Nontechnical Description: The common computer memory uses digital 0 and 1 solely depending on electric voltage In contrast a human has the neuromorphic response capability and can alter the decision-making process based on past experiences Recently scientists are exploring various materials particularly oxides in order to fabricate a man-made computational system with neuromorphic response capability This research project investigates organic polymers with electrical resistance that depends on geometry factors expanding the class of materials that can be used as the basic building blocks for neuromorphic computing Graduate students are trained in this project for interdisciplinary research bridging the fields of polymer science electronics and neuroscience In addition research opportunities are provided to high-school and undergraduate students through the Center for Optical Materials Science and Engineering Technologies (COMSET) Summer Fellows Program and in collaboration with Montessori School of AndersonTechnical Description: This project focuses on the investigation of non-conjugated polymers with pendant aromatic heterocyclic moieties that exhibit conformationally dependent conductivity and emulating synaptic behaviors A long-term goal of the project is to develop a polymer-based memristor technology that can be employed in a neuromorphic computation system The research includes three major tasks:  Development of molecular design rules for creating a memrisitor using non-conjugated polymers with pendant carbazole and oxadiazole moieties as well as monomer and polymer synthesis The goal is to create a polymer-based memrisitor with a conductive function depending on both voltage and a structural parameter particularly the rotational aspects and trapping properties of the pendant groups;  Measurement of the charge transport properties of the memristors with the results used to refine the molecular design rules and to improve synthesis methods; (3) Emulation of a series of synaptic behaviors using the polymer-based memristors

Subdivision-based algorithms can solve problems from a wide variety of applications in mathematics computer science and the sciences For example these types of algorithms are used in computer graphics mathematical biology computational geometry mathematical modeling robotics machine learning and mathematical computation Subdivision-based algorithms are popular because they are relatively easy to describe and implement on a computer and they are often efficient in practice The work in this project is to quantify and improve the effectiveness of these types of algorithms By studying the efficiency and providing algorithms to approximate solutions to problems which are typically considered intractable the results of this project provide techniques which can be applied to practical problems throughout the sciencesSubdivision-based algorithms recursively and adaptively subdivide a given domain into smaller regions until in each smaller region the behavior of a problem-specific feature can be determined Subdivision-based algorithms are frequently used because they are parallelizable recursive and adaptive More precisely they use weak local tests and perform more subdivisions only near difficult features These features that make subdivision-based algorithms practical however also make them challenging to study For example local tests make global topological correctness difficult and adaptive (non-uniform) subdivisions make the number of subdivisions difficult to bound This project addresses both of the important questions of complexity and correctness for subdivision-based algorithms in the following two ways:  Using continuous amortization as a uniform method to compute the complexity of subdivision-based algorithms  Developing topologically certified subdivision-based algorithms for geometric applications on algebraic varieties This project extends the technique of continuous amortization to many different types of algorithms including iterative and two-dimensional subdivisions; additionally the project develops subdivision-based algorithms to approximate previously intractable problems such as the medial axis and intersections of surfaces

This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will focus on human-infrastructure interactions within future smart cities Specifically the goal of this project is to develop a conceptual network optimization framework that exploits user feedback from crowd-sourced data The next-generation ubiquitous traffic sensors such as fixed traffic detectors mobile sensors with location-based services (eg Google traffic) and traffic active mobile sensors (eg Waze) have been used to retrieve large and diverse geo-located and time-stamped data In addition data crowd-sourced from social media and mobile applications are increasingly available for understanding human mobility On the other hand existing network optimization models in transportation were largely developed without considering human behavior This project will explore methods to design an electric vehicle wireless charging network of the future Such a charging network will provide non-stop in-motion charging particularly suitable for urban environments For many users wireless charging will be an opportunistic emergency charging choice that supplements distributed charging resources at home the workplace and at retail facilities Traditional network optimization models which implicitly assume that charging demand is distributed and a given may not result in a user-satisfactory solution in such tasks as finding the best routes that contain wireless charging network segments The PIs aim to overcome this deficiency by developing: (i) user feedback-driven network optimization models that explicitly account for user satisfaction and (ii) fast and scalable optimization methods for real-world large-scale problem implementations that efficiently and effectively utilize crowd-sourced information The results of this research will include a "living lab" assessment in which students will develop a mobile app to collect feedback about the route with wireless charging network segments This feedback will be analyzed and incorporated in optimization modelsThis approach will be implemented using a combination of large-scale machine learning and optimization solvers The mobile app will provide basic anonymized information about users trip types and route feedback through secured channels These data and open information about all road segments will be used to explore relevant latent factors and create cost-sensitive support vector machine based classifiers to identify the most suitable segments for wireless charging network and adjust the optimization-based network design Rather than using traditional computationally expensive optimization solvers the PIs will pursue an algebraic multigrid-based approach to cope with large-scale real-world problems and leverage their support vector machine solvers

The relatively flat southeastern US coastal plain from North Carolina to Texas is particularly susceptible to sea level rise As sea level rises the boundary between the low-lying coastal freshwater forest and high marsh moves upslope Highly productive forested wetlands are replaced successively by degraded wetlands and eventually by coastal salt marsh Not only does saltwater intrusion change vegetation composition high halide levels (called halogens) can interact with the large pool of soil organic matter through halogenation processes that are still poorly understood These halogenation processes are important to elucidate as they produce volatile halocarbons that act as ozone-depleting compounds in the atmosphere Halogenation of organic matter may also affect the decomposition rates of organic matter This interdisciplinary research will improve our understanding of chlorine and bromine biogeochemistry and demonstrate the importance of halogens in carbon cycling This collaborative research represents a new collaboration between four investigators with different specialties from universities in the northeast southeast and western United States Graduate and undergraduate students will have opportunities to interact with citizen scientists in an on-going EarthWatch project and learn how to disseminate the scientific knowledge to the general public This study will also raise the awareness of the impacts of sea level rise on low-lying coastal areas in the Southeastern USHalogens have historically been treated as inert elements in natural humification processes However numerous recent studies have demonstrated that chlorine and bromine are active components in C cycles The overall goal of this research is to assess novel decomposition process routes of terrestrial organic matter in forested wetlands with high levels of chloride and bromide The research project includes both field investigations and controlled experiments to determine the impacts of sea level rise on C and halogen biogeochemical cycles along salinity gradients in Winyah Bay South Carolina Fluxes of halogenated ozone depleting C compounds and greenhouse gases as well as concentrations of organochlorine and organobromine in soil and litter and water will be quantified along salinity transects and within controlled plots The research team contends that the novel method of determining X-ray absorption near edge structures (XANES) of halogenated organic matter in soil and detritus layers coupled with measurements of halocarbon emission and composition in water using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) will be useful in understanding the roles of halogens in C cycling Determining the seasonal variation of halocarbon in air soil and water from freshwater forested wetland salt-degraded wetland and salt marsh sites representing the transition of coastal wetland under sea level rise will be useful in developing a mechanistic and landscape understanding of how sea level rise affects decomposition humification and halogenation processes of terrestrial organic matter in coastal wetlands The controlled field experiments using different concentrations of chloride and bromide waters would illustrate their roles in humification and decomposition processes

This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation Professor R Kenneth Marcus and collaborators at Clemson University are developing and characterizing capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers as stationary phases for rapid processing of synthetic and large biological molecules These stationary phases are amenable to a wide range of instrumentation formats and offer advantages for the separation of mixtures The goal of the studies is to produce efficient and selective separations in an economical manner This work is interdisciplinary involving collaborative efforts between research groups in chemistry bioengineering mathematical and materials sciences The project includes investigators affiliated with the Clemson University Center for Advanced Engineering of Fibers and Films There are also collaborations with federal laboratories If successful the project may result in new commercial ventures in the textile and biopharmaceutical industries in South Carolina Enhanced capabilities for large molecule separations have implications across many commercial sectors including the rapidly expanding area of protein therapeutics A two-pronged approach is used to better affect macromolecule separations using the C-CP fiber phases The first area focuses on the novel implementation of the fibers as the stationary phases for dimension two of comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatographic separations C-CP phases of various surface chemistries are evaluated in terms of the cycling times required to affect high quality separations of temporal "cuts" obtained from the first dimension The second area focuses on modification of surface chemistries to affect high levels of selectivity There are four classes of reactions: further use of lipid tethered ligands as a general reaction methodology to modify hydrophobic surfaces high density amination of polyester base fibers microwave energy to affect covalent coupling of ligands to nylon 6 C-CP materials and finally the adsorption of macromolecule ligands on polypropylene surface for class-specific separation These chemistries are used to develop stand-alone columns (on either the analytical or preparative scales) as well as columns for use as dimension two in multidimensional applications

With this award the Macromolecular Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Sourav Saha of Florida State University to develop new strategies and receptors that can not only discriminate anions on the basis of their electronic properties but also capture and release the target anions in a reversible fashion under the influence of electrons and light Anions and cations are ubiquitous and have diverse structures properties and functions Some play important roles in biological chemical industrial and environmental processes while others are toxic and pollutants For these reasons it is important to regulate these charged species with high precision and selectivity Selective ion receptors can provide scientists with systems that are recyclable reusable and better suited for applications in environmental protection The graduate undergraduate and postdoctoral researchers working on this project will gain an array of scientific knowledge and technical expertise from synthesis to molecular recognition Integrated outreach activities are directed at local schools the public library and at students from Florida Agricultural and Mining University an HBCU institution Through these efforts Dr Saha plans to engage young and underrepresented students in hands-on experiments to motivate them to consider the pursuit of careers in scienceThe goal of this research is to develop new strategies to (i) discriminate anions on the basis of their electronic properties (ii) capture anions and cations simultaneously in a cooperative fashion and (iii) bind and release ionic guests in a reversible fashion under the influence of electrons and light To discriminate anions in aprotic solvents the Saha research team is exploiting the ability of ð-acidic naphthalenediimide (NDI) receptors to accept electron(s) from strong Lewis basic anions form charge-transfer complexes with less basic anions and engage in anionð and CH···anion interactions with charge-diffuse anions To overcome the ion-pairing effect that weakens the binding interactions between ionic guests and receptors tweezers-shaped ditopic ion-pair receptors are being developed by tethering two terminal NDI units with folded linkers that can bind cations The hypothesis is that cation binding at the linker units should facilitate anion binding between the two overlapping NDI units and vice versa During biphasic extractions these ditopic receptors should selectively extract salts that contain less hydrated charge-diffuse anions from aqueous to organic medium while the more hydrated hard anions should remain in water NDI-based cationic metallacycles are being constructed to capture large charge-diffuse anions inside their cavities through anion/NDI interactions The metal ion corners should mitigate the ion-pairing effects The reversible redox chemistry of the NDI units and the tendency of their reduced forms to expel anions offer a new approach to release the captured anions from these receptors upon chemical electrochemical and/or photochemical reduction
