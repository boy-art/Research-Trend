    <AbstractNarration>This project is funded by the STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning. This project will contribute to that effort by developing and assessing new modules for a high school course, Introduction to Digital Technology. This course is an entry-level course for high school freshmen and sophomores on an academic pathway that culminates in students taking an Advanced Placement (AP) course in computer science. The updated course will be implemented in two schools having large populations of students from groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, and the course will promote development of computational thinking skills by engaging students in authentic and culturally relevant, problem-based, inquiry learning (PBIL) projects. Student-created multimedia digital narratives consisting of mobile applications and computationally generated music will showcase student learning and their solutions to PBIL challenges. The project will investigate the factors associated with successful implementation of the updated course and its expected outcomes, including the impacts of integrating computer science and computational thinking within STEM disciplines at the high school level. The outcomes of this project will: 1) contribute to the knowledge base for current efforts to integrate computer science and computational thinking in STEM courses for K-12 students nationwide; 2) contribute to students in educational pathways to careers or advanced work in IT fields; and 3) impact current instructional programs in the state of Georgia, and potentially nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will employ a design-based research approach to develop and validate a pedagogical model for integrating instruction and learning of computational practices with science content. The feasibility of the model will be tested through a pilot study of courses that include the innovative new modules focusing on environmental sustainability and issues relating to water and air quality. The pilot implementation will be conducted with 26 teachers in two large school districts in Georgia having culturally diverse student populations. The project will provide teachers with teaching resources, the technology needed for implementation of the new modules, and professional development opportunities to support their implementation of two science investigations requiring a total of four to six weeks of classes. A mixed-methods research strategy will be used to characterize and estimate the level of student gains in applying computational thinking, carrying out science practices, and understanding core biology content knowledge related to the study of ecosystems. Data will be gathered from classroom observations, pretests and posttests of knowledge, embedded assessments within activities, student screencast reports, interviews with teachers and students, and log data automatically collected by learning software. Statistical models will be tested to explore the school and district-level factors that positively or negatively impact successful implementation and outcomes of the new courses.</AbstractNarration>
