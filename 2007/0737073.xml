    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;Hydrology is the science that deals with the occurrence, distribution, and circulation of water and its interaction with various physical, chemical, and biological processes of the earth system. National reports have advocated for improvements in the undergraduate hydrology curriculum in the key areas of observation and modeling. This project is enhancing student learning in undergraduate engineering hydrology courses through the use of recent advances in interactive scientific visualization. The project leaders are developing an innovative virtual-reality hydrologic observatory that integrates field observations collected in a real watershed with the capabilities of a process-based model that simulates rainfall-runoff in the same watershed. The observatory facilitates the introduction of field experiences and observational skills into hydrology courses using innovative virtual techniques and is developing students' knowledge and investigative skills on rainfall-runoff processes through the use of interactive and visually-supported hydrologic simulations. The observatory mimics the students experiences during a real visit to the watershed. Students have the ability to virtually download and analyze data from various hydrologic and meteorological instruments used in the field, furthering their learning and comprehension.</AbstractNarration>
