    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 0739208&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Ronald A. Fintushel, Efstratia&lt;br/&gt;Kalfagianni, Thomas H. Parker, Jon G. Wolfson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is the enhancement of the research&lt;br/&gt;training environment in geometry and topology at Michigan State&lt;br/&gt;University, building on our past success. The Geometry/Topology&lt;br/&gt;Group at MSU has a long-standing commitment to excellence in&lt;br/&gt;graduate and postdoctoral training: we have produced some&lt;br/&gt;outstanding graduate students, and we have been fortunate to have&lt;br/&gt;recruited and mentored exceptional postdoctoral fellows. Our&lt;br/&gt;goal is to use increased resources to improve: (1) Recruitment at&lt;br/&gt;all levels --- undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral. (2)&lt;br/&gt;Graduate training, especially in terms of the diversity of&lt;br/&gt;seminars, course offerings, and reducing the time to obtain a&lt;br/&gt;Ph.D. (3) The experience of postdoctoral fellows and their&lt;br/&gt;preparation for a tenure-track position. (4) Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;participation with the Geometry/Topology research group. (5)&lt;br/&gt;Interaction among students and faculty at all levels. (6) The&lt;br/&gt;research environment at all levels with a regular program of&lt;br/&gt;seminars and visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graduate students and postdoctoral assistants who will be&lt;br/&gt;mentored under this proposal will contribute to research in&lt;br/&gt;geometry and topology, using a wide variety of techniques&lt;br/&gt;including gauge theory, geometric analysis, pseudoholomorphic&lt;br/&gt;maps, knot invariants, surgery techniques, 3-manifold topology,&lt;br/&gt;and mapping class groups. Faculty at Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;as well as former students and postdoctoral assistants have taken&lt;br/&gt;part in important advances in these rapidly progressing areas,&lt;br/&gt;and it is expected that future students and postdoctoral fellows&lt;br/&gt;will continue in this direction. To further stimulate research,&lt;br/&gt;the MSU Geometry/Topology Group will initiate new programs and&lt;br/&gt;enhance existing programs for undergraduate and graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral fellows. The key to these programs is the&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere of collaborative learning that has been fostered by&lt;br/&gt;the Geometry/Topology Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will address the production of research&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and teachers of mathematics who are interested in&lt;br/&gt;geometry and topology. This proposal will support 5 new graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and 2 new postdoctoral associates as well as one postdoc&lt;br/&gt;and one graduate student who are being supported by our current&lt;br/&gt;RTG grant. Our aim is to create an environment which encourages&lt;br/&gt;all involved to become better teachers, better expositors, and&lt;br/&gt;better researchers, and encourages those entering mathematics to&lt;br/&gt;stay in the field.</AbstractNarration>
