    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) with cofunding from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Iowa for the summers of 2008-2010. The program will be administered through the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute at the University of Iowa and managed by Sarah Larsen of the Department of Chemistry. The program will provide eight rising junior or senior undergraduate students with research experience in cutting edge topics related to environmental and health aspects of nanoscience and nanotechnology. REU participants will have the opportunity to work with faculty mentors from the departments of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Occupational and Environmental Health. Each mentor will provide their REU student with a well defined project related to one of the three interrelated research themes that compose the scientific core of this REU program: (i) fundamental studies of nanoparticles and nanomaterials in environmental and health applications; (ii) fundamental studies to better understand the environmental and health implications of nanoparticles; or (iii) instrumentation development for field and laboratory measurements of nanoparticles and nanomaterials. All projects are designed to develop the REU students' lab skills and critical thinking skills so that they can become independent researchers. Students will also participate in a Communicating Science workshop that will focus on the communication of scientific results through written media and through oral presentations.</AbstractNarration>
