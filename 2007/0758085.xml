    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0758085&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: California Polytechnic State University Foundation&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM: PHY - PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Christiansen, Jodi L.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: RUI: Analysis of TeV Gamma-rays and Pulsars Observed by VERITAS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RUI grant will bring astrophysics experiences to California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. VERITAS, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, located in Southern Arizona at the Whipple Observatory Base camp, is an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes designed to detect very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (100 GeV ? 50 TeV) that shower in the earth?s atmosphere. Active galaxies (AGN) harbor a super-massive black hole at their core surrounded by an accretion disk. Little is known about the interaction between the accretion disk and the black hole, an interaction that produces powerful beamed jets of highly-energetic particles and radiation. The spectrum of this radiation is a strong indicator of the acceleration mechanisms involved. Combined VHE, X-ray, and UV spectra can test and help to tune current models of the acceleration processes of active galaxies. The goals of this award are to improve the VERITAS gamma ray detection algorithms and to use the improved algorithms to study the acceleration mechanisms in AGN and pulsars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under Broader Impacts, undergraduate students will be given broad exposure to the science while working on a focused and tractable research project suitable for a senior thesis. This grant will bring the expertise of two senior personnel to all 165 physics majors and support two student research projects each year. The PI will connect with middle school teachers through the Center for Excellence In Science and Mathematics Education (CESaME) to develop supplements that can be used in 6 and 8th grade curricula where Science and Astronomy are taught.</AbstractNarration>
