    <AbstractNarration>Li&lt;br/&gt;0709384&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies extensions of frames and their&lt;br/&gt;applications in signal processing. A common problem in&lt;br/&gt;applications is data fusion, the combination of data representing&lt;br/&gt;different aspects of the same item. For example, in attempting&lt;br/&gt;to sharpen a picture, treating the foreground and background&lt;br/&gt;separately may produce a better overall image. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies frame-theoretical formulations for data fusion,&lt;br/&gt;emphasizing applications in multi-spectral image fusion and&lt;br/&gt;related mathematical and computational issues. He also studies&lt;br/&gt;fused parallel sparse representation using fusion frames,&lt;br/&gt;examining issues of optimality and expected computational&lt;br/&gt;efficiency. Fusion frames are an extension of frames to deal&lt;br/&gt;with a set of overlapping subspaces; the aim is to fuse together&lt;br/&gt;information from overlapping subspaces into the composite total&lt;br/&gt;space. Fused sparse representation involves ways to obtain&lt;br/&gt;sparse representations of a signal in (overlapping) subspaces in&lt;br/&gt;a parallel fashion followed by a fusion operation. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator also studies pseudoframe duals of B-spline Riesz&lt;br/&gt;sequences having either minimum support or both minimum support&lt;br/&gt;and maximum approximation order. Limiting behavior of the small&lt;br/&gt;support of pseudoframe duals is considered. Here pseudoframe&lt;br/&gt;duals arise from a notion of pseudoframes for subspaces (PFFS). &lt;br/&gt;PFFSs are frame-like systems for the linear analysis and&lt;br/&gt;synthesis of a subspace. They differ from frames in that both&lt;br/&gt;analysis and synthesis sequences are not necessarily contained in&lt;br/&gt;the subspace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Signal processing generally refers to making the signal easy&lt;br/&gt;to handle or of better quality. It is everywhere seen in our&lt;br/&gt;modern society. In this project, the principal novelties&lt;br/&gt;introduced to signal processing are a new frame-theoretical&lt;br/&gt;approach to data fusion applications and ideas of performing data&lt;br/&gt;compression using a notion of fusion frames. Data fusion&lt;br/&gt;combines data sampled in different ways or represnting different&lt;br/&gt;aspects of an item in order to obtain a better representation of&lt;br/&gt;the item. The investigator aims at developing methods of&lt;br/&gt;combining images obtained in different type of cameras (such as&lt;br/&gt;infrared and conventional) into one single image with all&lt;br/&gt;information presented. In particular, he works to provide a&lt;br/&gt;combined image of much greater precision without ad-hoc&lt;br/&gt;procedures of conventional techniques. Advances here are&lt;br/&gt;important for such areas of information technology as commercial&lt;br/&gt;imaging, geographic surveys, geographic survey, mapping, and&lt;br/&gt;sensor array data processing. Similarly, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;develops tools to improve the efficiency of data compression by&lt;br/&gt;reducing a costly compression task into a set of parallel smaller&lt;br/&gt;tasks followed by a precise combination mechanism governed by the&lt;br/&gt;theory of fusion frames. More generally, the methods can&lt;br/&gt;increase the speed of information transmission in a broad range&lt;br/&gt;of communication and signal processing environments.</AbstractNarration>
