    <AbstractNarration>Teresa V. Orenic, Principal Investigator&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 0749574, "Generation of morphological diversity among the legs of the Drosophila adult."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals and plants are complex structures composed of myriad cell types organized into tissues, organs and organ systems. How this organization is generated during embryonic development, a process called pattern formation, is a central issue in the field of developmental biology. To address this issue, the mechanisms that control development of the nervous system of the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, will be investigated. Drosophila is a model system that has provided much insight into the genetic and molecular basis of animal development. The specific focus of this project is on a genetic and molecular characterization of the function of a member of the Hox gene family, which encodes proteins that have a general role in generating the body plan of all animals, from flies to humans. Although Hox gene function in development of some organs has been extensively investigated, little is known about the function of these genes in development of the nervous system. This research will provide insight into this issue, which is of key importance to human health, since the genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling development are conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates. Furthermore, disrupted function of Hox genes is associated with human genetic disorders and cancers. Hence, detailed genetic and molecular studies of the role of these genes in Drosophila development have and should continue to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying human development and genetic diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). UIC is an urban campus with a diverse student population. Both minority and nonminority undergraduate and graduate students have and will participate in research in the P.I.'s laboratory. Other efforts to broaden the impact of the P.I.'s research include visits to local elementary schools to give presentations on genetics and DNA, and judging of local science fairs.</AbstractNarration>
