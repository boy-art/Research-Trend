    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates a novel approach for assessing the fluency and&lt;br/&gt;grammaticality of alternative translation hypotheses that are created within&lt;br/&gt;search-based Machine Translation (MT) systems. This task, commonly termed&lt;br/&gt;""Language Modeling"" (LM), has been explored primarily in the context of speech&lt;br/&gt;recognition; however, current state-of-the-art language models (LMs) are not&lt;br/&gt;effective at distinguishing between more fluent grammatical translations and&lt;br/&gt;their poor alternatives. In contrast, the proposed approach, ""Discriminative&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge-Rich Language Modeling"" (DKRLM), is explicitly designed to find the&lt;br/&gt;most fluent and grammatical translations within the search space by comparing&lt;br/&gt;the linguistic features of the translation hypotheses against very large&lt;br/&gt;""clean"" monolingual corpora. The intuition is that more grammatical&lt;br/&gt;translation hypotheses should contain higher proportions of features seen in&lt;br/&gt;the large corpora. An important contribution of the project is in exploring&lt;br/&gt;different types of linguistic features to identify those that are most&lt;br/&gt;informative for the comparisons. Moreover, discriminative training is&lt;br/&gt;performed to incorporate the features into a system-independent scoring&lt;br/&gt;function, replacing traditional LMs in MT systems. The broader impacts of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed work include both broader adoption for the methodology as well as&lt;br/&gt;wider use of the new DKRLM functions to other search-based NLP applications&lt;br/&gt;that aim at generating fluent grammatical text. This includes search-based&lt;br/&gt;approaches to Speech Recognition, Natural Language Generation (NLG), Optical&lt;br/&gt;Character Recognition (OCR), Summarization, and others.</AbstractNarration>
