    <AbstractNarration>Ecosystems are losing native species, gaining exotics, and becoming simpler and more homogenous. The Waller group studies these processes in Midwestern forests using a unique baseline dataset from the 1950's. Differences among sites provide insights into what site and landscape features make forests susceptible to extinction and invasion. Differences among species provide clues as to which ecological processes are driving these changes, including habitat fragmentation and deer herbivory. In this project, the researchers will survey dynamic lowland forests to track invasions and extinctions and the roles of soil, light, invasive shrubs, and landscape conditions on plant community dynamics. The team will also analyze how plant characteristics affect the susceptibility of different species to various kinds of ecological change. This will allow these researchers to anticipate which species and sites are most vulnerable and the traits and conditions that make them vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze changes in community composition in terms of the invasion, persistence and extinction of individual species. These analyses will illuminate how shifts in plant distribution and abundance depend on plant traits as well as site and surrounding landscape conditions. These results will be used to test theories of community change and to guide forest and wildlife managers charged with sustaining diversity and ecological integrity. This project will also draw attention to long-term ecological change and build public support for monitoring and understanding those changes.</AbstractNarration>
