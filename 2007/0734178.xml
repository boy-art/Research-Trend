    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses the geometry of spaces of rational curves&lt;br/&gt;on smooth projective varieties, with a view toward understanding the&lt;br/&gt;structure of rational points for varieties defined over function&lt;br/&gt;fields. Consider a rationally-connected variety: Which homology&lt;br/&gt;classes contain free rational curves? Very free rational curves? Is&lt;br/&gt;the space of such curves connected? Irreducible? Rationally&lt;br/&gt;connected? Of general type? Is there a workable notion of `rational&lt;br/&gt;simple connectedness' and is this a birational property? How can we&lt;br/&gt;distinguish unirational varieties as a subclass of rationally-connected&lt;br/&gt;varieties? These questions are related to fundamental problems in Diophantine&lt;br/&gt;geometry over function fields: Does a rationally-connected variety&lt;br/&gt;over C(t) satisfy weak approximation? Can the hypothesis of the Tsen/Lang&lt;br/&gt;Theorem over C(s,t) be formulated geometrically? For rationally-connected&lt;br/&gt;varieties over C(s,t), to what extent do cohomological obstructions&lt;br/&gt;govern the existence of rational points?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support research on systems of polynomial&lt;br/&gt;equations with coefficents varying in parameters. Our goal is to&lt;br/&gt;solve these equations with rational functions that depend on these&lt;br/&gt;parameters. The case of a single equation (or of several independent&lt;br/&gt;equations) was addressed in the mid 20th century; the feasibility&lt;br/&gt;of finding a solution depends on the degree of the equation, the number&lt;br/&gt;of free variables, and the number of varying parameters. Recently,&lt;br/&gt;a comprehensive geometric approach was developed when there is just&lt;br/&gt;one varying parameter. However, for multiple (not necessarily&lt;br/&gt;independent) equations in two varying parameters much remains to be&lt;br/&gt;understood. This work will also have broader impacts on the education of&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, the development of web-based&lt;br/&gt;collaboration tools, and the promotion of robust academic networks&lt;br/&gt;linking universities across the country.</AbstractNarration>
