    <AbstractNarration>Collections of heterogeneous, network-connected computational devices&lt;br/&gt;have emerged as a new computational paradigm. This new network-based&lt;br/&gt;paradigm simplifies constructing flexible and scalable hardware&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure. Unfortunately, making such systems robust to failures&lt;br/&gt;can be difficult. Many of these distributed software systems contain&lt;br/&gt;a large number of devices, and therefore, have a significant chance of&lt;br/&gt;experiencing a hardware failure. Developers have to manually develop&lt;br/&gt;code to allow the software system to recover from such hardware&lt;br/&gt;failures. As a result, developing robust distributed software systems&lt;br/&gt;is typically more difficult than robust centralized software systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work builds upon the Principal Investigator's prior work on the&lt;br/&gt;Bristlecone language for developing robust software systems. The key&lt;br/&gt;insight behind the Bristlecone language is that most errors propagate&lt;br/&gt;through software systems to cause further damage either by corrupting&lt;br/&gt;data structures or through the control-flow--induced coupling between&lt;br/&gt;conceptual operations. Bristlecone programs are architected as a set&lt;br/&gt;of decoupled tasks that are linked through a set of task&lt;br/&gt;specifications that describe how these decoupled tasks interact and&lt;br/&gt;what consistent data structures look like. Bristlecone then uses&lt;br/&gt;these specifications to adapt the program's execution in response to&lt;br/&gt;failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project extends the previous work to support distributed software&lt;br/&gt;systems. This project develops static analyses to help developers&lt;br/&gt;understand how failures in the underlying hardware will affect the&lt;br/&gt;software system and to manage data and tasks so that hardware failures&lt;br/&gt;have a minimal affect on the computation.</AbstractNarration>
