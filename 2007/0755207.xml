    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) for the summers of 2008-2010. The site will be managed by Holly Gaede with assistance from James Batteas from the Chemistry Department at TAMU. Fifteen undergraduate students will be recruited nationally, but the Southwest region of the U.S. will be a target priority area. Nine of the participating students will be funded through NSF and the remaining six will be supported with institutional funds. All fifteen students will come to TAMU to be immersed in a 10-week research experience in the areas of biological, environmental, or materials chemistry. The participants will become full members of their research group and be assigned an independent research project. Students will take part in weekly Career Development seminars, highlighted by a Career Day in which Ph.D. chemists from a variety of occupations will speak about their training and background.</AbstractNarration>
