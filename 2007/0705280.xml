    <AbstractNarration>In collaboration with its four Montana Consortium partners, Fort Peck Community College is conducting an internship program to increase the number of minorities, women and American Indians majoring in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) areas. The collaborating institutions are Little Big Horn College, Fort Belknap College, Stone Child College, and Rocky Mountain College. They are providing more students with an opportunity to participate in community based research projects as a means to attract and retain students. These experiences are structured to teach students how to conduct research while participating in a research experience. Teaching of research skills is being achieved by offering a "Research for Undergraduates" credit course via "a blend of Internet and ITV (Internet television)." STEM instructors and research site coordinators have received mentorship training that is helping them to provide academic, career, and personal development guidance to students. &lt;br/&gt;The project is working to: achieve a 20 percent increase in the number of students receiving STEM certifications or degrees (two and four year); provide research experiences for a least 14 students annually; and increase the retention rate of STEM students by 25 percent.</AbstractNarration>
