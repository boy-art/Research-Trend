    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The objective of this NER project is the design of high-frequency microelectronic biomolecular sensors which employ a hybrid nanomaterial sensing region consisting of gold nanoparticles distributed onto carbon nanotubes, thus achieving a synergistic advantage over each individual nanomaterial alone. Immunosensors will be fabricated in which antigen or antibody is conjugated onto the Au nanoparticles; modulation of the electrical conductivity of the hybrid carbon nanotube/gold nanoparticle structure results from changes in local electrostatic environment associated with antigen/antibody binding. A device layout suitable for high-frequency on-wafer probing will be designed, and variations in DC through microwave impedance properties will be characterized using a model antibody/antigen system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The availability of low-cost microelectronic biosensors for biomolecular detection will have a wide-ranging impact in society through their use in clinical diagnostic testing (as detectors of disease biomarkers) as well as in biomedical research. This project will potentially lead to the replacement of cumbersome biomolecular assays with inexpensive microelectronic devices capable of enhancing biomedical discovery and facilitating rapid diagnosis and monitoring of disease. As an interdisciplinary research effort, the proposed program will serve as a platform for creation of a unique environment for learning and discovery, in which an existing suite of interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate courses will be expanded and enhanced between engineering and biology. Pre-college secondary students and underrepresented students will participate in this effort through existing ties with the Milwaukee Public School System and the Milwaukee Science and Engineering Fair.</AbstractNarration>
