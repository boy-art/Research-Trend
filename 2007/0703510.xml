    <AbstractNarration>Florida A&amp;M University proposes to serve as the institutional host-site for the&lt;br/&gt;Florida - Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP) during&lt;br/&gt;Phase IV program operations. FGLSAMP is designed to promote and facilitate the&lt;br/&gt;programmatic goals of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) LSAMP program under&lt;br/&gt;the HRD Directorate. In accordance with the goals, objectives and effort of NSF to&lt;br/&gt;address the low participation and degree production within science, technology,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by those ethnic groups identified as&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in STEM disciplines, FGLSAMP will address this problem through its&lt;br/&gt;programmatic structure which promotes enhancement of academic performance,&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research experiences, professional development, and preparation for&lt;br/&gt;pursuing STEM graduate degrees. The standard of success will be measured by our&lt;br/&gt;student participants': progression (to attain the B.S. degree); retention (within STEM&lt;br/&gt;disciplines); graduation (timely attainment); and STEM graduate enrollment&lt;br/&gt;(increasing STEM Minority enrollment). FGLSAMP will continue to employ a holistic&lt;br/&gt;approach to reform undergraduate education in the STEM disciplines along with&lt;br/&gt;identified "beast practices" as determined through it Steering Committee, while&lt;br/&gt;determining means to enhance and provide new program activities. FGLSAMP is&lt;br/&gt;designed to include a firm commitment of institutional administrators, faculty, staff,&lt;br/&gt;external partners, as well as parents and students.&lt;br/&gt;The goals of FGLSAMP are to significantly increase both the number of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities pursuing undergraduate degrees in STEM disciplines and the&lt;br/&gt;number of STEM B.S. degree recipients pursuing STEM graduate degrees. FGLSAMP&lt;br/&gt;will provide training opportunities to students in STEM disciplines while also providing&lt;br/&gt;an array of academic performance enhancement and support that will yield greater STEM&lt;br/&gt;retention and graduations rates among underrepresented STEM minorities. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;to address the numbers of STEM B.S. recipients pursuing STEM graduate degrees,&lt;br/&gt;FGLSAMP has developed a formalize program component to prepare its undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;participants to pursue graduate degrees. This will be accomplished through an intensive&lt;br/&gt;programmatic design that has been accepted and adopted by the FGLSAMP Steering&lt;br/&gt;Committee. FGLSAMP will continue provide assistance for undergraduate research&lt;br/&gt;experiences that will include the introduction of international research opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;student participants. FGLSAMP will also continue to build and strengthen ties and&lt;br/&gt;inclusion of community colleges by the inclusion of 2 new associate level partners within&lt;br/&gt;the alliance. Community Colleges are a valuable source of human capital to enter the&lt;br/&gt;STEM academic pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;FGLSAMP program operations will be met through annual financial support from the&lt;br/&gt;National Science Foundation, a special appropriation from the State of Florida.&lt;br/&gt;Through the addition of two additional community colleges, FGLSAMP will be&lt;br/&gt;able to: 1) stimulate and increase student awareness of academic and professional&lt;br/&gt;opportunities in STEM areas and 2) create a larger network/pipeline between the&lt;br/&gt;community college students and FGLSAMP undergraduate institutions with which these&lt;br/&gt;two community colleges are affiliated. FGLSAMP will also capitalize and capture&lt;br/&gt;greater numbers of potential STEM majors prior to graduation and transfer to the upper&lt;br/&gt;division.</AbstractNarration>
