    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is engaging teams of undergraduates in the preparation of interactive educational wiki pages to explain the mathematical concepts behind computer-based images from diverse disciplines. In addition to exploring the formalization of this activity into an elective course on mathematical writing, the project is also investigating how the intense engagement of undergraduate students in constructing an educational website - an activity that strengthens their skills and interest in mathematics, computer science, and education - encourages them to follow one of these career paths. In addition to mathematics and education undergraduates, computer science students are applying their interest in gaming software to produce interactive learning units for some of the pages. The intellectual merit of the project is further strengthened by its use of structured, mentored, and collaborative processes based in lessons learned from the creation and development of the Math Forum. These processes combine academic inquiry, production of public resources, and alternative points of engagement with mathematics through technology. The project is exerting broad impact through its creation of web-based educational network of undergraduates and others working on the Math Images site and cooperating and interacting through the associated wiki pages. In addition, the content of the Math Images site lends itself to use in a wide range of settings including formal classroom demonstrations, group and individual projects, specialized honors work for advanced students, and general informal education for the public. Its interactive, personalized, community-oriented, and highly visual design holds strong appeal for many who may be put off by the usual symbolic and numerical presentation of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
