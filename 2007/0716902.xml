    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13). This project studies the change in global student evaluations of teaching (SET) ratings upon implementation of interactive teaching methods in introductory physics and astronomy courses. The change in specific SET ratings is investigated and correlated with two different measures of student learning: (1) gains in the performance on standardized concept inventories administered online and (2) course grades. An online survey is administered to study the specific implementation details and institutional circumstances of the participating instructors. This work determines whether student evaluations of teaching are a barrier to the implementation of interactive teaching methods and thus to student learning. It helps faculty to collect and analyze data to learn more about advantages and disadvantages of their specific implementation, contributes to a better understanding of the applicability of student evaluations in measuring student learning, and helps administrators and faculty to better interpret SET data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The study addresses a formidable barrier to the implementation of interactive teaching methods, i.e. an often-held perception that such methods negatively affect student evaluations. While anecdotal evidence appears to refute any negative impact, the proposed study is designed to unambiguously determine this impact for a broad range of courses and instructors. The proposed work also provides information on how increased student learning and a broader emphasis on concepts impacts student ratings. Broader Impact: The proposed work has several outcomes: (1) it informs faculty of the impact of the implementation of interactive teaching on student ratings, (2) by documenting this impact (and possibly identifying the underlying reasons for it), it helps remove a major implementation barrier for interactive teaching techniques, (3) it helps participating faculty to identify other potential barriers in the implementation of interactive techniques, and (4) it helps participating faculty collect data on learning and student attitudes. It continues to build a community of scholars dedicated to the improvement of undergraduate education.</AbstractNarration>
