    <AbstractNarration>Polyploidy (the multiplication of chromosome sets within a nucleus) and apomixis (the production of embryos without fertilization) are encountered in many living organisms. Their roles in the propagation of hybrids (in wheat, cotton, citrus, etc.) are well documented, but their effects on genetic diversity and geographic distribution are largely unexplored. Polyploidy and apomixis are especially prevalent in cheilanthoid ferns, a group of 500+ species adapted to seasonally dry habitats avoided by most other ferns, and they clearly have contributed to the ability of these species to prosper in these climatically-challenged environments. Using a combination of genetic (DNA, protein, and chromosome) and morphological analyses, this project will explore this apparent connection between polyploidy and apomixis, genetic diversity, and the ability to colonize marginal habitats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will examine how polyploidy and apomixis have contributed to the evolutionary success of xeric-adapted plants, facilitating the development of hypotheses applicable to land plants in general. Such studies may prove critical in the face of global climate change and increasing aridity. Additional goals include development of an online identification guide, creation of teaching modules for use by high school teachers, graduate and postgraduate training in systematics, and outreach to students and professionals in countries hosting field work.</AbstractNarration>
