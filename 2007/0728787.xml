    <AbstractNarration>This project involves designing approximation algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems arising in computer networks in which nodes need&lt;br/&gt;to communicate with each other under some constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building a direct link between any two nodes has a cost associated&lt;br/&gt;with it. This cost is different for different pairs of nodes. There&lt;br/&gt;are several constraints, for example, a typical requirement would be&lt;br/&gt;that every node would be able to reach every other node by a sequence&lt;br/&gt;of links. Examples of some other constraints are making the network&lt;br/&gt;robust in case of node failures, communication paths between nodes&lt;br/&gt;being short on average, and buying enough bandwidth for links to&lt;br/&gt;support the expected traffic (more bandwidth costs more but allows&lt;br/&gt;larger quantity of data to be delivered on the link per time unit).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the link costs, and the network constraints, the goal is to&lt;br/&gt;design a network satisfying the constraints, such that the network&lt;br/&gt;cost is not too large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed problems have applications in VLSI, manufacturing, buying&lt;br/&gt;large set of items at bulk and more. Theoretical insight into these&lt;br/&gt;problems is likely to lead to better understanding of the problems.</AbstractNarration>
