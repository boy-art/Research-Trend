    <AbstractNarration>The salty marine environment is dehydrating and marine fish are left with seawater as the only source of hydration. In land-dwelling animals ingestion of seawater results in severe diarrhea which, in itself, is dehydrating. In contrast, marine fish are able to absorb fluids from ingested seawater and can successfully eliminate the associated salt gain. The present project aims to further characterize the intestinal processes that allow for these vertebrates to exist in abundance in oceanic environments. Specifically, uptake of chloride across the intestine, which is important for the absorption of water, is the focus of the present research. The PI's previous NSF funded research identified a novel pathway for chloride absorption, which in most fish accounts for at least 50% of the total uptake. This chloride uptake pathway involves the secretion of large quantities of base into the intestinal lumen, but excretion of this base could ultimately result in a challenge to the acid-base balance of the fish. This challenge is met in marine fish by excretion of a proportional amount of acid across their gills to maintain normal blood pH. Through the use of molecular techniques and studies of cells lining the intestinal lumen the goal of this research is to identify the specific proteins involved in this unique chloride uptake pathway. In addition, recently developed equipment, which allows for the determination of both oxygen consumption and ion transport by fish intestine, will be employed to test that hypothesis that absorption of fluid from ingested seawater has a high metabolic cost. Through the course of this research graduate and undergraduate researchers will be trained. In addition, the findings of this research will be incorporated into a university course about the environmental biology of fishes and into an environmental health curriculum targeted to high school teachers in the local public school system, which has a highly diverse demography.</AbstractNarration>
