    <AbstractNarration>Most (~75%) vertebrate species of the world inhabit tropical and southern hemisphere regions, and are generally characterized with a 'slow' development rate. North temperate species, in contrast, generally posses a 'fast' development rate. This project will combine controlled comparative analyses with manipulative experiments to examine whether epigenetic maternal effects, mediated by maternal hormones, are proximate mechanisms causing the variation of development rate and related life history strategies across latitudes. It explores and experimentally tests the hypotheses that variation in exposure of the avian embryo to maternally derived hormones in the egg explains variation in offspring development rate. Maternal hormones selected for study are: i) androgens because they show strong correlations with development rate in temperate zone passerines; and ii) thyroid hormones because they are regulators of vertebrate development and metabolism. The hypothesis predicts these egg hormones i) to be lower in tropical than temperate passerines; ii) to cause variation in rate of embryo development; iii) to cause trade-offs between development rate and offspring quality such as immune function, thereby explaining variation in other life history traits as well. Proposed studies will be conducted in conjunction with ongoing long-term investigations conducted by Dr. Thomas Martin (U. Montana) that address the ultimate causes (e.g. offspring and parent mortality) of variation in development rate in the same model systems with a tight integration of projects and approaches. This will provide a powerful and unique tool for testing hypotheses of evolution of life histories, generating novel and critical insights into epigenetic maternal effects on life history evolution and evaluating selection pressures driving evolution of proximate mechanisms of maternal effects in both the parent (reproductive physiology) and the offspring (developmental physiology) generations. The project provides training of graduate and undergraduate students in integrative approaches to, and analyses of, complex biological questions.</AbstractNarration>
