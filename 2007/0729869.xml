    <AbstractNarration>0729869&lt;br/&gt;Cui&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to implement an electroactively controlled conductive polymer drug release device. The system will utilize the unique properties of electroactive conducting polymers, which can be synthesized by electropolymerization with ionic drug molecules incorporated, allowing for flexible drug loading onto electrodes. Upon an electrical potential change, the polymer undergoes redox reactions that lead to the release of drug from the electrodes, with the release quantity controlled by the amplitude of electrical stimulation. &lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of the project are: (1) in-vitro development and characterization of a conductin-based neurochemical system, and (2) in-vivo characterization of the neurochemical delivery system. The interdisciplinary research project includes elements of bioengineering, material science and neuroscience. This study will make important contributions to the field of neuro-electrode interfacing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will support new course development, train graduate and undergraduate students and support programs for educating women and underrepresented minorities. The results will enhance scientific understanding in multi-disciplinary fields. This project will significantly impact localized drug delivery while electrically recording the neural response in real-time.</AbstractNarration>
