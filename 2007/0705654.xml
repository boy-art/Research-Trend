    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;ARC 0713896 &amp; 0725654&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative research project, PI Peter Schweitzer and PI Tim Heleniak, is the US portion of a larger international collaboration that was conceived under the European Science Foundation, EUROCORES Programme, BOREAS. The full ESF project is a collaboration of researchers from five countries, including the US, Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Finland. These particular projects, which represent a portion of the US NSF contribution to the BOREAS effort, focus on the local and regional context and impacts of state sponsored and implemented resettlement programs, of indigenous and non-indigenous communities, in the Arctic in the 20th and 21st centuries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the tools of economic geography and population geography, the aim of Heleniak's project will be to document and analyze changes in the spatial distribution of economic activity and settlements patterns across the circumpolar North. The project aims to be comparative, spatial, and temporal. A major component of this will be to examine the events of the past decade and a half in the Russian North against the situation in other northern regions. The breakup of the Soviet Union, transition of the Russian economy, and liberalization of society has had profound consequences for the Russian North as well as on relations among northern regions. A question is whether the Russian North is beginning to resemble other northern regions elsewhere or whether the past patterns of development and settlement will remain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major component upon which the analysis will be based will be a geodatabase of economic activity and population distribution across the North. Other geodatabases or GIS (geographic information systems) have been compiled on the Arctic or the North that emphasize changes in physical characteristics of northern regions, many emphasizing the impact of climatic change on these regions. The proposed geodatabase would emphasize the economic and human aspects of the circumpolar North and changes in these attributes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comparative analysis that the project is taking of the diverse circumpolar migration and resettlements movements will have relevance and intellectual merit for the community of academic researchers interested in circumpolar issues. The combination of the broad comparative approach proposed in this project, along with comparative approaches being undertaken in the other projects at other geographic scales will contribute significantly to our theoretical understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models of economic and population change developed in this project will have broader impact and relevance for other academics and policy makers dealing with circumpolar issues. The geodatabase of economic and demographic characteristics across the circumpolar North will be of value to both groups as climate change and other factors impact on the North in the decades ahead. In order to enhance these broader impacts, outreach efforts will be undertaken to ensure wide distribution of the data collected and analysis undertaken in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schweitzer will conduct research among the Residents of Shishmaref, Kivalina, Newtok, and many other coastal communities of Alaska facing erosion and, thus, the loss of their residential areas due to severe storm events and other consequences of a changing climate. The former residents and their descendants of Naukan and Chaplino in Chukotka and of King Island in Alaska preserve strong memories of being relocated almost 50 years ago. The indigenous residents many communities on the Chukchi Peninsula have experienced waves of expansion and contraction of their villages, be it due to the sedentarization of reindeer herders, the mass influx of Russians and other incomers, or their rapid out-migration since 1990. During the summer of 2005, the threat of the closure of an Air Force Base in the vicinity of Fairbanks spurred community protests and scenarios of economic and social decay. At the same time, a good portion of the non-indigenous population of Fairbanks is characterized by having arrived during or after the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in the mid-1970s, an event which serves as a dividing line between "old settlers" from "new settlers".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the cases mentioned above refer to past and future population movements triggered by outside forces, be they direct state intervention, market forces, or changes in the natural environment. All of them are also characterized by memories of past events and conditions, as well as by speculations about the future, in short by narrative ways of adapting to changing conditions. Notwithstanding these similarities, these and other examples are defined by a number of important differences. Most obviously, Alaska and Chukotka seem to represent two diametrically opposed experiences regarding the role of the state in population movements. While Chukotka has been the frequent recipient of Soviet and post-Soviet forms of social engineering, Alaska seems to have been relatively free from such interventions. A closer look, however, reveals that also in Alaska many small-scale communities have been closed or relocated, for a variety of different reasons. At the same time, large influxes of non-indigenous people occurred during economic boom periods, many of which were either initiated or regulated by the state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most compelling reasons for conducting this research is that there is hardly any documentation of the diverse relocation phenomena which have characterized Alaska and rural Chukotka throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. The first goal of documenting what has happened and continues to happen is both of scholarly importance, as well as highly relevant to affected communities. The second goal of focusing on four or more case studies will, apart from providing more in-depth documentation, result in a better understanding of the factors which contribute to positive and negative effects of relocation events. This addresses important issues regarding the creation and re-creation of community identity and the importance of "place" in these processes. Another compelling reason for this project is its new, comparative approach. Yet another reason for this study is its emphasis on the people themselves. This project reaches beyond a general history of events and delves into their impacts and perceptions thereof.</AbstractNarration>
