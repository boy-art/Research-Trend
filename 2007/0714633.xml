    <AbstractNarration>This project would create radio programs, podcasts, Internet blogs, and other materials to engage children 8-11 years old. Using science challenge competitions, radio broadcasts and interactive web features, this project will showcase children's interactions with scientists and engineers. To reinforce involvement, the project will develop and distribute scientist trading cards, science activity books and other products directly linked to project themes. Project deliverables include 150 Pulse of the Planet radio programs which focus on the interaction between a select group of scientists and youths 8-11, who have been chosen from a nationwide Science Challenge which encourages children to submit questions and potential experiments to scientists; 60 podcasts designed for children; onsite visits by children and parents to science labs and research sites; and website features including podcasts, scientist blogs, and related projects and activities. Project partners include a variety of businesses (e.g., sports manufacturers such as K2), media (e.g., internet social networks such as imbee.com, TIME for Kids, Dragonfly TV, and Hispanic Communications Network) and educational partnerships (e.g. Community Science Workshops and the National Science Teacher's Association.) Underserved participants will be reached through Celebra la Ciencia science outreach programs. The evaluator, Knight-Williams, will carry out formative evaluation to inform the design of the radio programs and learning resources. The summative evaluation will explore how children interact with and learn from listening to the podcasts, getting and using the activity book, pursuing information on the Internet, joining the imbee.com online community and engaging with teachers or parents while doing these activities.</AbstractNarration>
