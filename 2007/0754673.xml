    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a new Research Experience for Undergraduates site to be located at CUNY Queensborough Community College. The site will expand community college student participation in the application of physics to astronomy and biology. The theoretical aspect will focus on data mining and analysis using the national science data banks such as the NASA Hubble data and the RCSB protein data. The experimental aspect will focus on data collection using the computer controlled laser labs via LabVIEW. The projects will focus on optical measurements of biological samples and their relationships to the biological growth conditions. The site will recruit eight students and two high school teachers each year, and will provide a national model for community college based research tailored for lower division students. The remote controlled laser lab capability will enable a consortium of community colleges to share expensive equipment and introduce talented community college students to bio-physics, medical instrumentation and related careers; as well as lasers, optics, photonics and related engineering careers. The utilization of the national science data banks under a physics theme will enable the community college physics faculty to bring the forefront of science to the classrooms to attract and retain talented students, and to inspire high school teachers as well.</AbstractNarration>
