    <AbstractNarration>The Laboratory for Atmospheric Research (LAR) at Washington State University (WSU) will build on existing summer research programs and organize a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site. Eight or nine students will be recruited each summer, targeting underrepresented communities in the Pacific Northwest (Native Americans and first-generation college students) plus minority students from outside the Northwest who would not otherwise have undergraduate research opportunities. Through several half-day workshops during the program, students will learn about atmospheric chemistry, measurement and modeling techniques, data interpretation, and scientific communication. In parallel with these workshops, students will pursue individual research projects with faculty and graduate student mentors. These projects will focus on current problems in atmospheric chemistry including: biogenic emissions and secondary organic aerosol formation; agricultural and forest fires in the Pacific Northwest with associated visibility and health impacts; air quality impacts of livestock and agricultural operations; and air quality forecasting, remote sensing, and the impacts of climate change. Throughout the summer, the students will meet weekly as a group with the faculty advisors to discuss research progress and present individual results. The summer will culminate with poster presentations from each student at the WSU Undergraduate Research Symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus on atmospheric chemistry and air quality issues will promote among the participants the idea of interdisciplinary and collaborative research and encourage them to pursue graduate school opportunities and careers in an environmental field. The REU program will increase the participation of underrepresented students in engineering and science. The program will also contribute to broader impacts on education by assessing the impact of the REU experience on participants' beliefs and perspectives on science and engineering research.</AbstractNarration>
