    <AbstractNarration>Our knowledge of properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter, especially the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy, is important for understanding many critical issues in nuclear physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The density and momentum dependence of the nucleon isovector potential is the most fundamental but currently very poorly known quantity determining properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter. Heavy-ion reactions, especially those induced by high energy radioactive beams, provide us the unique means to investigate properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter in terrestrial laboratories. In concert with the experimental efforts undertaken at several radioactive beam facilities in the US and abroad, I shall develop new theoretical tools to explore signatures of the density and momentum dependence of the isovector nucleon potential and the corresponding symmetry energy; continue to provide theoretical assistances in planning and data analyses of experiments; and evaluate timely astrophysical impact of the symmetry energy constrained by the latest terrestrial nuclear laboratory data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While carrying out the proposed work, I will carefully integrate my research and the education of students. Several undergraduate and graduate students will participate in carrying out the proposed work. I will emphasize and encourage early involvement of undergraduate students in research. This experience not only plays a vital role in their complete education but also provides a solid basis for them to become next generation scientists and engineers. Moreover, the continued NSF funding will also help significantly improve the environment and infrastructure for research, especially in nuclear physics and astrophysics, at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce.</AbstractNarration>
