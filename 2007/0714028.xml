    <AbstractNarration>Daniel G. Nocera, Moungi G. Bawendi, Klavs F. Jensen (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Manoochehr Koochesfahani (Michigan State University) are jointly supported to develop a microfluidic reactor for high throughput materials synthesis. This massively parallel system will allow for rapid mixing and extremely uniform segmentation, required for hydrothermal and solvatothermal synthesis. The microfluidic reactor will be fitted with sensors to provide information on chemical and physical phenomena underlying materials growth as well as allowing feedback optimization of the desired materials properties. New optical diagnostic techniques will allow microflows to be quantitatively measured. These data will allow for the control of reaction kinetics and growth processes for the creation of nanocrystals designed for optical sensing and water-splitting catalysts for solar energy conversion. The new microfluidic reactor system will enable the rapid synthesis and analysis of new materials, allowing many new compositions and combinations to be effectively studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded through the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program (CRC) and provides collaborative training and research opportunities in chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. The investigators also engage the public by discussing the role of basic scientific research in promoting societal sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
