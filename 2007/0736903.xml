    <AbstractNarration>CBET 0736903&lt;br/&gt;Environmental Engineering Body of Knowledge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Debra Reinhart&lt;br/&gt;University of Central Florida &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides participant support funds to support two workshops as part of an effort by the environmental engineering community to develop a "body of knowledge" (BOK) for the field of environmental engineering. A body of knowledge (BOK) provides the foundations that define a profession, and the need for a BOK has been recognized by many engineering disciplines. The BOK for environmental engineering will describe the knowledge and core competencies integral to the understanding and practice in this broad and interdisciplinary field. A working group established in 2006 to develop the BOK for environmental engineering has members representing the academic community, as well as practicing environmental engineers from the consulting profession and industry. An initial meeting of the working group was held in Tempe, AZ, as part of an NSF-funded workshop on Frontiers in Environmental Engineering Education, in January 2007. A second meeting of the working group, to be held at the 2007 AEESP Research and Education Conference in Blacksburg, VA, July 29, 2007, will discuss critical elements of the BOK, including outcome descriptions and appropriate levels of achievement. The goals of a third and final workshop in spring 2008 are to reach closure on outstanding issues and develop a plan to seek input from important stakeholders in the field.</AbstractNarration>
