    <AbstractNarration>The Internet is a phenomenal success, but problems and weaknesses in&lt;br/&gt;it have become apparent, and this has spurred a search for new&lt;br/&gt;technologies and network architectures. Although technical innovation&lt;br/&gt;will remain fundamental to the Internet's evolution, the importance of&lt;br/&gt;this key infrastructure for society as a whole means that economic&lt;br/&gt;aspects will be critical in determining what innovations are adopted.&lt;br/&gt;This project, therefore, seeks to investigate -- both qualitatively&lt;br/&gt;and quantitatively -- how economic factors mediate the eventual&lt;br/&gt;success of new network architectures and technologies. Aspects of&lt;br/&gt;interest include quantifying the benefits of virtualization in&lt;br/&gt;enabling different levels of network integration; evaluating the&lt;br/&gt;effect of a dominant incumbent (today's Internet) on emerging new&lt;br/&gt;architectures; and devising models for quantifying the value of&lt;br/&gt;architectural flexibility and openness in facilitating technology&lt;br/&gt;adoption and service creation in the presence of market uncertainties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is in developing an&lt;br/&gt;economic framework for reasoning about network technologies,&lt;br/&gt;architecture alternatives and trade-offs. The goal is to inform the&lt;br/&gt;design of new network architectures by accounting for both their&lt;br/&gt;technical dimensions, and the economic mechanisms that will mediate&lt;br/&gt;their success or failure. The broader impact of the project will be&lt;br/&gt;in helping select network solutions that are likely to succeed in the&lt;br/&gt;market place. The project will also foster a multi-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;curriculum involving economics, business and engineering perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;This will both better prepare engineering students to succeed in a&lt;br/&gt;world where understanding of economical forces is of paramount&lt;br/&gt;importance, and promote interactions and collaboration among&lt;br/&gt;engineering and business students.</AbstractNarration>
