    <AbstractNarration>This proposal formally establishs a multi-university Silicon Solar Consortium (SiSoC) as part of NSF?s Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) program. The Georgia Institute of Technology and North Carolina State University (the lead institution) will maintain research sites to collaborate on research, fabrication, and characterization of advanced photovoltaic (PV) materials and devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center's goal is to help reestablish a global leadership role for the U.S. Silicon PV industry by having government together with the solar-electric power industry jointly stimulate high quality university level research and education, while developing an expanded and skilled workforce. The Center will collaborate with other university and government agencies bringing together the leading academic institutions currently involved in PV research and development. Research emphasizes materials characterization leading to a fundamental understanding of impact of defects/impurities/mechanical behavior of solar cell materials to accommodate various needs of both single- and multi-crystalline Si wafers, thin films and nanoscale PV science and technology. Results will create strategies for processing advanced silicon PV structures and devices. Research will also focus on reducing the cost of PV generated electricity and designing and fabricating high efficiency solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SiSoC will help develop a skilled workforce in a much needed area. This will be enabled by having NSF and other government agencies, together with the solar-electric power industry jointly stimulating high quality university level research and education. Research activity will also be strengthened through student internships at industry member locations. This center will also be used to compliment efforts for outreach and improve opportunities for underrepresented minorities/women to participate in PV materials research through such programs as the Research Experiences for Undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
