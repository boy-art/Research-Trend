    <AbstractNarration>The University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (UA) is preparing 36 students to become secondary level mathematics and science teachers through a Robert Noyce Scholarship Program. Students are completing the nationally recognized UA Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program, making them eligible for licensure in mathematics or science to teach in Arkansas' secondary schools. The scholarships are available to three types of students: 1) those who have completed an undergraduate STEM degree and would like to teach but do not have the financial means to pursue teacher preparation; 2) STEM professionals seeking a career change and; 3) students near the end of their junior year who demonstrate an aptitude for teaching and considering it as a career. The program supports students during their senior and MAT years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physical science and mathematics students receiving Noyce scholarships are required to participate in experiment-based projects designed to develop low cost experiments in current scientific and technology areas for use in the classroom. These experiments are providing K12 classrooms with connections to cutting-edge science and technology. This project should result in a 40% increase over the current production of science and mathematics teachers at UA leading to the placement of highly qualified science and mathematics teachers in Arkansas schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Noyce program builds on the prior NSF-supported PhysTEC program which encourages, nurtures and evaluates STEM majors to become 7-12 physical science and physics teachers; and expands the collaboration between STEM discipline, Education, and 7-12 teachers to more STEM departments. Project partners include larger school districts with growing minority populations (Rogers, Bentonville, Fayetteville, Springdale) and a small district with a growing disparity in economic means (Elkins). Noyce Scholarship students serve internships in the partnership schools. Each of the schools has a longstanding tie to the UA MAT program and provides the program with placements based on socioeconomic status and percentage of ESL students. This provides the Noyce Scholarship graduates with the type of experiences needed to prepare them for service during their two-year commitment in high need schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After completion of all program requirements, scholarship recipients take positions in high need schools, where they are assisted in their initial years of teaching. Arkansas' induction program already assigns new teachers a mentor. The project provides a discussion board that allows MAT graduates to share ideas, ask questions and reflect on their experiences. In addition, ongoing research focuses on graduates' issues with pedagogical content knowledge.</AbstractNarration>
