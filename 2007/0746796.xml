    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this CAREER project is to understand how noise in gene expression is controlled. Gene expression, similar to many other biochemical reactions involving small copy number components, is inherently stochastic. Such stochasticity inevitably leads to considerable noise in gene expression. However, "noisy gene expression" is intuitively at odds with the incredible precision cells and organisms achieve during development and growth. How do cells cope with noise, adopting a robust growth pattern while the underlying molecular events are inherently stochastic? In this work, real-time gene expression dynamics in single E. coli cells with unprecedented single molecule sensitivity is followed and the full noise spectrum of gene expression, both the amplitude and frequency, is quantitatively analyzed. Knowledge obtained from this study may bring in the possibilities of designing and building synthetic networks with desired properties to carry out specific functions. The educational component of this project focuses at two levels: K-12 and college. An annual Fun with Science Summer Camp that is freely open to local low-income, underserved students in eight adjacent city elementary schools will be organized to provoke their interest in learning science. At the college level, an elective course Single Molecule Methods will be developed and offered to graduate students in the School of Medicine. The integrated research and education plans allow the PI to expand the participation of underrepresented minority students in scientific research, provide broad training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students and advance the understanding of the noise control mechanisms in gene expression.</AbstractNarration>
