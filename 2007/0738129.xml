    <AbstractNarration>Collins&lt;br/&gt;OISE-0738129&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to carry out its responsibilities as&lt;br/&gt;the United States National Member Organization (NMO) of the International Institute for Applied&lt;br/&gt;Systems Analysis (IIASA). These responsibilities take two forms: participating in governance of the&lt;br/&gt;Institute through participation in the IIASA Council and direct interaction with the organization; and&lt;br/&gt;facilitating and encouraging U.S. interest in IIASA's activities. The Board on International&lt;br/&gt;Organizations (BISO) of the National Research Council (NRC) executes these responsibilities through the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Committee for IIASA, chaired by Professor Simon Levin of Princeton.&lt;br/&gt;IIASA was established in 1972 as a multilateral, non-governmental research institution devoted to&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary, policy-oriented research. At IIASA, multidisciplinary, international teams of&lt;br/&gt;researchers conduct research on issues related to environmental, technological, and economic aspects of&lt;br/&gt;global change, including energy and technology, population, and natural resources. The Institute thus&lt;br/&gt;serves as a neutral forum for sustained investigation and discussion of global and international issues. It&lt;br/&gt;is located in Laxenburg, Austria, near Vienna.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal consists of the work by the U.S. NMO, in collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;interested U.S. researchers and Government agencies, to formulate U.S. views regarding IIASA's&lt;br/&gt;research, budget, and administration. This helps to insure the integrity of the Institute and guides the&lt;br/&gt;IIASA research program in ways that will maintain its quality and its relevance to U.S. research and&lt;br/&gt;policy concerns. The NMO works to broaden the impact of the Institute and its work by serving as a&lt;br/&gt;liaison to the U.S. science, technology, and policy communities, with the goal of increasing participation&lt;br/&gt;in and awareness of IIASA by Americans in academia, government, business, and non-governmental&lt;br/&gt;organizations (NGOs). This includes recruiting for and funding IIASA's Young Scientists Summer&lt;br/&gt;Program for advanced graduate students; helping to find suitable candidates for IIASA's job vacancies;&lt;br/&gt;serving as the hub of a national network of interested scholars and policymakers; and helping IIASA to&lt;br/&gt;find opportunities to participate in national policy debates.&lt;br/&gt;The chairman of the U.S. Committee represents the U.S. NMO at IIASA's Council meetings. The&lt;br/&gt;Council is composed of representatives from the 16 NMO's; each NMO country pays an annual&lt;br/&gt;membership contribution. The U.S. Council member was elected to a three-year term as Chairman of the&lt;br/&gt;Council in November 2003, and he works with the Director of IIASA, the IIASA Council Program&lt;br/&gt;Committee, and the IIASA Science Advisory Committee to guide and strengthen the IIASA research&lt;br/&gt;program. The U.S. national committee carries out an annual review of IIASA's research progress,&lt;br/&gt;soliciting comments from academic, government, and other experts in the U.S. scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
