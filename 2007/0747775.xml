    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project is to develop the thermo-mechanical models of concrete under multi-axial loading and realistic thermal environment. Under severe fire conditions the mechanical behavior of concrete and of structural elements made of concrete is currently not well understood, and the engineering data and models needed to design concrete structures under such thermal environment are not available. Experiments will be conducted in the thermal testing facility especially developed for this purpose to simulate real fires such as short duration high intensity and progressive burning. Testing methodology will be developed to measure the permanent damage due to load related strain, thermal induced strain, and transient strain in confined concrete. Based on the experiments on scaled models, the thermo-mechanical material properties and models will be established to predict temperature profiles, deformation, and damage characteristics in large scale concrete members subjected to real fires. The results of the study will be widely disseminated to educational and professional communities involved in the performance-based design of structure for fire safety. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The completed project will have significant impact on the development of design codes and on the implementation of the performance based design concepts for fire safety. First, the data from this research will provide experimental evidence in the area of thermo-mechanical modeling - a corner stone in performance based design for fire safety. Second, the developed control fires and test methods for quantifying thermo-mechanical damage during confined testing can be applied in the development of national and international codes and standards for the fire protection of buildings. Third, graduate and undergraduate engineering and architectural students will benefit directly through class room instruction as well as participation in long and short term research opportunities. Finally, the educational videos developed in this project will be available to the university and professional communities.</AbstractNarration>
