    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Gregory K. Friestad of the Chemistry Department at the University of Iowa. The project focuses on the development of new stereoselective methods to achieve asymmetric amine synthesis via free radical addition reactions. In particular, these studies will expand the scope and improve the efficiency of Mn-mediated radical additions, provide new methods for the construction of quaternary carbon stereocenters, and investigate asymmetric catalysis of radical additions to C=N bonds. A new radical addition approach to chiral amines, involving addition to the C=C bond of chiral enamides with subsequent stereoselective trapping by tandem bond constructions, will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to knowledge of the chemistry of radical addition reactions that generate chiral amines. Since chiral amines play crucial roles in pharmaceutical chemistry, these investigations are expected to have broad impact on research in the health sciences. This project will also provide important undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training in preparation for careers in health sciences research.</AbstractNarration>
