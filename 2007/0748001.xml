    <AbstractNarration>This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Pittsburgh is to study to facilitate, control and direct the growth, differentiation and functional integration of stem cells within a host tissue. This project seeks to develop a technology platform that can be used to study material-neural tissue interaction with a specific emphasis on the differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells. That the stem cell fate can be influenced by the engineered substrate, specifically via the surface characteristics, controlled release of soluble factors and electrical stimulation is one of the most important questions in neural tissue engineering, tissue repair and regenerative medicine. Application of stimuli is expected to promote neural stem cells differentiation into functional neurons at desired locations and orientations, and is to promote functional tissue regeneration and repair. Electroactive conducting polymers such as polypyrrole and its derivatives will be used to build various surfaces for neural stem cells to grow and differentiate. The unique properties of these polymers will allow to systematically changing the surface characteristics, to release soluble factors at a high spatial and temporal resolution and to apply electrical stimuli. Conductive polymers will be electrodeposited on electrodes patterned on the bottom of cell culture wells for systematic and high-throughput cell culture studies to be performed with improved efficiency and precision. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology platform will create numerous multi-interdisciplinary training opportunities, including new courses and workshops to attract and educate graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral fellows and even medical doctors. The proposed research project may provide significant insight into methods of manipulating neural stem cells via their supporting substrates by engineered external stimuli, so that they can be of therapeutic value to neurological diseases or injuries, many of which are the most devastating of conditions. The educational plan will bring more impact to the rapidly growing field of neural engineering by promoting the engagement of scientists, engineers and clinicians, and attracting more young talent (graduate and undergraduate students, with extra effort on increasing participation of underrepresented groups) to the field and providing them with a wealth of multidisciplinary training and research experience.</AbstractNarration>
