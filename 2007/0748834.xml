    <AbstractNarration>This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Illinois is to develop synthetic chemistry tools to facilitate the formation of polymeric lactic acid nanoparticle utilizing drug-initiated ring-opening polymerization that precisely controls the formation of nanoparticle drug delivery system. This polymerization approach, where drug is attached to the terminal of polymer chains during polymerization would have the following unique characteristics. 1) Drug loading to polymers is completed in a drug-initiated, living polymerization process instead of being conjugated or encapsulated to an existing polymer; 2) Drug molecules quantitatively coordinate with metal catalysts and facilitate quantitative chain initiation and complete monomer consumption in the polymerization; and 3) Drug release kinetics is modulated by the degradation of polymer matrix and the hydrolysis kinetics of the cleavable polymer-drug bond with low or no burst release effect. By this approach, drug incorporation efficiency could reach 100%, and drug loading could be controlled by adjusting monomer/drug ratio. The scientific broader impact of this project is possible development of well-controlled drug delivery technologies using drug polymer particulates with clear application in medicine and food industry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop unique and innovative education and outreach programs, such as the development of a workshop on nanobiomaterials for undergraduates and mentoring these students. K-12 students will participate in the project through the Engineering Summer Programs. During the course of this project, the PI plans to develop three biomaterials courses focusing on synthesis and biomedical applications of biomaterials. In addition, a senior undergraduate course will be developed and this course will cover regulatory, legal and business aspects of biomaterials, integrating the PI's interactions with the Tech Transfer Office.</AbstractNarration>
