    <AbstractNarration>0746458&lt;br/&gt;Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Career award to University of Delaware by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research is to study a novel, self-activating gene delivery platform by combining self-assembled monolayer-functionalized with nanogold particles with attached biomimetic and nucleus-specific unpackaging peptides. With this award, Dr. Millicent Sullivan will synthesize and characterize histone-mimetic gold nanoparticles (HMGNs) modified with trimethylated histone tails (H3K4Me3). Self-assembly of these nanoparticles with plasmid DNA will be the other part of this project. The ultimate potential goal of this project is to create HMGNs containing combinations of histone tails that optimize nucleus-specific transcriptional activation of HMGN/DNA nanocomplexes. This project, if successful, could develop an integrated gene therapy scaffold and a generic gene/drug delivery system targeted to the nucleus of the cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the objectives of this project is to integrate research activities with teaching, training and education of graduate and undergraduate students at University of Delaware. The outreach component of the project involves the participation of high school students and their teachers. Local high school teachers will be selected and trained at the researcher?s laboratory as teaching interns in bioengineering course module, and these teachers in turn will provide training and internship to high school students. In addition, these high school students and teachers will be co-mentored by undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
