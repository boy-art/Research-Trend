    <AbstractNarration>This project studies the Earth's transition thirty four million years ago from a greenhouse state with forests in Antarctica to its current icehouse state with ice caps at both poles. This time interval--the Eocene-Oligocene--had atmospheric CO2 levels similar to those predicted for the Earth in the next century. Sedimentary records of this period can thus help us understand how the Earth's climate will change in the near future. This project investigates the transition in Antarctica by collecting seismic and gravity data from offshore New Harbor (ONH). The work's ultimate goal is to select areas for future drilling as part of the ANDRILL Program, a multinational initiative that aims to recover stratigraphic records of Antarctica's climatic and glacial history over the past 50 million years. ONH is an ideal locale to sample these sedimentary archives as existing data suggest that substantial strata deposited from the Eocene through mid-Oligocene. The work uses new over-ice seismic techniques that employ a snowstreamer and air gun to quickly acquire seismic reflection data. A complementary high resolution gravity survey will also be performed to determine structural patterns. The outcomes will be tied to information from other surveys and drill holes to characterize this region. The study will also help understand the link between formation of the sedimentary basin and the adjacent mountain range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this project has an integrated educational and mentoring program targeting sixth through tenth grade students from groups typically underrepresented in the sciences. This will be highlighted by a teacher accompanying the expedition. In addition, this project provides support for two graduate and two undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is supported under NSF's International Polar Year (IPY) research emphasis area on "Understanding Environmental Change in Polar Regions". This project will leave an important legacy for IPY by characterizing drilling sites relevant to understanding global warming. The project is also international in scope by including scientists from New Zealand. In addition, this project will help educate the next generation of Antarctic researchers through education at the K12 through graduate student levels.</AbstractNarration>
