    <AbstractNarration>This award partially supports a technician who plays a key role in the recently established, NSF-funded multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The laboratory will be used to make high-precision isotope ratio measurements, which are critical in NSF-supported research in several areas of Geology, Anthropology, and Environmental Chemistry at UIUC. Specific applications of the instrument include:&lt;br/&gt;- Tracing chemical reactions involving potentially toxic selenium, chromium, and mercury in ground water and surface water&lt;br/&gt;- Revealing the processes through which magmas are generated and migrate toward the Earth's surface&lt;br/&gt;- Determining the ages of past climate changes &lt;br/&gt;- Determining the ages of mountain-building events and the processes involved in them&lt;br/&gt;- Tracing migration of human ancestors and archaeological artifacts&lt;br/&gt;The technician is essential for the proper operation and efficient use of this advanced, complex instrument and enables the laboratory to serve a large, diverse community of students and researchers. The educational impact of the laboratory is greatly enhanced by the technician's efforts. Students in three classes use the instrument with his help. These students and the many graduate students who use the instrument for thesis research learn key scientific practices as they collect data, assess its quality, and interpret first-hand results.</AbstractNarration>
