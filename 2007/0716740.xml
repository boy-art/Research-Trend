    <AbstractNarration>Society is dependent on many engineered systems whose increasing&lt;br/&gt;complexity and inter-connectedness have, in turn, increased their&lt;br/&gt;vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In many of these systems,&lt;br/&gt;protecting the execution of their computations is as crucial as&lt;br/&gt;ensuring the security of their data. This research investigates how&lt;br/&gt;to maintain survivable operation of such systems, even in the face of&lt;br/&gt;invasive attacks where computations are intentionally subverted to&lt;br/&gt;interfere with other computations' execution constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop new techniques for isolating&lt;br/&gt;the effects of interactions among computations through specific&lt;br/&gt;resources in these systems, including: flexible specification and&lt;br/&gt;rigorous enforcement of computations' execution constraints; explicit&lt;br/&gt;control of all OS kernel components under a single scheduler; detailed&lt;br/&gt;on-line monitoring of computations and their supporting OS kernel&lt;br/&gt;components; automated learning to discover previously unknown&lt;br/&gt;interactions among computations; and formal modeling and verification&lt;br/&gt;of computations, execution constraints, and system components and&lt;br/&gt;resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected benefits of this project include: a novel approach to&lt;br/&gt;non-bypassable isolation of computations from the effects of&lt;br/&gt;adversarial attack in which isolation can be enforced flexibly&lt;br/&gt;according to the system-specific execution constraints that must be&lt;br/&gt;satisfied; a high quality open-source software implementation of&lt;br/&gt;kernel-level scheduling and monitoring services that provide and&lt;br/&gt;measure such non-bypassable isolation; new formal models, analyses,&lt;br/&gt;and methodologies for verifiably correct configuration and management&lt;br/&gt;of those services; and empirical studies of the services' ability to&lt;br/&gt;protect computations from interference under a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;adversarial attacks.</AbstractNarration>
