    <AbstractNarration>This REU program will provide a rich research experience for ten chemical engineering undergraduates in the emerging field of energy research. The students will be mentored by faculty members in diverse, but all energy related research areas, ranging from heterogeneous catalysis to nanomaterials for energy reduction. In addition to the research experience, the students will be involved in a variety of professional and developmental activities. These activities include: 1) field trips to local companies involved in energy related research (fuel cells, hydrocarbon processing, biofuels) and to energy research facilities on campus (Institute for Energy Conversion); 2) informal workshops focusing on areas such as oral communication skills and graduate student life; and 3) brown bag lunches to encourage social interaction among the students and mentors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in alternative energies and energy reduction technology is rapidly becoming one of the most important topics in engineering and science and will remain a national research priority for quite some time. The students in this program will have the opportunity to make a substantial impact in addressing the world's energy issues. The involvement of these students in exciting research enhances the likelihood that they will consider post-graduate study and broaden the base of the Nation's technical manpower.</AbstractNarration>
