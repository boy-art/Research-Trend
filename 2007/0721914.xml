    <AbstractNarration>To resolve the apparent scarcity of available prime radio spectrum (300 MHz - 3 GHz), the dynamic spectrum access paradigm was proposed to improve spectrum utilization. By enabling temporary, unlicensed wireless access to the unoccupied licensed spectrum, called "spectrum holes", a larger number of wireless transmissions can be supported by the same spectrum while simultaneously respecting the rights of the incumbent license holders. However, this paradigm heavily depends on the location and size of these spectrum holes, which can vary randomly with respect to time, frequency, and geography. The objective of this project is: (i) to accurately characterize the availability of prime spectrum in mid-size US cities, i.e. the average and most common case, for secondary access via theoretical and experimental techniques, (ii) to quantitatively determine the long-term behavior and trends of spectrum occupancy and spectrum hole availability, and (iii) to understand and obtain insight into the electrospace characteristics (time, frequency, spatial) over a large urban area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quantitative assessment and characterization of available prime spectrum is important for providing access to new and growing wireless services. Understanding how this essential resource is utilized will greatly assist spectrum regulators and users to plan future deployments and the overall growth of the wireless industry. Since modern society depends on communication networks in order to function properly, conducting research into spectrum availability is important. Knowledge of how much spectrum is actually available and where those opportunities are located in frequency is of vital importance to the wireless industry, which has experienced rapid growth over the past several years and continues to accelerate.</AbstractNarration>
