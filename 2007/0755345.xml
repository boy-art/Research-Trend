    <AbstractNarration>The theme of this three-year REU Site program is "Sustainable Solutions to Emerging Environmental Problems." With new technological and scientific advancements combined with increasing population and limited resources, environmental problems become more complex and inter-connected. These problems may require technological and/or social solutions that provide for economic, social and environmental sustainability. Examples of emerging environmental problems are: 1) the predicted end of oil; 2) climate change; and 3) human and ecosystem impacts of emerging pollutants. In an effort to respond to the need for solutions to these emerging environmental problems, this REU Site program theme incorporates three main areas of research: Alternative Energy and Greenhouse Gas Reduction; Fate and Transport of Emerging Pollutants; and Political, Social and Ecological Responses to Emerging Environmental Problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this REU site are as follows: 1) to motivate students to continue on to graduate school and successful careers in science and engineering,2) to recruit traditionally underrepresented students and provide these students with the opportunity to conduct independent research in environmental engineering and science in a supportive and challenging environment , 3) to advance multidisciplinary approaches to solving emerging environmental problems through cross-disciplinary training in hypothesis-driven research methods and experience in applied research, and 4) to teach students how to communicate their research to colleagues and the general public through professional oral presentation, peer-reviewed publication, and the media. In addition to the hands-on research experience students will participate in seminars, field-trips and social activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will aim to increase recruitment of underrepresented students through contacts at colleges with large minority populations and collaboration with other on-campus programs.</AbstractNarration>
