    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Award funds a project that will probe quantum dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures with designed geometry. These dynamic processes ultimately determine the limits of operational speed and the efficiency of electronic devices that interact with light (optoelectronic devices). Taking the opportunity offered by the newly developed nanostructures, one expects to discover novel phenomena arising from collective electron excitation and light emission in nanostructures. Harnessing quantum properties of semiconductor nanostructures may also enable new capabilities in the emerging field of quantum information science. The education component of this project will explore a wide range of methods to integrate research and education in both undergraduate and graduate levels. Effective pedagogical methods in introductory physics courses for non-science majors will be practiced by teaching with technology. A graduate-level course, "ultrafast optics and spectroscopy", will be developed. This course includes both lectures and training in presentation and scientific writing skills. In response to the congressionally requested report, "Rising above the Gathering Strom: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future", future and current high school teachers will be involved in the education and research activities via the platform of the UTeach program at the University of Texas-Austin. This award is supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Award funds a project that will probe quantum dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures with designed geometry. In semiconductor nanostructures, structural, electronic and optical properties are closely related. Following optical excitation, excitons (or bound electron-hole pairs) are formed. Exciton dynamics ultimately determine the limits of operational speed and the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. A central question is how quantum dynamics are determined by a combination of physical dimensions, the arrangement of building blocks, and Coulomb interactions. To answer this question, this project will probe exciton dynamics in nanostructures with designed geometry using comprehensive optical spectroscopy tools. The proposed research is significant in that it advances quantum engineering in nanostructures to a new level of sophistication. Taking the opportunity offered by the newly developed nanostructures, one expects to discover novel quantum phenomena arising from collective electron excitation and photon emission in nanostructures. The education component of this proposal will explore a wide range of methods to integrate research and education in both undergraduate and graduate levels.
