    <AbstractNarration>This research concerns the modular representation theory and&lt;br/&gt;cohomology of finite groups of Lie type. A major thrust involves the&lt;br/&gt;defining characteristic theory, in which the underlying module is&lt;br/&gt;taken over a field having the "same" characteristic as the group.&lt;br/&gt;The cross-characteristic theory is another theme; here, the&lt;br/&gt;characteristic of the module differs from that of the group. In both&lt;br/&gt;cases, the (already known) representations of continuous Lie groups provide a starting point for representations. This is most apparent in the defining&lt;br/&gt;characterstic case, where an ambient algebraic group is available.&lt;br/&gt;In cross characteristic, quantum groups plays a similar role, but,&lt;br/&gt;so far, only for the finite general linear groups. The major&lt;br/&gt;unsolved problems involve classifying the irreducible modules,&lt;br/&gt;determining their dimensions and characters, and understanding their&lt;br/&gt;homological properties. Issues involving Weyl groups (and Hecke&lt;br/&gt;algebras), finite dimensional algebras (e.g., endomorphism and&lt;br/&gt;quasi-hereditary algebras), the geometric theory of perverse&lt;br/&gt;sheaves, etc. arise naturally in many attacks on these problems.&lt;br/&gt;Parshall and Scott have developed and contributed to many of the&lt;br/&gt;various approaches, and the current project will continue in that&lt;br/&gt;direction, but also apply new (and deep results), such as the recent&lt;br/&gt;solution of the Broue conjecture for symmetric groups (by Chuang and&lt;br/&gt;Rouquier). For example, the authors will combine this work with&lt;br/&gt;their own recent work relating Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial character&lt;br/&gt;formulas for representations of the special linear groups in the defining characteristic to the representations of symmetric groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The groups and representations studied here comprise the most&lt;br/&gt;important basic ingredients for creating a general theory of all&lt;br/&gt;finite group representations, Over the past century, similar&lt;br/&gt;theories for continuous groups played a large role in quantum theory&lt;br/&gt;and the theory of elementary particles. Their finite analogs have&lt;br/&gt;already proved valuable in the design of communications and data&lt;br/&gt;storage devices, though this finite theory remains very incomplete. In the future, one expects that the finite discrete worlds of computers and&lt;br/&gt;communications will become even more important. The task of creating&lt;br/&gt;a viable general theory of finite group representations--the&lt;br/&gt;investigators' long-term goal--is, thus, a central problem&lt;br/&gt;for the future. Finally, graduate and undergraduate students will&lt;br/&gt;be fully involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>
