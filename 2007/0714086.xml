    <AbstractNarration>The research project is focused on a broad range of questions concerning &lt;br/&gt;algebraic stacks and their applications. The project is divided into two &lt;br/&gt;parts. The first part concerns foundational problems which have arisen &lt;br/&gt;in recent important applications of stacks such as the geometric &lt;br/&gt;Langland's program, the theory of moduli of stable maps, and the &lt;br/&gt;construction of moduli spaces for higher dimensional varieties. The &lt;br/&gt;second part of the program concerns applications of the theory. In &lt;br/&gt;particular new applications of the relationship between log geometry in &lt;br/&gt;the sense of Fontaine and Illusie and stacks discovered by the PI in &lt;br/&gt;earlier work, generalizations of the theory of twisted stable maps, as &lt;br/&gt;well as applications to the construction and study of moduli spaces for &lt;br/&gt;varieties of general type, abelian varieties, and vector bundles on &lt;br/&gt;curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notion of stack is a tool used to deal with internal symmetries of &lt;br/&gt;mathematical objects, as well as actions of groups. For example, when &lt;br/&gt;trying to classify geometric objects one is naturally forced to deal with &lt;br/&gt;the symmetries of the objects in question. In recent years, the theory of &lt;br/&gt;stacks has come to play an important role in almost every part of &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, and mathematical physics and a &lt;br/&gt;great number of exciting new applications of stacks have been found. This &lt;br/&gt;is not surprising considering the importance of symmetries in mathematics &lt;br/&gt;and other fields of science. This great interest in stacks has brought to &lt;br/&gt;light a number of important problems about stacks. The research project &lt;br/&gt;aims to broaden our understanding of both the foundational aspects of the &lt;br/&gt;theory of stacks and as well as the many applications.</AbstractNarration>
