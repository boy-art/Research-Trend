    <AbstractNarration>This project is a continuation of an ongoing experiment to measure the strength of certain types of electroweak interactions. The electroweak force (one of the fundamental forces in nature) gives rise to an intrinsic energy difference between right- and left-handed configurations of particles and electromagnetic fields. Here, molecules are used in a novel scheme to amplify this (usually tiny) effect by many orders of magnitude. This should make it possible to measure as-yet unseen features of the electroweak force, in particular how it is modified by the presence of strong forces inside an atomic nucleus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work involves extensive student training. Two current PhD students will complete their theses on the project, and another will be sought. Five undergraduates have participated to date, and a similar continued level of undergraduate involvement is anticipated. In addition, this project will continue to provide significant collaborative effort, including: participation of (at least) two faculty members from nearby small colleges, where on-campus research is not feasible; cross-disciplinary collaborations with chemists; and work with theorists in both Russia and the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
