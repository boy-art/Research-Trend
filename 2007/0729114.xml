    <AbstractNarration>An integrated, collaborative project among the Ohio State University (OSU), Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and General Motors R&amp;D (GM) will remove the principal obstacles to the adoption of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) for automotive application: the inabilty to predict forming and springback and the identification of processing technologies to produce new materials with strength/ductility combinations superior to those available with current AHSS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project has three inter-related thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;1. Process Development: Formability and springback measurement and simulation of existing AHSS and candidate alloys and microstructures devoloped in Thrust 2.&lt;br/&gt;2. Material Development: Identification of new processing routes and microstructures upon which to base a 3rd generation of AHSS; validation of application readiness with methodologies developed in Thrust 1.&lt;br/&gt;3. Educational Program: Education of promising and diverse students in AHSS-related technical areas at undergraduate and graduate levels; incorporation of Thrust 1 and Thrust 2 technical results into existing curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Broader impacts in four principal areas are anticipated: &lt;br/&gt;1. Benefits to Society: AHSS offer major improvement in automotive vehicle performance, cost, safety (personal security), energy savings, emissions, reliability, and durability. Nonetheless, adoption is uncertain without fundamental understanding.&lt;br/&gt;2. Learning / Broadened Participation: The technical research program will be integrated into existing and new educational activities at the two institutions &lt;br/&gt;3. Dissemination of Results: Project results will be widely disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and other avenues.</AbstractNarration>
