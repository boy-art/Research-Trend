    <AbstractNarration>The structure and decay dynamics of highly excited states in molecules is a research area that has provided a rich and diverse sampling of elucidating physics. The hydrogen molecule, being the simplest stable neutral molecule, is an especially important system for probing fundamental quantum mechanical effects in molecules. A dramatic example is a class of so-called double-well states of unusually large size. The structure and dynamics of these molecular configurations have long been of interest to scientists, but their nature has made them very difficult to create and study. The PI has developed a new excitation scheme that will allow us unprecedented access to these exotic states in molecular hydrogen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the experimental measurements will provide an important incentive for the development of improved methods of calculating the structure of ?super-excited? molecular configurations where internal energies exceed ionization and dissociation thresholds and large ranges of molecular size must be considered. The results will provide new information about the dynamics of highly excited states of molecular hydrogen and their important role in many astronomical and atmospheric processes. This research program will be conducted at Bryn Mawr College and will provide young women an opportunity to obtain in-depth laboratory research experiences. Engaged in research, members of this underrepresented group in physics will build mentor relationships and explore career expectations that can support their persistence and success in the physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
