    <AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This project develops a method for constructing composite nanoscale wires and fibers using tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as a template for assembly. TMV is a rod-like virus that has a tendency to undergo head-to-tail association under suitable conditions of pH and ionic strength. It is therefore attractive as a template for the formation of nanowires and/or nanofibers with a high aspect ratio and uniform diameter. In this work a number of monomeric materials will be caused to bind to the TMV template after which they will be polymerized into covalently linked wires and fibers. Proof of concept was demonstrated by binding and polymerizing the simple organic base aniline. Additional proposed monomers include ethylenedioxythiophene which can be expected to yield a polymer with considerably higher conductivity than polyaniline. Such structures could be useful in constructing nanoscale circuitry and other nanodevices. Conductive fibers (wires) are not the only species sought. Fiber-like inorganic structures can be prepared, for example, by coating TMV with tetraethoxysilane under mild acid conditions to produce long silica/TMV composite fibers. Because the organic and inorganic monomer units can be prepared with a variety of chemical and physical characteristics, one can hope to obtain TMV-templated fibers with desired electrical, optical, or magnetic properties. Binding of monomers to the template may be stabilized by electrostatic, hydrogen-bonded, or other forces, depending on the character of the monomer. The primary focus of the work will be to understand the fundamental factors that govern assembly of various monomer types along the TMV template. Significant attention will also be given to careful characterization of the polymerized nanostructures using microscopy, conductance, X-ray scattering, and nanomechanical measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: An inexpensive, general method for preparing nanofibers and nanowires possessing desired mechanical, chemical, and physical characteristics can be expected to have broad applicability for the construction of various nanodevices. The proposal includes a plan for attracting high school and university students into scientific careers through a week-long Summer Workshop for Bionanoparticle Technology. It also provides a platform for interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate research students.</AbstractNarration>
