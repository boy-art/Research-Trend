    <AbstractNarration>Ghosh&lt;br/&gt;0703392&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This CSUMS project, NCSU CUSP, prepares students to engage&lt;br/&gt;in a significant research experience, and to be fluent in the&lt;br/&gt;languages of computing, mathematics, and statistics. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his colleagues provide inquiry-guided learning&lt;br/&gt;to train undergraduates in exciting new approaches to problems&lt;br/&gt;involving massive datasets or computationally intensive methods. &lt;br/&gt;The program couples extensive coursework in computing for&lt;br/&gt;contemporary statistical analysis with a practicum and research&lt;br/&gt;lab focusing on an area of application such as drug discovery,&lt;br/&gt;pattern recognition, statistical genetics, data assimilation, or&lt;br/&gt;financial risk. The practicum and lab provide scientific&lt;br/&gt;background, an overview of statistical and computational&lt;br/&gt;approaches, training and feedback on teamwork and communication&lt;br/&gt;skills, and a significant mentored research experience. Faculty&lt;br/&gt;members from interdisciplinary teams conducting research in the&lt;br/&gt;areas of data mining, geophysical and environmental data&lt;br/&gt;assimilation, statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Bayesian&lt;br/&gt;hierarchical modeling, financial risk modeling and time series&lt;br/&gt;analysis serve as NCSU CUSP mentors and as co-mentors for&lt;br/&gt;students from neighboring Meredith College. The NCSU CUSP meets&lt;br/&gt;four specific objectives. It (1) prepares students to take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of computing advances and make sophisticated computing&lt;br/&gt;an integral part of the statistical and mathematical methodology&lt;br/&gt;curriculum and research experience; (2) improves students'&lt;br/&gt;non-technical skills, including public speaking and written&lt;br/&gt;communication, working in teams, and ethical reasoning, (3)&lt;br/&gt;provides the research experience to apply initiative and&lt;br/&gt;creativity in developing statistical and computing approaches to&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary scientific problems; and (4) prepares and&lt;br/&gt;motivates a diverse pool of highly qualified students to pursue&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary graduate studies in the mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Aided by rapid advances in technology, massive amounts of&lt;br/&gt;new data are generated daily in many scientific disciplines and&lt;br/&gt;the volumes are growing at a rate unprecedented in human history. &lt;br/&gt;For the US to remain competitive and innovative, a diverse pool&lt;br/&gt;of researchers trained in novel and powerful techniques is&lt;br/&gt;critically needed to illustrate, model, and analyze these&lt;br/&gt;large-sized, high-dimensional, and nonlinearly-structured data. &lt;br/&gt;Building on resources of one of the country's largest statistics&lt;br/&gt;departments, NCSU CUSP becomes one of the first computationally&lt;br/&gt;intensive statistics programs for undergraduates in the nation. &lt;br/&gt;This project leads to development of new computationally&lt;br/&gt;intensive courses and interdisciplinary courses, which will have&lt;br/&gt;a long term impact. The project is also committed at the outset&lt;br/&gt;to increasing diversity in the emerging field of computational&lt;br/&gt;statistics. NCSU CUSP increases awareness of statistical science&lt;br/&gt;among mathematics majors and faculty, fosters greater&lt;br/&gt;collaboration between interdisciplinary programs, and encourages&lt;br/&gt;a diverse pool of well-prepared students to pursue graduate&lt;br/&gt;studies in quantitative sciences. Training in communication&lt;br/&gt;skills helps develop graduates who can bring scientific research&lt;br/&gt;results to the public and policy makers. NCSU CUSP methods and&lt;br/&gt;results are widely publicized to the mathematical science and&lt;br/&gt;computational communities through regional and national&lt;br/&gt;conferences, participation in workshops, a CUSP website, and&lt;br/&gt;published articles. The project is supported by the MPS Division&lt;br/&gt;of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;Activities, and the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>
