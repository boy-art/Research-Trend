    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: Information Mechanisms and Robust Stabilization of Nonlinear, Stochastic Transportation Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yanfeng Ouyang, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of the proposed efforts is to reveal (i) why similar system-level instability problems arise in a variety of complex transportation networks (e.g., car-following traffic and logistics supply chains) and (ii) how to provide and utilize information to improve system stability and collective network behavior. This research will develop a unified framework where the dynamics of different networks are encompassed by overarching mathematical models to evaluate network behaviors and system characteristics. Robust stability analysis tools, stability conditions, and stabilization strategies that account for various nonlinear, stochastic behavioral and operational factors will be created to enrich the understanding of how information provision and utilization may improve network behavior. This work has the potential to bring out commonalities from seemingly unrelated network systems, and integrate their respective modeling approaches to enhance the methodological applicability within different domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research project is expected to provide significant managerial insights and control strategies that hold the promise of stabilizing and improving operations of a variety of transportation networks, which will have a profound impact on the transportation and freight logistics industry with strong economical and societal implications (e.g., reducing congestion and resource consumption). The new integrated analysis framework created through this project will lay a novel foundation for solutions to a wide range of complex problems in diverse scientific fields. This project will lead to new educational practices by the creation, integration, and dissemination of innovative teaching materials such as Internet-based interactive simulation tools. Outreach efforts will continue to be conducted to involve and attract students from underrepresented groups and to stimulate research interests in transportation networks among public and private industry sectors.</AbstractNarration>
