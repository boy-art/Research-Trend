    <AbstractNarration>1. Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;Various issues in quantum information theory will be addressed using a consistent formulation of probabilities in the quantum domain, one not limited to macroscopic events or measurements. One class of problems involves various features of how information can be transferred between spatially separated quantum systems using the resources of entangled states, local quantum operations, and various types of communication channel. These include things like dense coding, unitary operations, and distinguishing different quantum states. A second class of problems involves the construction of quantum error correcting codes for the reliable transmission and storage of quantum information, and a better understanding of the fundamental principles underlying such codes. A third class, not unrelated to the preceding two, involves the fundamental nature of quantum information: in what respects it is different from and in what respects it uses the same principles as ordinary&lt;br/&gt;(Shannon)information theory, and whether such understanding can be useful for&lt;br/&gt;quantitative estimates of the location of quantum information. In addition to the standard methods of probability theory and quantum mechanics, computer simulations will be used to study model systems.&lt;br/&gt;2. Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;The research effort will contribute to the education program at Carnegie-Mellon&lt;br/&gt;University at both the undergraduate and graduate levels through providing research projects for students, including those working towards a PhD. Postdoctoral research associates will have an opportunity to sharpen their skills while participating in this research group, making them more valuable members of the scientific community. Students and postdocs will take part in an ongoing seminar series in quantum information, and occasional courses which address these subjects, both of which attract other scientists and science students living in Pittsburgh. Improvements in teaching quantum mechanics and quantum information will eventually prove beneficial to university students outside Pittsburgh as well as those in this city.</AbstractNarration>
