    <AbstractNarration>Dynamical systems methods have had significant impact on the characterization of a range of phenomena in the natural and engineering sciences. More importantly, predictive models have been formulated that enable high-fidelity prediction of complex dynamical responses of natural or man-made mechanisms and systems. This development has supported a deeper understanding of the workings of nature coupled with active intervention and problem solving that has sustained and advanced human society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the National Science Foundation, a workshop is being held at Cornell University to discuss how dynamical systems can similarly be brought to bear on the cognitive sciences. The workshop features invited speakers and participants from the social, behavioral, cognitive, engineering, and mathematical sciences. Discussions center around the potential for concepts and methods from dynamical systems to shape the research questions and empirical methods asked by cognitive scientists. Benchmark problems and examples from the cognitive sciences are used to help bring clarity and focus to the discussions. The organizers plan to disseminate the results of the workshop by means of an edited volume and a journal article, both designed to reach a broad audience of scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
