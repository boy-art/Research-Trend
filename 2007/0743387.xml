    <AbstractNarration>Wetlands have long been recognized as significant habitats where organic matter and other materials are stored and transformed. While their quantitative importance is well-established, it is less clear why certain wetlands carry out these functions to a greater degree than others. This research will test the idea that the actual location and configuration of patches of vegetation within tidal wetlands influences the extent of alteration in water quality. In the simplest case, patches closest to the actual point where water exchanges between the wetlands and the mainstem Hudson River should have the greatest effect on concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nutrients. In contrast, patches at higher elevation are less frequently inundated by tides and therefore should have less influence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wetlands are rigorously protected by law and frequently the target of restoration efforts to improve the services they provide to wildlife, water quality and human society. Prioritization of protection efforts and design of restoration plans presupposes a solid knowledge of what factors control how well these ecosystems perform these functions. This research addresses such controls and will directly involve teachers and employees of resource management agencies in both field work and data analysis. This real-world experience should improve the ability of teachers to prepare lessons illustrating ecological principles and give managers a firm rationale for protecting these valuable ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>
