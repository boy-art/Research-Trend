    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation will support the research program of Professor Francisco Zaera at the University of California, Riverside. Dr. Zaera and his students will develop a molecular-level understanding of the factors that make changes in the structure of heterogeneous catalyst translate into changes in catalytic selectivity and to advance new synthetic methodology for the preparation of well-defined catalysts to take advantage of this structure-performance correlation. To accomplish these goals, surface-science studies will be carried out on systems of increased complexity, starting with single-crystal model systems under vacuum and evolving to incorporate the use of high gas fluxes and supported particles. Synthetic methodology based on colloidal and self-assembly chemistry will be developed for the production of supported catalysts with well-defined metal particle sizes and shapes to optimize selectivity in specific olefin isomerization processes. The studies will involve the participation of both graduate and undergraduate students. Collaborations with Latin American research groups will be forged, and student participation from underrepresented groups in research will be strongly pursued.</AbstractNarration>
