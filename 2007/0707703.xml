    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Karen Leighly will undertake a comprehensive program designed to determine the physical conditions in the low-ionization line-emitting gas in Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars. Understanding the low-ionization line-emitting gas is important because it emits the hydrogen, iron and magnesium lines whose ratios are used for metallicity estimates, and whose velocity widths are used for black hole mass estimates. The research leverages large uniformly-selected samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, carefully-targeted new observations, new perspectives combined with large-scale photoionization modeling, and a state-of-the-art spectral synthesis model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Leighly will conduct Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) activities through guided student research, mentor senior thesis students, develop freshman seminars, and train undergraduate students in astronomical research using telescopes. She will participate in the Oklahoma University speaker series, giving public lectures throughout the state.</AbstractNarration>
