    <AbstractNarration>AST-0707417&lt;br/&gt;Mulchaey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most galaxies in the Universe, including our own Milky Way, are members of poor groups. Previous optical studies of X-ray selected groups have revealed strong correlations between the global group properties and the presence or absence of X-ray emission, but those samples were biased towards X-ray luminous systems. This project is the first detailed optical and X-ray study of an unbiased sample of nearby, ideally more typical, groups. The 25-member sample has been carefully selected to be representative of groups in general. Each group is being observed with the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) wide-field multi-object spectrograph on the Magellan I telescope in Chile, in order to determine group membership, derive the star formation properties of group galaxies, estimate the fraction of active galactic nuclei, determine the luminosity function, and calculate global kinematic properties. Each group is also being observed by the X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) satellite to determine the properties of the hot intra-group medium. Combining these complementary observations will allow a complete census of the properties of nearby groups, for comparison to existing high-redshift samples, to study how the properties of group galaxies evolve in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data obtained by this research will be incorporated into the Discovery Project. This innovative educational resource created by the principal investigator comprises the creation of a classroom dedicated solely to science, and a web-based curriculum using the many existing astronomy-based educational activities. . The goal of the Discovery Project is to inspire academically challenged students to understand the role of science in their life. The research will directly involve undergraduate students, targeting traditionally under-represented groups, as has been done effectively before. The researcher is also the primary scientific driver for Carnegie's new public lecture series, and will be adding pre-lecture talks for elementary and middle school students to the main lecture intended for adults.</AbstractNarration>
