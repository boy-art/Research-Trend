    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the proposal is to collect and quantify black carbon colloids&lt;br/&gt;(BC) in water samples from Lake Tahoe and Fallen Leaf Lake in the wake of the Lake&lt;br/&gt;Tahoe basin Angora fire. The sampling program will collect near-shore, mid-lake and&lt;br/&gt;outlet river samples from Fallen Leaf Lake and Lake Tahoe. In addition to sampling&lt;br/&gt;conducted by the project, we will leverage pre-existing sampling programs such as the&lt;br/&gt;UC-Davis Mid-Lake Tahoe Profile (MLTP), which collects depth profiles from the lake&lt;br/&gt;every 30 days. A proposal will be submitted in December to the NSF Hydrologic&lt;br/&gt;Sciences to interpret the data resulting from the SGER.&lt;br/&gt;Scientific merit&lt;br/&gt;Little is known regarding black carbon colloids, produced by incomplete&lt;br/&gt;combustion, in aquatic systems. However these nano-particles are now believed to be&lt;br/&gt;an important component of the global carbon cycle, the hydrologic cycle, global&lt;br/&gt;warming, accelerated snow pack and glacier melt, fresh water and marine chemistry and&lt;br/&gt;sediment geochemistry. Recent studies of BC in seawater and marine sediments&lt;br/&gt;suggest that BC may have a very long residence time in the ocean and fresh water&lt;br/&gt;bodies. These particles may also determine the partitioning of many toxic organic&lt;br/&gt;compounds in aquatic ecosystems. To our knowledge there have been no studies of BC&lt;br/&gt;colloids in a lake system following a major fire in its basin.&lt;br/&gt;Objectives&lt;br/&gt;. Collect and analyze BC in water samples from Lake Tahoe and Fallen Leaf Lake&lt;br/&gt;over a two year period after the Angora Fire.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project represents a rare opportunity to study the impact of a fire on BC&lt;br/&gt;colloids and determine how these colloids impact the aquatic environment. The results of&lt;br/&gt;the project may have wide ranging impacts on the global Earth Science Community as&lt;br/&gt;well as the Lake Tahoe community. For example, if the study can establish the&lt;br/&gt;residence time of BC in the lake, we will be able to determine the impact of BC on the&lt;br/&gt;lakes optical properties and chemistry over time. The results from the study may then be&lt;br/&gt;applied to other lakes and rivers. The data will be used by Federal and State&lt;br/&gt;policymakers and local planners to evaluate and implement environmental policy in the&lt;br/&gt;Lake Tahoe area. The project will communicate the results to the Lake Tahoe&lt;br/&gt;stakeholders and scientific community through journal publications and public meetings.</AbstractNarration>
