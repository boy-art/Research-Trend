    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator will simulate solar eruptions based on his recently developed 3D MHD solar active region (AR) evolution model, which is driven by actual observations. The new model has already shown promise in reproducing the non-potential magnetic field evolution of an active region AR8100. He will investigate potential triggers for solar eruptive events using available photospheric measurements, in order to determine the factors contributing to the initiation of a solar eruption. Specifically, the PI plans to study issues related to the magnetic configuration and free magnetic energy of active regions; the effects of magnetic flux emergence and submergence/cancellation on solar eruptions; contributions of energy and helicity flux through the photosphere to the growth of ARs; and the energy threshold for solar eruption. He also will perform a correlative study of the evolution of energy/helicity flux and non-potential magnetic field parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important innovation in the Principal Investigator's new model is the incorporation of actual photospheric measurements. In addition, self-consistent and time-dependent characteristic boundary conditions are fully implemented in the model to correctly input these changing photospheric observations. The PI states that effects caused by sub-photospheric and convective zone dynamics will be directly reflected through the surface boundary conditions, and thus his model will be able to couple the sub-photosphere and the solar corona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graduate student will be supported in this project. The PI will continue his multiple European collaborations, including a 'US-Slovak Space Weather' initiative, which attracts many foreign scientists and graduate students, some of whom eventually come to work in the US. The 'US-Slovak Space Weather' project has held several annual workshops in Europe and has received the support of the NSF Office of International Science &amp; Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>
