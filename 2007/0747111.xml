    <AbstractNarration>Despite significant advances in information theory and its application &lt;br/&gt;to point-to-point communications, a general theory governing optimal &lt;br/&gt;information flow over networks does not yet exist. Except for a few &lt;br/&gt;simple network models, the capacity region of a general memoryless &lt;br/&gt;network remains unknown, due to the complex tradeoff between &lt;br/&gt;competition and cooperation among many nodes in the network. Modern &lt;br/&gt;applications such as sensor networks, peer-to-peer systems, and &lt;br/&gt;distributed storages further bring up a new set of challenging &lt;br/&gt;problems spanning control, estimation, compression, computation,&lt;br/&gt;communication, as well as networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program provides a common set of conceptual, &lt;br/&gt;mathematical, and algorithmic tools for the emerging convergence of &lt;br/&gt;computation, control, and communication over networks, with the &lt;br/&gt;ultimate goal of developing a unified framework for characterizing &lt;br/&gt;fundamental performance limits of such systems. Towards this goal, we &lt;br/&gt;focus on three concrete problems representing the intersection of &lt;br/&gt;computation, control, and communication -- 1) the capacity of the &lt;br/&gt;relay channel (how to summarize the relay's noisy observation of the&lt;br/&gt;codeword: a list intersection technique via coding for distributed &lt;br/&gt;computing), 2) networked control (how to summarize the observation to &lt;br/&gt;stabilize a linear dynamical system: a variant of rate distortion &lt;br/&gt;coding for control), 3) collision avoidance for multiple access (how &lt;br/&gt;to build cooperation from a common source of randomness: a distributed &lt;br/&gt;generation of correlated random variables). Novel coding schemes will &lt;br/&gt;be proposed, while classical coding techniques will be reinterpreted &lt;br/&gt;and extended to broader applications. An algebraic framework for &lt;br/&gt;capacity regions is also developed to check the optimality of such &lt;br/&gt;coding schemes. The research program is complemented by educational &lt;br/&gt;activities that include the curriculum development for a graduate &lt;br/&gt;course on network information theory and the writing of an accompanied &lt;br/&gt;textbook.</AbstractNarration>
