    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Elena M. Kramer&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #IOS-0720240&lt;br/&gt;Modification of the ABC Program and the Evolution of Floral Novelty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One major question being addressed by evolutionary developmental biology is the genetic basis of morphological innovation: how do new traits arise? In the flowering plants, this can be investigated in the context of new types of floral organs. While most flowers exhibit only sepals, petals, stamens and carpels, some plants produce more than four types of floral organs. Also, over the course of evolution, many unusual organ elaborations have arisen that are important for diversification in specific plant groups. Work supported by this proposal focuses on Aquilegia (columbine) whose flowers exhibit three main innovative features: morphologically distinct, showy sepals; spurred petals with nectaries; and the presence of a completely novel fifth organ type, called staminodia, positioned between the stamens and carpels. Molecular genetic approaches will be used to specifically eliminate the function of genes that appear to be involved in differentiating between these novel floral organs. In addition, genomic techniques will facilitate the identification of unknown genes that are involved in the development of features such as nectar spurs or staminodia. This research has the potential to advance our understanding of both the conservation of the genetic pathways that control floral development and the mechanisms by which these pathways have been modified over evolutionary time. Ultimately, the experiments described here will lay the foundation for a global approach to studying the evolution of novel floral organ identity programs. Training will be provided to a post-doctoral fellow and both graduate and undergraduate students will be recruited to work on the project. The PI is an active participant in undergraduate research training programs and is involved in a new program for academically talented high school students from financially disadvantaged backgrounds, who will also have the opportunity to participate in the project.</AbstractNarration>
