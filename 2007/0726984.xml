    <AbstractNarration>The PIs propose to develop a benthic tripod equipped with sensors to measure total benthic oxygen exchange by eddy-correlation, and diffusive benthic oxygen exchange and sediment oxygen penetration depth by microprofiling. A high resolution digital camera will provide time-series images of the sediment surface area that contributes to the flux. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new system for measuring Benthic OXygen Exchange Rate (BOXER) will be utilized in a completely autonomous mode during this project but will also be designed to receive power and transmit data if connected through cables to a benthic node of a coastal observatory. BOXER measurements will be performed at least seasonally between July 2008 and December 2009, but also over shorter time-scales during parts of the year. By coordinating these measurements with a network of other oceanographic observations and field programs, The PIs will address the hypothesis that benthic exchange rates are temporally variable and controlled predictably by forcing events such as the spring transition (wind) and onset of plankton blooms associated with upwelling events (carbon flux). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combined measurements proposed here and the connection to and collaboration with other projects focusing on the Oregon Continental Shelf will provide new valuable information on the oxygen and carbon exchange dynamics for the Shelf. This work represent a pioneering effort in adapting eddy-correlation to long term monitoring facilities, which is the only way to get in depth insight on seasonal element cycling in these important environments. The project has high potential to serve as a platform for education and training of students. The PI has an excellent track record of training excellent scientists. Hosting REU students and integrating some of this work into a marine technology class nicely compliment the standard graduate training.</AbstractNarration>
