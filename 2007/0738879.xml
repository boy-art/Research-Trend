    <AbstractNarration>The rise of the Tibetan plateau has profoundly changed the Earth's atmospheric&lt;br/&gt;circulation and climate. For this reason, it has been the prime site to understand the link&lt;br/&gt;between tectonics and climate change as well as the processes of continental collision.&lt;br/&gt;There are several competing hypotheses for the rise of the Tibetan plateau: a rapid and&lt;br/&gt;broad increase in the elevation of the plateau, an expansion of the plateau by&lt;br/&gt;continuous viscous flow of lower crust, or an expansion of the plateau by sequential and&lt;br/&gt;localized shear between coherent crust and mantle blocks. At the center of the&lt;br/&gt;competing scenarios is the question whether the plateau has grown upward en masse&lt;br/&gt;or outward over time. The best place to address this question is the northeast Tibetan&lt;br/&gt;plateau, where the plateau is at a nascent stage with features and dynamic processes&lt;br/&gt;in the crust and shallow mantle that are keys to the understanding of the mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;that may have operated for the entire Tibetan plateau.&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between U.S. and Chinese institutions acquires seismic data&lt;br/&gt;from the northeast Tibetan plateau. The research includes detailed studies to image the&lt;br/&gt;crust and mantle structures in the region, to test the current hypotheses against seismic&lt;br/&gt;observations, and to develop new models that integrate seismic observations and other&lt;br/&gt;geological constraints. The research also includes focused studies to analyze regional&lt;br/&gt;earthquake activity, which helps to mitigate earthquake hazards in one of the&lt;br/&gt;seismically most active areas in the interior of a continental plate.</AbstractNarration>
