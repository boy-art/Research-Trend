    <AbstractNarration>EEC-0755355&lt;br/&gt;Dugan Um&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two year REU site program will provide a research experience for undergraduate students who are interested in mechanical, manufacturing, industrial, or materials engineering with an emphasis in micro-manufacturing systems. Primary research activities will focus in the areas of micro/nano electro-mechanical system material and structure, micro sensor/actuator system and design, feedback control system for rapid assembly system, and micro-robotic arm kinematics/dynamics and motion control. To enhance the hands-on laboratory research experience, a variety of additional activities are included in the program. These include: a series of informative seminars; field trips; and social events designed to foster group cohesiveness as well as to hone the students' leadership skills. Students will also sharpen their communication skills through the writing of a research report and through presenting their research work to industry members of the manufacturing system consortium in the Central Texas area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will target women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities. The program intends to have more than 80% of the participants come from institutions that offer only undergraduate programs. Students who participate in this REU program will not only contribute to the development of micro-manufacturing technology, but they will be more likely to remain in a technical field. Successful development of micro-manufacturing systems opens endless application opportunities in homeland security, transportation, aerospace, biomedical, advanced manufacturing, and many other commercial applications.</AbstractNarration>
