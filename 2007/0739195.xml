    <AbstractNarration>This project is concerned with the research and teaching of the&lt;br/&gt;mathematics of stochastic analysis, motivated by a number of timely&lt;br/&gt;application areas. These applications, among them financial&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, telecommunications, risk measure analysis, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;queuing systems, and green-house gas emissions, are key to attracting&lt;br/&gt;young talent towards stochastic analysis, which is an area that has&lt;br/&gt;been rewarded with a number of major mathematical prizes in the past&lt;br/&gt;two years. Some of the technical issues arising from the problems&lt;br/&gt;studied here are: analysis of very heavy tailed distributions;&lt;br/&gt;stochastic partial differential equations; multiscale asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;approximations for jump processes; convex analysis for set-valued&lt;br/&gt;functions; limit theorems for time-changed Poisson process models of&lt;br/&gt;Markovian service networks. Tools of stochastic analysis are becoming&lt;br/&gt;crucial for a core applied mathematics training, and this RTG aims to&lt;br/&gt;train a number of the future trainers, as well as practitioners of the&lt;br/&gt;skills, with rigorous foundations in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expertise in probability, the mathematics of uncertainty, is in great&lt;br/&gt;demand in the US: university mathematics departments and applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics programs, operation and risk management, financial&lt;br/&gt;regulatory and public policy offices, bio-engineering, and the&lt;br/&gt;telecommunications industry. The initiatives of this project are&lt;br/&gt;designed to attract talented US students to graduate degrees, as well&lt;br/&gt;as postdoc positions and beyond. The RTG's educational emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;mathematical methodology means that we will train people with broadly&lt;br/&gt;applicable technical skills that may later be applied in vastly&lt;br/&gt;different contexts as demands and trends in the workplace evolve. In&lt;br/&gt;financial markets, for example, poor regulation and a lack of&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the risks involved, have contributed to wide-ranging&lt;br/&gt;crises, such as that triggered by the subprime mortgage debacle in&lt;br/&gt;Summer 2007, threatening more and more retirement and endowment funds&lt;br/&gt;and public savings every day. We need to stop this run-away train. An&lt;br/&gt;ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to this effort by&lt;br/&gt;developing new tools and strategies to educate the future scientists,&lt;br/&gt;policy makers and regulators, and potential investors about the risks&lt;br/&gt;and the mathematical language for their description and control. By&lt;br/&gt;focusing on forms of risk which have traditionally remained off the&lt;br/&gt;radar screen of educators and practitioners, e.g. operational risk, we&lt;br/&gt;will raise the level of awareness and make sound controls possible.</AbstractNarration>
