    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to synthesize new materials consisting of alkali or alkaline earth metals, transition metals, and chalcogens such as sulfur or selenium through ion exchange (from mono- and divalent halide salts as well as molten organic acids), reductive and oxidative intercalation/deintercalation (both chemical and electrochemical), and novel methods that will induce exfoliation, all to be completed under inert conditions. This work feeds into ongoing collaborations to explore the activity of these materials as catalysts for photo-oxidation and hydrodesulfurization. In addition, a central component of this project is the development of methods to increase the awareness and appreciation of solid state chemistry in both the undergraduate curriculum and in the community. Undergraduate students will be employed to spearhead a "family science night" at local schools involving the use of interactive experiments to promote the importance of solid materials. Courses in the chemistry curriculum will additionally be modified to incorporate new equipment and resources highlighting innovations in solid state chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sulfur and selenium-based materials are extremely important as catalysts, semiconductors, and optical materials. These compounds, known as chalcogenides, have unique structural properties which make them interesting candidates as reactants for chemical synthesis. We will pursue strategies to predictably synthesize new materials from interesting starting compounds, such as potassium-nickel-sulfides (K2Ni3S4, for example) using a catalog of mild chemical techniques. This work feeds into ongoing collaborations to explore the activity of these materials as catalysts for environmentally important applications such as the removal of sulfur impurities from fuels. In addition, a central component of this project is the development of methods to increase the awareness and appreciation of chemistry in both the college curriculum and in the community. Undergraduate students will be employed to spearhead a "family science night" at local schools using interactive chemistry experiments to remind children that science is fun, fascinating, and exciting. Additionally, underrepresented minority students at local community colleges will be recruited to begin undergraduate research at a university setting through a coupling with an existing Senior Discovery Corps program. Courses in the chemistry curriculum will likewise be modified to incorporate new equipment and resources highlighting innovations in solid materials study.</AbstractNarration>
