    <AbstractNarration>This project is a travel grant to support travel by 25 US student researchers to the premier international conference on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The Sixth International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems (AAMAS' 07) will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii between May 14 and May 18, 2007. In addition to the main technical program, the conference includes an energetic workshop program and several tutorials by leading agent researchers. There is also a co-located doctoral mentoring program. This is a significant event in the important field of multi-agent systems which will help shape the future of agent-based computing, and this funding ensures that the US is well represented by our graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
