    <AbstractNarration>0754802&lt;br/&gt;Qiao&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is focused on a novel approach of energy harvesting, which can generate useful electricity from ambient environment (e.g. body temperature, solar thermal energy, geothermal energy, temperature gradients between ground/water and ground/air, etc.). This technique is fundamentally different from conventional methods of direct thermoelectric energy conversion, which is usually based on the Seebeck effect. It helps to solve the thermal shorting problem that limits the energy conversion efficiency; that is, in addition to the energy conversion, heat conduction also causes a significant thermal energy loss. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, nanoporous materials will be employed as large-surface-area electrodes. If two nanoporous electrodes are placed at different temperatures, they absorb different amounts of ions, generating a net output voltage. The thermally driven ion motion into or out of nanopores causes a transient current in the solid phase. The preliminary experimental data have shown encouraging results. The output voltage/power and the energy conversion efficiency are higher than that of conventional thermoelectric materials by orders of magnitude. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the development of advanced energy conversion techniques, this study will also shed light on fundamental mechanisms of ion motion in nanoenvironment, which is critical to the studies on microtransportation, energy storage, nanomaterials processing, etc. These efforts will promote the application of nanoporous technology in new areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will also provide an important support to the author's pedagogical efforts. Video of experiments and visualized computer simulation modules will be used in a number of undergraduate and graduate courses, having considerable impact on the curriculum. Female students and under-represented minorities will be encouraged to attend the seminars and take the courses. Graduate students will be actively involved in the project and acquire comprehensive hands-on research experience.</AbstractNarration>
