    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0725382&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Computer Go -- A Proxy for Key Open Challenges and Opportunities in Computational Intelligence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Wunsch, Donald C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: University of Missouri-Rolla&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to illuminate and narrow the differences between computer and human capabilities by making a 9x9 Go player, and creating the groundwork for a 19 x 19 player. &lt;br/&gt;The approach is to:&lt;br/&gt; Combine Simultaneous Recurrent Networks with Cellular Neural Networks, and train them via Reinforcement Learning, to analyze influence functions;&lt;br/&gt; Create Neurofuzzy rules for known patterns;&lt;br/&gt; Compare approaches to move filtering;&lt;br/&gt; Develop improved tactical analysis;&lt;br/&gt; Bootstrap endgame techniques backwards;&lt;br/&gt; Develop optimized hardware;&lt;br/&gt; Perform outreach.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is:&lt;br/&gt; Go is much harder than Chess and its solution offers more to science. Its subtleties mirror core issues in learning.&lt;br/&gt; Creative and original concepts are proposed, as outlined in the approach section above.&lt;br/&gt; The PI and Co-PI have been collaborators since 1998, and both have significant research track records in many synergistic projects.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research are:&lt;br/&gt; Improved heuristics for cutting through combinatorial complexity.&lt;br/&gt; Creating stronger links between learning architectures and improving their training.&lt;br/&gt; Contributions to related applications:&lt;br/&gt;Economics, &lt;br/&gt;Security Applications, &lt;br/&gt;Sensor networks,&lt;br/&gt;Embedded systems,&lt;br/&gt;Biologically-inspired applications, &lt;br/&gt; K-12, international, and underrepresented groups outreach.&lt;br/&gt; The dissemination of results will be superior, due to the availability of Go rules and data.&lt;br/&gt; The project will benefit society, through an improved ability to automate strategic analysis, through better tools, and through an improved workforce.</AbstractNarration>
