    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-0725433&lt;br/&gt;Spong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project encompasses a range of issues involving not only autonomous agents but also human-in-the-loop systems. Although there have been considerable advances in control of autonomous robots in recent years, in practice, even a single unmanned vehicle typically requires a team of humans on the ground to monitor and control the mission. Our research is aimed at reversing this ratio so that a smaller number of humans can control a larger network of agents. Our research will contribute to the fundamental understanding of such networked robotic systems that must operate in complex, unstructured environments and communication over possibly unreliable communication networks with one another and over a distance with human operators. This research will integrate communication, control, and computing in ways that will both increase the level of autonomy possible in robot networks and the ability of humans and robots to work together in complex tasks. Robustness in such complex systems cannot be achieved by robustness guarantees for individual components alone but requires new solutions to many interdisciplinary research problems, such as stability and transparency in human-robot interaction, control over unreliable communication networks, and sensor-based control of multi-agent systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed here will impact numerous future technologies, such as telemedicine, including improved tele-surgical systems, technologies to assist first responders at accident scenes, search and rescue applications, and remote scientific studies of many kinds, such as experiments conducted in undersea environments, rain forest environments, or arctic environments. Remote construction, remote cleanup of hazardous environments,land mine search and remote deactivation, are just a few of the numerous applications that can result from semi-autonomous human/robot interaction. &lt;br/&gt;The laboratory component of the project will also attract and enable a significant number of undergraduate students to become involved in the research.</AbstractNarration>
