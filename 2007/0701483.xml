    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. George W. Flynn of Columbia University and his postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) to study: two-dimensional self-assembly at surfaces, the electronic and chemical properties of two-dimensional carbon (graphene) sheets and the chemistry taking place at environmentally important iron oxide surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this wide-reaching program, Prof. Flynn and his colleagues will use scanning tunneling methods -- both microscopy and spectroscopy -- to examine the molecular level details of a variety of systems. They will examine how molecules self-assemble into patterns on surfaces -- the ability to understand the mechanisms of this behavior will help others learn how to design and assemble molecular-level devices. They will examine how organic pollutants degrade on the surface of iron oxide surfaces, in order to develop better strategies for understanding and remediating the effects of subsurface soil pollution. Finally, studies of the fascinating material graphene will be conducted to begin to learn about this nanoscopic carbon material''s chemical and physical properties. Besides the possible societal benefits accruing from the research supported in this award, Prof. Flynn will continue with his many outreach and service activities.</AbstractNarration>
