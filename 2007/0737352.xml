    <AbstractNarration>Assessment/Research (91)&lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This project is engaging science and education researchers in developing a new framework for teaching science to non-majors, with the ultimate objective of enhancing public understanding of science. The major objective is to assess whether teaching the process of scientific inquiry and the nature of science improves understanding of both scientific content and reasoning. This assessment is being undertaken in the context of a new, multidisciplinary course designed for students not majoring in STEM at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The course examines five big ideas in science, each representing a major paradigm shift in science: helio-centrism, plate tectonics, radioactivity, evolution, and global climate change. The course is designed to explicitly weave together scientific content, development of the necessary scientific skills, processes of scientific inquiry, and the nature of science. It is anticipated that this project will contribute valuable advances to the instructionally challenging notion of scientific reasoning. Student learning is being measured in this context. The results may illuminate useful ways to revision and restructure approaches to teaching science. The project is also developing a lab manual, instructional materials, and a related web site to facilitate dissemination. The course itself is intended in particular for students interested in majoring in elementary education. The curriculum and embedded assessments being developed will be transferable to other contexts at the University of Wisconsin and other institutions. A parallel course is being developed that brings together graduate students in the disciplinary sciences and science education to develop and test instructional materials for this general science course.</AbstractNarration>
