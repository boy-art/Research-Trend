    <AbstractNarration>Knowledge-guided NURBS for Robust Engineering Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to investigate knowledge-guided NURBS to enhance the robustness, the reliability and the compatibility of engineering design systems. As product and process design becomes more knowledge intensive and collaborative, it is necessary to provide as much information as possible to assist designers who work in geographically diverse locations separated by cultural boundaries. Errors in engineering design often occur due to the inability to share complete design information, including geometry, across various CAD systems. This research will result in a NURBS-based modeling environment that will facilitate robust and seamless knowledge and data transfer. The goal will be to embed design knowledge directly into the geometric model and use it throughout the design process. Design intent will be captured at the lowest level of geometry construction and incorporated into the model?s knowledge base. The robustness of CAD systems will be enhanced by providing knowledge support to computational algorithms that work with knowledge types instead of data types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When successful, a new design paradigm, called knowledge-guided NURBS, will be introduced to the design community. This research will result in improved support for collaborative design with seamless data transfer at all levels, from process to process, and systems to system. The methods will change the way engineering design and communication between design systems are performed, and achieve a significantly higher level of reliability of engineering design systems across a range of applications. The research findings will be integrated into curricula and disseminated through archival publications and presentations at technical meetings. Close collaboration with industry will provide continued research guidance and validation of the results throughout the grant period. Summer programs for high school seniors and guest lectures to neighboring high schools will provide the opportunity for dissemination to diverse student groups.</AbstractNarration>
