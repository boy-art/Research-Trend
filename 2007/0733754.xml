    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This project is producing four books aimed at fostering and deepening the interest of young women in science. The books should also attract a broad general audience, for whom science may seem either too difficult or "scary." The Feminist Press at CUNY is teaming with the Graduate Center at the City University of New York, which offers strong connections to academic research and to professional scientists and science societies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on information collected through surveys and focus groups representative of the target audience, and through consultations with scientists, librarians, book publishers, teachers, science writers, and parents, this effort to produce literary books about the work of women scientists could very effectively attract young women, and even young men to science fields. Girls identify with and prefer to read about female protagonists, yet there are relatively few accounts of the work and lives of female scientists. Students in focus groups were hard-pressed to name a woman scientist. They are interested in careers that serve society, yet they do not perceive science as a potent path for contribution, because they are unfamiliar with the work of scientists. The book series stemming from this project will offer specific and creative ideas for books in various forms of fiction, nonfiction, and manga (graphic novel). The target content, genres, and style are based on an extensive review of research literature, a survey of the book market, feedback from our target readers, and a conference of experts. The books will contribute to and compliment other informal education venues that promote science and engineering emphasizing engagement and entertainment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Engaging stories about the work of women in science designed for the interests of girls will counter typical stereotypes and portrayals of science as a male profession. They will show the realities of women and men working together in science today and thereby make the presence of women in science normative rather than exceptional. They will also improve science literacy by explaining and featuring the work of scientists. In addition to books, teachers' and parents' guides are being produced to help them positively influence girls' educational and career choices. The project will encourage the development of interest in and passion for work in science, thus building future human capital for the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes multi-layered plans for outreach and distribution. In partnership with a wide array of networks, the Feminist Press is working with established trade book and academic distributors. The books will also be marketed through national and regional organizations serving young women, including many specializing in science education, and the New York City high school, college, and library system.</AbstractNarration>
