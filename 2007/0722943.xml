    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS 07-22943&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Okamura, Allison M.&lt;br/&gt; Cowan, Noah J.; Hager, Gregory D.; Kazanzides, Peter.; Taylor, Russell H/&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Johns Hopkins University &lt;br/&gt; Baltimore, MD 21218-8268&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI/Dev.: Infrastructure for Integrated Sensing, Modeling, and Manipulation with Robotic and Human-Machine Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project, developing infrastructure for sensorimotor integration that fosters new studies and enhances existing work in the area of manipulation for robotics and human-machine systems, aims to offer a publicly available systems framework, including software, mechatronics, and integrated hardware. Enforcing a general development approach that can be easily extended to other robotic and human-machine applications, two complementary robotics platforms will built addressing two different application domains: a&lt;br/&gt;. Bimanual dexterous manipulation system with integrated environment sensing and the capability for modeling rigid objects commonly found in human environments, and&lt;br/&gt;. Teleoperated surgical robotic system with integrated sensors that can acquire patient-specific deformable tissue models.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, via the project's website, dissemination is planned for:&lt;br/&gt;. Open-source software for real-time system control and sensor/model/manipulation/display integration;&lt;br/&gt;. Design of a complementary mechatronic firewire controller board that includes A/D, D/A, encoders, amplifiers, and low-level control capabilities via FPGS, and&lt;br/&gt;. Detailed descriptions of hardware integration, including WAM arms, Barrett hands, a tactile sensing suite from Pressure Profile Systems, surgical robots, cameras, ultrasound, OCT, a vision-based tracking system, visual and haptic displays, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Integrated robotic systems that fuse multimodal sensory information to enhance models and manipulate the environment positively impact human lives, particularly in health care, safety, and human assistance. The research also impacts related disciplines, including neuroscience, rehabilitation, and surgery. Researchers will have access to open software and designs. The platforms clearly impact education, people at many career stages, from high school students to senior faculty. The system, and detailed directions on how to produce it, will be made available. The design framework will be used in undergraduate classes in conjunction with existing educational hardware; experimental platforms will be used for course projects. Visiting students and faculty (including WISE girls) will make positive use of the integrated testbeds. There is an ongoing collaboration with Morgan State U. Involving REU and RET participants, outreach is well planned. The dissemination plan includes an active web site; the software will be made available via open-source repository. Furthermore, the website documents all hardware and respective vendors.</AbstractNarration>
