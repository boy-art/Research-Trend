    <AbstractNarration>Berlyand&lt;br/&gt;0708324&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator works on the theoretical development and&lt;br/&gt;applications of homogenization theory. This theory deals with&lt;br/&gt;the properties of heterogeneous materials, which are of critical&lt;br/&gt;importance for modern technology. Modeling of such materials&lt;br/&gt;raises fundamental mathematical questions, primarily in partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations and Calculus of Variations. The project&lt;br/&gt;focuses on two areas, with homogenization and multiscale analysis&lt;br/&gt;as their common themes. &lt;br/&gt; Area A. Ginzburg-Landau models: homogenization, well-posedness,&lt;br/&gt;and near-boundary vortices. Vortices of the minimizers of the&lt;br/&gt;Ginzburg-Landau energy functional capture essential features of&lt;br/&gt;superconductors and superfluids. They have many common features&lt;br/&gt;with vortices in fluids, defects in liquid crystals, dislocations&lt;br/&gt;in solids, etc. The investigator studies the homogenization and&lt;br/&gt;rise of a special type of near-boundary vortex for the&lt;br/&gt;Ginzburg-Landau functional in the class of maps with the degree&lt;br/&gt;(winding number) prescribed on the boundary of a&lt;br/&gt;multiply-connected domain. In this problem, he establishes novel&lt;br/&gt;local minimizers that have near-boundary vortices with bounded&lt;br/&gt;energy. &lt;br/&gt; Area B. Homogenization of an elasticity problem with many&lt;br/&gt;nonseparated scales and the Cauchy-Born rule. Homogenization&lt;br/&gt;(upscaling) in the presence of many nonseparated spatial scales&lt;br/&gt;is far from understood from a mathematical standpoint and it&lt;br/&gt;arises in the study of turbulence, soils, biological tissues,&lt;br/&gt;etc. The investigator studies such a problem for elasticity&lt;br/&gt;equations and constructs an approximate (upscaled) solution&lt;br/&gt;belonging to a finite-dimensional functional space. The&lt;br/&gt;classical Cauchy-Born rule is a postulate that allows the passage&lt;br/&gt;from atomistic to continuum models in monoatomic crystals. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator uses the above approximate solution to derive a&lt;br/&gt;generalized Cauchy-Born rule for strongly heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator focuses on the development of novel&lt;br/&gt;techniques of applied analysis to address the needs of modern&lt;br/&gt;technology. The Ginzburg-Landau equations arose in modeling&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity but have wider implications. In this project,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator's work on this topic has potential applications&lt;br/&gt;in the design of superconducting materials (which at certain&lt;br/&gt;temperatures conduct electric current with no resistance) and&lt;br/&gt;ferromagnetic materials. Additionally it addresses the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of vortex behavior, which is one of the major&lt;br/&gt;challenges for the science of superconductivity and its&lt;br/&gt;technological applications. For the second topic, homogenization&lt;br/&gt;of elasticity problems with nonseparated scales, he aims to&lt;br/&gt;develop novel, efficient computational tools suitable for&lt;br/&gt;modeling strongly heterogeneous (disordered) materials, both&lt;br/&gt;natural and man-made. In particular, the issue of elastic&lt;br/&gt;"cloaking," when a portion of a geological medium is shielded&lt;br/&gt;from elastic waves, is addressed. Advances here could help in&lt;br/&gt;the design of earthquake-proofed buildings.</AbstractNarration>
