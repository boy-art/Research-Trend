    <AbstractNarration>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is now able to explore the sky in a whole new way, poised to detect extremely tiny ripples in the geometry of spacetime that are generated by distant astrophysical objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and supernovas. A new "science run" in 2009-2010, coordinated with the French-Italian VIRGO detector, will provide the most sensitive data yet to be searched for gravitational wave signals. This project connects the gravitational-wave detection effort with mainstream astronomy by carrying out gravitational-wave burst searches and by leading a campaign of prompt optical telescope (and potentially X-ray and radio telescope) follow-up observations of gravitational-wave burst candidates during the 2009-2010 science run. In addition, it supports data quality diagnostics and an end-to-end test system using simulated signals in the detectors, in preparation for establishing the validity of any gravitational-wave signal that is detected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project helps to maximize NSF's investment in LIGO by increasing the chance of detecting a distinct gravitational-wave signal in the 2009-2010 science run. A prompt optical transient, associated with a gravitational-wave burst candidate, would help establish the reality of the gravitational-wave signal and also provide valuable additional information about its source. Developing and exercising this capability now prepares for the future, when Advanced LIGO will detect gravitational-wave signals regularly that can be connected to astronomical observations. Besides the benefits to astrophysics, this project strengthens international cooperation among gravitational-wave&lt;br/&gt;scientists, builds connections with the optical astronomy community, and contributes to education by providing research experience for students.</AbstractNarration>
