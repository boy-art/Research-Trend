    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding for a Workshop on Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations to take place in Cartagena, Colombia -- July 23-27, 2007. Organized by Dr. Alfonso Castro of Harvey Mudd College and Dr. Jorge Cossio from Universidad Nacional de Colombia, in Medellin, Colombia, the workshop will be part of the VII Americas School in Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis (VII ASDE), an annual conference held in the region. The meeting will cover a variety of topics, from reaction-differential equations to nonlinear partial differential equations, inverse problems, and dynamical systems. The workshop should be a catalyst for future collaboration between U.S. and Latin American researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is expected to attract leading mathematics researchers and students from virtually all the countries in the region. Each participant will present lectures on topics of his/her expertise leading to open questions of current interest. The contacts established at the workshop are expected to lead to future collaboration and opportunities for graduate and postdoctoral students to advance their studies in other countries. This award is being jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>
