    <AbstractNarration>This program is designed to increase the number of talented at risk undergraduate students receiving baccalaureate degrees in Computer Science, Chemistry, Physics, Geology, Earth Science, and Mathematics at Lamar University. At risk students include women and minorities who are underrepresented in science, technology, and mathematics, as well as low income and first generation students who are at risk because of financial burdens and the lack of role models. The goals are to: (1) retain talented at risk students; (2) help transition them into advanced study or careers in science; and (3) attract more students to the field. Strategies include: (1) engaging STAIRSTEP students in an enriched research plan with tutoring, mentoring, and peer support; (2) using institutional relationships to help students bridge to the next level; (3) dispelling misconceptions that discourage participation in science; and (4) engaging STAIRSTEP students in outreach programs for high school students, community college students and university students in general studies or undeclared majors. STAIRSTEP students are applying concepts they learn in class to their research, and their research is in turn incorporated into relevant classes. The program is helping prepare new scientists for the global workforce by having them work in teams that are diverse, including men and women from different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. It is benefiting society by enabling at risk students to attain fulfilling careers in science, which in turn strengthens the field by the infusion of their diverse ideas and perspectives.</AbstractNarration>
