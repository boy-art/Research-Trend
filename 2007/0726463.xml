    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to study some classic problems in &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial and analytic number theory. More precisely, Yu will study &lt;br/&gt;(1) bounds for finite sets of integers satisfying some binary additive &lt;br/&gt;properties, and (2) rank 0 quadratic twists of elliptic curves over the &lt;br/&gt;rationals. The objects in study (1) are the generalized Sidon sets and &lt;br/&gt;additive 2-basis of integers. A new idea is introduced which captures the &lt;br/&gt;concentration of the sumset and the difference set. Along with the classic &lt;br/&gt;methods of discrete Fourier analysis, this new idea results in an &lt;br/&gt;improvement for currently the best upper bounds for the cardinalities of &lt;br/&gt;generalized Sidon sets. This new approach will also be employed to improve &lt;br/&gt;the lower bound for the 2-basis of integers. In study (2), Yu will show &lt;br/&gt;that, for any elliptic curve which posses a 2-isogeny over the rationals, &lt;br/&gt;a positive proportion of its quadratic twists have rank 0; and, for a pair &lt;br/&gt;of elliptic curves over the rationals, there are infinitely many &lt;br/&gt;squarefree integers D such that the quadratic twists of the two curves by &lt;br/&gt;the same D simultaneously have rank 0. To achieve these, techniques such &lt;br/&gt;as the first descent, sieve methods and estimation of character sums will &lt;br/&gt;be applied. Besides, Yu will try to use the similar methods to prove &lt;br/&gt;boundedness of the average rank of the quadratic twists of every elliptic &lt;br/&gt;curve over the rationals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of bounding a (generalized) Sidon set has attracted a lot of &lt;br/&gt;attentions. While an upper bound for a generalized Sidon set has natural &lt;br/&gt;implication in the study of Fourier series from Sidon's work back in &lt;br/&gt;1930's, it is also closely related to some other problems in harmonic &lt;br/&gt;analysis and continuous Ramsey theory. In the first part of this project, &lt;br/&gt;Yu studies the upper bounds for generalized Sidon sets, and use the new idea &lt;br/&gt;involved to study some related problems. In the other part of the project, &lt;br/&gt;Yu is devoted to studying some arithmetic of elliptic curves. Yu will &lt;br/&gt;partially solve a longstanding problem related to the rank of elliptic &lt;br/&gt;curves, and will also study some related problems.</AbstractNarration>
