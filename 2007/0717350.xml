    <AbstractNarration>Ecologists increasingly recognize that individual mechanisms often act (and interact) in concert. This research will employ a powerful approach to evaluate the roles of various mechanisms, both individually and in combination, that allow multiple species to coexist. The study system consists of two specialist parasitoids (parasitic insects that attack eggs) of the harlequin bug. Their approach of integrating laboratory and field experiments with theoretical modeling will provide a means for evaluating multiple mechanisms that influence species coexistence. The factors to be evaluated include variability in resources, temporal variation, developmental rates of species, resource use, species interactions such as competition and predation, and the role of temporal refugia. A model will be developed to assess the mechanisms involved in species coexistence, to generate new predictions, and to generalize to other systems. The results of this research will inform real-world models of biological control and provide insight into our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves training undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates in quantitative and experimental approaches to studying ecology. The ability to integrate theory and data is a crucial skill for the next generation of scientists who will tackle the important ecological and environmental issues that confront the nation. The proposed research will provide this training to young researchers at various career stages, emphasizing strong participation by women and other underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
