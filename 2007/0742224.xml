    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support from the NSF Division of Materials Research for speaker travel to a symposium entitled "Synthesis and Self-Assembly Approaches to Polymer-Inorganic Hybrid Nanoparticles," which will be held at the Spring 2008 American Chemical Society National Meeting in New Orleans, LA (Apr. 6-10th, 2008). This symposium is sponsored by the ACS Division of Polymeric Materials: Science &amp; Engineering (PMSE) The co-organizers of this symposium are the PI (University of Arizona) and Prof. Michael Bockstaller from Carnegie Mellon University. The primary objectives of this symposium are to showcase new research and application directions in the area of polymer-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles and complex materials derived from self-assembly. Leading researchers from academics and industry have been invited to showcase both fundamental and applied concepts in this area. Funds from this proposal will be used for travel support and registration fees for six beginning principal investigators ($500 each). An emphasis on how these hybrid nanoparticle materials are being pursued in applications such as, photovoltaics, solid-state batteries, radiofrequency devices and magnetic storage will implemented into the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;NSF funds are requested for travel and registration fees for six beginning principal investigator speakers in a symposium entitled, "Synthesis and Self-Assembly Approaches to Polymer-Inorganic Hybrid Nanoparticles," which will be held at the Spring 2008 American Chemical Society National Meeting in New Orleans, LA (Apr. 6-10th, 2008). This symposium will be a high profile event sponsored by the ACS Division of Polymeric Materials: Science &amp; Engineering (PMSE) for the presentation of academic and industrial research in the area of hybrid nanoparticle materials chemistry. The talks, posters, and preprints associated with this symposium will be used to educate ACS members and the general scientific public on the relevance of these materials for applications in energy-related technologies and microelectronics. This symposium will also serve as a high visibility forum for beginning investigators, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to participate in and promote their careers.</AbstractNarration>
