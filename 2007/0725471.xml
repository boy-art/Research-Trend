    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sixth International Penguin Conference in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, September&lt;br/&gt;2007 will bring penguin researchers from all over the world to discuss recent research&lt;br/&gt;results. This conference is held once every 3-4 years and is open to persons interested in any aspect of penguin physiology, behavior, genetics, ecology, and conservation. The gathering is particularly important during International Polar Year, as it unites scientists from approximately 15 countries and offers an unparalleled opportunity for U.S. scientists to meet new colleagues and share their work with an international audience. Penguins are global sentinels and attract scientific interest because they provide insights into climate change, over-exploitation of fisheries, and fundamental advances in basic science. Climate change is a particular emphasis area of US IPY. Funding is requested to support U.S. students and young scientists wishing to present their research to the conference. A review committee with broad interests will select the students, to be awarded $2000 each, to help defray their costs. The 2007 International Penguin Conference is the premier international forum focusing on penguin research. Attendance at the meeting will allow these scientists to present their work, make contacts with others in their specific fields of interest, and forge international collaborative research efforts.</AbstractNarration>
