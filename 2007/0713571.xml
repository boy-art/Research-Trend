    <AbstractNarration>Text summarization generates a concise summary of documents to&lt;br/&gt;help a user quickly digest information and has become increasingly important due to the &lt;br/&gt;explosive growth of information. Most existing summarization methods &lt;br/&gt;can only generate an unstructured summary with a simple list of sentences. &lt;br/&gt;In many applications, however, we want to generate a (more structured)&lt;br/&gt;multi-faceted comparative summary, in which sentences are grouped into &lt;br/&gt;multiple facets and compared across different views. For example, a summary about laptop opinions &lt;br/&gt;may group sentences into facets such as ``battery life'' and ``memory'' and separate sentences&lt;br/&gt;with positive and negative opinions in each facet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to systematically study this new summarization problem (called multi-faceted&lt;br/&gt;comparative summarization). The PI will develop general probabilistic approaches that can &lt;br/&gt;be applied to multiple instances of the problem in different domains. &lt;br/&gt;The basic idea is to use probabilistic mixture models to model and extract&lt;br/&gt;the multiple facets and multiple views of each facet in a set of text documents to be summarized.&lt;br/&gt;The extracted facets and views are then used to generate facet labels and select sentences for&lt;br/&gt;different facet-view combinations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will open up a new research direction in text summarization. &lt;br/&gt;The developed methods can be directly applied to provide more useful&lt;br/&gt;product opinion retrieval service on the Web to all people and help scientists in multiple fields&lt;br/&gt;to digest scientific literature more effectively, thus speeding up scientific discovery.&lt;br/&gt;All research resources and results will be disseminated to the research community &lt;br/&gt;through publications and downloadable software and data. The research results will also&lt;br/&gt;enhance the current curriculum in information retrieval, &lt;br/&gt;leading to improved education of the information technology workforce.</AbstractNarration>
