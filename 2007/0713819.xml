    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Profs. Robert L. Vold and Gina Hoatson from the College of William and Mary and their graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will develop models for simulating slow molecular motion to include more realistic motional models, to apply them to experiments that are important for very high magnetic resonance, and to make the dynamic simulation and data fitting procedures easily accessible and freely-available to non-specialists. Parts of this research will also involve collaboration with the X-ray diffraction group of Prof. J. Stezowski at the University of Nebraska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is a powerful technique that allows scientists to determine the structures and motions of molecules in solids. The work of Prof. Vold, Prof. Hoatson and their research colleagues and research students will enable scientists to study a broader range of materials, and to analyze some of the very slow motions that take place in important classes of materials. In addition to the broader scientific impact of the proposed work, the students being trained in this project will be exposed to unique interdisciplinary research. One product from this research will be a set of software programs that the PIs will freely distribute via their website.</AbstractNarration>
