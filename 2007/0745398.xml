    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this CAREER award is to establish a next-generation computational framework for shape optimization of geometrically complex products. Existing methods of shape optimization are typically slow and tedious, and lack robustness, especially when a product is geometrically complex. Product models are therefore geometrically simplified today, prior to optimization, through feature removal. The proposed framework will replace fragile geometric simplification methods with robust and mathematically sound algebraic simplification methods. An adjoint corrector method will be used to avoid errors that appear as a result of simplification. In addition, novel feature sensitivity methods will be explored that will eliminate the need for reanalysis during shape optimization. The proposed framework will be applied and tested against complex artifacts found in the aerospace, automobile and precision machinery industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will have a major impact on industry and society, primarily through the design of highly optimized, less expensive and environmentally friendly products. A wider range of product designs can be explored during the design process which will lead to novel new products. Computationally, this framework will integrate geometric simplification and shape optimization, linking these research areas with the potential for future advances. As a test bed, the results of this research will be used by graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Wisconsin and Wisconsin Technical Colleges to compete in national car design challenges. The research results will also be embedded within the undergraduate curricula through technical elective offerings and expanded student design experiences at both campuses. With support from industry, participating students, especially minority and women, will receive scholarships to complete necessary CAD training and take part in nation-wide competitions.</AbstractNarration>
