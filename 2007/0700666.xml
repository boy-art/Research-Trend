    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this work is to understand the fundamental issues affecting reinforcement efficiency in carbon nanotube reinforced metallic composites. The objectives of the research are to: 1) Develop efficient simulation methods in order to better study the mechanical properties of carbon nanotube reinforced metallic composites; 2) Establish efficient experimental methods to evaluate reinforcement mechanisms and the efficiency of carbon nanotube reinforced metallic composites; 3) Understand important factors that determine mechanical properties of carbon nanotube reinforced metallic composites; 4) Establish relationships between the mechanical strength of carbon nanotube reinforced metallic composites and the factors that influence it. The various research approaches consist of material synthesis, experimental characterization, microstructure characterization, and analytical investigations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metallic materials with strong mechanical strengths are important for developing advanced engineering systems. However, pure metals normally have a low strength. Fibers have been proven efficient to improve metals' strength by forming composites. Carbon nanotubes have proven much stronger than conventional fibers and therefore they are potentially an ideal reinforcement material in developing advanced composites. However, the interfacial bonding between carbon nanotubes and metal matrices, as well as how to best use the miniature size and super high strength associated with carbon nanotubes to realize expected mechanical strength of composites are important issues but they still remain unclear. The proposed work, if successful, will provide guidelines for future, more efficient development of carbon nanotube reinforced metallic composites. In addition, curriculum renovation and workforce production will be realized by involving students to conduct the researched work.</AbstractNarration>
