    <AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports research by Professor John D. Protasiewicz at Case-Western Reserve University to investigate the constituent carbenes (R2C) of conjugated polymers with heavier analogs (such as phosphinidenes, RP) to produce nearly isostructural conjugated materials that are electronically modulated (having E=C and E=E bonds versus C=C bonds). Specific goals include: 1. The development of new and better methodology for high yield synthesis of extended conjugated materials; 2. New monomers for constructing extended systems with greater conjugation and photoluminescent responses; and, 3) Discovery of new extended systems having interesting optical and electronic properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students will receive education and mentoring in organic, inorganic, main group, polymer, and physical chemistry. The PI also mentors high school students in his laboratory, and serves as advisor to local ACS affiliates and student groups.</AbstractNarration>
