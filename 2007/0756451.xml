    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0756451&lt;br/&gt;Papoutsakis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop novel multi-library-based approaches for generating complex phenotypes that would be useful for developing industrially important strains for many bioprocessing applications, such as those currently employed or anticipated in the bioprocessing for the utilization or renewable resources (green technologies) or in bioremediation. In addition, the knowledge generated from this project will make a significant contribution to the basic biology of ethanol tolerance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project?s strategies can be applied to any desirable organism and bioprocessing application whereby a selectable complex phenotype is desirable, and especially processes for the utilization of renewable resources. The importance of efficient and economically viable technologies for production of chemicals &amp; biofuels from renewable resources has become an urgent national and international priority over the last few months. This was driven by several important facts. First, the depletion of non-renewable energy sources, such as oil, coupled with increased energy demand driven by fast developing economies and world population has led to high oil and energy prices. And a second important fact is the realization that non-renewable fossil fuels lead to significant climatic changes that may lead to catastrophic weather-pattern changes. In contrast, biomass is a carbon-neutral renewable resource for production of biofuels and chemicals. Finally, this project provides unique opportunities for student education and training in experimental genomics, and associated high-throughput technologies.</AbstractNarration>
