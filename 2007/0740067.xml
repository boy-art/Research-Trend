    <AbstractNarration>A great deal of funding and effort has been applied over the last several years to deploy cutting edge networked information technologies to support emergency services at local to national levels. An important and open question is: do such technical systems actually work as promised when they are deployed within real organizations and in real emergency circumstances? This proposal will support a one-day workshop to address this issue. To give a consistent structure to the workshop, a set of cases will be developed to evaluate and characterize several existing systems. Approximately 25 academic experts and emergency services government practitioners will attend. In addition to the cases, a workshop report will be developed and distributed nationally.</AbstractNarration>
