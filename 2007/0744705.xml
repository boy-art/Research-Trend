    <AbstractNarration>PI Name: Thomas P. Coombs-Hahn&lt;br/&gt;Award Number: IOS-0744705&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Evolution of environmental cue response systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conditions on earth vary over time. How animals cope with this variation determines whether or not they can survive and reproduce successfully in particular environments. This project explores a key aspect of animals ability to survive and reproduce successfully in different environments: their ability to time reproduction appropriately as conditions change. Timing of reproduction is of the utmost importance because ill-timed attempts (when weather or food supply are not favorable, for instance) can be catastrophic. The project focuses on understanding how animals use information from the environment, so-called environmental cues such as seasonal changes in day-length, to time changes in physiology and behavior that are critical to survival and successful reproduction in changing environments. The project exploits natural variation in the breeding schedules of wild birds to determine whether different timing challenges presented by different environments (i.e., predictably or unpredictably changing food supply) require animals to possess specialized neuro-hormonal cue response mechanisms that are uniquely suited only to a limited set of environmental circumstances. Alternatively, more generalist solutions that work well under a variety of circumstances might prevail. The project is of fundamental interest in the field of environmental physiology, and is particularly timely because the results will provide a general conceptual basis for anticipating how animals adapted to different types of timing challenges (e.g., highly predictable or highly unpredictable variation in environmental conditions) are likely to differ in how they will be affected by human-induced modifications to the environment (e.g., climate and global warming). The project involves extensive training of young biologists, including members of under-represented groups, undergraduate students, masters and doctoral students, and postdoctoral trainees. It also involves extensive outreach beyond the academic setting, through public lectures, presentations in public schools, and web sites.</AbstractNarration>
