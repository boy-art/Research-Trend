    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to gain fundamental understanding of the complex processes occurring in practical combustion systems through mathematical modeling. The work is concerned with the propagation of multi-dimensional flame fronts with emphasis on their interaction with the underlying flow. One set of problems address the propagation of flames in channels and cracks, which is of considerable interest in a number of applications where the penetration of the flame may be favorable, as in miniaturized combustion devices, or detrimental, as in crevice volumes of an internal combustion engine. The second set of problems is concerned with edge-flames, which are of fundamental importance to the phenomena of flame stabilization and liftoff occurring in many applications such as household burners and furnaces. Edge-flames play an important role in the evolution of holes created on the flame interface because of high strain or excessive heat loss, and thus are fundamental to the dynamics of turbulent diffusion flames. Understanding of these complex phenomena will be achieved by constructing models that contain the necessary physical ingredients of the problem at hand, constructing solutions to the mathematical models by means of asymptotic techniques and numerical methods, and comparing the results with experimental observations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combustion provides the majority of the energy that we consume today. It is important to ensure that combustion processes are utilized in the most efficient way and in such a way to minimize their adverse effect on the environment. This research will provide fundamental understanding of the dynamics of flame fronts, the interaction of a flame with the underlying flow field, inflammability limits, and intrinsic instabilities associated with the burning process. This knowledge will have an effect on future industrial combustion design and emerging micropropulsion technologies, resulting in improved energy utility and reduction of pollutants. Students trained through involvement in this research project will become valuable to the educational and research needs of the country.</AbstractNarration>
