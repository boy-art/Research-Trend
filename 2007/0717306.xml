    <AbstractNarration>Psychology - Biological (71)&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is creating three state-of-the-art laboratory research modules that comprise "Modular Digital Course in Undergraduate Neuroscience Education-Revised" (MDCUNE-R) and making these available to students and instructors at a wide range of institutions. The first module explores neurophysiology by experimenting with a virtual neural circuit to discover and analyze the mechanisms generating rhythmic neural activity. The second module introduces the subject of bioinformatics and makes extensive use of bioinformatics tools available free on the web. The third module analyzes sex differences and hormonal effects in the development of the bird song system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is modifying existing materials so that the modules are exclusively digital and publishing them in an enduring form. They are available on demand using open access media on the Web. These modules are inquiry-based laboratory experiences and demonstrations. They provide sufficient material for an entire laboratory course and allow instructors at any institution to employ the digital materials to create high-quality didactic experiences with no equipment required except a computer. &lt;br/&gt;MDCUNE-R is also providing extensive faculty development opportunities including workshops, articles, presentations at conferences, webcasts, and web-based tutorials with each module. The project is explicitly targeting faculty members at underserved institutions, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In keeping with the CCLI cyclic model, MDCUNE-R is being evaluated at four steps in its execution by: 1) testing and refining the teaching tools with UCLA students, 2) obtaining feedback from faculty and students at other institutions testing these materials, 3) receiving peer review feedback during the publication review process, and 4) receiving feedback from faculty and students who are using the materials once they have been released for general dissemination. At each of these points the feedback is being used to revise the materials.</AbstractNarration>
