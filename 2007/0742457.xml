    <AbstractNarration>In the CUNY Science Now GK-12 project, City University of New York doctoral students will collaborate with science teachers in New York City high schools to engage students in ?real world? science that is based on the Fellows? own research. Teachers and Fellows will collaborate to develop and teach innovative Authentic Research Modules in Science that focus on scientific content and process skills together with basic literacy and numeracy skills. CUNY research faculty will assist in this process, producing a unique three-way partnership. Fellows will master a wide range of knowledge and process competencies regarding learning, instruction, and the communication of science through the project?s rigorous training program, the curriculum development process, and a high school teaching experience. The project will enrich the graduate training of CUNY?s STEM doctoral students and equip them with the skills they need to become effective science communicators in the 21st century. Involving high school students in highly engaging, research-based instructional modules will help them to master the content and process skills needed to succeed in college-level science courses and promote greater interest in science. The project will provide a rich professional development opportunity to teachers and also address the issue of making science education at the high school level more inquiry based. The Science Now GK-12 project will develop a nationally replicable, professional development model that demonstrates its simultaneous impact on doctoral students, high school teachers, research faculty, and high school students, while also leaving in place curriculum modules that can be adopted by schools.</AbstractNarration>
