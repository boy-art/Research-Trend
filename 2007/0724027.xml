    <AbstractNarration>A fundamental challenge for many mobile computing applications is data&lt;br/&gt;management. Data should be available anywhere at anytime. However,&lt;br/&gt;this task is particularly difficult to support with respect to&lt;br/&gt;managing a user's personal data (e.g., data files, email, and cached&lt;br/&gt;web pages) across a collection of personal devices (e.g., a laptop,&lt;br/&gt;PDA, and mobile phone). Two properties of the mobile environment make&lt;br/&gt;data management particularly challenging: network disconnection and&lt;br/&gt;device resource constraints, particularly energy constraints. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of this work is to provide maximal availability and consistency&lt;br/&gt;of personal data as well as maximal aggregate device lifetime for a&lt;br/&gt;collection of personal devices. To accomplish this goal, the project&lt;br/&gt;develops a set of cooperative prefetching algorithms that enable&lt;br/&gt;devices to retrieve relevant data when connected to the information&lt;br/&gt;source. Further, the algorithms efficiently distribute the energy&lt;br/&gt;burden of performing prefetching across the collection of devices.&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation investigates the performance of the algorithms in an&lt;br/&gt;implementation running on a collection of laptop computers and iPAQs.&lt;br/&gt;Two primary metrics are considered: the aggregate lifetime of the&lt;br/&gt;devices and the hit rate of user requests for data. The overarching&lt;br/&gt;impacts of this work will be improved usability of mobile devices and&lt;br/&gt;applications and maximization of mobile device lifetime. Further, the&lt;br/&gt;student participants in this project are undergraduate women from&lt;br/&gt;Mount Holyoke College, one of the nation's finest all-women&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate institutions. Therefore, the project will also serve to&lt;br/&gt;improve the overall participation of women in systems research.</AbstractNarration>
