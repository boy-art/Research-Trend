    <AbstractNarration>This Tennessee State University proposal is a request for support for a 3-year exploratory research study focused on the content, cultural significance, and recommendations for increasing scientific literacy in diverse students living in either urban communities or on tribal reservations. Specifically, this proposal is designed to enhance an existing interdisciplinary high school science curriculum -Astrobiology in the Secondary Classroom (ASC), developed by university professors from the Minority Institution Astrobiology Collaborative (MIAC), classroom teachers, and partnership with scientists from NASA Goddard in an innovative way and conduct research to determine the effectiveness of these materials in three different underrepresented student populations African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americas experiencing an achievement gap in STEM areas at 5 sites. These sites include the NASA Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Aerospace Academics (SEMAA) (1) in the Miami Dade County Public School System in Florida; (2) at Tennessee State University, an HBCU in Nashville; (3) in the Las Cruces Public School System in New Mexico along with two programs on America Indian Reservations; (4) at Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the Owens Valley after school program; and (5) The Chinle Unified School District No. 24 in the Navajo Nation. Two teachers and up to 40 students will participate at each of the five sites, totaling 10 teachers and approximately 200 students. Modules will be developed that have been heavily researched and support the research in this area. Improvements will focus on program alignment and increased use of data sets made available by research scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals and objectives are (1) to test, validate, and modify the Astrobiology in Secondary Classroom (ASC) curriculum with high school students who are underrepresented in STEM activities; (2) train and support teachers who implement the ASC Curriculum; (3) examine the students' involvement and learning through analysis of real scientific data including cultural differences; and (4) determine the success of the ASC materials in fostering inquiry, critical thinking, problem solving, decision-making, design, and communication at increasing levels of complexity with student populations experiencing an achievement gap in STEM areas.</AbstractNarration>
