    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project will build on the success of the M3 project (funded by the U.S. Department of Education) to produce and disseminate K-2 curriculum materials for promoting students' high-level mathematical thinking and competence on the basis of research finding and national standards. Two replacement units of about 4-5 lessons each, one unit on geometry and one on measurement, will be developed, field tested, and revised by a collaborative, cross-disciplinary team (including teachers) and published by Kendal-Hunt. Curricular materials, available in both English and Spanish, will focus on promising discourses of hands-on inquiry of rich problem-situations, presented in real-world and/or scientific contexts, and while utilizing technology. These units will be accompanied with professional development guides and materials for use by trainers of elementary mathematics teachers to promote mathematics content and pedagogical knowledge that teachers need to implement the units with fidelity. Annual professional development models will consist of a one-week summer institute followed by three one-day workshops during the academic year and through a weekly visit to the classroom of field-test teachers. Field-testing will be conducted in 14 classrooms in three different states (CT, KY, and TX), including research, by an external evaluator, about the impact of the materials on student outcomes and on teacher perspectives and practices. Dissemination will include publication of student materials in print and on the web, as well as newsletters and family nights/meals to actively engage parents in their children's math learning.</AbstractNarration>
