    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; ""The Power of Partnerships"" is the theme for this RII proposal with the title ""Enabling Technologies for Scientific Innovation through Sensor Development."" This proposed effort builds on statewide cultural characteristics emphasizing partnerships and cooperation as primary means for overcoming resource scarcity. This cooperative approach to problem-solving aligns perfectly with EPSCoR''s goals for advancing research capacity and economic development statewide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: An active and engaged Statewide Committee, using data and analyses gathered by a professional technology consultant team, identified Sensors as the overarching theme for NH''s first RII effort, and identified three interdisciplinary fields (Space Science, Environmental Science and Nanotechnology) where NH''s universities, colleges and businesses are poised for national prominence through sensor development, testing and application. They further identified access to state-of-the-art instrumentation, and experimental and testing facilities as major barriers to advancing excellence. This proposal requests major infrastructure investments including: &lt;br/&gt; * Facilities for developing and testing sensors for a new generation of small satellite systems &lt;br/&gt; * Facilities for generating unique turbulence-flow environments for sensor testing and application &lt;br/&gt; * Significant upgrades in nano-scale surface measurement and materials deposition facilities &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These investments will be augmented by support for faculty development and graduate student assistantships and fellowships. Synergies among the three interdisciplinary science fields are clearly developed. The space science team looks to new developments in nano-scale sensors to reduce costs and enhance reliability in the space environment. The nanotechnology team includes environmental scientists who will take newly developed sensors and test them under challenging field conditions for long-term monitoring applications. The large-scale experimental turbulence system will provide a proving ground for new sensors for atmospheric and aquatic environments, as well as a unique environment for studying turbulence itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A unique program in Research and Commercialization Partnerships will build on 14 years of experience with the state-funded, NH Industrial Research Center. This Center combines state and industry funds to support faculty and student research on campuses across the state. A modest investment from this EPSCoR award will be leveraged significantly with state and private funds to advance economically relevant research and to develop a core of faculty, student and private-sector participants. Investments in K-12 programming will emphasize direct contact among university researchers, K-12 teachers, faculty at 2- and 4-year colleges, and students at all these levels. Advanced undergrads and graduate students will play a key role in this program as ""Scientists in Residence"" and as mentors and role models. Partnerships with non-profits, such as the Mount Washington Observatory, provide engaging environments for inspiring increased interest in STEM education at all levels.</AbstractNarration>
