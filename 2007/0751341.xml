    <AbstractNarration>This award partially supports the GSA research grants program. The primary role of this program is to provide partial support of Master's and Doctoral thesis research in the geological sciences for graduate students at universities in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Central America. Grants are intended as an aid to a research project, not to sustain the entire cost. Students may receive a GSA graduate student grant once at the Master's level and once at the Ph.D. level and a maximum of $4000 per award will be given to an individual student. Since the amount of money requested for grants usually greatly exceeds the amount available, applications are evaluated on a competitive basis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eligibility is restricted to GSA members. Grants are awarded only to individuals; institutions, societies, and universities are not eligible for grants. Grants with allowances for institutional overhead costs will not be funded. Grants are awarded to graduate students currently enrolled in universities or colleges in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Central America. Applications are evaluated on the basis of the scientific merits of the problems, the capability of the investigator, and reasonableness of the budget. GSA strongly encourages women, members of under-represented groups in Geosciences, and persons with disabilities to participate fully in this grants program.</AbstractNarration>
