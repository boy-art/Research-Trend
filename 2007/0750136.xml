    <AbstractNarration>This Phase II project has two technical goals. In Year 1 the focus is on increasing the video quality (bit rate) of NFT delivered broadcasts, while keeping bandwidth costs low. In Year 2 the focus shifts to expanding product support to Mac and other non-Windows systems. Network Foundation Technologies (NFT) has developed a patented distributed broadcast technology that overcomes many of the current bottlenecks. The key difference between the NFT approach and the traditional approach is that with NFT the computers and Internet connections of the viewers watching a broadcast help deliver that broadcast on to other viewers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network Foundation Technologies' products and technology have the potential to significantly impact the way television-style broadcasting is conducted over the Internet, greatly increasing the number of voices that can be heard. While NFT's near term goal is "to bring television to the Internet", the long term goal is to give ordinary citizens their own "online television stations."</AbstractNarration>
