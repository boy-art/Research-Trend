    <AbstractNarration>Johns Hopkins University is organizing a six-week research workshop focused on Machine Learning for Language Engineering and striving for synergistic cross-fertilization with other areas of machine intelligence. This workshop brings together diverse teams of leading professionals and students, both graduate and undergraduate, in a cooperative and intensive effort to advance the state of the science in Language Engineering, which encompasses automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, topic detection and tracking, information retrieval and extraction, summarization and question answering.&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of the workshop are to advance language engineering, to attract new students to the field and to prepare them for research by having them work alongside distinguished researchers on exciting problems.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop projects are selected through an open call for proposals issued to the worldwide IIS community. The proposals are evaluated competitively at a planning meeting that draws together the projects' proponents, impartial experts from the relevant disciplines, and government representatives.&lt;br/&gt;The graduate students are selected based on their research interest and performance by the proponents of the selected projects. The undergraduates are entering seniors selected through an open national search.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to establishing new research directions and providing hands-on education to students, the workshop results will be widely disseminated and incorporated into continuing, large-scale, collaborative research efforts by participating faculty, graduate and undergraduate students from geographically diverse institutions. Valuable tools and data for IIS research will be created, and fruitful and long-lasting collaborations will be initiated between diverse and dispersed participants.</AbstractNarration>
