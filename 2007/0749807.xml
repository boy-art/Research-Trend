    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Heather Allen of The Ohio state University. Prof. Allen's research program focuses on studying the interactions between water molecules and lipid membranes. Prof. Allen and her students will utilize state of the art surface sensitive non linear spectroscopic techniques to elucidate the organization of water molecules on and about the surface between the lipids in different surface phases. Improving the state of understanding of water at air-lipid-water interfaces will impact scientific thought across many disciplines including biology, environmental science and nanotechnology. For example, it will increase our understanding of aerosol chemistry since water content and the organization of water molecules on the surface of aerosol droplets greatly impact their reactivity and potential toxicity when inhaled in urban and rural areas. The study will provide an excellent educational opportunity for graduate students, undergraduate students, high school students and postdoctoral trainees to carry out a fundamental research project at the interface of chemistry and atmospheric sciences.</AbstractNarration>
