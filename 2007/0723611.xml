    <AbstractNarration>In 2008, the project is hosting a three-day invitational conference on Pathways to Algebra. Thirty distinguished mathematics education researchers, educators, and research mathematicians from the international community will discuss data, findings, and claims regarding young students' ability to reason algebraically and begin to use algebraic representations. The aim is to achieve a grounded discussion about the place of algebra in early mathematics instruction i.e., a discussion relevant to the work of researchers as well as professionals involved in teacher education and curriculum development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the months leading up to the conference in Western France, the project is holding moderated online discussions regarding evidence-based claims about algebraic reasoning and learning among young students. Topics will cover issues at the crossroads of mathematics, learning and teaching among which are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Field Axioms in elementary and middle school: Can young children understand the field axioms (associativity, commutativity, distributivity etc.) and use them to assert generalizations and derive theorems?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic Reasoning and Modelling: What is gained or forfeited by emphasizing quantitative reasoning as a pathway to algebra? Does a measurement approach offer a useful ramp to algebra? Can children's algebraic competence emerge from problems involving rich, 'worldly' contexts?; and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Functions and Equations: How might functions constitute a pathway to algebra? How does one shift emphasis from the extra-mathematical/representational uses of functions toward the syntax of written forms? Can young students solve equations? Can they understand equations as the setting equal of two functions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pre-conference moderated discussions as well as the presentations and debates from the conference itself will be edited in the form of a book about Pathways To Algebra. The present initiative and resulting publication responds to the challenge set forth by the RAND 2003 Mathematics Study Panel that proficiency in algebra in K-12 constitute a focal point for coordinated research and development efforts. It also attempts to clarify the research basis necessary for implementing NCTM's recommendation that algebra constitute a strand woven throughout K-12 education. The findings will be of interest to researchers, policy makers, curriculum developers, and educators.</AbstractNarration>
