    <AbstractNarration>This research project will focus on the mechanism of matrix assisted pulsed laser deposition of thin polymer and organic films. These thin films are crucial to the advancement of technology in such areas as chemical and biological sensing, antistiction coatings, and flat panel displays, and many others as well. In this technique a polymer or other organic material to be deposited as a thin film is dissolved in a solvent matrix and then the solution is frozen and placed in a vacuum chamber. The volatile solvent is pumped away and the organic material is deposited as a thin film. Our recent research results, as well as others, have shown that the laser wavelength and matrix used can greatly affect the characteristics of the deposited films. Once this wavelength specificity and the role of guest-host interactions are understood, the deposition of high quality films in a reproducible manner will be facilitated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research project begin with the fact that it is intrinsically multidisciplinary. In this fashion, the results obtained from this work will be of interest to researchers in almost every science and engineering discipline. As such, the pool of students who may participate is naturally large. Since Rutgers-Camden is a diverse campus in a developing urban environment, the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in this project is naturally facilitated. Finally, the training of undergraduate students and the postdoctoral fellow supported by this project will be enhanced by Rutgers-Camden's commitment to both undergraduate participation in research and close faculty mentoring.</AbstractNarration>
