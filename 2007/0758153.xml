    <AbstractNarration>New probes of the physics of inflation have emerged in recent years. This proposal focuses on two topics: one is non-Gaussianity of primordial fluctuations and the other includes reheating and preheating after inflation. If inflation was accompanied by Gaussian fluctuations, this means that only correlations between two (density) fields are important.&lt;br/&gt;Non-Gaussianity is measured by there being non zero correlations between more than two fields. The PI has developed and is continuing to develop new quantitative tests of inflation with non-Gaussianity. Specifically, the PI along with his students proposes to study the following: 1. Higher correlation functions such as the Trispectrum (four-point function) which directly measures scattering effects and how they effect primordial non-Gaussianity;&lt;br/&gt;2. Including non-linear effects such as scattering in the Boltzmann equation which describes the evolution of the fluctuations. This calculation will allow one to compare theoretical predictions and future CMB data from the Planck satellite.&lt;br/&gt;3. The PI will develop the tools and formalism necessary to calculate gravitino production due to the non-linear scattering of inhomogeneous,time-dependent scalar fields. &lt;br/&gt;The project integrates research and education naturally by providing graduate students with opportunities to do cutting-edge research The PI intends to involve undergraduate students in research as well as outreach projects. The PI intends to use simulation data as an attractive and efficient tool for giving undergraduate students research experiences and outreach projects. As a part of undergraduate student?s outreach activities, he intends to create movies of the ?Big Bang at Work? using their simulations and make the movies publicly available via the World Wide Web.</AbstractNarration>
