    <AbstractNarration>Despite consumer demand for sleek, lightweight electronics, mobile embedded systems often use bulky discrete voltage regulation components to deliver noise-free power. Dedicated motherboard-level regulators increase the form factor of portable electronics. This project is developing a novel paradigm in which power regulation circuitry is designed synergistically with the computational elements of system, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for off-chip regulation. The focal point of the research is the development of models, design methodologies, and management techniques that allow low power high-performance SoCs to be directly connected to an energy source, enabling the next step in system integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to develop integrated, programmable, on-chip switching regulators that leverage novel packaging technology to provide noise free supply voltages at high-efficiency. In addition, on-chip regulation improves the feasibility of fine-grained voltage domains. The project examines unique cross-boundary system optimizations spanning both software-level task management and regulation hardware design. It is developing integrated operating system and hardware methods to limit peak current, improve slew rate demands, and reduce voltage ripples through balanced scheduling. In special cases, it may be possible to completely remove regulation circuitry and allow the operating system to adapt computation under ""deregulated""gradually declining battery voltages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The removal of dedicated off-chip regulation from embedded systems has broad potential for commercial and social impact by enabling new generations of compact, reliable embedded devices, such as consumer electronics and medical devices. This project provides educational benefits through training of graduate students and incorporation of resulting advanced material in courses.</AbstractNarration>
