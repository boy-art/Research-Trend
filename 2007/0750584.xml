    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II research project will develop a compact, easy-to-use two-axis magnetic sensing module with picotesla sensitivity, based on the use of Magnesium Oxide (MgO)-based Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) sensor devices and associated electronics. The sensor module will have superior field sensitivity with excellent linearity and orthogonality, thanks to a specialized control circuitry which allows the sensors to operate under optimal magnetic conditions. The sensor module will operate under ambient conditions, with no extra infrastructure required, and will therefore be easily integrated into a number of emerging applications. The field sensitivity of the sensor module will be more than a factor of ten larger than any commercially-available thin film sensor, giving it a dominant technical edge for high -performance applications. This sensor module will be realized through the synergy of three key innovations: enhanced device performance derived from magnesium oxide tunnel barrier technology, active sensor compensation via on-board current-carrying striplines, and anisotropy engineering using specialized annealing processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will create a new product family with greatly enhanced capabilities for use in many critical segments of the world sensor market, including remote sensing applications in the defense and homeland security segments, as a key component of non-destructive evaluation systems, and in emerging medical applications. It will expand the utility and availability of a number of powerful new medical technologies. This research will improve the understanding of the emerging spintronic technology of magnetic tunnel junctions, a class of devices which forms the central component of several important commercial products in the high-tech semiconductor and data storage industries.</AbstractNarration>
