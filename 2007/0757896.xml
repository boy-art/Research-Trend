    <AbstractNarration>This award supports Stanford?s ongoing program on advanced gravitational wave detectors. The research will focus on continuing projects on the development and testing of the Advanced LIGO seismic isolation and control systems and on the investigation of improved sensors for increasing performance of active isolation systems. In addition, research will continue on the use of ultraviolet light to mitigate the buildup of electrostatic charges on Advanced LIGO mirrors and on the evaluation of thermalized optical losses in core optic materials and optical coatings. All these efforts have as their goal the increased performance of Advanced LIGO. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravitational waves were predicted almost 90 years ago in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, but they have not yet been detected due to the extreme sensitivity required. Interacting black holes, coalescing compact binary stellar systems, stellar collapses, pulsars and low mass X-ray binaries are all possible sources of gravitational waves, as is the random background of radiation from the early universe. Laser interferometer detectors, which operate by measuring strains in the fabric of space-time that are expected to be produced by gravitational waves, are now becoming operational and may soon give us a first detection. Detectors of higher performance, such as Advanced LIGO, should allow us to develop gravitational wave astronomy as a new window on the Universe. Stanford has a strong, multidisciplinary program in developing the technology for such detectors with participants from many areas of physics and engineering. The program provides training for future scientists and engineers at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, it integrates basic scientific research with scientific education, and includes outreach programs that inform and educate the broader community.</AbstractNarration>
