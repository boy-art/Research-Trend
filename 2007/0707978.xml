    <AbstractNarration>Milton&lt;br/&gt;0707978&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Superlenses achieve resolution finer than convential lenses,&lt;br/&gt;and have some startling properties, such as making polarizable&lt;br/&gt;dipoles essentially invisible if they lie within a critical&lt;br/&gt;distance of the lens. This project improves our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;superlenses and invisibility, particularly for spherical&lt;br/&gt;superlenses, which not only superresolve but also magnify. It&lt;br/&gt;also seeks to characterize exotic electromagnetic behaviors that&lt;br/&gt;composite materials formed from constituent materials with&lt;br/&gt;extreme properties can exhibit in the quasistatic limit, where&lt;br/&gt;the wavelength of the time-harmonic radiation is much larger than&lt;br/&gt;the microstructure. The investigator also studies a new class of&lt;br/&gt;material named "massnetic materials." These have in their&lt;br/&gt;microstructure collections of spinning tops, each situated in a&lt;br/&gt;cavity in the body, and each weighted on one side by a mass that&lt;br/&gt;allows one to increase or decrease the spin of each top by&lt;br/&gt;appropriately oscillating the body. These materials should be&lt;br/&gt;able to store and release energy on the microscale. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator also explores new equations of elastodynamics, and&lt;br/&gt;studies novel microstructures with the unusual property that&lt;br/&gt;their average momentum depends not just on their overall&lt;br/&gt;velocity, but also on how they are deformed, i.e. on their&lt;br/&gt;strain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Metamaterials, i.e. composite materials with properties&lt;br/&gt;unachievable in ordinary materials, have attracted a great deal&lt;br/&gt;of interest and are beginning to revolutionize our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of materials and the properties they can exhibit. More&lt;br/&gt;technogical applications of these materials are now possible due&lt;br/&gt;to advances in our ability to tailor the microstructure of&lt;br/&gt;substances, for instance through nanotechnology. This project&lt;br/&gt;studies how composites can be constructed from high contrast&lt;br/&gt;materials to exhibit elastic and electromagnetic properties far&lt;br/&gt;richer than existing materials. In the defence, automotive,&lt;br/&gt;aerospace, electronics, and other manufacturing and&lt;br/&gt;telecommunication industries there is a constant need for new&lt;br/&gt;materials. The impact of such new materials is likely to be&lt;br/&gt;greatest when their properties are radically different from any&lt;br/&gt;material we know. The project could lead to the development of&lt;br/&gt;whole classes of radically different new materials with novel&lt;br/&gt;properties. Also it should give a much needed firm theoretical&lt;br/&gt;foundation to Pendry's work on spherical superlenses, and enhance&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of invisibility.</AbstractNarration>
