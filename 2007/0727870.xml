    <AbstractNarration>This research will develop a strategy for using first principles theory and computation to determine the atomistic details of polymer hydrogel double network structures applicable in the development of scaffold-supported cell therapies to promote cartilage regeneration. Recent advances in first-principles-based molecular simulations that allow the description of systems with 1,000s-millions of atoms with chemical and structural detail at the Materials and Processing Simulation Center in the California Institute of Technology will enable the essential framework to: &lt;br/&gt;1) simulate the critical nano bio-mechanical properties of gel polymer networks, including mechanoregulation, and &lt;br/&gt;2) develop an increased understanding of fundamental mechanisms that regulate in-vivo performance for the development of new/enhanced materials. &lt;br/&gt;This work will validate the strategy on prototypical systems and set the stage for important applications in Tissue Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;This research is critical to improve our understanding of, and to enhance our ability to emulate the, nano-mechanical properties of natural cartilage. Cartilage has a limited self-repair capacity and traditional therapies for musculoskeletal conditions involving cartilaginous tissue have relied on surgical procedures for full joint replacements when local repair/replacement is not possible; these methods have proven to be ineffective in the long-term. Musculoskeletal conditions remain as one of the major health concerns in the United States imposing a huge economic load on individual/public health care costs, leading to prolonged disabilities and decreased productivity of our workforce, with further socio-economic impact. Engineering/Science students will be recruited for this research and findings incorporated into a course on "Atomistic Simulation of Materials" at Caltech.</AbstractNarration>
