    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on developing new catalyzed organic reaction methodology to access a variety of synthetically useful organic compounds efficiently and economically. The focal point of these planned investigations is on the design and execution of new catalytic asymmetric C-C bond forming reactions that deliver versatile enantioenriched synthons with applications in a wide range of synthesis activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Scott G. Nelson, of the Department of Chemistry at University of Pittsburgh. &lt;br/&gt;Professor Scott G. Nelson and his co-workers will be studying new methods to synthesize important organic intermediates and developing novel strategies for the synthesis of natural and unnatural products. The project is of considerable significance to the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, as it could impact how organic molecules are prepared.</AbstractNarration>
