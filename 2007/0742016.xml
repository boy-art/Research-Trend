    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: Motivated by the ever-increasing demand for growth of continuous, smooth and single crystalline deposits, this research emphasizes development of a new method for epitaxial growth by Surface Limited Redox replacement (SLRR) and its application for deposition of plain metals, alloy films and multilayer structures. This method is based upon multiple application of a "building block" deposition event consisting of decoupled potential-controlled deposition of "sacrificial" monolayer of metal U (U = Tl, Cd, Pb and Bi) and electroless redox replacement of this layer by more-noble metal ions of Ag, Au, Pt, Pd and Cu). The research program is planned in two sequential modules with development and application emphasis respectively. In the first module, the replacement kinetics in SLRR will be investigated with Electrochemical Techniques, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance and Theoretical Modeling. Films deposited by kinetically optimized building block reactions will be characterized in view of their surface morphology, structure and composition, by STM, X-ray Diffraction, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. A collaborative Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation work will shed more light on the initial stage of nucleation and growth in SLRR. In the second module, the lateral size stress effects in high aspect ratio Cu, Ag, Au and derivative alloy ensembles grown by SLRR on templated substrates will be studied at nanometer length scale. Also, SLRR protocols will be employed for controlled deposition of thin alloy films and metal multilayers aimed at final applications in hydrogen catalysis and electronic industry. A collaborative effort will be implemented for surface templating by block co-polymers and high end surface characterization. The intellectual merit of this program is manifested primarily by the unique nature of the new SLRR method that for the first time combines sequential potential-controlled and electroless steps to encompass a single deposition event. NON-TECHNICAL: PI is committed to integrate research program with the undergraduate and graduate education. While the research component would support mainly graduate studies, new scholar achievements will be delivered to the undergraduate classroom by a multifaceted two-level educational activity called "A Roadmap from Faraday to Moore in Today's Electrochemistry Education" and tailored for interdisciplinary experience. Starting as an educational block at a sophomore level and expanding it to a full senior course with a strong experimental emphasis, this work addresses challenges in today's electrochemistry education, offers a balanced approach to walk undergraduate students throughout the curriculum and aims to extend the positive experience to high school teaching practices. A formative and summative evaluation coordinated on campus would serve for development of benchmark criteria of the program success. The teaching strategy is expected to enhance the students' interest and motivation thereby facilitating the identification of qualified undergraduates from under represented women and minority groups (typical for SUNY-Binghamton is African American) who will be offered participation in the PI's research program. The ultimate goal would be to encourage these students by virtue of their unique research experience to elect natural sciences as field for future higher-level educational and professional endeavors.</AbstractNarration>
