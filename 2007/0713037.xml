    <AbstractNarration>Title: Workshop: Graduate Student Symposium at ACM Creativity &amp; Cognition Conference (CC2007)&lt;br/&gt;PI: Hollan, James D&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California, San Diego&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop supports the Graduate Student Symposium at the ACM Creativity &amp; Cognition (CC2007) Conference. The symposium encourages young researchers currently pursuing a graduate degree in areas with emphasis on creativity and cognition by giving their work wider exposure in the community, helping to foster a sense of community among these young researchers, and providing an opportunity to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community in an interactive and supportive environment. Graduate students from different disciplines involved with understanding creativity and cognition will attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As computers become pervasive in all of society, there is a growing need to encourage&lt;br/&gt;interaction between the disciplines of computer and information technology and the disciplines of digital arts, design, and cognition. Many envision that interactions across these disciplinary boundaries are fundamental to research advances. Involving young researchers during their graduate education is a key opportunity to seed and encourage such interactions. This is consistent with the new NSF initiative on Creativity in Information Technology, Science, Engineering, and Design (CreativeIT) and is a key intellectual merit of the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the Graduate Student Symposium is to substantially increase participation by young researchers pursuing a graduate degree in fields contributing to our understanding of creativity and cognition. The symposium will provide a supportive setting for feedback on graduate students' current work and guidance on future directions. Student participants will meet and discuss their work with each other and a panel of experienced researchers and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>
