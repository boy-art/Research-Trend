    <AbstractNarration>The theory of stacks is the study of symmetries of geometric objects and, as&lt;br/&gt;such, has wide impact throughout mathematics: it is a central theme in&lt;br/&gt;current work in algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, number theory,&lt;br/&gt;analytic and differential geometry, and mathematical physics. Indeed, the&lt;br/&gt;theory has proved flexible enough to apply to any field of mathematics were&lt;br/&gt;it is important to study symmetries across continuous families of geometric&lt;br/&gt;objects, especially when the groups of self-symmetries can vary&lt;br/&gt;non-continuously throughout the family. This workshop, to be held at the&lt;br/&gt;Fields Institute in Toronto, will bring together leading researchers,&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral mathematicians, and graduate students from fields which apply&lt;br/&gt;the theory of stacks; the intent is to discuss recent advances, and to&lt;br/&gt;explore and stimulate potentially important new areas of applications. The&lt;br/&gt;main speakers will address current problems in chromatic stable homotopy&lt;br/&gt;theory, orbifolds, mathematical physics, geometry in various forms, and the&lt;br/&gt;emerging field of derived algebraic geometry. Researchers who have agreed to&lt;br/&gt;participate include Mark Behrens (MIT), Ian Grojnowksi (Cambridge), Jacob&lt;br/&gt;Lurie (Harvard), Gabriele Vezzosi (Firenze), and Angelo Vistolli (Scuola&lt;br/&gt;Normale Superiore). In addition, Mike Hopkins (Harvard) will give a series&lt;br/&gt;of lectures concurrently with this workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be the central event of a two-month subprogram&lt;br/&gt;entitled ``Stacks in geometry and topology'', within the thematic program&lt;br/&gt;``Geometric applications of homotopy theory''. The full program will run&lt;br/&gt;from January through June of 2007 at the Fields Institute. Beyond the&lt;br/&gt;workshop, there a directly related mini-courses by Paul Goerss&lt;br/&gt;(Northwestern), Ezra Getzler (Northwestern), and Jacob Lurie (Harvard).&lt;br/&gt;The workshop and the mini-courses will pursue the theory of stacks&lt;br/&gt;across a diverse fields of mathematics where this theory has been applied,&lt;br/&gt;and an important goal of this whole program is to foster cross-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;interaction.</AbstractNarration>
