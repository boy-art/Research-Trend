    <AbstractNarration>This Track 1 project is working to increase the Earth system science competency of 12 elementary science teachers and 280 4th and 5th grade minority students in the state of Florida through a collaboration between the University of South Florida, 3 digital libraries, and existing mentoring programs for minority undergraduate and graduate students. Teachers and minority Scholars in the Minorities Striving and Pursuing Higher Degrees of Success (MS PHD'S) and Bridge to the Doctorate programs will attend a summer training institute to begin the process of connecting with each other, as well as receive orientation to digital library teaching and learning modules that can be most efficiently integrated into the Florida Earth science curriculum and address state learning standards. In addition, the Scholars will engage in supplemental virtual training activities to learn key strategies to support teachers in the development of lesson plans and activities to facilitate successful integration of selected digital library materials with state standards. Teachers will receive financial support to purchase materials, supplies and related teaching aids to facilitate creative 'hands on' learning activities. MS PHD'S and Bridge to the Doctorate Scholars will serve as young role models and mentors for the students through on-going virtual interactions. This project aims to develop a replicable model for professional development of elementary teachers working with minority students, in order to broaden participation in the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>
