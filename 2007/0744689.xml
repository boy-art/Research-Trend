    <AbstractNarration>Phillip Allan Newmark, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;IOS-0744689&lt;br/&gt;Functional genomic analysis of spermatogenesis and testis regeneration in planarians&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The propagation of nearly all animals requires the production of functional male and female gametes. Fertilization of the oocyte by male gametes (sperm) enables the developing egg to produce all of the cell types of the resulting organism. What mechanisms are used to generate functional gametes and to what extent are these mechanisms shared between different organisms? This is a major biological problem that involves development, differentiation, and, to some extent, de-differentiation. This work uses the tools of genomics and the unique biology of the planarian to understand the generation of male gametes (spermatogenesis). Planarians are well-known for their ability to regenerate a complete organism from almost any part of the body; it is less appreciated that they can also regenerate their reproductive organs, using an adult ?stem cell? population as the source of new tissue. The availability of the planarian genome sequence, techniques for studying the expression of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously, and the ability to manipulate gene function in this organism will facilitate the identification of genes required for proper spermatogenesis. This work will identify genes necessary for spermatogenesis that are shared between planarians and other organisms, including mammals. The broader educational impact of this work will be in the training of graduate and undergraduate students in the use of functional genomic approaches to study important problems. Furthermore, the P.I. and the members of his laboratory are actively engaged in outreach activities designed to increase the interest of K-12 students and members of under-represented groups in scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
