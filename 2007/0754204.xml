    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0504539&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Nora Ganter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates the interaction of elliptic cohomology&lt;br/&gt;with other areas of mathematics and physics, with a focus on&lt;br/&gt;equivariant phenomena and power operations. Subjects treated&lt;br/&gt;range from orbifold models in string theory over representation&lt;br/&gt;and character theory in 2-categories to generalized Moonshine and&lt;br/&gt;stable homotopy theory. Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel character theory&lt;br/&gt;arose in the context of homotopy theory and exposes many formal&lt;br/&gt;similarities between the above fields. The goal of the project&lt;br/&gt;is to better understand the mechanisms underlying these&lt;br/&gt;observations. Power operations in elliptic cohomology were&lt;br/&gt;already linked to product formulas in string theory and to the&lt;br/&gt;twisted Hecke operators of generalized Moonshine. This project&lt;br/&gt;will further pursue these connections, aiming to clarify the&lt;br/&gt;links between the literature in these three subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In less technical terms: Elliptic cohomology is a rich mix of&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics and physics, which on the surface do not&lt;br/&gt;appear to have much to do with each other. Especially in the&lt;br/&gt;presence of an action by a group of symmetries, one can observe&lt;br/&gt;many analogies between seemingly unrelated research areas. With&lt;br/&gt;collaborators from various fields of mathematics, this project&lt;br/&gt;seeks to find an explanation for the deeper mechanisms underlying&lt;br/&gt;these phenomena.</AbstractNarration>
