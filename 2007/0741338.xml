    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The project explores heterogenous microsystem integration for distributed use in an electric power grid. From the perspective of microsystems technology research, this project integrates multi-sensing, information extraction, and wireless communication functionalities ? all in one very compact device. In this over-arching concept, the multi-sensing could include acoustic, seismic, magnetic, biological, and image (visible or IR), among others. The present investigation will involve design, fabrication, and test of electrical sensors (relevant to the power lines ? transmission or distribution, and related equipment), vias between the sensor plane and the processing plane, and stacking issues, including thinning, planarization, alignment, and bonding. It will also address the design and simulation of analog circuits, data converters, and digital signal processing (DSP) cells (which will be customized for power grid application), and very importantly, a framework for the needed digital processing. The latter will include automatic compensation in case of sensor relocation for defect circumvention on the sensor plane. Putting all the pieces together, an overall architecture will be developed and verified. In particular, the mapping of fault detection and its localization (distance calculation) to a systolic architecture using the proposed single-cycle DSP cells will be performed. Two related issues, namely the on-chip binding network and sensor fusion will be addressed in a future full proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research focuses on developing technology for microsystems that could be used for monitoring the electrical power grid. This application has high strategic importance. While only one graduate student will be directly supported through this grant, it is anticipated that a few other G and UG students will also be trained. Special effort will be made to recruit women, minority, or disabled students to fill these supported research positions. The project will significantly benefit a course that the PI is developing on heterogenous microsystems. Technology transfer to the industry will be carried out through conference and journal publications, and through a web site.</AbstractNarration>
