    <AbstractNarration>Professor Akos Vertes at the George Washington University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study the formation of ions for mass spectrometric characterization by electrospray ionization (ESI) of molecules in liquids. ESI is an important characterization tool for a wide range of biological and other applications, all of which can benefit from better understanding of the underlying processes. Dr. Vertes and his group will study effects of the geometry of ESI systems on spray stability and ion chemistry. They will also evaluate laser excitation of the spray as a means to improve ion yields and to alter the chemistry of the ions produced, and the combination of laser ablation and spray plumes for enhanced atmospheric pressure ion yields of high mass ions. Molecular dynamics modeling of charged droplet/charged wet surface collisions is also planned to probe the processes involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational aspect of the project is closely tied to the direct involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the process of scientific inquiry. Students who work on the project acquire modern technical skills and learn how to present their findings at local and national meetings. Cyber-enabled mass spectrometers are used by Dr. Vertes in a classroom setting to broaden the preparation of students. Advantages of this approach include first-hand student experience with sophisticated instrumentation from the classroom and better utilization of the available analytical equipment.</AbstractNarration>
