    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Synthetic Organic Program will support a "Workshop on Organic Synthesis and Natural Products Chemistry." This workshop has the dual purpose of providing an effective forum for informal discussion among young industrial and academic scientists on current research in topical areas of organic synthesis and natural products, and assisting the Program staff in identifying emerging areas and researchers. This process, in turn, will aid the Program in long-range planning. The specific goals of the workshop include: 1) Providing an environment for the dynamic exchange of ideas in organic synthesis and natural products chemistry among a small group (about 20) of active young researchers in these fields. 2) Encouraging an attitude of cooperation among individuals working in related areas, and thereby, avoiding duplicative efforts. 3) Stimulating participants to study new problems and methods in synthetic and natural products chemistry. 4) Increasing diversity at high-level meetings 5) Creating an atmosphere in which the scientific and social interaction among participants will be both stimulating and pleasant.</AbstractNarration>
