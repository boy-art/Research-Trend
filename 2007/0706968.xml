    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0706968&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jeff Cheeger, Shmuel Weinberger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will explore differing approaches to non-smooth&lt;br/&gt;spaces that arise in modern geometry and topology with an eye&lt;br/&gt;towards cross-fertilization among the various groups of&lt;br/&gt;researchers. Two of the central thrusts are topological methods&lt;br/&gt;based on the ideas of a stratification, and metric measure&lt;br/&gt;spaces, and their analysis, especially their differential&lt;br/&gt;calculus. Others are based on cohomology with growth conditions,&lt;br/&gt;or resolution of singularities, intersection homology, sheaf&lt;br/&gt;theory etc. Moreover the applications of these studies are&lt;br/&gt;diverse, from the Novikov conjecture, knot theory, and&lt;br/&gt;transformation groups to Gromov-Hasudorff convergence techniques&lt;br/&gt;in Riemannian geometry and geometric group theory to problems of&lt;br/&gt;interest to theoretical computer scientists (embedding finite&lt;br/&gt;metric spaces in various Banach spaces). It is anticipated that&lt;br/&gt;as a result of this meeting, progress can be expected in the&lt;br/&gt;directions of producing analytic geometric structures on singular&lt;br/&gt;spaces, the quasi-isometric theory of groups, and characteristic&lt;br/&gt;classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the basic ideas of analysis and geometry are based on the&lt;br/&gt;idea of linear approximation. The first example of this is&lt;br/&gt;calculus itself where linear approximation defines the basic&lt;br/&gt;notion of the derivative. A more modern example is the idea of a&lt;br/&gt;manifold in topology, which is a space that is, in small regions,&lt;br/&gt;well approximated by Euclidean space. Countless further&lt;br/&gt;developments have shown the need for more general tools to deal&lt;br/&gt;with situations where such approximations are not feasible or may&lt;br/&gt;not exist. By bringing together workers who have dealt with&lt;br/&gt;these issues in varied contexts, this conference will spur the&lt;br/&gt;development of new syntheses and bring to the fore common issues&lt;br/&gt;that arise in completely different settings.
