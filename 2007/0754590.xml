    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: 0754590&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Linninger, Andreas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three year REU site award will provide a unique summer research experience focused in the area of bioengineering and biomedicine for mixed teams of undergraduate students who will be collaborating with math and science teachers and gifted high school students. This REU site program will be integrated with the Chicago Science and Math Teacher Research (CSTR) program, an already existing NSF Research Experiences for Teachers Program (RET) and an existing high school student mentoring program with the Illinois Math and Science Academy. The aims of this REU site are to: (1) introduce students to state-of-the-art multidisciplinary research content and practice; (2) enhance students' creativity and prepare them for graduate studies; (3) promote the development of professional skills needed in the engineering workplace; and (4) strengthen students' self-confidence by improved leadership and communication skills. Specific research projects offered in this REU site will include drug transport and biomolecular technology, biomechanics, nanotechnology, microfabrication and molecular biology, bioinformatics for molecular drug design and characterization. This site is also unique because it will bring together bioengineers with faculty in neuroscience, oncology, medicinal chemistry and orthopedics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to enhance the hands-on laboratory research experience, a variety of additional activities have been incorporated. These include the following: (1) an ethics component: (2) lectures on communication and leadership skills; (3) a workshop on laboratory safety; (4) industrial site visits; (5) tours to clinical and research facilities at the University of Illinois Medical Campus, the University of Chicago Hospitals and Rush University Medical Center; (6) group visits to sporting events, architectural boat tours on Lake Michigan and other recreational facilities in the Chicago area; (7) weekly social lunch time get-togethers; and (8) a PI hosted summer reception for REU and RET fellows, mentors and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eighty percent of the REU participants will be recruited from underrepresented groups. Results of the research will be disseminated in scientific publications. All REU participants will be required to prepare a technical paper and all presentations, progress reports and technical papers will be placed on the REU/RET website.</AbstractNarration>
