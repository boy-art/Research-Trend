    <AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to carry out a wide range of scholarly and educational projects related to his research interests in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. In his research, the PI makes substantial use of Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma to tackle structural and enumerative problems. This Lemma is one of the most powerful tools in modern combinatorics, it has applications not only in combinatorics but in analysis and additive number theory as well. The original form of the Lemma concerns dense graphs, but in many applications one would need a sparse version of the Lemma. The PI plans to develop the theory of sparse regularity, so that it might be applied to solve a wide range of problems. Furthermore, the PI proposes to study phase transitions in bootstrap percolation, which are related to models in statistical physics, such as the Ising model. In addition to persuing his own research, the investigator proposes a great variety of educational and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of complex discrete and combinatorial structures is crucial in many areas of modern science and technology. The PI is convinced that the new approaches and techniques resulting from his project will lead to further developments, not only in Discrete Mathematics, but also in other fields such as Information Theory, Computer Science and Statistical Physics. Since his area is relatively accessible to a wider audience, the PI proposes numerous educational outreach activities. He plans to organize several conferences, including one whose participants will mainly be graduate students, to develop courses providing a gentle introduction to a variety of powerful methods in modern Combinatorics, including one for undergraduates, and mentoring students on their own projects, leading to Masters and Ph.D degrees.</AbstractNarration>
