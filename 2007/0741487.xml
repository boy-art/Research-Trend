    <AbstractNarration>Through this Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled Integrating Nanotechnology into Undergraduate Engineering Curricula at Bucknell University, under the direction of Dr. Erin Jablonski, a Nanofabrication Laboratory will be implemented at Bucknell University as a platform for enhancing undergraduate engineering education through interdisciplinary projects in designing, manufacturing, and characterizing materials and devices with nanoscale features. The proposed laboratory will provide unique demonstration and experimental capabilities in nanofabrication currently unavailable to Bucknell students and will be instrumental in facilitating technolgically relevant senior design projects. The Nanofabrication Laboratory will play a pivotal role in advancing the Nanotechnology in Engineering educational initiatives of Bucknell University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering Program Solicitation (NSF 07-554), and is being funded by the Directorate for Engineering, Office of the Assistant Director.</AbstractNarration>
