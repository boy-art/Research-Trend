    <AbstractNarration>Nonlinear dynamics has historically played a fundamental role in explaining diverse and&lt;br/&gt;complex atomic processes, a role which in turn has stimulated numerous theoretical&lt;br/&gt;advances in classical and quantum chaos. This trend continues as advances in atomic&lt;br/&gt;and optical techniques provide an unprecedented level of control and precision for&lt;br/&gt;experimental studies of chaos in atomic systems. For example, the time evolution of&lt;br/&gt;highly localized initial states (e.g. ultrashort optical pulses, Rydberg wavepackets, and&lt;br/&gt;localized ensembles of ultracold atoms), can be measured as they evolve and disperse&lt;br/&gt;within a chaotic potential, thereby probing the detailed fractal structure in the chaotic&lt;br/&gt;phase space. Such precision tools, however, highlight a fundamental deficiency in&lt;br/&gt;theoretical nonlinear dynamics; there exists no general framework (in the sense of&lt;br/&gt;symbolic dynamics) capable of classifying the diversity of chaotic behavior exhibited by&lt;br/&gt;transport in real physical systems.&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is twofold: (i) It will exploit new advances in chaotic dynamics&lt;br/&gt;to motivate, guide, and interpret experiments capable of probing chaotic phase space&lt;br/&gt;with unprecedented resolution. These include the chaotic transport, ionization, and&lt;br/&gt;control of Rydberg wavepackets as well as the elucidation of novel chaotic pathways for&lt;br/&gt;the mixing and loss of ultracold atoms in optical traps. (ii) It will develop a nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;dynamics toolbox that can extract an accurate (symbolic dynamics) model for the&lt;br/&gt;structure of chaotic transport in Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom. This&lt;br/&gt;model can be made arbitrarily precise, even for systems exhibiting a mixture of chaos&lt;br/&gt;and regularity. The prior success of ?homotopic lobe dynamics? in describing phase&lt;br/&gt;space transport will serve as a key ingredient of this program. Finally, recognizing the&lt;br/&gt;natural topological extension of homotopic lobe dynamics to higher dimensional spaces,&lt;br/&gt;this proposal will address the challenge of chaotic transport in more than two degrees of&lt;br/&gt;freedom, for which far fewer techniques currently exist.</AbstractNarration>
