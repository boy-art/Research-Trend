    <AbstractNarration>In this CAREER award, Prof. David Rueda of Wayne State University and his graduate and undergraduate research students will develop new technology based on the combination of single molecule fluorescence detection with laser induced temperature jump (T-jump) thermal denaturation to study the structural dynamics of RNA molecules. The goal of the research is to understand how functional and structural heterogeneity in single RNA molecules affect the structure-function relationship in biologically important RNAs, as well as to establish a set of physical and chemical rules based upon this knowledge to engineer RNAs with useful applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to his research activities, Prof. Rueda will work with high school teachers in the predominantly African-American Detroit School District, through the Wayne State University Department of Education and the Office of Minority Student Initiatives. The bulk of this effort will be focused on developing a summer research program for high school science teachers. This project aims at filling an important gap in the continuous education program of high school science teachers by providing them with first hand experiences in a modern laboratory. Integration of research and education will also be achieved by actively supporting graduate, undergraduate and high school student training in the research laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
