    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing annual scholarship support for 30-35 engineering technology students enrolled either in a "2+2" program for Associates/Bachelors degree recipients or a traditional four-year baccalaureate degree program. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its focus on engineering technology, for which there is a critical shortage of workers in the region surrounding the grantee institution. Additional meritorious aspects of the project are in the comprehensive student support activities, including a summer bridge program to develop a sense of community among each year's scholars; a follow-on first-year seminar for scholars; critical support for students in introductory mathematics courses (tutoring, use of the ALEKS system for on-line help, and a "Math through the Real World" lab); and active mentoring by upper-level student peers and faculty. The broader impacts of the project are felt through its positive influence on regional economic development, especially in a "high tech" area. Strong administrative endorsement of the project is also having a positive effect on faculty involvement in the effort as mentors and sponsors of undergraduate research projects. Finally, the institution is leveraging the scholarships to continue its strong record of placing students in employment upon graduation.</AbstractNarration>
