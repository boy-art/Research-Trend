    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports Professor Jian Li at Arizona State University to develop a range of stable metal-complex and polymeric materials as active materials for photovoltaic applications. The proposed metal-complex absorbers will be designed to have extended absorption spectra, resulting in an improved matching to the solar source, and modified exciton properties of organic absorbers due to the incorporation of metal ions, which will lead to long exciton diffusion lengths in the materials. Specific research aims include: (1) synthesizing novel organic/organometallic compounds and studying their photophysical and electrochemical properties; (2) measuring the charge mobility and exciton diffusion length of the proposed materials, and correlating the structural changes of materials and properties of organic thin films; (3) studying the mechanisms and processes of charge transport and energy transfer in the organic solids; (4) achieving organic photovoltaic cells with 10% power conversion efficiency or higher at the end of this program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research directly addresses some critical challenges in improving the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells. Students working on this project will learn modern organic synthesis, device physics and engineering, as well as materials and device characterization. The educational aims include: (1) developing an educational module on solar electricity to reach a large number of K-8 students and teachers (over 20,000 per year); (2) outreach to local high schools by providing summer mentorship and creating educational modules for high school advanced-placement classes. The educational module, Solar Electricity, will be integrated with current existing Science is Fun program. This program trains undergraduate interns to visit more than 70 schools annually and give several hundred presentations to over 20,000 students and teachers. Educational outreach will target key underrepresented groups, including minority as well as female students.</AbstractNarration>
