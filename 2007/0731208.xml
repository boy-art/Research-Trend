    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop sensors that are capable of detecting improvised explosives based on peroxides. The ever-increasing use of such explosives by terrorist organizations and the paucity of suitable detection devices make this an important objective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project will take successful technology developed for neutralization of terrorist explosives and apply it to the development of sensors for the detection of explosives. The sensors that will be developed will be atypical because they will be capable of identifying both peroxide-based explosives and conventional nitroorganic explosives. The developed technology will also offer a solution to detecting and eliminating peroxides that form in laboratory solvents. The sensor devices that will be developed will range from very sensitive and robust electronic colorimetric, and fluorescent sensors to simple test strips and inks that can confirm the identity of peroxide explosives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts, Technological: &lt;br/&gt;The developed technology could be modified in future research to detect other chemicals by changing the surface catalysts. The experimentation will also advance our understanding of nanoparticle synthesis, reactivity, and surface properties. The research will likely have a widespread and lasting positive impact on the safety and use of laboratory solvents, especially in the area of trace analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts, Educational: &lt;br/&gt;The students will undergo rotation through the two constituent laboratories to gain experience in all aspects of the proposed research. The project will also provide lectures in nanotechnology in conjunction with the Oklahoma Nanonet Initiative (a NSF EPSCOR project. Public outreach will also be conducted through a web-site and general lectures concerning nanotechnology presented at local high schools and other venues such as AP Teacher Training Institutes. A contribution will also be made to Stillwater's Children's Museum Without Walls that takes displays to school.</AbstractNarration>
