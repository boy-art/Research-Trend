    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and commercialize advanced nanochannel array reactors for efficient and cost-effective fuel reforming for fuel cells and other applications. Conventional reformers have significant performance, size, reliability and cost issues that prevent broad-scale introduction of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell systems, especially in the portable power market segment. To overcome these limitations, a highly innovative approach based on the nanoporous ceramics is being pursued to create ultra-light and ultra-compact reactors. That approach was successfully validated during Phase I. The results unequivocally demonstrated the feasibility of methanol reforming and confirmed the strong competitive advantages of the proposed architecture over conventional reactors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phase II aims to develop application-specific reactor prototypes and to initiate their integration into PEM fuel cell systems. The expected outcome will be a manufacturing technology for low-cost and compact yet highly efficient and reliable reactors for point-of-use hydrogen generation. This technology has a potential to facilitate the development of more affordable fuel cell power system for broader government, commercial and consumer applications, especially in the portable power (0.1-1kW) market segments, and will benefit our society by contributing to energy security and availability of environmentally friendly energy solutions.</AbstractNarration>
