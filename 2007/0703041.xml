    <AbstractNarration>As an NSF ATE Center for Excellence, the National Center for Telecommunications Technology (NCTT) has led the development of work-relevant, industry-validated Information and Communications Technology (ICT) curricula and materials for use in programs spanning Grade 11 through community college and four-year college levels. NCTT has now established formal regional partnerships with 10 academic institutions in different regions of the U.S and is reviewing partnership opportunities with a number of other institutions. NCTT has also provided extensive opportunities for faculty professional growth including workshops, seminars, emerging web-based content, and career awareness for both traditional and non-traditional learners in ICT disciplines. Strategic partnerships have been forged with business, industry and academic organizations to develop a nationally validated set of ICT skill standards. The unique content and curriculum developed by NCTT integrates engineering technology and skill standards and continues to be math and science focused. This project builds upon those activities to transition technician education to the next level in addressing the workforce skills and needs of the ICT industry. NCTT establishes a Workforce Development Enterprise Community of Practice that integrates workforce, business, educational institutions and learners to determine the competencies needed by technicians who can work effectively in an environment of connected technologies - in which information technologies are integrated with diverse communications technologies. Also established is an open content system to develop and modify new curricula as a result of interactions with each other and with industry. Dissemination of information is through workshops and use of emerging technologies.</AbstractNarration>
