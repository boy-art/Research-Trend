    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will support the initiation of a concept for courses at the interface of engineering and science and ethics. Educating students and faculty to regard attentively ethical determinations entails organizing hands-on coursework that demonstrate how the choices involved in the many activities associated with the research and professional practices of scientists and engineers should be framed in ethical parameters. These parameters are further determined by cultural and socio-political conditions that differentiate both needs and expectations. The plan will engage philosophy faculty, along with engineering and industry and policy professional. The focus for the first course will be issues related to computer technology development and use. Faculty will be engaged from around the El Paso region, enable participation by a number of Universities. In the interdisciplinary, international, and multi-cultural formal planned, an essential task will be to come to terms with the ethical nature of how each of the several other participants plays roles in defining identity and tasks. Additional relevant issues will be identified with an Advisory team. A summer seminar will begin the cross-disciplinary exploration.</AbstractNarration>
