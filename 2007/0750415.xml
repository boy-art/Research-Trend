    <AbstractNarration>This research project, directed by Professor Igor Rubtsov and supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is aimed at developing a novel relaxation-assisted two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy method (RA 2DIR) relevant to chemistry and biochemistry that will be useful for structural measurements for various organic and inorganic molecular systems. The method permits measuring long-range bond connectivity patterns in complex molecules. The project will aim at understanding the transport of vibrational energy in molecules on angstrom scales in various structural motifs, which is essential for practical use and further development of the RA 2DIR method. The correlations of the observables of RA 2DIR, such as energy arrival times, with the distances between the vibrational modes will be targeted. It is the Rubtsov team's goal to develop RA 2DIR into a routine analytical technique for the structural characterization of molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several undergraduate and five graduate students will be trained in this research program and benefit from this interdisciplinary project. The PI will implement the new discoveries resulting from this project in the course on Molecular Spectroscopy and will design an experiment on 2DIR spectroscopy which will be a part of the course on Instrumental Analysis taught annually for undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
