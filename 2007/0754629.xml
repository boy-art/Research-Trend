    <AbstractNarration>Pawluk&lt;br/&gt;0754629&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphical visual representations of objects and scenes have always been important for conveying unfamiliar information: from teaching a young child new vocabulary words, to introducing a worker to new machinery or devices, to learning about a faraway city to go to on vacation. These representations are also very valuable in creative environments, such as when artisans must imagine design patterns or engineers new devices they are developing. Unfortunately, for individuals who are blind or visually impaired, there are a dearth of tools and appropriate representations to provide them with access to this type of graphical information, which is commonly available in their environments. This lack of access affects these individuals beginning at a very young age and progresses cumulatively over their lifetime. It likely explains, at least in part, the very high unemployment rate of 74% for individuals who are blind or visually impaired, which is significantly above the rate for those with other disabilities. The most frequent method of representing 2-D graphical information for individuals who are blind or visually impaired is the use of static raised-line drawings. However, this method is very poor in relaying information in unconstrained tasks, such as understanding unfamiliar objects and object scenes. More recently, a more effective, textured-enriched graphical representation has been proposed as an alternative. This method uses texture to encode critical picture information (i.e., the separation of objects into their subparts, and the orientation of their parts) that is otherwise very difficult to obtain. The general objective of this proposal is to develop a system to maximize the transfer of information using these textured-enriched graphics by developing: (1) a cost-effective, portable and easy to maintain dynamic tactile device capable of presenting a range of textures; and (2) an appropriate texture set to use on the device for encoding purposes, which maximizes its discriminability even under tactile masking and adaptation effects. Both the device and the textures will be designed to maintain the advantages of texture enriched graphics, over raised-line drawings, of being able to immediately provide encoded information on contact (through texture) and in parallel across the fingers, while avoiding the costs and bulkiness of static production methods. The display and texture set will also be developed with feedback from the community of people who are blind or visually impaired, and validated experimentally. The proposed research will assist in the development of an active partnership between the PI and the community of people who are blind or visually impaired, and their teachers, through several organizations. The PI?s laboratory will further be developed as a place where students who are blind or visually impaired can effectively engage in research, whether for this project or any other. This project will also include training of both graduate and undergraduate students in understanding the needs of the community of people who are blind or visually impaired.</AbstractNarration>
