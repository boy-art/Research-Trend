    <AbstractNarration>Supernovae are involved in many of the most pressing current questions in astrophysics. In particular, Type Ia supernovae are called on to provide much of the iron in the Universe, and their bright, almost uniform explosions allow the mapping of the Universe''s expansion. In spite of this importance, the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae are still not unambiguously identified, and the explosion mechanism itself is poorly understood. But several trends in recent years have brought new hope of progress. On the theoretical front, progenitor systems involving a single degenerate star accreting from a companion have been shown to produce a strong, fast wind for substantial periods of time before the explosion. The effects of this wind on the system''s surroundings, and on the companion star itself, have not yet been well modeled. At the same time, evidence has been mounting that at least a few Type Ia supernovae do involve interaction with circumstellar material, while high-velocity absorption lines are now commonly seen in Type Ia spectra. Light (and infrared) echos have been seen from a few Type Ia systems, indicating in some cases dust quite close to the supernova. Finally, supernova remnants are revealing far more about their birth events than had been thought possible, primarily through X-ray spectroscopy. Evidence of ejecta is clearly seen in significant numbers of remnants with ages up to and beyond 10,000 years. In addition, some supernova remnants, such as Kepler''s, show clear evidence for prior interaction with a dense circumstellar medium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These tantalizing clues may hold the key to the nature of not just a few anomalous Type Ia supernovae, but of the entire Type Ia phenomenon. In this project, Dr. Reynolds and collaborators will undertake a series of multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations designed to connect the progenitor systems, the supernovae themselves, and their remnants. The effect of a fast white-dwarf wind on the companion and on surrounding material will be studied in order to characterize the immediate pre-supernova environment. Model explosions will be set off in the midst of these environments to identify optical, infrared, and radio clues to the interaction with circumstellar material, both to explain observed systems and to interpret upper limits when emission is not seen. The supernovae will be numerically evolved to the age of young supernova remnants such as Kepler, to compare with their structure, and then followed to much larger ages, to compare with several Magellanic Cloud remnants which seemingly require strong circumstellar interaction to explain their X-ray properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work will have broad applicability. The question of the nature of Type Ia supernova origins is connected with some of the most significant questions in astronomy today, with implications for galactic chemical evolution as well as cosmology. This work will allow a much tighter connection to be drawn between supernova remnants, the supernovae that produce them, and the progenitors of those supernovae, to the mutual benefit of all three areas of research. Graduate students, undergraduates, and high-school students will be involved in all aspects of this work. The results of this research will also be used by Dr. Reynolds and collaborators in their continued outreach efforts to groups from amateur astronomers to elementary-school children.</AbstractNarration>
