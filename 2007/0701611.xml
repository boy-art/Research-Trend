    <AbstractNarration>This Grant continues an ongoing program to develop fundamental theories of many-particle systems, ranging from nuclei and nuclear matter to cold atoms, with applications to astrophysical and condensed matter systems. The nuclear program includes studies of the equation of state of nuclear matter, including finite temperature, and superfluidity in nuclear matter, aiming more generally to understand the properties of matter under extreme conditions of density and temperature. It applies nuclear theory to neutron stars and supernovae, with the aim of understanding observations and, conversely, using observations to learn the properties of matter. A major focus is on understanding new states of matter formed under extreme conditions, especially quark gluon plasmas produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. The research on atomic Bose-Einstein and superfluid Fermi systems, a vital facet of the study of unusual states of matter, focuses on atomic states at low temperature, as well as under extreme rotation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The nuclear and atomic systems being studied are very unusual many-particle systems that provide broad intellectual insights. By working across the boundaries between nuclear and atomic physics, this program enables the building of bridges and cross-fertilization between the warmest and coldest many-particle systems in the universe. A vital component of this research program is the training young scientists who, through the broad training they receive and their intimate involvement in the research of the PIs and colleagues, develop the ability to combine nuclear, particle, astro, condensed matter and cold atom physics research on forefront problems. The scientists trained in this program generally go on to have significant impact in research at U.S. universities and national laboratories, as well as abroad.</AbstractNarration>
