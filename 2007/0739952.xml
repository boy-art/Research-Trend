    <AbstractNarration>Baker, Lawrence A., PI&lt;br/&gt;University of Minnesota-Twin Cities&lt;br/&gt;0739952&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop: The Water Environment of Cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cindy M. Lee, Program Director, (703) 292-5356&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop, which will advance a holistic, interdisciplinary approach for managing the urban water environment that recognizes water as a core organizing concept for urban design, will bring together experts in surface and groundwater hydrology, civil and environmental engineering, environmental policy, urban planning, law, geomorphology, and recreation management. The workshop will be held in late 2007. Several of the participants are currently involved in writing a text book, The Water Environment of Cities, aimed at graduate students in disciplines involved with water resources management, planning, and sustainability. The authors and respondents, which include practitioners, will address the following key themes (1) water scarcity, (2) multiple uses of water, (3) water management institutions, (4) formation on new knowledge, (5) sustainability, and (6) resilience. Outcomes include a synthesis chapter for the text, a report on the workshop, and a journal article that will propose an agenda for future research in sustainable water resources. The broader impacts of the workshop include the resulting graduate text that will bring a holistic approach to the need for sustainable water resources for the world's growing urban populations.</AbstractNarration>
