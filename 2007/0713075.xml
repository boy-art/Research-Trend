    <AbstractNarration>Recent advances in smart Electro-active Polymers (EAP) have created a unique opportunity to design true biologically-inspired robots. However, the ionic EAP actuator has been observed by many researchers that the wiring power line, to the respective electrode surface, is challenging, especially in multi-segment design applications and micro-scale actuation. In order to adequately design robust robotic systems that can be adaptable to a variety of unstructured and tortuous environmental conditions, it is necessary to have breakthroughs in the intelligent power supply and the control unit. In this proposal, we introduce an innovative approach to use a wireless link between EAP based target locomotion units and a remote control/power unit. The remote unit can provide necessary intelligence to the target locomotion units by modulating both frequency and amplitude of the microwave to selectively actuate a different segment of the EAP actuator by using a specially coded patch antenna pattern on the electrode surface of the actuator. The proposed microwave control systems have a wide spectrum of future engineering applications where proper intelligence capabilities need to be provided to the local locomotion unit. The success of the proposal can lead to the development of Integrative Biomimetics cluster that will provide necessary foundation for education and outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>
