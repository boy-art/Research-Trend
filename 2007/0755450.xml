    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics at the University of Wyoming will host a three-year REU-site program for sophomores and junior engineering, science, or mathematics majors. The site will create a stimulating environment for in-depth exploration of significant mathematical problems, and will encourage students to pursue graduate education and/or careers in mathematically oriented fields through an extended field trip to the National Center for Atmospheric Research, presentations and activities from representatives of the National Security Agency, and discussions with graduate students and &lt;br/&gt;each REU-participant will engage a significant mathematical problem in depth, practice communicating technical ideas orally amongst team members and in formal presentations, and produce a well-written report. It is expected that in some cases the student teams will produced refereed journal articles as a result of their summer projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed REU-site will (a) broaden the participation of underrepresented groups by actively recruiting women and minorities, and by will provide new opportunities for students in the Rocky Mountain region who currently have few regional REU opportunities, and many of whom are schools without a strong research or graduate program emphasis, (b) encourage student participants to pursue graduate education and/or careers in mathematically oriented fields through meaningful research experiences, and professional development, and (c) strengthen existing collaborations between universities and colleges in the Rocky Mountain region, and relations between the University of Wyoming and both NCAR and NSA.</AbstractNarration>
