    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program at the National Science Foundation for this new award, Professor Felicia Etzkorn, of the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, will develop new materials inspired by the molecular structure of the biopolymer, collagen. This research in the laboratories of Professor Felicia Etzkorn in the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Tech will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the molecular forces that cause formation of the collagen triple helix, while leading to interesting new materials with potential bioengineering applications. Collagen?s unique macroscopic properties of strength and flexibility make it an attractive target for mimicry. The basic sequence of collagen that promotes triple helix formation is: glycine-proline-hydroxyproline (Gly-Pro-Hyp). Both Gly-Pro and Xaa-Hyp sequences are required to be in the trans conformation for the triple helix. The materials were designed to stabilize the collagen triple helix structure by replacement of the key Gly-trans-Pro amide bond with a Gly-trans-Pro alkene isostere to decrease the entropy of folding. Peptides with alkene isostere replacements will be synthesized to elucidate the physical and structural perturbations introduced by the substitution. Polymer synthesis experiments will follow two threads: polymer length, and triple helix stabilization. These materials will be characterized for stability and for mechanical strength and biocompatibility by a collaborator, Prof. Joseph Freeman. Once stable, folded collagen-like polymers have been synthesized, alternative tripeptide monomers will be introduced including charged residues: Lys, Arg, and Glu, to bind counterions in processes similar to biomineralization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Etkorn will make contributions to society through education, dissemination of results, and applications. Both graduate and undergraduate students will continue to be trained during their contributions to the project. The Etzkorn group has had success recruiting female, minority, and underprivileged students, each of whom has pursued a career in scientific research or professional school. This project will continue to recruit one underrepresented undergraduate student each summer through the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The primary collaborator on this project, Joseph Freeman, is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Virginia Tech who is African-American. The broader impact of this research will continue to focus on applications of these new materials in bioengineering, and be disseminated through presentations at national meetings, publication of original research, and review articles in high quality journals, and patent applications. The results of this basic research into the fundamental properties of collagen, and the development of synthetic collagen-inspired materials are expected to lead to new and exciting applications.</AbstractNarration>
