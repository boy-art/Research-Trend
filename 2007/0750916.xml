    <AbstractNarration>In the context of climate change, detecting long-term modulations in the general circulation and in the global transport of tracers is important, but it is made difficult by the low signal-to-noise ratio. Dr. Nakamura will alleviate this problem by introducing a new partition between the eddies and the background flow and their interaction. Preliminary results using this novel method have been obtained, and a global, multi-year amplification of the eddies and jets, over the period 2001-5 is revealed. This amplification is not detected using traditional methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This method will be applied to meteorological analyses and to long-term climate-model simulations under global warming scenarios, to measure the frequency and intensity of modulations of the general circulation. Idealized models (shallow water and two-level models) will be employed to explore the dynamics that underlies such modulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effects of jets and their modulations on global mixing properties will be studied using a passive tracer subject to advection by the observed large-scale flow together with small-scale diffusivity. The decay rate of the variance of the tracer is a metric of global mixing, and contributions from the jet regions to the decay rate will be quantified with a new diagnostic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will provide a new diagnostic platform for the tropospheric general circulation and transport, suitable for the detection of long-term shifts in the climatic regime. The Lagrangian-mean approach bypasses the complication of eddy-mean flow interaction in the traditional sense, and it allows simpler interpretations in terms of nonconservative processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this activity are that the diagnostic framework can be applied to a wide class of flows, including the stratosphere, troposphere, possibly the oceans, and numerical simulations. Two graduate students will be supported.</AbstractNarration>
