    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project integrates technological, business, and legal topics in Information Assurance and Security (IAS) into courses across schools of engineering, business, and law. The project enhances communication and interaction among faculties of these schools by having a synergistic effect on collaborative activities, promoting effective instruction, and supporting rapid dissemination and adaptation of successful educational innovations in IAS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three courses are being revised that incorporate this integrative approach: Computer Communications (in a School of Engineering), Data and Process Modeling (in a School of Business Administration), and Cybercrimes (in a School of Law). Interdisciplinary educational materials on security, business, and law are also being developed, incorporating lecture notes, presentation slides, experiments, demonstrations, and course projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hands-on experiences in IAS are supported by means of the Portable Educational Network (PEN) platform developed in a prior NSF-supported project. The PEN platform provides a realistic training and education environment for students in engineering and a concrete experience in protecting computer systems from attack for students in business and law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be made available to a broad collection of constituencies, including educators, government information assurance officers, industry information professionals, undergraduate students, and pre-college students and their parents.</AbstractNarration>
