    <AbstractNarration>Neuropeptides are known to regulate social behaviors in representative species from all vertebrate classes. Species differences in behavior, however, have made development of clear mechanistic models difficult. This project investigates the complexity of behavioral mechanisms using a combination of field experiments and computational models. Field studies address important emerging questions on neuropeptide modulation of female affiliative behaviors. Synthetic experiments with agent-based models allow exploration of conditions impractical or impossible in empirical tests. The models are expected to propose new mechanisms for neuropeptide control of behavior. This project thus implements a tight experiment-model-experiment loop and develops a new paradigm for a systems biology approach to understanding social behavior. Neuropeptides can alter a variety of vertebrate social behaviors, including parental, aggressive, and reproductive behaviors. Specifically, this project will determine the effects of vasotocin on female phonotaxis in gray treefrogs and subsequently a computational model for phonotaxis that can make predictions as to how neuropeptides influence social behavior will be developed. This model will then be tested under natural conditions for verification. Results from these studies will significantly advance our understanding of the effect of neuropeptides on female behavioral plasticity. This project also includes a significant training component, with involvement of an undergraduate field biology class (populated with 30% under-represented minorities) and training of a post-doctoral fellow and graduate student in a unique inter-disciplinary environment. In addition, a new course on modeling approaches to behavioral sciences will be developed.</AbstractNarration>
