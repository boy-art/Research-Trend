    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a fundamentally new technique for building biocompatible microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The approach is to use soft biomaterials such as hydrogels (for which host compatibility has been widely studied) as the basis material for building MEMS components in advanced devices. Implantable devices have a wide range of medical use, but one of the most persistent challenges with conventional MEMS materials has been to resist biofouling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This research aims to develop a new coherent strategy for using biomaterials as the basis material for constructing MEMS devices. This research proposal is innovative in developing new techniques in multi-cycle fabrication of spatially complex microstructures, interfacing of multiple 3D hydrogel components, and construction of cell-encapsulated microdevices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This project will achieve broader impact at Columbia University, the New York City area, and broader society through three mechanisms. 1) A new undergraduate course at Columbia University on bioMEMS will be developed. 2) The latest MEMS research will be incorporated into educational modules for underrepresented K-12 students from New York City, and for New York high-school students through a teacher education program. 3) Translation of MEMS research into medical products that will benefit society will be promoted by fostering interactions between industrial researchers and undergraduate students. Also, MEMS research projects will be incorporated into international collaborations, including those with researchers from Asia and Africa.</AbstractNarration>
