    <AbstractNarration>The VIGRE program in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Georgia (UGA) will recruit and train mathematical scientists from the US to meet the demands of the scientific workplace in the 21st century. Our program will focus on the integration of research and education at all levels. Through our vertically integrated research groups (VRGs) there will be dynamic research environments where faculty, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates can make discoveries and produce publishable results. &lt;br/&gt;In conjunction with our core mathematics curriculum and VRGs, we will provide additional professional development opportunities for our students and postdocs through our summer training program, industrial internships, MEFT (Mathematicians Educating Future Teachers) training program and professional development workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With solid training and mentorship we will produce high quality graduates and postdocs for the mathematical science and teaching workforce. We will continue to develop the VRG model which has transformed graduate education at UGA and has the promise of being implemented at a other academic institutions. Our graduates with their collaborative VIGRE experience will be able to transfer this knowledge and expertise in their various professional career paths. Within our summer training program, we will hold a yearly Summer School Program. The mini-courses in this program, intended for for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, will introduce foundational concepts and recent advances in a particular area. Our Internship and Interdisplinary Outreach Program will foster interdisciplinary research at all levels though by building contacts between our department with academic, industrial, and government agencies. Furthermore, our MEFT Program will have a positive impact at the local area schools as well as on the nationwide level by preparing students and postdocs to effectively teach K-12 teachers.</AbstractNarration>
