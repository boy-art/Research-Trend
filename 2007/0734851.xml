    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0734851&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Benson Farb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference ""Geometry, Rigidity, and Group Actions"" will bring&lt;br/&gt;together researchers in a cluster of fields related to actions of&lt;br/&gt;lattices in semisimple Lie groups. The subject's roots concern&lt;br/&gt;linear representations of lattices, but developments in the past&lt;br/&gt;two decades have established strong connections with a variety of&lt;br/&gt;other topics, including ergodic theory, dynamics of group actions&lt;br/&gt;on compact manifolds, differential geometry, spaces of&lt;br/&gt;non-positive curvature, geometric group theory, symplectic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, algebraic groups, unitary representation theory,&lt;br/&gt;operator algebras, and group cohomology. Our lectures will&lt;br/&gt;include contributions from all of these areas. We are holding&lt;br/&gt;the conference on the occasion of Robert J. Zimmer's 60th&lt;br/&gt;birthday, in recognition of his work's dramatic impact on the&lt;br/&gt;growth of this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The speaker list of this conference cuts across a variety of&lt;br/&gt;closely related areas of mathematics, and will present&lt;br/&gt;participants with the opportunity to learn about recent&lt;br/&gt;developments, important open questions, and the wide variety of&lt;br/&gt;successful techniques that are being applied. New developments&lt;br/&gt;are emerging rapidly and involve ideas from disparate areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, so conferences of this type are necessary to keep&lt;br/&gt;established researchers up to date, and are even more valuable&lt;br/&gt;for young researchers who are entering this fast-paced,&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research area. A Sunday-afternoon workshop will&lt;br/&gt;provide younger scholars with an opportunity to present their&lt;br/&gt;work and discuss it with other conference participants.&lt;br/&gt;Additional information is available from the conference web site&lt;br/&gt;at http://www.math.uchicago.edu/zimmer60/</AbstractNarration>
