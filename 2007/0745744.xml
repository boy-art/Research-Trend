    <AbstractNarration>The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) has operated Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) since July 1, 1997. This project continues NSF support of that facility, and is motivated by BBSO having reached the final stage in building its 1.6 meter aperture off-axis New Solar Telescope (NST). The NST will become an essential test-bed for the US solar physics community's planned 4-meter Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI will complete the integration of the NST's visible and near infrared vector magnetograph systems, as well as the commissioning of the telescope to its full scientific capability. The PI's team will exploit NST observations in the visible and near IR for a variety of solar physics research programs. These NST observations will make possible high-cadence and high-resolution studies of solar flare emissions, sub-arc-second resolution studies of the quiet solar atmosphere (focusing on measurements of the transverse magnetic field component, which is weaker than intra-network fields), investigations of the energy sources of coronal heating, comprehensive studies of vector magnetic fields associated with flares, and investigations of plasma flow fields in flare-productive active regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BBSO's high quality data and analytical tools are routinely utilized by the space weather forecasting community. BBSO is a leader in the US community for developing the next generation of solar instrumentation and training the next generation of solar physicists. About 30% of NJIT students in this field are women. BBSO is a key part of NJIT's integrated approach to space physics research and education, with graduate student research and dissertation opportunities supported throughout this project.</AbstractNarration>
