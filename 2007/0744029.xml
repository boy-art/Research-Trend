    <AbstractNarration>RNAi is the process by which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing. Remarkably, in C. elegans and other organisms, dsRNA-mediated gene silencing can spread between cells and tissues within the organism and can even be transmitted to progeny in a phenomenon known as systemic RNAi. Further investigation of this phenomenon may uncover novel roles for intercellular RNA transport in cell-to-cell signaling during development and other important physiological processes. For example, systemic RNAi in plants transports antiviral silencing signals ahead of an incipient infection, thereby providing immunity to uninfected cells. Specific goals include identifying and characterizing genes required for distinct transport steps, such as export and inter-tissue transport, and genes that function to regulate RNA transport. The long-term goals of this research into systemic RNAi are to understand how dsRNA is transported, how transport is regulated, and to determine the significance of dsRNA transport in animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RNA interference refers to a means by which cells use an RNA-based signal to target genes for silencing. In plants and a few investigated animals, this silencing signal is transported between cells. In plants this cell-to-cell silencing is important for anti-viral immunity but a function for the spreading in animals is unknown. The focus of this study is to identify proteins that regulate and mediate the transport of silencing signals between cells in animals. In addition to the scientific findings, the project will result in the training of future scientist and educators.</AbstractNarration>
