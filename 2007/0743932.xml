    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry supports work by Professor Uwe Burghaus at North Dakota State University Fargo to characterize the adsorption dynamics of small molecules (carbon monoxide, dioxide and oxygen) on Cu and Au model array catalysts which are pertinent for the petroleum industry and the cleaning of exhaust pollution, and to clarify with molecular beam scattering the catalytic activity and particle size, as well as support effects, in the CO oxidation reaction mechanism. This reaction is one of the most important prototypes of bimolecular surface reactions. The knowledge gained will promote catalyst improvements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a large number of students recruited from diverse locations including graduate students from NDSU, undergraduates from tribal colleges, and students from a local non Ph.D. granting college. Some of the experiments will be conducted as part of a physical chemistry laboratory class providing an introduction about nanoscience and kinetics to the students. A related off-campus hands-on class will be taught at a Native American community college (Sunday Academy).</AbstractNarration>
