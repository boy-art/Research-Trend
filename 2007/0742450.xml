    <AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0742450&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Robert Newton &lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Learning through Ecology and Environmental Field Studies (LEEFS) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GK-12 award provides funding for 9 Fellows each year to work with 12 teachers in New York City Title 1 schools. The teachers will be selected from a total of eight middle schools and four high schools. In addition, teachers from one high schools located in the Dominican Republic will participate in the program. The program is designed around the theme: Learning through Ecology and Environmental Field Studies (LEEFS). The LEEFS project integrates and expands on existing partnerships between units of the Columbia University Earth Institute and New York City Title 1 schools. Graduate Fellows and grade 6-12 teachers will work together for four to eight weeks prior to the school year in a program of field science internships, professional development, and curriculum planning and creation. During the academic year, direct support is supplied to partnering schools in field and laboratory science: weekly on-site presence of Fellows and assistance in field and laboratory locations. Innovative aspects include: the intensity of integration of teachers and their students into field research in an urban setting; the close linkage of LEEFS with the NYC Department of Education initiatives toward inquiry-driven, hands-on, experiential learning of science for the general student population; near real-time access to LEEFS field data collection; and extension of the Program to research and education in the Dominican Republic. The program actualizes recent pedagogical research indicating unique benefits from field based learning; it contributes to several NSF-funded field programs; and it explores innovative ways to augment graduate student education. LEEFS will also impact the high-needs schools in the New York area and will provide an international connection for participating Fellows and teachers.</AbstractNarration>
