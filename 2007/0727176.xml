    <AbstractNarration>Ten academically talented, financially needy students majoring in chemistry or physics are receiving scholarships of $10,000 annually for four years. The students are recruited from City of Philadelphia high schools with majority enrollments of minorities and a high percentage of students eligible for free or reduced cost lunches. Approximately fifty high school students with an interest in science are being identified and invited with their parents to attend information meetings to learn about the scholarship availability and the application procedures. Potential S-STEM scholars are identified by their teachers and participation in either Science in Motion or the Kaczmarczik lecture series. These programs are intended for high school students and their teachers. All scholars participate in three six-month Co-operative education experiences as an employee in a company or government organization doing work directly related to the student's major.</AbstractNarration>
