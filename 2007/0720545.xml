    <AbstractNarration>Sensor networks are considered one of the "10 Emerging Technologies That Will Change the World". Teaching sensor network concepts is challenging because the field draws upon a disparate set of computing disciplines. For sensor network programming education, some "tutorials" exist, but their target audience is largely graduate students and professional researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs' experience shows that the presentation of these tutorials is difficult for undergraduate students as they do not have the prerequisite knowledge necessary. In the past, no lab exercises were available that are appropriate for activity-based teaching of this new and exciting field to undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fill this void, this CSR-CSI project is developing exemplary laboratory exercises at two institutions: Lewis &amp; Clark College, a small private liberal arts institution, and Portland State University, a Ph.D.-granting research university. With input from students, industrial advisors, and an educational consultant, the PIs are developing exemplary lab exercises, identifying topics that are appropriate, clarifying prerequisite knowledge and preparatory material, and presenting the material in a format that is suitable for undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this work are in clarifying the prerequisite knowledge to employing and programming sensor networks, and building a foundation for teaching these topics to undergraduates. This project also enriches the scientific and engineering research capability of the US, and provide undergraduates with activity-based learning. The effectiveness of the materials is tested on undergraduates at institutions serving a large population of minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>
