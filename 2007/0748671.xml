    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award is co-funded by the Electronic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research and the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The project is to study charge carrier dynamics in organic semiconductors on the macroscopic and microscopic levels with the final goal of developing methodology for utilizing charge-transfer processes in single-molecule optoelectronic devices. Mechanisms of intermolecular charge transfer responsible for conductivity will be investigated using a combination of photoconductivity techniques: time-resolved luminescence, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, and electric force microscopy. The project is to study functionalized polyacenes and anthradithiophenes. It aims (i) to establish mechanisms of charge photogeneration, transport and trapping and to model the photoconductive performance; (ii) to observe and characterize charge trapping and detrapping processes on the single molecule level; (iii) to measure charge carrier mobility on the microscopic scales and its dependence on local environment; and (iv) to design single-molecule devices based on charge trapping properties.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance, and is expected to provide new scientific understanding of organic semiconductors, which have potential applications in thin-film transistors, light emitting diodes, solar cells, and lasers. The research component of the project is integrated with the educational component that will aim to achieve four main goals: (i) to provide learning and research experience to undergraduate and high-school students through their involvement in the research group activities; (ii) to introduce research context in the curriculum, to develop a novel course in advanced optical materials and a web-based tutorial illustrating physics and applications of organic optical materials; (iii) to provide exposure to modern science and technology for general public; and (iv) to attract women to careers in physics.</AbstractNarration>
