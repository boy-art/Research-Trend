    <AbstractNarration>This award supports theoretical and computational research on&lt;br/&gt;thermoelectric materials. In these materials, the flow of heat and&lt;br/&gt;electric charge are linked in a way that makes it possible to convert&lt;br/&gt;electrical current into heat flow for cooling purposes, or to convert&lt;br/&gt;heat flow into electrical current for power generation. Thermoelectric&lt;br/&gt;devices are already used in specialized applications, but improved&lt;br/&gt;materials that allow more efficient device operation are needed. This&lt;br/&gt;project will use theory and computation to search for novel materials&lt;br/&gt;with improved thermoelectric properties for cooling applications. The&lt;br/&gt;research will address the roles of both electrons and lattice vibrations&lt;br/&gt;in the transport of heat and electric charge in thermoelectric&lt;br/&gt;materials. Materials with strong electron-electron interactions will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated, both in bulk form, as well as in artificially engineered&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures. The goal is to develop efficient and accurate&lt;br/&gt;computational methods that can be used to identify promising classes of&lt;br/&gt;materials that optimize competing factors relevant for cooling and to&lt;br/&gt;elucidate ways in which nanostructures can be used to modify both charge&lt;br/&gt;and heat flow to improve thermoelectric performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the training of graduate students, both in the&lt;br/&gt;academic research environment and in the industrial R&amp;D context. The&lt;br/&gt;project also provides research experiences for undergraduate students,&lt;br/&gt;and supports the continued development and assessment of a course in&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics and materials science for non-science students. A&lt;br/&gt;related outreach program will introduce the wonders of the quantum world&lt;br/&gt;to elementary-school students.</AbstractNarration>
