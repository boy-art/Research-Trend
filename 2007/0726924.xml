    <AbstractNarration>The University of California San Diego is awarded a grant to host an internship and mentoring program for graduate students in science and engineering. The program is designed to encourage doctoral students to incorporate CI tools and HPC in their research, and to build communities to further expand the application of CI tools in their field. The internships will be held at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, a world-renowned high performance computing (HPC) scientific resource center and resource provider (RP) site in the national TeraGrid, from July 1, to September 8, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following an introduction to the wide applications and uses of CI tools in research, the students will work with researchers and staff at SDSC to incorporate CI tools into their own field of research. The program is analogous to the SDSC Strategic Applications Collaborations (SAC) program, by which SDSC develops new applications and CI tools for professional scientists. A team of graduate students will work with an SDSC specialist in bioinformatics, who will present the students with challenges typical of their research field and coach them through the process of developing a CI or HPC-based solution.</AbstractNarration>
