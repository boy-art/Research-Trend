    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing scholarships to engineering technology students. Twenty scholarships of $2500 are being awarded to students recruited from a number of high schools and technical education programs in the local region. The selected students are earning associates, baccalaureate or graduate degrees, thereby preparing them for entry into the engineering technology workforce. The university is providing student support services such as mentoring, tutoring and career guidance. The students are also forming a learning community, greatly enhancing their probability of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diverse groups of faculty are guiding the scholarship students. As students are being recruited from an existing pre-college program, the diversity of the scholars is also enhanced. With the faculty and students participating as members of a diverse team, the project leaders are seeing an increase in teamwork skills, communication skills, as well as a greater acceptance and appreciation for cultural diversity. Graduates from this program are being highly recruited by local industry as they are being seen as effective engineers with the skills to be a part of a diverse, well-functioning team.</AbstractNarration>
