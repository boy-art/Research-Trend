    <AbstractNarration>This program is focused on three critical areas: (1) the recruitment of academically-talented students in Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Earth Science, Engineering Technology, Math and Physics using the existing science contests and the ACE (Advanced College Experience) program, (2) the retention of majors through the critical first year of study at Bloomsburg University using the STLLC (Science &amp; Technology Living Learning Community) and (3) continuation of support for S-STEM scholars as they progress in their major through graduation. The project is funding about 13 students who are the target of this program with $10,000 each year for four years. These S-STEM Scholars are guaranteed scholarship support at the level granted for the freshman year provided they maintain program eligibility and financial need. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is its focus on the recruitment and retention of eligible students into the STEM disciplines. The target audience for recruitment includes the normal pool of student applicants plus students in nineteen Pennsylvania Upward Bound programs and twelve Math and Science Upward Bound programs in Pennsylvania and surrounding states (several thousand students). The retention efforts are built on well established principles including (1) social activities centered on academic programs, (2) peer mentoring, (3) time management instruction, and (4) emergency intervention services. Retention activities also include a host of placement testing, tutoring, and academic services designed to help students get past hurdles such as Calculus I or the transition from high school to college. Off-hours tutoring and living/learning communities are strategies that have helped the scholars make good progress in their degree programs. The broader impact of this project is to increase the overall number of students both entering the STEM disciplines and graduating in these disciplines due to the intensive retention and student support efforts.</AbstractNarration>
