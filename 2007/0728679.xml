    <AbstractNarration>This project is awarding scholarships to qualified students and enhancing academic and support services already available to students in the Physical and Life Sciences (PLS). Program objectives are to: 1) Increase the number of women (especially low income and minorities) enrolled in and successful in completing baccalaureate degrees in PLS. 2) Enhance the educational opportunities for students in PLS. 3) Improve retention of students within PLS. 4) Enhance academic support for scholarship recipients. 5) Establish/strengthen partnerships between the college, other higher education institutions (particularly for collaborative research opportunities), and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced educational opportunities and academic support include networking with members of the business community and institutions of higher education through participation in the mentor activities, including opportunities for students to present undergraduate research, weekly meetings with advisors and PIs, and increased availability of tutoring and assistance in career development. These activities also support student retention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project effectively supports students in their study of biology or chemistry and attracts new PLS majors to the college through experience of the project leadership, which includes middle and high school levels as well as collegiate; the access that students will have to student services, financial aid, and career development professionals; and the depth of experience brought by off-campus mentors, employed in biology and chemistry-related careers. The program is comprehensive, structured, and integrated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The college successfully prepares women for fields in which they are underrepresented. Within the past three years, of the college's graduates from the Physical and Life Science department, over 60% applied to, and were accepted into Ph.D. programs in biology or professional schools; and 30% of those graduates have secured jobs in biology and chemistry-related fields in government agencies or private industry.</AbstractNarration>
