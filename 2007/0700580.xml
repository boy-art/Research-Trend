    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator proposes to work on two distinct but related projects. The first project&lt;br/&gt;is a study of Selmer groups and Mordell-Weil groups of elliptic curves over towers of number fields,&lt;br/&gt;and the second is to resolve certain deformational problems related to automorphic forms. One&lt;br/&gt;of the aims of the first project is to prove that Selmer rank grows at least as fast as would be&lt;br/&gt;predicted by heuristics governing the signs of expected functional equations. One of the aims of&lt;br/&gt;the second is to understand the parameter spaces of automorphic forms that are usually referred&lt;br/&gt;to as "eigenvarieties."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project pursued by the principal investigator is the fundamental arithmetic problem of understanding&lt;br/&gt;the structure of triples of algebraic numbers that are solutions of given homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;polynomials of degree three in three variables, this cubic case having an extraordinary amount&lt;br/&gt;of structure and playing a pivotal role in the larger project of understanding the arithmetic of&lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations in general. This type of number theory was critical, for example, in the&lt;br/&gt;establishment of Fermat's Last Theorem (work of Wiles and Taylor-Wiles) over a dozen years ago,&lt;br/&gt;and - indeed - becomes ever more powerful and continues to be crucial for a wide range of applications,&lt;br/&gt;for example in cryptography. The second project proposed by the Principal Investigator has&lt;br/&gt;its historical origin in classical work of Ramanujan, that dealt with the arithmetic properties of the&lt;br/&gt;Fourier coefficients of modular forms. Ramanujan unearthed striking congruences that on the one&lt;br/&gt;hand contain important number theoretic information, and on the other suggest that a mysterious&lt;br/&gt;coherence underlies a large assortment of basic arithmetic phenomena; one of the goals of modern&lt;br/&gt;number theory is to expand this, and use its power for a range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
