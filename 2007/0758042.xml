    <AbstractNarration>Further development and application of a cross-discipline theoretical framework for&lt;br/&gt;two-atom, few-atom, and many-atom quantum systems is proposed. The theory, the&lt;br/&gt;multiscale quantum-defect theory, asserts that universal properties exist at different&lt;br/&gt;length scales for such systems, and provides methods to uncover and study them.&lt;br/&gt;It has been developed by the P.I. over the past few years, and has been demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;explicitly for two-atom, few-atom, and many-atom quantum systems. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research is expected to lead to the development of a new theoretical framework for&lt;br/&gt;studying strongly-coupled many-atom quantum systems and highly excited clusters,&lt;br/&gt;including a first microscopic quantum theory of liquids that goes beyond the liquid&lt;br/&gt;helium. It is also expected to lead to much improved understanding of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;atomic and molecular processes that include, e.g., the interaction and scattering of polar&lt;br/&gt;molecules and the Feshbach resonances in nonzero partial waves in&lt;br/&gt;ultracold atomic interactions.</AbstractNarration>
