    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses several challenging problems about high-dimensional probabilistic &lt;br/&gt;objects, that are related to the concentration phenomena. Part one is devoted to the study &lt;br/&gt;of probability distributions on linear spaces under certain convexity hypotheses of the&lt;br/&gt;Brunn-Minkowski kind. It focuses on general dimension free geometric and analytic &lt;br/&gt;properties of measures with heavy tails, expressed in terms of dilation, isoperimetric, &lt;br/&gt;and weighted Sobolev-type inequalities. The uniform distribution of mass in a convex body &lt;br/&gt;and more general log-concave distributions describe another important family in the &lt;br/&gt;hierarchy of convex or hyperbolic measures. As a closely related direction, the PI is also &lt;br/&gt;planning to consider some new aspects of the concentration phenomenon on product &lt;br/&gt;spaces of a large dimension. Part two deals with applications of different concentration &lt;br/&gt;phenomena to the randomized models, such as a partial summation of data, spectrum of &lt;br/&gt;stochastic matrices, etc., under minimal assumptions on the dependence of the observed &lt;br/&gt;random variables. Of a particular interest is an asymptotic behavior of typical distributions, &lt;br/&gt;resulting in a given randomized scheme. Part three is devoted to analysis of geometric &lt;br/&gt;characteristics of Markov kernels and associated random walks on graphs and other &lt;br/&gt;discrete structures. Discrete isoperimetric and modified forms of logarithmic Sobolev &lt;br/&gt;inequalities are planned to be considered in connection with the problem on the rates of &lt;br/&gt;the convergence of the Markov semi-groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the concentration phenomena is strongly dictated by various problems &lt;br/&gt;of Probability and Statistics on general global properties of stochastic processes. &lt;br/&gt;The Asymptotic Convex Geometry is another field, where a number of hard problems &lt;br/&gt;about high-dimensional convex bodies appeal to the concentration results and techniques. &lt;br/&gt;This study is also stimulated by problems in Combinatorics and Computer Science &lt;br/&gt;(such as computation of the volume) and in Mathematical Economics (optimization of &lt;br/&gt;the transport costs). The present proposal continues research in this direction and is aimed, &lt;br/&gt;in particular, to explore the role of the weak dependence in concentration phenomena, &lt;br/&gt;as well as its range of applicability in spaces of large dimensions.</AbstractNarration>
