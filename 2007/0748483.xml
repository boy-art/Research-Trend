    <AbstractNarration>Professor Adam Urbach, of the Department of Chemistry at Trinity University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his research involving the design of molecules that recognize and label specific peptides in aqueous solution. Such compounds would have broad impact on fields ranging from basic biochemistry to medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Current approaches are synthetically challenging and thus inefficient. The PI plans to develop an approach to modifying synthetic peptide receptors that will enable rapid iteration of their design, synthesis, and characterization, thus substantially accelerating the discovery process. The teaching portion of the project focuses on incorporating undergraduate and postdoctoral students in the research, and on improving the integration of teaching and research at Trinity, with a focus on writing and experimental design skills.</AbstractNarration>
