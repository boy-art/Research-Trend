    <AbstractNarration>DRL 0741760&lt;br/&gt;Future Earth Initiative&lt;br/&gt;PI: Patrick Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;Science Museum of Minnesota &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Science Museum of Minnesota, in collaboration with six NSF-funded Science and Technology Centers (STCs) around the country, are developing several deliverables around the theme of the Anthropocene epoch, i.e., the idea that the Earth is currently in a period of its history where humans are the dominant planetary agents of change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables include: (1) a 3,500 square-foot exhibit at the museum; (2) a changing set of small exhibits on sustainability science and design that will be both at the museum and the University of Minnesota; (3) an Earth Buzz Web site equivalent in intent to the museum?s very popular Science Buzz site on current science; (4) kiosks with Earth Buzz experiences in selected public venues where the STCs are; (5) Talking Circle discussion groups with decision makers on the implications of the exhibit topic for policy; and (6) youth programs and activities that engage them with the exhibit, Web site, and careers in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exhibits and Web site will feature scientific visualizations and computational models adapted to public learning environments from the STCs? research. Twin Cities Public Television will produce several first-person narrative videos of scientists and their research that will be incorporated into the deliverables as well as be packaged as a program for public television.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intended strategic impact on the field of informal STEM education is twofold: (1) to learn how to accelerate the dissemination of scientific research to public audiences; (2) to continue to explore ways science centers/museums can use exhibitions as educational frameworks for public policy dialogues.</AbstractNarration>
