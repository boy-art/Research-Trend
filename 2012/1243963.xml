    <AbstractNarration>Many viruses of Archaea have a spindle or lemon-like shape, which is very different from other viruses. This unique virus shape may help these viruses remain stable in the extreme environments in which they thrive. However, very little is known about the structure and assembly of spindle-shaped viruses. This project will study the structure and assembly of Sulfolobus Spindle Shaped Virus 1 (SSV1), the best-known of these so-called fuselloviruses. SSV1 replicates in extremely hot (80&amp;#730;C or 176&amp;#730;F) and acidic (pH = 3) conditions. The research will use cutting-edge genetic and biochemical tools pioneered in the Center for Life in Extreme Environments (CLEE) at Portland State University (PSU) and state-of-the art cryo-electron microscopy tools in collaboration with the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston Texas (UTMB). The major aims of the project are to determine the structure of the whole virus to &amp;#8804; 10 Ã… resolution, determine the location and kinetics of production of the major coat protein in vivo and characterize the major coat protein in vitro. Understanding the structure of SSV1 and characterizing the major coat protein in vivo and in vitro will provide insights not only into protein stability and assembly of macromolecules in extreme environments, but also virus evolution. The work also has implications for the development of nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Primary research will be performed in revamped teaching laboratory courses in new space. Research results will be incorporated in undergraduate lectures to at least 100 students/year. This project will directly support postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate and high school students in CLEE at PSU and at UTMB. Many PSU students are first generation college students and underrepresented minorities. These students will be directly involved in the research in collaboration with the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Partnerships and McNair scholarship programs. The project will also provide access for PSU students to the unique facilities at UTMB.</AbstractNarration>
