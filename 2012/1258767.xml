    <AbstractNarration>The University of Evansville Science and Mathematics Scholarship (SAMS) program provides four-year scholarships to talented and financially needy students majoring in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, environmental science, mathematics and physics. The project incorporates multiple student support strategies to retain students in science and math majors, including new courses, focused advising and a math and science living/learning environment. One of the new courses is an interdisciplinary math and science course offered during a summer bridge program. This hands-on course emphasizes real-life scientific problems and develops critical thinking through active learning. The second course, a one-credit college success course that SAMS Scholars take in the first semester, provides them with study skills and time management tools to help them succeed in their math and science majors. A team of faculty from each of the represented departments serves as advisors for the SAMS Scholars. In addition, scholars receive career advising at a monthly math and science career colloquium, and informal peer mentoring from upperclass math and science majors. Finally, a supportive learning community is fostered through a science and math-themed floor in a residence hall and regular social activities. The SAMS program helps students make smooth transitions from high school to college and from college to the workforce or graduate school.</AbstractNarration>
