    <AbstractNarration>1218345&lt;br/&gt;Harcum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells) are used to manufacture a majority of the therapeutic&lt;br/&gt;proteins on the market today. In particular, CHO cells are able to express recombinant&lt;br/&gt;glycoproteins, including monoclonal antibodies, which require complex post-translational&lt;br/&gt;modifications. Even though CHO cells have become the new "Escherichia coli" workhorse cell&lt;br/&gt;line, there are still many engineering challenges that must be addressed. These challenges can&lt;br/&gt;be calculated when assessing the cost to consumers of glycoprotein therapeutics ($10's to&lt;br/&gt;$1000's of dollars (US) per milligram with typical doses of 10's of milligrams).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One major production challenge for glycoproteins is protein aggregation. Glycoproteins are&lt;br/&gt;prone to aggregation due to the size of these molecules, incomplete glycosylation, high&lt;br/&gt;synthesis rates, and free thiols. Fortunately, bioprocess engineers have discovered interim&lt;br/&gt;solutions, such as, media additives that can reduce protein aggregation in CHO cell cultures,&lt;br/&gt;but more efficient long-term solutions are necessary to stabilize production and reduce costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this research project is to develop and enhance the toolbox for better&lt;br/&gt;understanding protein aggregation beginning with gene expression. Factors that lead to protein&lt;br/&gt;aggregation and conditions that reduce protein aggregation will be investigated by interrogating&lt;br/&gt;the transcriptome profiles developed from the transcriptome-sequencing component of this&lt;br/&gt;project. The CHO cell transcriptome will be made publicly available and characterized to&lt;br/&gt;promote genome-wide research in CHO cells. Transcriptome analysis will be used to identify&lt;br/&gt;genes that affect and respond to protein aggregation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a strong conceptual route for increasing the availability of therapeutic&lt;br/&gt;proteins and glycoproteins to the public. The availability of this additional high quality CHO cell&lt;br/&gt;transcriptome data to the public will allow for a commensurate community knowledge base that&lt;br/&gt;will enable all scholars the ability to contribute to our understanding of bioreactor process effects&lt;br/&gt;on this host cell line. Broader impacts also include the establishment and maintenance of a&lt;br/&gt;pipeline of educated, motivated students, particularly those from under-represented minority&lt;br/&gt;populations to undertake careers in biotechnology to meet this growing demand in the US.</AbstractNarration>
