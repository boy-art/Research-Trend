    <AbstractNarration>In human robot dialogue, although human partners and robots are co-present in a shared environment, they have completely mismatched capabilities in perceiving and reasoning about the environment. Their knowledge and representations of the shared world are drastically different. In addition, the shared environment is full of uncertainties and unexpected events. Humans and robots may have different capabilities in attending and responding to these uncertainties. All of these contribute to a misaligned perceptual basis between a human and a robot, which jeopardizes their collaborative activities and task performance. To enable situated human robot dialogue, a critical component is to develop techniques that will support mediating the shared perceptual basis for effective conversation and task completion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this National Robotics Initiative project is to develop a novel framework that tightly integrates high level language and dialogue processing with low level sensing and control systems and contextually grounds the collaborative discourse to mediate shared perceptual basis. By capturing grounded symbolic representations as well as continuous representations of the internal configuration of a robotic system and continuous information sensed from the changing environment, the framework allows the robot to promptly modify its execution without interrupting the on-going tasks. It further enables collaborations between humans and robots to mediate a shared perceptual basis and support efficient interaction in a highly dynamic environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide insight as to how the misaligned perceptual basis between a human and a robot should be mediated through a collaborative process and how such a process should be integrated to produce intelligent and collaborative robot behaviors. The expected results will benefit many applications such as manufacturing, service, assistive technology, and search and rescue.</AbstractNarration>
