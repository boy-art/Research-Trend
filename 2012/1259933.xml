    <AbstractNarration>This project builds on previous successes by providing a mentoring program and faculty led extra-curricular activities. The current project is increasing retention of all students and most notably of the scholars. Successful elements of the earlier project that are being continued include a three-week summer bridge session prior to the freshman year focusing on the transition to college, cohort building activities, and monitoring of academic progress with appropriate interventions. The project is providing a supportive environment that improves learning, encourages student bonding and good study skills, and reinforces student motivation to earn a degree in a STEM field. The project is awarding scholarships to 33 incoming high-need, high-ability freshmen in the departments of Engineering, Computer Science and Information Assurance. These scholarships are renewable for the sophomore year. After students reach the milestone third year, the college is providing continuing financial support for the remaining two years, along with advising, mentoring and career-planning assistance. Participants are selected based on financial need, SAT scores, high school grades, and an interview process. Cohorts of 11 students enter the college as freshmen in three fall semesters. An evaluation process is determining if retention is improved and if it is correlated to project activities.</AbstractNarration>
