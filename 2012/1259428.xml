    <AbstractNarration>RPR (An Approach for Recruitment, Persistence, and Retention of CS/ITS Students) provides full four-year scholarships to a cohort of 13 academically-talented and financially-disadvantaged majors in Computer Science and Information Technology &amp; Systems majors. Recruitment initiatives focus on program features that have broad appeal to a diverse population of students, including women. RPR's intellectual merit is grounded in its coordination of initiatives found to be effective in recruiting and retaining students. The program features a cohort approach to learning, including a common freshman year experience where students participate in a two-semester active learning CS sequence, a self-management course that aids in student persistence and retention, and a discrete mathematics course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, students have opportunities to engage in applied research and internships and to be paired with industry mentors. Program evaluation focuses on the effectiveness of recruitment strategies in attracting a diverse cohort and on core program features in aiding student achievement, persistence and retention. The broader impact of RPR is to promote growth and diversity in the CS/ITS field and to disseminate evaluation findings through peer-reviewed publications such as the Proceedings of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) and the Journal of Computer Sciences in Colleges.</AbstractNarration>
