    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms(CSDM) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jussi Eloranta of California State University at Northridge together with his undergraduate and graduate students, will study the interaction of atomic and molecular species with superfluid helium through optical spectroscopy based methods. Superfluid helium is an exceptional solvent with unique properties (e.g., vanishing viscosity, super-thermal conductivity, and liquid phase down to 0 K), which allow for fast energy dissipation, free diffusion of atoms and molecules, and minimization of thermal effects. Atomic and molecular species to be studied include copper and boron atoms and their dimers, as well as highly fluorescent molecules such as tetracene and glyoxal. The atomic species are expected to be useful for studying the superfluid properties of the liquid on the nanometer scale. Conversely, the surrounding superfluid liquid can also be used to probe the electronic properties of the solvated species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-range goal of this project is to understand how the unusual solvent effects, such as solvent layer guiding and vortex alignment of atomic orbitals, can be used to alter the way chemical reactions proceed. This may result in chemical reactions following paths that would normally be suppressed at elevated temperatures. Examples of possible applications include preparation of novel molecular structures, synthesizing high-energy materials and fuels, and controlling chemical reactions at low temperatures ("field guided molecular synthesis"). Students working with Professor Eloranta will gain skills related to optics, lasers, vacuum technology, and electronics as well as theoretical tools required to solve quantum mechanical problems.</AbstractNarration>
