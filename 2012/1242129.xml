    <AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Interdisciplinary Nano Tools Course at the University of Rhode Island", at the University of Rhode Island (URI) under the direction of Dr. Geoffrey D. Bothun, will focus on the instrumentation tools used to characterize physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials. The rationale behind focusing on Nano Tools is that instrumentation is broadly applicable to nanomaterials of varying composition and geometry, and, by first learning the tools, students can better grasp nanomaterial characterization that will feed into their understanding of eventual applications. Nano Tools will provide basic principles of operation and hands-on experience in dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano Tools will develop nanotechnology concept competences and professional skills in undergraduate students within STEM majors at URI. The new course will be open to junior and senior students and available as a professional elective course for all five URI engineering majors: Chemical; Civil and Environmental; Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical; Mechanical, Industrial, and Systems; and Ocean Engineering in conformity with the norms of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). The pre-requisites are relaxed and clearly defined so that more STEM students can enroll into the course. The course will also complement two other nanocourses that are currently offered at URI, and will provide a basis for the development of a future nanotechnology minor. This will be the first course of its kind offered at URI, and will provide the basis for an interdisciplinary nanotechnology minor and/or certificate program.</AbstractNarration>
