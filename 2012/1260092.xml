    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to recruit and retain to transfer or completion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees academically capable students with financial need. The focus of the project is to enable scholarship students to attend full-time and to complete their STEM programs reliably in two years. The students are being supported by the STEM Emporium at the college, a program designed to increase completions in STEM majors by supplying out-of-classroom academic support. The student scholars are also supported by many established student support groups that supply experienced and focused support for student sub-populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is providing scholarship recipients full opportunities and resources to stay in a STEM major, to focus on courses and not be distracted by working and financially supporting themselves, to attend full-time, and to engage with faculty and cohort students. The scholars are benefiting from an array of support services that includes faculty mentors, dedicated counselors, academic tutoring, and services to aid students who are transferring to universities or who wish to obtain career-track internships or research opportunities. A diverse group of faculty members, who are knowledgeable about population subgroups and serve as role models, are mentoring the students. The scholarships are increasing the academic success of students, rates of completion, transfer to universities, and career readiness. In addition, the program is offering students optional research opportunities that are traditionally available only to students at four-year universities by partnering with universities that provide access to advanced laboratories, instrumentation, and personnel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is improving the retention of academically talented, financially disadvantaged students, many of whom are from groups underrepresented in STEM professions, thus increasing the economic and racial diversity in STEM graduates and transfer students, and narrowing socioeconomic gaps. Students are learning job skills and gaining confidence for employment through enrichment activities such as faculty mentoring and optional internships. By recruiting and drawing students from local high schools and partnering with private sector companies, the project is giving at-risk students a financially rewarding pathway in STEM careers to which they otherwise might not have been exposed or motivated to pursue.</AbstractNarration>
