    <AbstractNarration>In this project, quantitative measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC) utilizing the HAIS TOGA-GV instrument on the NCAR GV aircraft will be obtained as part of the Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) experiment proposed to take place during January and February 2014 from the island of Guam. CONTRAST is designed to measure the chemistry and transport of reactive chemical species into the tropical Tropopause Transition Layer (TTL) over the Western Pacific warm pool area. TOGA-GV measurements include a suite of volatile organic compounds C-2 (VOCs), including: oxygenates, non-methane hydrocarbons, halocarbons, and some nitrogen and sulfur containing species. The sources, chemistry, and transport of trace gases and their degradation products into the lower stratosphere in this region during the boreal winter season can substantially impact the chemistry of the lower stratosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trace gas concentrations measured in this campaign can influence atmospheric chemistry and climate and will provide a method of chemically describing transported air masses. Specific data will be obtained for: tracers of oceanic emissions and anthropogenic and biogenic activities, radical precursors, tracers of urban and biomass combustion emissions, products of oxidative processing, precursors to aerosol formation, and compounds important for aerosol modification and transformation. Better understanding of the processes in this region will improve process-oriented chemistry/climate models and their validation by providing a unique suite of benchmark measurements, especially in the characterization of active halogen chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
