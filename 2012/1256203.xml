    <AbstractNarration>This research aims to overcome the extreme challenges that need to be solved to realize a 1000-core (kilocore) processor. Processors with tens of cores are already in commercial products today. A kilocore processor could take us into the era of Server-on-Chip and Supercomputer-on-Chip. On-chip network is the medium through which two nodes in a processor can communicate, and therefore constitutes the backbone of a kilocore processor. Unfortunately, current on-chip network solutions are inadequate as they do not scale in terms of both power and performance beyond a few tens of cores. To reach the ambitious design goal of 1000+ cores with realistic power budgets, the interconnect technology needs to be at least 15 times more power efficient while providing at least the same level of throughput-per-core as today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates three interrelated solutions to meet the above challenge in an evolutionary manner: (1) Developing a low-power and energy-proportional interconnect architecture that employs a larger number of narrower networks, (2) Using high-radix Swizzle-Switches as the building blocks for interconnecting the multiple networks, and (3) Re-designing network architecture with multiple networks and Swizzle-Switches using 3D integration with Through-Silicon-Vias to achieve scalability beyond 1000 cores. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of kilocore processors. If such processors can be built, they could have a tremendous impact on future exascale systems such as cloud computing servers and HPC systems that have many applications including drug discovery, defense, information analysis, and social networking.</AbstractNarration>
