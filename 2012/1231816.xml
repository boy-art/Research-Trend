    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approach: The research objective is to develop a novel energy harvesting method for self-powered devices. If one could develop sensing circuits that required no power, then the amount of wiring which leads directly to maintenance and production costs could be greatly reduced. It is proposed to develop energy harvesters to create sensor networks that could constantly report on the health of a variety of critical structures. The proposed approach will develop methods of power harvesting from fluid flow using aeroelastic systems and smart power electronic circuits. Using piezoelectric structures, these devices will be capable of converting flow-induced vibrations into storable electrical energy. Nonlinear switching circuits will be developed to enhance the efficiency of transducer electromechanical power extraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This work also represents fundamental research into a heretofore untapped source of energy for self-powered systems, i.e., the movement of fluid air and water. The results of this work will give engineers the analytical tools to determine how to harvest power from fluid flows. This could aid in the development of condition-based systems of maintenance for future and existing infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This project will disseminate information for K-12 students by creating teaching modules in cooperation with local middle and high school teachers. These modules will be made available to schools on the web to demonstrate the idea of energy harvesting from the environment. Local teachers will be invited to a workshop at Cornell with their students to help create lessons and experiments for use in K-12 classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
