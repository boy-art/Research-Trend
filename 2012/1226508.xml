    <AbstractNarration>This project will examine the disjuncture between the ideas about what law is in a post-Soviet socialist state and the legal practices guiding everyday life by examining how these logics run up against each other in the context of legal proceedings. While the legal system is dedicated to shaping a nation and a citizenry that adheres to a particular socialist ideology, everyday legal practices still attend to familiar concepts of responsibility. In any one case, legal officials' decisions can illuminate tensions between the state's ideas and everyday legal life. Through participant observation and interviews in a municipal court, a law office, and amongst families undertaking activities of daily living, this research seeks to answer: (1) how participants in the legal system judges, lawyers, and litigants?reconcile the disjuncture between the understandings of the state and everyday life as they navigate each legal case; and (2) what the consequences of their practices might be. Taken together these questions help us to understand how, through their attempts to resolve cases, the participants in the legal system may perhaps unwittingly reshape the contours of what it means to be a citizen in a contemporary post-Soviet socialist state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will represent one of the first sustained ethnographic studies of law in a contemporary post-Soviet state and can contribute to studies of the complex relationships between the law, the nation, and the state. Further, it has the potential to broaden the conversation within the fields of law and social science by inviting seldom-heard voices?specifically those of legal professionals in a post-Soviet state?that can share the unique experiences of a socialist legal system.</AbstractNarration>
