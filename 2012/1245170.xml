    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing innovative learning materials based on real-life problems that students may encounter in their engineering careers. Incorporating service systems into existing engineering curricula promotes students' critical thinking and scientific understanding of complex systems. In-class and out-of-class interventions such as case-based learning, project-based learning, field trips, student presentations, teamwork, and guest lectures are being developed to show students how engineering is applied to help people. This work is building on the fundamental premise that if students (especially women) could envision themselves applying engineering knowledge to helping people (as their career path), it will build their confidence and they will be more likely to complete their degrees. The materials are being designed to be gender inclusive and positively impact all students by developing diverse perspectives and emphasizing collaboration. In addition to broadening participation of women in engineering, this project is aiding the service sector of industry by supplying better-trained engineers.</AbstractNarration>
