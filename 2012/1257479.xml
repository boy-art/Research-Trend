    <AbstractNarration>Bacterial wilt is one of the most devastating bacterial diseases of plants worldwide, affecting hundreds of plant species including many major crops such as tomato and potato. The bacterial wilt pathogen, Ralstonia solanacearum, is a root-invading, vascular pathogen that employs a specialized secretion system to deliver a collection of "effector" proteins directly into plant cells. Effector proteins are thought to promote disease by interfering with plant defenses. This project will identify plant targets of a conserved effector, Rsp1281/PopS, which is present in most R. solanacearum species, is highly expressed within the plant vasculature and is required for full virulence on several plant hosts. The investigators will use biochemical, microscopic and genomic approaches to identify plant proteins, organelles and pathways that are targeted by this effector. The identification of effector targets of a root-invading pathogen may yield new information about plant defense pathways employed in roots and can be useful for developing wilt resistant crops. Additionally, the majority of the work in this project involves student research, integrating research and education. A total of approximately 100 students will participate in this project, acquiring knowledge and skills that will be important in other STEM courses, in graduate school and for success as future scientists.</AbstractNarration>
