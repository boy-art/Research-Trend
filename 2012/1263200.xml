    <AbstractNarration>------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to the United Tribes Technical College (UTTC), which will provide research training for 8 students for 10 weeks and 4 science teachers, for each of the summers 2014-2016. Participants will conduct environmental ecology research critical to Tribal lands in the Northern plains, under the guidance of mentors from UTTC (Bismarck, ND), Ft. Berthold Community College (New Town, ND), Sitting Bull College (Ft. Yates, ND), Oglala Lakota College (Kyle, SD), Augustana College (Sioux Falls, SD), and North Dakota State University (Fargo, ND). Participants will be involved in research focusing on restoration ecology, insect behavior and ecological impacts, integrated bison prairie management, effects of oil development of natural resources, conservation biology, and geospatial applications in ecological research. Undergraduates are recruited from across the Northern Plains, with a focus on tribal college students, and are selected based on expressed interest, demonstrated skills, and dedication to science careers. Participants will conduct individual research projects as part of a larger research team and will receive training in research ethics, project design, field and laboratory techniques, and analysis and presentation of results. Science teachers (grades 6-12) are recruited from reservation school systems and will conduct fieldwork alongside the REU participants. Teachers will develop curriculum modules based on their research experiences for their own classrooms and provide the modules to other teachers. Shared orientation week, a midpoint camping trip, and final presentations develop teamwork among the participants. Students will be encouraged to present at regional and national conferences and to publish their result in scientific journals. Participants are evaluated using the common assessment tool for biology REU programs. The program increases the recruitment, retention, and degree completion of Native American students in science, while providing a solid foundation for these students to be successful in graduate programs.
