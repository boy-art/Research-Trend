    <AbstractNarration>The Network of Cooperative Science Centers (CSCs) and High Schools for Training High School Students in Geosciences is a Track 2 program designed to create an effective pipeline for recruiting high school students and preparing them for transition through undergraduate and graduate programs to the workforce in geosciences. The program has two major components, Outreach to High Schools, and a 6-week's summer program. Through the outreach program, geoscience recruitment materials are disseminated to teachers and counselors. In addition, selected high schools are visited to make presentations to more than 500 juniors and seniors nationwide. Students are provided information about undergraduate and graduate degree programs in geosciences available at the more than 20 institutions that make up the four CSCs. They also receive information about the existing opportunities for financial support, mentoring and research in geosciences at the bachelors, masters and doctoral levels. The outreach program helps to increase students' access to learning about Earth System Science, and recruitment into geoscience degree programs or related sciences in the universities. Thirteen (13) high school seniors preparing to enter college are recruited into the 6-weeks summer geoscience bridge program each year. The program uses an Earth System Science approach, enhances the quantitative skills of the students, and exposes them to workforce needs and careers in geosciences. It also creates opportunities for students to work in a culturally diverse environment.</AbstractNarration>
