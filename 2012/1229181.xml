    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award effort will support development of a unique mobile thermodynamic and dynamic profiling system for meteorological and engineering research. This portable platform will combine (1) a passive remote-sensing Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer; (2) a microwave radiometer; and (3) a surface meteorological system, including both standard meteorological and turbulence sensors on a deployable mast. These components will be integrated with an existing University of Oklahoma-provided Doppler wind lidar (light detection and ranging system) adapted for mobile use so as to provide observations of cloud base, characteristics of optically-thin clouds, and airflow via range-height type scanning. These observations are to be supplemented by periodic in-situ radiosonde measurements via co-location of existing mobile sounding systems. This development will be unique, as passive-infrared and microwave radiometers have not been previously combined in a mobile observing system. Moreover, synergistic opportunities exist to improve temperature and humidity retrievals from combination of these measurements along with lidar specification of cloud base height. Scientists, engineers, students and a technician will work together to design, test and implement this mobile platform and harden systems as required for travel. Preheating/temperature controls will be incorporated as necessary to foster rapid deployment, and potential electromagnetic interference issues will also be addressed. A common software display, analysis and robust data storage system that integrates remote communication capabilities will also be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this effort will come through improvements in the ability to more fully characterize of the pre-convective environment and relevant mesoscale dynamics involved in thunderstorm formation, boundary layer and urban meteorological processes, as well as through contributions to data assimilation, understanding of regional climate, and improved sensor synergies. Broader Impacts will include substantial extension of capabilities already resident in NSF's lower atmosphere observing facility deployment pool, contributions toward key atmospheric research objectives identified in recent National Research Council reports, potential improvements to numerical simulation of high-impact weather events, both hands-on and classroom education of students at undergraduate and graduate levels (including participants in an NSF-supported Research Experiences for Undergraduates program), and involvement of underrepresented groups in both education and supported research.</AbstractNarration>
