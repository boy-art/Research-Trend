    <AbstractNarration>Technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed program, twelve U.S. students (6 undergrad, 6 graduate) will collaborate with faculty and students at two Chilean institutions (Universidad de Chile, P. Universidad Católica de Chile) to determine geographical and social conditions underlying direct fitness variation in the degu (Octodon degus), a social rodent found within a wide geographical range in Chile. Previous work in one degu population showed that direct fitness (per capita number of offspring per mother) decreases with increasing group size, suggesting that group living is costly to females. Contrary to theory, degus in this population do not live in kin groups, suggesting that direct fitness costs are not offset by enhanced indirect fitness. To what extent these trends occur in other degu populations is not known. IRES students will study how group size, kinship and local environmental conditions influence the direct fitness of females ? including an examination of the extent to which direct reproduction is equitable among females belonging to the same social groups ? in two degu populations. Students working in the field will determine social group composition and collect tissue for genetic analyses. Student-led genetic analyses will determine if females living with kin have higher inclusive fitness than females living with non-kin. Depending on the outcomes of these studies, the students may conduct research on social foraging strategies, costs of dispersal and personality assessment in different populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will develop the professional skills and cultural understanding of students, increasing the likelihood for successful future projects and their capacity to compete and collaborate in the international research arena. To this end, students will be engaged in research, educational, and cultural activities for up to two years. Prior to IRES, students will participate in animal and research training, grant proposal development, and Spanish language courses. During IRES, students will develop behavioral and genetic research skills, giving them a broad research ?toolkit.? Collaborations with Chilean counterparts will enhance their international network of peers and potential collaborators. After IRES, students will prepare manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals and present their results at regional and national meetings. &lt;br/&gt;An important aim of the program is to broaden the impacts of the project by promoting international research and STEM education in the greater Chattanooga, Tennessee area. To this end, IRES students will consult with University of Tennessee at Chattanooga engineering students regarding the design of a new prairie dog exhibit at the Chattanooga Zoo, an organization located in inner-city Chattanooga and serving a diverse constituency. In collaboration with students from the Chattanooga Girls Leadership Academy (a STEM-focused middle &amp; high school serving mostly minority &amp; economically disadvantaged girls), the IRES students will study the behavior of the prairie dogs and other social animals at the zoo. Undergraduate students in the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga?s STEM teacher preparation program ? a pathway into secondary STEM classrooms for talented STEM majors ? will incorporate some of the projects into STEM educational activities for science classes at the high school. Activities will be highlighted in a documentary segment to be aired on a local Public Broadcasting Station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;Over a three-year period, this award will provide 6 undergraduate and 6 graduate students from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and other institutions with the opportunity to gain international research experience in Chile. In collaboration with researchers at the Universidad de Chile and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, students will study the composition of social groups and reproductive consequences of group-living among the degu (Octodon degus), a rodent found only in Chile. The aim of the work is to determine if the reproductive consequences of group-living are habitat-dependent or depend on the extent to which degus live with close relatives. To this end, the students will study degu social groups in two populations. They will also conduct genetic analyses to determine if females live with close relatives and if the number of young that females produce is dependent on the size and composition of the groups in which they live. This research will make important contributions to the discipline of behavioral ecology. &lt;br/&gt;The program will develop the professional skills and cultural understanding of students, increasing the likelihood for success of projects and the international competitiveness of students. To this end, students will be engaged in research, educational, and cultural activities for up to two years. Prior to IRES, students will receive animal and research training, write grant proposals, and take Spanish courses. During IRES, students will develop research skills that will make them competitive for graduate programs and research careers. Collaborations with Chilean counterparts will enhance their international networking. After IRES, students will prepare manuscripts for publication in scientific journals and present their results at regional and national meetings. &lt;br/&gt;An important aim of the program is to broaden the impacts of the project by promoting international research and STEM education in the greater Chattanooga, Tennessee area.
