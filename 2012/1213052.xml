    <AbstractNarration>The memory system continues to be a major performance and power&lt;br/&gt;bottleneck in nearly all computing systems. And, it is becoming&lt;br/&gt;increasingly more so with major application, architecture, and&lt;br/&gt;technology trends. Embedded applications that acquire and&lt;br/&gt;process real-time data, Internet and cloud applications that have to&lt;br/&gt;analyze large databases, and the exa-scale era HPC applications that&lt;br/&gt;need to crunch voluminous data sets are just a few examples of&lt;br/&gt;increasingly data-intensive applications that require high memory&lt;br/&gt;capacity, performance, and energy efficiency. Thus, the well-known &lt;br/&gt;memory wall problem has become even more difficult to surmount and&lt;br/&gt;needs a fundamental rethinking of the memory hierarchy design for future&lt;br/&gt;computing platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to fundamentally and holistically&lt;br/&gt;rethink the design of the entire memory hierarchy taking into consideration&lt;br/&gt;the emerging device/memory technologies and to exploit the design trade-offs&lt;br/&gt;at different layers of the system stack -- from devices to micro-architecture,&lt;br/&gt;compilers and runtime systems. The solution will cover innovations in&lt;br/&gt;architecting and optimizing the entire memory path consisting of the caches,&lt;br/&gt;on-chip networks, memory controller and main memory. The objective&lt;br/&gt;is to enable 100X improvement in memory capacity over the next&lt;br/&gt;decade, while providing 5X improvement in performance and&lt;br/&gt;10X improvement in energy efficiency. The proposed research has the potential to transform the design of&lt;br/&gt;next-generation memory systems for the multi-core era, which is expected&lt;br/&gt;to be a ubiquitous part of the entire IT sector.&lt;br/&gt;The cross-cutting nature of this research can foster new research directions&lt;br/&gt;in several areas, spanning technology/energy-aware design, computer architecture,&lt;br/&gt;compilers, and system/application software. With the memory system forming&lt;br/&gt;the backbone of nearly every envisioned future application domain, the&lt;br/&gt;broader impact of this research can accelerate the design and deployment&lt;br/&gt;of future applications. This project will enable transfer of research&lt;br/&gt;results to industry, enhance undergraduate and graduate student training&lt;br/&gt;including under-represented students, and contribute to the development of new&lt;br/&gt;research and teaching tools.</AbstractNarration>
