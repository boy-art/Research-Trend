    <AbstractNarration>The Bellevue College STEM Scholars Network provides support for up to 50 academically talented and financially disadvantaged students through graduation with associate degrees in STEM fields. The STEM disciplines targeted by the STEM Scholars Network include Earth and Space Sciences, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Engineering and Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The cohort-building activities, significant involvement of local industry and academic support structures incorporated into the STEM Scholars Network provide a model for other similar institutions to adapt and implement to facilitate graduation of community college STEM majors. The engagement of STEM professionals with faculty and students promotes new understandings of effective teaching and learning strategies, as well as approaches for effective integration of resources from academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Partnerships with local companies developed and strengthened through this project are adding to the role the college plays to provide talented STEM professionals to the local workforce. Further, by encouraging participation of underrepresented groups, this project increases access to educational and professional pathways for diverse students, including women, students of color and economically disadvantaged students, thereby diversifying the STEM workforce. Dissemination of these important findings to pre-college teachers, college faculty, administrators and industry leaders throughout Washington state and nationally will inform better strategies for broadening the participation of the nation's underprivileged populations in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
