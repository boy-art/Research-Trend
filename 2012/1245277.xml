    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT DESCRIPTION &lt;br/&gt;In an age of ubiquitous mobile computing devices, students demand instant access to information. The project is creating an open-source, on-line laboratory in which students can engage in experiential learning of electrical engineering content in an on-demand setting. It is developing an open laboratory, which uses a virtual laboratory assistant (VLA) with voice input and output capabilities to provide personalized instruction for students participating in a self-paced undergraduate engineering laboratory. The intelligent agent is customizing the learning process by providing each student with personalized tutoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components of the system include: pre-lab testing and instruction, engineering design exercises, short topic explanation videos, instrumentation instruction (including safety), and a corresponding post-lab test module. In the pre-lab, students are introduced to basic theory and simulation tools. If a student needs clarification on a topic, a short instructional video will provide guidance. These videos utilize a Khan Academy style format and explain many basic electrical engineering concepts. The lab instruction module assists students in executing an open-ended design problem using the VLA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's pilot electrical engineering lab is studying the development of an extensible framework and evaluating the efficacy of open laboratory pedagogical approach. The effort is exploring: (1) to what extent is individual, self-paced learning possible, (2) what benefit comes with 24/7 accessibility, (3) how more timid students can receive personalized instruction in a non-threatening environment, and (4) how the level of engagement can be increased by allowing students to freely explore the subject matter. The evaluation activities involve both formative and summative efforts that will be supported by Temple University's Teaching and Learning Center. The instructional diagnosis and surveys will provide interested educators with data necessary to foster adoption of the project resources at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE &lt;br/&gt;Temple University's open laboratory is being used as a recruiting tool during more than a dozen recruiting events per year, which are focused on high school and middle school students. These events are attended by hundreds of potential engineers from underrepresented groups. Through these events, the team is recruiting members of underrepresented groups to engineering. They are also integrating education and research through the open laboratories - in which undergraduate research students are performing simulations and prototyping. A successful development of the open laboratory environment is expected to more efficiently utilize lab space and student/faculty time. Moreover, the pilot is producing an open lab model that can be leveraged by other courses, along with a scalable architecture that can be used by other colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>
