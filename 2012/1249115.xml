    <AbstractNarration>Growth of the ancient North American continent (Laurentia) along its western margin in Paleozoic times occurred by addition of materials of both local and exotic origins: a sedimentary apron derived from erosion of the western flank of the continent (the miogeocline), and also a complex of accreted terranes displaced by plate tectonics from other parts of the globe and faulted into the continent. Research of this study will examine the history of the accreted Chilliwack terrane in northwest Washington about which preliminary studies suggest that at least parts came from northwestern Europe. A primary tool in our work is acquisition of U-Th-Pb ages of zircon grains in igneous and sedimentary rocks. Preliminary data from igneous rocks in the Chilliwack terrane yield ages not known in western North America, but common in ancient Scandinavia (Baltica). In sedimentary rocks, age distributions of zircons are in some rocks similar to North America and in other rocks point to an exotic (European or other) homeland. Additional zircon ages will clarify these possible correlations. Further Hf isotopic data from zircons will be used to test possible derivation of parts of the Chilliwack terrane from a primitive oceanic island arc, specifically the early Paleozoic Alexander arc terrane accreted in southeast Alaska, as opposed to evolved continental crust (Laurentian or other). Field mapping of rock units will evaluate the genetic and structural relationship among parts of the Chilliwack terrane that have North American vs. exotic affinities. The fundamental goal of the project is basic knowledge of mechanisms of plate tectonics and processes of formation of an active continental margin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan is designed to address the scientific issue described above, and also to enhance the education and training of students and elevate interest and understanding of earth history of the Pacific Northwest in the general public. Project funds will support undergraduate students as assistants in the field and laboratory, and pay for students to attend a professional meeting. Student research on the project will likely form the basis of senior theses. Knowledge gained from this study will be incorporated into course work in the classroom, on field trips, and off-campus Pacific Northwest field courses taught at Western Washington University. With respect to the broader community, and aside from technical publications and lectures, results of the proposed study will be integrated into and will enhance frequently occurring field trips for professional groups, such as the Geological Society of America, National Association of Geology Teachers, and Northwest Geological Society. The public lands of the San Juan Islands and Cascades are global tourist destinations, presenting opportunity for reaching a broad audience through geologic displays in parks and in popular geologic literature. The scale of continental margin tectonics on display in western Washington is fascinating at any level of knowledge.</AbstractNarration>
