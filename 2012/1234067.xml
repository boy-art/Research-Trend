    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative research effort is to develop micro-electro-mechanical frequency converters that make use of subharmonic resonances. The first approach utilizes a chain of N coupled resonators with 2:1 internal resonances among nearest neighbors, which takes an input frequency at one end and provides a set of output frequencies that are the input frequency divided by 2^j, for j=2,?,N along the chain. The second approach makes use of subharmonic responses in vibro-impact devices; these provide frequency division by integer factors using a single resonator driven with input frequencies near multiples of its natural frequency. Both systems will be investigated from a fundamental dynamical systems point of view, and the results will be used to develop and optimize MEMS designs. The resulting devices will be fabricated, experimentally characterized, and tested for performance metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frequency converters are devices that take an input frequency and change it into another frequency at the output. They are used in spread spectrum communication systems, signal synthesizers, mixers, clock generators, and sensors. The originality of the proposed effort is the combined use of nonlinear mechanical vibrational resonances and the inherent design flexibility of micro-electro-mechanical systems to develop entirely passive converters that do not require the buffers and amplifiers used in most electronic converters. The anticipated designs are appealing due to their size, ease of fabrication, integration with electronics, ability for frequency tuning, and low power requirements. The broader impacts of the effort include outreach activities, multi-disciplinary training of students, inclusion of students from underrepresented groups, development of classroom materials, and dissemination of research.</AbstractNarration>
