    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Michael C. Heaven of Emory University and his research group will investigate unusual bonding mechanisms in (1) beryllium clusters containing 3 - 30 Be atoms, (2) hypermetallic MOM with M=Mg and Ca; (3) alkaline earth carbides; and (4) the diatomic ions CaO+, BaO+ and BaCl+. These clusters and molecules have been the subject of numerous theoretical investigations, but experimental data are lacking. The ultimate goal is to develop a better understanding of the unusual modes of bonding that are not well-characterized in terms of conventional models, and to advance our understanding of bonding when clusters grow from a few atoms in size to large systems that approach bulk metal behavior. In addition, the studies of the carbides MgC and CaC will be of value to the astrophysical community, while work on the molecular ions CaO+, BaO+ and BaCl+ will advance research programs where the aim is to generate and manipulate ultra-cold (&lt;mK) molecules for applications such as quantum computing. A variety of experimental tools will be employed, including anion photodetachment, laser-induced fluorescence, resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization, and cavity ring-down spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from these studies will help chemists to develop a deeper understanding of bonding that encompasses the traditional models as well as the unusual interactions that are one of the themes of the present study. The research will provide the graduate and undergraduate students, and post-doctoral associates involved with a rich experience in advanced experimental and theoretical methods. A successful collaboration with Spelman College, that provides research opportunities to students from a historically Black women's college, will be continued.</AbstractNarration>
