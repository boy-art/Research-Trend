    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to establish a control design methodology for nonlinear systems possessing redundant control inputs, suitable for application to supervisory control of advanced combustion engines. The need for a comprehensive approach to the control and optimization of nonlinear over-actuated systems is warranted in a variety of engineering applications to fully exploit the potential benefits arising from redundant actuation. This is especially true for combustion engines, where simultaneous control of engine breathing and combustion can only be achieved by combining the effect of heterogeneous actuators. The proposed approach aims at overcoming fundamental limitations by exploiting a geometric characterization of system redundancy to determine the structure of the controller. The integration of two control strategies is pursued, one aiming at regulating the output, the other at shaping the transient response through online optimization. The overall integrated approach is novel and is expected to extend the state of the art in the theory and practice of control of complex nonlinear systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central to the automotive industry is the need to improve fuel efficiency in light of the increasingly stringent government mandates and fuel price increases. However, significant benefits can only be achieved if advancements in engine design can be matched by improvements in controlling engine performance. The outcome of this research will lead to better fuel economy and emissions control and significantly shorten the development and integration of new engine technologies, a process that today is significantly slowed by the use of empirically based design and ad-hoc calibration procedures. Collaboration with industry will be pursued and fostered by the use of testing facilities for hardware verification. Integration of research and education will be achieved and enhanced through the involvement of undergraduate honor students, especially from under-represented groups, and collaboration with foreign academic institutions that leverage existing student exchange agreements.</AbstractNarration>
