    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award supports an integrated research and education program by the PI and his students at California State University Fullerton (CSUF) aimed at hastening the direct detection of gravitational waves with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The research is focused on i) a thorough characterization of the Advanced LIGO instruments, especially the identification and removal of noise artifacts in the data that could mask or mimic potential astrophysical signals, and ii) measurement and analysis of scattered light from optical materials that are important for extending Advanced LIGO's reach. The outreach component of this award will establish a pathway for students at nearby community colleges to learn about and become part of the PI's research group. This project will also increase science literacy through the development and dissemination of educational materials for learning gravitational-wave science in the undergraduate curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albert Einstein predicted gravitational waves in his 1916 theory of general relativity. Nearly a century later, we are poised to directly detect these waves for the first time, and to observe the universe in an entirely new spectrum. LIGO is an NSF-funded project to measure gravitational waves from astrophysical systems such as colliding black holes and neutron stars. This award supports research to thoroughly characterize the LIGO detectors - work essential for the detection of gravitational waves. In addition, it supports research on optical scatter aimed at assessing and improving the quality of commercial optics that will be required to extend the astrophysical reach of future gravitational-wave detectors. These projects provide increased opportunities for students to participate in cutting-edge research at CSUF, a primarily undergraduate and Hispanic-serving institution. The education and outreach components of this award will engage students, many from groups currently underrepresented in physics and astronomy, in the discovery-ready field of gravitational-wave science.</AbstractNarration>
