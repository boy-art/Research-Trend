    <AbstractNarration>SES-1260191&lt;br/&gt;Cheol-Sung Lee&lt;br/&gt;University of Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how intellectuals' activities under authoritarian regimes shaped labor issues after nations transitioned to democracy in four distinct historical contexts. Specifically, this research explores how activists' strategies to either go underground or to cooperate with authoritarian elites had lasting impacts on the subsequent trajectories of democratization. Based on comparative historical evidence from four recently democratized developing countries, the study assesses three types of solidarity and one absence case: participatory solidarity in Brazil, top-down solidarity in South Korea, clique-based solidarity in Argentina, and co-optation (lack of solidarity) in Taiwan. Qualitative interviews with key leaders who once engaged in these activities are expected to provide thicker and deeper data about the cases. Overall, this exploration of activities under pre-democratization structures will explain the paths and forms of labor politics in the post-authoritarian era. The study's novel theoretical approach will improve our understanding of the divergent trajectories of democratization. Its focus on the dynamic formation of civic leaders' networks and identities in informal communities will also bridge organizational approaches to understanding contention with the broader literature on democratization. Finally, this research will contribute to highlighting the historical evolution of the "social foundations" of institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will contribute to new social scientific knowledge by providing theoretical insights into the different forms and qualities of democracy. This approach will provide stronger explanations of post authoritarian labor-based initiatives and their contributions to democratization and welfare states than have previous studies. Moreover, this research has the potential to inform not only researchers but also civic leaders and policy-makers about the importance of developing ties to civil groups and community organizations in order to build durable and broad democratic bases. Insights into the historical paths of difficult times in other societies may provide leaders of contemporary American communities with new ideas and perspectives regarding their strategies of mobilization and community participation.</AbstractNarration>
