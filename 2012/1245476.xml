    <AbstractNarration>The project supports a series of experimental research studies designed to test improvements in the calibration, reliability, validity, and efficiency of a proto-type tool (Quickscore, a scoring algorithm) that facilitates the examination of structured retrieval practice in learning fundamental concepts in biology. The research systematically examines and tests specific characteristics of structured retrieval practice that have the potential to enhance conceptual learning under different conditions. Building and expanding on previous findings, the project's working hypothesis states that guiding students to practice active reconstruction of their knowledge enhances long-term meaningful learning of complex science materials. While being developed for introductory biology courses, the Structured Retrieval Practice program (software package) is designed to be utilized in all STEM disciplines to enhance learning of fundamental concepts in a discipline. The research contibutes to a growing body of knowledge on the role of retrieval in concept learning. The series of research studies starts under laboratory conditions and concludes with a field-based research study in large introductory courses. An aim of the project is to translate findings from basic researach studies on learning into providing students with a research-based tool that enhances their conceptual learning.</AbstractNarration>
