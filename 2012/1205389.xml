    <AbstractNarration>The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) began full-scale operations in September 2007 and completed a telescope upgrade in the summer of 2012. This award funds ongoing maintenance and operation of both the telescopes and the array facility over a 3-year period. VERITAS seeks to both identify new sources of Very High Energy (VHE: E &gt;100 Gigaelectron-volt) gamma rays, and to perform in-depth studies of the known sources to better understand their underlying fundamental processes. The primary targets of VERITAS Galactic observations are supernova remnants, pulsars, binary systems, and known VHE sources whose classification is currently unknown. The extragalactic targets observed by VERITAS include active galactic nuclei, radio galaxies, starburst galaxies, galaxy clusters and gamma-ray bursts. In addition, Local Group galaxies, dwarf galaxies and globular clusters are targets of VERITAS observations focused on the indirect detection of cold dark matter. VERITAS is currently the most-sensitive VHE gamma-ray observatory in the world. After 6-years of operation, the experiment is well-understood and promised performance metrics of the experiment (e.g. total data yield and data quality) are achieved or surpassed. Continued operations of VERITAS for this funding cycle are expected to result in new gamma-ray science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Outreach: The VERITAS collaboration is involved in public engagement as an important element of its research program. The Adler Planetarium and the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Visitors Center at the VERITAS site coordinate activities, websites and public displays to promote VERITAS science to the public, other educators, museum professionals and the wider community. VERITAS scientists provide education and public outreach experiences in the form of multimedia products, public presentations and activities such as classroom visits, an annual public lecture series, "star parties" at the observatory, and tours of the experiment.</AbstractNarration>
