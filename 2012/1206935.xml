    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project is on nanopattern formation enabled by photo-induced processes at the surface of polarity patterned ferroelectric materials. The nanoscale surface properties of the ferroelectric materials are characterized using photo electron emission microscopy (PEEM) and scanned probe approaches. The research project combines chemical, photo-enhanced and thermal approaches to prepare polarity patterned ferroelectric surfaces with controlled screening. In situ surface processing and deposition of thin oxide films can provide uniformly terminated surfaces with enhanced electric fields which reflect the nanopatterns of the ferroelectric domains. Surface states, defects and the polarization bound charge lead to band bending effects which contribute to the photo-induced deposition process. A second approach for photo-induced nanopattern formation combines vanadium dioxide deposited on ferroelectric surfaces to drive an insulator-metal transition which follows the nanopatterned domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical: The project addresses the science that underpins approaches for nanopattern formation which could impact electronics or sensor technologies. The interdisciplinary research environment will enable the graduate and undergraduate students involved with this research to gain the expertise to consider a career in electronics or sensor technology development. The project also provides integrated projects that pair graduate student researchers with candidates of the ASU Professional Science Masters in Nanoscience. The K-12 education outreach is through the ASU Science is Fun program and a new demonstration on ferroelectric materials will become part of program for presentation to Phoenix area K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
