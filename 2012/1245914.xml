    <AbstractNarration>This award focuses on a specific research program that will be using data from the neutron monitor at McMurdo (which will be then moved to Jang Bogo) and from other worldwide locations. The research program is based on a unique southward cosmic rays "viewing direction" of the subject monitor for comprehensive analyses of individual solar events by measuring three dimensional distribution functions of solar energetic particles. The long and complete database acquired by the McMurdo monitor over 50+ years also plays an important role in the studies of historical trends in "solar modulation" of galactic cosmic rays and the influence of solar magnetic activity on the radiation input into the Earth's atmosphere. The recent deep solar minimum and slow recovery to the maximum are unprecedented for the potentially new era in the studies of the Sun. To ensure continuity of the McMurdo long-term dataset, it is proposed to move the monitor to the new Korean station Jang Bogo, which is located in Terra Nova Bay and has the viewing direction nearly identical to that of McMurdo. Solid science, international partners, and travel to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve excellent education and outreach goals. By providing undergraduates and two-year college students with Antarctic research experience, the proposal demonstrates how a future generation of scientists can make meaningful contributions to the cutting-edge research.</AbstractNarration>
