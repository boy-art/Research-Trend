    <AbstractNarration>The Raleigh Future Scholars program offers a comprehensive package of financial, mentoring, and career support to undergraduate students pursuing degrees in engineering and statistics disciplines. Students are recruited from the Raleigh Promise: a cross-sector community partnership program designed to increase educational outcomes for academically talented and economically disadvantaged youth in Raleigh, NC. Prior to the start of the academic year, the program begins with a summer transition program, offering incoming students guidance and mastering of necessary skills to shift into the rigorous undergraduate schedule. This support continues through graduation offering mentoring, career counseling, internships and personal guidance. Students self-document these activities through an e-portfolio that helps them see their progress, to communicate effectively about science and engineering, to acquire high ethical standards and professionalism, and to prepare for careers that fulfill their goals in life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assessment of this project is designed to provide a model of recruitment, retention, and academic advising, transferable to STEM programs at other institutions. The broader impacts of the proposed scholarship program are to improve North Carolina State University's capacities to increase the representation of students in areas of need and to highlight elements of undergraduate student support services (e.g. financial, academic, social, and career-related) that need to be addressed in order to promote long-term sustainable change.</AbstractNarration>
