    <AbstractNarration>This proposal provides funding for the first GREPSEC: Underrepresented Groups in Security Research workshop, which will be affiliated with the annual IEEE Symposium on Research in Security &amp; Privacy, in May 2013, in San Francisco CA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USC/ISI will organize a day-and-a-half long workshop for women and underrepresented minorities in computer security and privacy. The workshop will be held May 18-19, 2013. This is the weekend before the IEEE Computer Society's Security and Privacy Symposium, the premier conference in security, and this workshop will be co-located in San Francisco, California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of the workshop is to increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities in computer security research. Security is a wide field, encompassing network security, operating system security, language-based security, forensics, privacy, as well as legal and policy issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the organizers is to encourage PhD students who are female and from underrepresented groups to choose security as their field of specialization. Their approach is to show the wide range of problems within the field and how women and underrepresented groups are working towards solving those problems.</AbstractNarration>
