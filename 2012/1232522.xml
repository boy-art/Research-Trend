    <AbstractNarration>Bipedalism is a fundamental modern human behavior yet many questions about its evolution in our extinct ancestors remain unanswered. Paleoanthropologists studying fossilized skeletal anatomy have analyzed these data in many different ways, only to arrive at conflicting conclusions regarding when and how bipedalism evolved. New approaches are necessary to resolve this ongoing debate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral student Kevin Hatala (The George Washington University), under the supervision of Dr. Brian Richmond, will pursue a novel approach that circumvents these problems by analyzing a new type of 'fossilized behavior' data, in the form of recently discovered fossil hominin footprints. With a growing sample of fossil footprints from different times throughout the Plio-Pleistocene, these data can be used to investigate the evolution of human foot anatomy and bipedal locomotion. Before scientists can take advantage of the information stored in these footprints, however, there is need to determine how anatomy and gait are recorded in footprints. This study will use experimental biomechanics to investigate the dynamic process of footprint formation, and will apply this knowledge to the analysis of fossil hominin footprints from Laetoli, Tanzania; Ileret, Kenya; and Engare Sero, Tanzania. These analyses will directly test the hypothesis that modern humans' anatomical and functional adaptations for bipedal locomotion were present in hominins at 3.7, 1.5, and 0.12 million years ago, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through collaboration with the Rutgers University/National Museums of Kenya Koobi Fora Field School, this project involves extensive training of undergraduates from Kenya, South Africa, and the US. Results will be presented to scientific audiences through publications and conferences, and to the public through ongoing collaborations with the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History Human Origins Program. A new archival system will be developed at the National Museums of Kenya, allowing students and other researchers to access the original three-dimensional scans of fossil footprints generated during this project.</AbstractNarration>
