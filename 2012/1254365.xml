    <AbstractNarration>Chorus waves are naturally occurring whistler waves and are nearly monochromatic and discrete in time. Hiss waves are broadband and incoherent. This proposal addresses the relationship between these two types of waves and in particular will evaluate the idea that chorus waves evolve into hiss as they propagate. The proposal will use ground based instruments, laboratory experiments and numerical ray tracing. This research is important for magnetospheric physics because both types of wave emissions are thought to control the population of energetic electrons. &lt;br/&gt;This is a CAREER proposal and as such it has an extensive education and outreach element. It includes training of K-12 students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. It will involve the use of Capstone Senior Design projects to develop applications for smart phones. These waves are in the audio frequency range and can be received and recorded by using smart phone technology.</AbstractNarration>
