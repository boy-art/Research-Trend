    <AbstractNarration>Fostering Outstanding Cohorts in Undergraduate Science II (FOCUS II) provides a two-tier program for biology, biochemistry, chemistry, mathematics, and physics majors to promote retention at the freshman and sophomore levels and to provide targeted support for juniors and seniors. Students participate in cohort scheduling and a mentor network including graduate students, faculty, and professionals in their field and can apply for travel support to attend professional conferences. A "Careers in Science" seminar course is offered to provide career preparation, advice on coursework, professional career skills, and academic success skills to participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this program includes utilizing proven strategies in cohort building to focus on student retention in STEM majors while also employing new approaches to increase student success. This effort provides undergraduate students with financial support, as both an incentive to do well in their coursework, but also as a means to reduce the necessity for outside jobs during the most intensive portion of their undergraduate program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, this program provides training to a diverse population of low-income students. Students who participate will be well prepared to enter STEM fields or graduate programs with a strong mentor network to assist them. The program team works with an external evaluator to measure student outcomes and provide both formative and summative assessment of program activities, which will be disseminated to the science education community through conferences and publications.</AbstractNarration>
