    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing, conducting, and disseminating an undergraduate-level course designed to increase the confidence and ability of early childhood education (ECE) students to teach science and mathematics to young children. It leverages the strengths of the partnering institutions: (1) the Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS), the public science center at the University of California, Berkeley; and (2) Los Medanos College (LMC), a community college located in Pittsburg, CA, which serves a large number of students pursuing certificates and degrees in ECE. LHS has been a leader in developing and teaching hands-on, developmentally appropriate science and mathematics programs for people of all ages for over four decades. LMC brings educational expertise in child development and teacher preparation. The Child Study Center on the LMC campus serves as a site for field experiences, observations, and collection of authentic documentation of real-world classroom activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on the idea that preparing teachers to teach early childhood science and mathematics is most effective when they themselves manipulate and investigate concrete materials, take time to develop and test ideas, and experience a supportive and collaborative environment that nurtures their curiosity. The course is tailored to meet the needs of the large number of community college ECE students who are "nontraditional learners." The focus on nontraditional college student development is important in addressing the needs of diverse populations entering ECE. Early childhood educators often lack a background in science and mathematics, and they often doubt their capacity to effectively facilitate teaching and learning in those areas. In light of what is known about the importance of early science and mathematics experiences for young children, it is critical that early childhood pre-service and in-service teachers acquire the appropriate blend of science and mathematics content and pedagogical skills to increase confidence and attitudes toward science and mathematics teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the evaluation, the project team is collecting and analyzing data to understand the impact of the course on ECE students' content knowledge, understanding of developmentally appropriate pedagogy, and confidence in and comfort with engaging young children in science and mathematics. The investigators are also developing a course guide, along with supporting instructional materials, to allow the course to be implemented in early childhood programs at colleges and universities nationwide. Ultimately, the project is designed to promote change and improve community college coursework and practical experiences related to teaching science and mathematics in early childhood settings.</AbstractNarration>
