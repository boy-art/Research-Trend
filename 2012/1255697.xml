    <AbstractNarration>The most abundant metazoans in the open sea are often the earliest developmental stages of copepods, their nauplii. Nauplii remain under-studied due to the limitations of conventional techniques and an historical emphasis on studying the larger mesozooplankton. However, there is increasing recognition that nauplii play important roles in food web dynamics, and considerable evidence that nauplii may be important trophic intermediaries between microbial and classical food webs due to their high abundance, high weight-specific ingestion rates, and ability to feed on relatively small particles. This team of investigators is developing a novel molecular approach to studying diverse populations of nauplii in mixed field samples based on quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). They propose to complete development and validation of this qPCR-based technique for enumeration of nauplii, and evaluate its utility in the field. The specific objectives of this research are to identify and reduce technical and biological sources of error in the methodology, determine the accuracy of the method across a range of environmental conditions, and complete one paired field experiment that compares the grazing impact of naupliar and protozoan micro-grazers in a model subtropical coastal ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project will include training of graduate and undergraduate students, inclusion of research results in graduate and undergraduate courses at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, and public outreach through the web and in public venues. These PIs have a strong track record of engaging under-represented students in research, and particular emphasis will be placed on recruiting and training students from under-represented backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
