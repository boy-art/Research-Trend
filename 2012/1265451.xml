    <AbstractNarration>Modern computer system architectures are forcing computational scientists to move scientific applications&lt;br/&gt;from traditional homogeneous cpu-based systems to heterogeneous multi-core/accelerator architectures. &lt;br/&gt;Obtaining performance in the presence of accelerators requires close attention to&lt;br/&gt;the memory hierarchy and chip-level parallelism to reach even a modest fraction&lt;br/&gt;of the potential performance. As a result, coding tasks which were once the province of&lt;br/&gt;lone graduate students in a single discipline now require interdisciplinary teams of people. &lt;br/&gt;Project Chemora will explore the design of a new application framework for automatically&lt;br/&gt;creating highly optimized code for high-end computational machines. The system&lt;br/&gt;will use as input a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe a&lt;br/&gt;problem, it will then construct a machine-specific abstract performance model, and using these&lt;br/&gt;it will generate well-tuned code and execution configurations for accelerated&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., hybrid CPU/GPU) computing clusters at various scales. Chemora will&lt;br/&gt;improve programmability in this simplified domain by decoupling the science and&lt;br/&gt;computer science at a high level, thereby reducing the complexity and number of issues scientists need to&lt;br/&gt;collectively understand and allowing individual scientists in the team to focus on their area of&lt;br/&gt;specialty. Chemora will improve performance (both wallclock time and energy) for&lt;br/&gt;systems with both simple and complex sets of equations by making use of detailed&lt;br/&gt;information describing the problem and machine, and will provide improved load&lt;br/&gt;balancing through the AMPI framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemora project has chosen the Einstein equations as the primary science driver because&lt;br/&gt;these equations are one of the more complex PDE systems, one with many&lt;br/&gt;hundreds of terms, and a problem scale that is challenging to optimize for most&lt;br/&gt;compilers. Achieving this vision for a general scientific problem would indeed&lt;br/&gt;be a "Grand Challenge" in computational science, but in order to give our&lt;br/&gt;research a sharper focus we have chosen as a science driver the&lt;br/&gt;simulation of Intermediate mass ratio Binary Black Hole (IBBH) systems. Such&lt;br/&gt;systems, consisting of a black hole of mass 100 to 1,000 solar masses orbited by&lt;br/&gt;a smaller black hole of mass 5 to 20 solar masses are expected to be important&lt;br/&gt;sources of gravitational waves for advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational&lt;br/&gt;Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). Accurate modeling of&lt;br/&gt;the waveforms from IBBH systems will be necessary in order to extract&lt;br/&gt;gravitational wave signals using template-matching data analysis techniques.</AbstractNarration>
