    <AbstractNarration>The CALIPER Project (Catalyst to Assess Learning and Instructional Practices for Evidence-based Reform) is leveraging Boise State University's recently reformed general education curriculum to transform undergraduate STEM instructional practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the CALIPER project is 1) documenting the use of evidence-based instructional practices in STEM foundational courses; 2) assessing the learning outcomes achieved by students in these courses; and 3) associating these observed instructional practices with the learning outcomes achieved. The Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) is being used to document evidence-based instructional practices. Student work (e.g. written assignments and exams) is being collected and assessed to evaluate the degree to which students achieve intended learning outcomes, such as "apply quantitative reasoning to draw appropriate conclusions" and "understand the process of inquiry and analysis in response to evidence." This process is building a sustainable assessment system for collecting and analyzing data to understand the relationship between instructional practices and student learning outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By integrating assessment of evidence-based instructional practices and student learning outcomes, the CALIPER project is informing the national dialogue on effective education of future STEM professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry. Successful implementation and dissemination of this model will provide both an incentive and a roadmap for other educational institutions that wish to take effective action to improve STEM learning for their students.</AbstractNarration>
