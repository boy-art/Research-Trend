Household Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are intended to collect information in the home and to communicate with each other to create powerful new applications that support our day-to-day activities Existing research suggests that users have a difficult time selecting their privacy settings on such devices The goal of this project is to investigate how why and when privacy decisions of household IoT users are suboptimal and to use the insights from this research to create and test a simple single user interface that integrates privacy settings across all devices within a household This interface will have a flexible set of privacy profiles that fits a wide range of privacy preferences and also helps US companies to comply with EU privacy regulations when they operate in the European marketUnlike existing privacy research which assumes that users employ limited but essentially rational decision-making practices this project aims to understand consumers' actual decision processes In this way we can improve theories about privacy decision making using part-worth utility mapping and process tracing (including eye-tracking) The results of these efforts are used to develop a data-driven set of privacy profiles that cover the privacy preferences of most users These profiles are then integrated into a privacy management interface (an open-source contribution to an existing IoT management platform) that does not overload users with information and control but instead leverages their existing decision processes and avoids their biases

Graphene has proven to be a truly unique material and the record holder for a number of physical parameters It is expected that employment of graphene as a highly conductive and transparent material would create a new class of electronic devices characterized by excellent durability and flexural freedom However despite recent significant progress in scaling up fabrication of large area graphene sheets the fabrication methods still require significant effort and sophisticated multistage handling of the material To this end this award targets the manufacture of highly conductive graphene-based films from micron-scale sheets of reduced-graphene oxide which can be obtained from naturally occurring graphite The manufacturing method in this project is environmentally friendly does not involve toxic organic solvents and utilizes conventional industrial equipment The approach has a significant potential to rapidly grow to industrial scale and therefore increase the competitiveness of US based-manufacturing and create employment opportunities In course of the work significant effort will be directed to increase the numbers of students especially underrepresented minorities and women who wish to pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering Students will benefit greatly from this project's interdisciplinary nature and hands-on approachThe ultimate goal of this work is the design and understanding of a robust and scalable nanomanufacturing method for the fabrication of highly conductive highly flexible and transparent reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based nano-scale layers or films via a facile dip-coating process assisted with polymer adsorbed layers The method is based on enveloping individual graphene oxide (GO) sheets in few nm thick polymer layers allowing for near-perfect formation of the GO monolayer by scalable conventional dip-coating After the dip-coating a polymer interlayer is deposited on the GO/ RMS (reactive macromolecular super-spreader) monolayer by adsorption The polymer interlayer is employed to promote formation of the second GO monolayer (by dip-coating) and provide carbon atoms to connect the bottom and upper rGO monolayers during the GO reduction This work directly addresses a number of the grand challenges for the large-scale nanomanufacturing of rGO-based conductive transparent flexible films Specifically it is expected that the research manufacturing method will allow the straightforward and reproducible fabrication of tight GO monolayers on non-conductive substrates control of the thickness of the rGO layer with single layer precision and achieve high coherency and robustness of the fabricated layer In terms of properties the project targets the manufacture of highly conductive (low sheet resistance) and transparent (low absorbance in visible region) rGO-based nanoscale films on non-conductive oxide surfaces

This project provides funding to develop HomeSHARE a community infrastructure for doing research around aging in place that provides the community with access to a network of smart homes with a standard sensor package and the ability to add custom technology as needed for specific studies Currently although there is much research interest in using home-based sensors to model mobility and health setting up these kinds of studies is difficult and there is little infrastructure to support it This tends to cause duplicate wasted effort in setting up sites; very small numbers of participating homes limiting the generality and power of the research; and incompatibilities in the setups used by different teams that make it hard to put different pieces of research together To address this the team will create the backbone of a large network of homes that can support research that uses sensed information to predict a number of attributes about older adults at home including mobility patterns mental health hospital readmissions and energy use The main activities are to deploy their suite of sensors and other computing technology in a total of 30 volunteers' homes at two partner institutions and develop software that connects and collects data from the homes Team members will work carefully with residents of the homes to cover the costs of technologies and address privacy and technical concerns they have They will also create materials that cover technical ethical and training issues that other researchers can use both as client sites to conduct studies using the existing network (for a fee to cover operating costs) and as installation sites who join the network directly by adding their own smart homes To manage demand for the infrastructure the team will create a governing board of researchers drawn initially from the awardees' institutions This board will review the technology needs and applications for studies to ensure that they meet the ethical and research goals of the project The hope is that through this research the infrastructure will pay for itself many times over not just in knowledge but in improved health and life quality outcomes for older adults; it will also provide service- and project-based learning opportunities for a number of graduate and undergraduate studentsThe network will consist of a number of homes using a standardized technology package to ensure consistent reliable and secure data collection and data sharing across the many studies while also addressing privacy and acceptability concerns for participants It will include a number of window and door sensors a wearable activity tracker a tablet computer for communicating with and collecting survey information from residents a wireless access point and paid internet access and an in-home server that manages the installed devices and data The servers will be connected and managed with an enhanced version of the team's existing Piloteur framework for reliable sensor data collection in homes Piloteur will be extended to support larger-scale deployment and changes in the standard technology package demanded by technology advances and research needs and will add a layer for storing securing and sharing the data using existing open standards Installation sites will be run by technicians supervised by the research team The technicians will handle recruiting and communicating with participants as well as deploying and debugging the technology installations in the homes and participants will be recruited to ensure diversity along demographic factors that should improve generalizability of results The team will also develop materials to make it easy for other researchers to use and join the network For those who want to access the existing network for individual studies they will develop a HomeSHARE Study Packet that includes guidance on study planning and costs technical aspects of the homes and data and sample materials from prior studies that have been approved by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) For those who want to join the network they will create a HomeSHARE Site Kit that includes information about best practices around recruitment and installation sample IRB materials for existing sites and standard budget information useful for writing proposals to join the network A leadership committee initially composed of researchers from the awardee institutions will oversee project management including the coordination of studies using the network the evolution of the standard technology package the addition of new installation sites to the network and the administration of the data sharing and costs

There is an established need for highly qualified K-12 science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers especially in high-need schools It can be particularly challenging to recruit middle grades STEM teachers who have a strong content background in a specific STEM discipline With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program the Preparing and Mentoring Middle Grades STEM Educators to Teach in High-Need South Carolina School Districts project is recruiting career changers from STEM fields and preparing them to become middle grades STEM teachers The project is funding 40 scholarships over 4 years In this project Clemson University is collaborating with Greenville County Public Schools Recipients will be enrolled in a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program that includes initial teacher certification for Middle Grades Education The Noyce Scholarships will expand opportunities for STEM career changers to complete the MAT program and hence also expand the number of middle grades STEM teachers in the stateThe project will investigate the impact of the Noyce Program by analyzing 16 years of data from the Clemson MAT in middle grades program which has enrolled more than 250 individuals 86 of whom have been or will be Noyce Scholars Research questions include:  How do teacher efficacy and other personal characteristic affect teacher retention and success among STEM instructors  Do STEM career changers possess different characteristics than STEM majors who come directly out of undergraduate majors (3) How does the performance of the students of Noyce Scholars and non-Noyce-Scholars compare (4) How does the performance of the students of STEM majors and non-STEM majors compare The goal is to identify characteristics of successful STEM teachers and to determine the extent to which a STEM background strengthens the impact of a middle grades teacher

Professors Pennington and Garcia and their colleagues in the Chemistry Department of Clemson University host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF Chemistry REU program This Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) brings ten participants annually from regional Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) primarily undergraduate institutions and two-year technical colleges Undergraduates perform research in the areas of advanced materials and chemical biology In addition the undergraduates are provided many opportunities for personal and professional growth and development through numerous workshops seminars and panel discussions on topics ranging from the fundamentals of instrumentation techniques research opportunities in the various disciplines of chemistry career planning and preparation and the role of women and underrepresented groups in the sciences The recruitment and selection process targets female and underrepresented minority students who despite having academic metrics that limit their opportunities in conventional REU programs feature noncognitive factors (positive self-concept realistic self-appraisal long-range goals system navigation leadership and demonstrated community service) that indicate a strong aptitude for researchThe REU students perform research in two high impact areas: advanced materials and chemical biology to improve the health and quality of life of our society Some of the areas of study available to students include examination of carbon nanotube-peptide composite structures the synthesis and characterization of plasmonic nanoparticle assemblies the synthesis of proton conducting polymer electrodes with applications to fuel cells the development of nanocomposites and biocompatible surfaces the study of quantum dots with applications to sensors and imaging and the development of peptide-based chiral catalysts The research training students receive in the lab the professional development fostered by the workshops panel discussions and seminars at Clemson University and the subsequent presentation of their work at professional conferences contributes to students' ability to successfully pursue a productive career in chemistry and related sciences

In conventional engineered materials an engineering designer often selects a material from tabulated databases of products and completes an iterative process of checking the adequacy of the conceptual design for meeting performance requirements The final engineering design is thus handicapped by the initial material selection A material designer on the other hand works with a library of material compositions and processing methodologies with a goal to discover how new properties emerge from microstructure control for example The focus of material design is thus limited to achieving specific property enhancements without considering the end application of the material There is a need to unify the material and engineering design processes so that new materials can be intentionally designed with the specific goal of incorporation into a useful product and the engineering design can be freed from the upfront material-based constraints This project will establish a concurrent design process combining top-down goal-oriented decision-making to optimize engineering system performance with bottom-up constraint-aware algorithms to efficiently search the domain of feasible material designs for polymer nanocomposites This research project will provide innovation in design methodologies enabling a competitive advantage to our nation's manufacturing industries as well as energy and defense technologies This award supports fundamental research for the development of a new design paradigm termed Concurrent Unified State-aware Tailoring of Materials (CUSToM) The PIs will take a Bayesian approach to searching over the design domain facilitating explicit consideration of the uncertainties in every aspect of the process In the CUSToM framework computer simulation (either empirical or first-principles based) is an integral part of the search process capturing the material scientist's domain knowledge The hypothesis underlying this project is that the top-down search processes engrained in the CUSToM framework will yield products with superior performance compared to those obtained with conventional materials design This hypothesis will be tested on the design of polymer nanocomposites with precisely determined material microstructure composition and processing methods for applications in wind energy; specifically high-strength light-weight composites for next generation wind turbine blades The broader impacts of this work will go beyond providing a new design paradigm for engineered materials to include the training of undergraduate and graduate researchers exposure of undergraduate and graduate students to the world of entrepreneurship and outreach to K-12 students in order to motivate them towards careers in STEM related fields

Obesity is one of the most pressing health challenges faced by our country and has been the target of much attention in the mobile health (mHealth) community While the science of obesity indicates that diet is a major factor in behavioral change to encourage healthy weight management we are still not able to effectively quickly and easily measure eating and drinking behavior This project's goal is to develop a digital earpiece­­ small and comfortable enough to wear behind the ear­­ that can sense and detect actions such as eating and drinking The project's long­term vision is to enable behavioral ­health researchers to better understand health-­related behaviors and subsequently to support the development of effective behavioral­ health interventions that promote healthy diet and behavior Ultimately a better understanding of eating-­related behaviors and better design of effective interventions regarding eating behavior will have profound impact on personal and public health as well as the national economy The project's hardware and software prototypes will be shared widely in the research community to enable experimentation around the sensing and interaction opportunities possible in an earpiece device Furthermore the project directly involves undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary research and outreach to middle­school students expanding the supply of scientists educated in this important emerging topic The project's approach is to build a prototype wireless earpiece small enough to wear behind the ear with low­power (microwatt­scale) electronics and software sufficient to allow for the battery to last a full waking day; to develop efficient algorithms for detecting and distinguishing health­related behaviors (eating drinking smoking speaking and stress); and to develop easy and effective means for the wearer to interact with the earpiece and its applications The team expects to develop novel low­-power analog electronics and distributed software algorithms for inferring relevant behaviors from sensor data; develop novel interaction modalities involving bone ­conduction audio between the earpiece and its wearer complemented by tactile interfaces on the earpiece on the skin or on auxiliary devices like a wristband or smartphone; and validate these approaches through user studies and experiments inside and outside the lab

As data-intensive science becomes the norm in many fields of science high-performance data transfer is rapidly becoming a standard cyberinfrastructure requirement To meet this requirement an increasingly large number of university campuses have deployed Science DMZs A Science DMZ is a portion of the network built at or near the edge of the campus or laboratory's network that is designed such that the equipment configuration and security policies are optimized for high-performance scientific applications rather than for general-purpose computing This project develops a secure and resilient architecture called SciGuard that addresses the security challenges and the inherent weaknesses in Science DMZs SciGuard is based on two emerging networking paradigms Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) both of which enable the granularity flexibility and elasticity needed to secure Science DMZs Two core security functions an SDN firewall application and a virtual Intrusion Detection System (IDS) coexist in SciGuard for protecting Science DMZs The SDN firewall application is a software-based in-line security function running atop the SDN controller It can scale well without bypassing the firewall using per-flow/per-connection network traffic processing It is also separated from the institutional hardware-based firewalls to enforce tailored security policies for the science-only traffic sent to Science DMZs The virtual IDS is an NFV-based passive security function which can be quickly instantiated and elastically scaled to deal with attack traffic variations in Science DMZs while significantly reducing both equipment and operational costs In addition to these functions the researchers also design a cloud-based federation mechanism for SciGuard to support security policy automatic testing and security intelligence sharing The new mechanisms developed in this project are robust scalable low cost easily managed and optimally provisioned therefore substantially enhancing the security of Science DMZs This research encourages the diversity of students involved in the project by active recruitment of women and other underrepresented groups for participation in the project The project has substantial involvement of graduate students in research and trains promising undergraduate students in the implementation and experiments of the proposed approach Moreover the project enhances academic curricula by integrating the research findings into new and existing courses

Youth environmental education (EE) programs often serve as gateway experiences in which diverse audiences engage in informal science learning While there is evidence that these programs can have positive impacts on participants little empirical research has been conducted to determine what makes one program more successful than another To be able to conduct such research this Exploratory Pathways study will  develop and statistically validate ways to measure meaningful outcomes for participants across a variety of programs and  test observational methods that will enable research that can determine which elements of program delivery most powerfully influence participant engagement and learning outcomes in different contexts These efforts will include consultations with diverse subject matter experts from the National Park Service nature centers and academia; survey research with participants in afterschool and free-choice EE programs; and observations of EE programs designed to fine tune the measurement of program delivery elements and student engagement Developing valid and reliable outcomes measures and observational protocols will enable a larger investigation that will specifically address the following research question: What program characteristics lead to the best learning outcomes for program participants in different contexts This research will result in empirically tested guidelines that will enable educators to design and deliver more effective programs for a wide range of audiences in a wide range of contexts It is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which seeks to advance new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning in informal environmentsThis effort will refine methods necessary to undertake an unprecedented study (and future AISL Research in Service to Practice proposal) to examine the linkages between pedagogical approaches participant engagement and learning outcomes in informal STEM-focused youth EE programs The larger study will involve systematically observing a large number of programs to assess the use of different approaches and to link those approaches to engagement and learning outcomes through both observation and survey research In this current study the team will develop and refine crosscutting outcome measures to ensure validity reliability and sensitivity by drawing upon the literature and consultation with key stakeholders to develop suites of indicators for subsequent psychometric testing and revision They will also refine observational techniques for assessing pedagogical approaches through extensive testing of inter-rater reliability Finally techniques for measuring participant engagement incorporating both observational techniques and retrospective participant surveys will be refinedThe work will be conducted by researchers at Clemson University and Virginia Tech in partnership with the US National Park Service the North American Association for Environmental Education and the American Association of Nature Center Administrators This work represents the first step in a longer research process to determine the "best practices" most responsible for achieving outcomes in a wide range of contexts

As the role of computing in scientific discovery continues to increase campuses across the country are challenged with the task of providing effective facilitation for computing capabilities so that researchers can harness these capabilities in their investigations Such facilitation requires novel organizational approaches to the way that both human and physical resources that constitute campus research computing capabilities are composed structured and operated The mission of the Campus Research Computing (CaRC) Infrastructures Consortium is to provide a national forum for the exchange and dissemination of best practices expertise and technologies enabling the advancement of campus-based research computing activities By bringing together a wide range of campuses and community stakeholders the CaRC Consortium provides a novel yet complementary element of an evolving and expanding national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem Governed by a council according to the consortium bylaws the CaRC Consortium acts as unique force in advancing the impact of computing on the productivity of faculty and students As an organization that is driven by the campus perspective of research computing the CaRC offers several key outcomes at a national scale including the sharing of knowledge best practices software and hardware technologies expertise workforce development and professional development This fills a void within the national research computing fabric; as more campuses recognize the value of investments in research computing capacity and also in facilitators and like-functioning positions many of these campuses and their individual staff members are isolated in a new field of practice without the necessary supporting infrastructure from a practitioner community

Every day we are confronted with an abundance of decisions that require us to choose from a seemingly endless number of choice options Recommender systems are supposed to help us deal with this formidable task but some scholars claim that these systems instead put us inside a "Filter Bubble" that severely limits our perspectives This project investigates a new direction for recommender systems research with the main goal of supporting users in developing exploring and understanding their unique personal preferences The project will develop a new type of recommender system: a Recommender System for Self-Actualization (RSSA) which will support decisions that have a resounding influence on our life (eg choosing an education or a job) where we do not want to just take the easiest option but rather to develop ourselves into unique individuals with a strong sense of determination that we have chosen the right pathIn contrast to most existing recommender systems research this project carefully considers the psychology of consumer choice processes and develops new types of recommendations to support these processes in novel ways (the RSSA features) The PI's team will develop a new recommender system outfitted with the capability to display a traditional Top-N recommendation list plus each new RSSA feature The team will then test the benefit of each RSSA feature against traditional Top-N recommendations in an online user experiment This benefit will be measured by participants' subjective evaluation of the system and their usage behavior logs

Origami is the ancient art of folding paper into decorative shapes and geometries Over the last several decades it evolved and became a design framework for many engineering and architecture applications Examples include deployable space structures kinetic buildings self-folding robots surgery devices and advanced materials Origami folding so far has been considered as a static process People typically focus on its design and geometry or internal actuation mechanisms that makes the folding autonomous This award supports a collaborative project that will investigate the fundamental dynamic characteristics of origami folding In particular the research will explore how to harness the extraordinary properties of origami for applications like vibration isolation at low frequency recoverable impact absorption and impulsive actuation Furthermore the research will produce design tools that can generate sophisticated folding patterns and assign material properties that are suitable for a wide variety of dynamic performance requirements The results of this project will become the building blocks for the next generation of air marine and land vehicles intelligent machines and robots or smart infrastructures enhancing their functionality safety and sustainability The findings will thus advance the aerospace civil mechanical robotics and many other industries Education and broadening participation plans will focus on student learning and community outreach at various levels and on the enhancement diversity through inclusion in the research activities of members of underrepresented minorities in science and engineeringThis research will for the first time rigorously investigate the dynamic characteristics of origami folding and develop its corresponding engineering potentials Preliminary studies have discovered that origami with generic crease patterns exhibits many attractive properties via folding such as zero/negative stiffness pressure dependent multi-stability and piece-wise stiffness jump Such surprisingly rich properties and the corresponding dynamic responses will be analyzed in detail based on an equivalent truss-frame model which transforms the continuous origami structure into a finite degree of freedom system The truss frame model would also become the basis of a comprehensive synthesis tool that incorporates crease perturbation and optimization so that the origami can be customized for prescribed dynamic performances This synthesis tool will bridge the currently separated branches of studies: the mathematical theories of origami design/folding and the engineering of origami based applications Overall the new modeling analysis and synthesis tools for origami dynamics will create a significant intellectual leap and build a strong foundation for many future related research and development efforts

By the end of the decade the US Department of Transportation (DOT) will likely require all new vehicles to be Connected Vehicles (CV) capable of communicating with other vehicles and roadside infrastructure through wireless communications in order to reduce the number of crashes and save lives The crash avoidance applications supported by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity exchange safety critical information such as speed location and direction of movement to assess the crash risk based on the proximity of vehicles While standards such as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) will play a key role other technologies such as WiFi LTE (cellular) or other emerging technologies can lower overall systems cost as well as supplement the availability coverage and peak data rate requirements of DSRC-based systems The South Carolina Connected Vehicle Testbed (SC-CVT) is located along a 10-mile segment of Interstate I-85 near Clemson's International Center for Automotive Research (ICAR) campus in Greenville South Carolina Two specific example CV applications that will be developed are traffic incident detection and queue warning These two applications provide a convenient starting point for illustrating how CV applications can benefit from advanced network technology that integrates multiple wireless technologies in a CV systemHeterogeneous networks (HetNets) are networks that integrate and exploit multiple concurrently available networking technologies For critical applications requiring resource allocation optimization in order to meet safety-driven performance requirements This project is using a combination of Software Defined Networking local computing provided by GENI racks and control based on statistical learning theory to demonstrate optimized HetNet operation on the SC-CVT

This collaborative EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) research project focuses on a design concept that may allow energy harvesting from waste heat by converting the heat to electrical energy The vision of the research is to use heat pipes in particular so-called oscillating heat pipes (OHP) Inside an OHP a series of serpentine-arranged mini-channels exist that are partially filled with a working fluid There has been limited if any research in the area of energy-harvesting through the use of heat pipes Heat pipes provide salient mechanical work within their structure due to vapor expansion and fluid flow This research aims to harvest this internal work by augmenting the OHP heat transfer to the environment through utilization of a specially designed energy harvesting system that enables generation of electrical work through a piezoelectric effect namely thermally-actuated piezoelectric transduction (TPT) This research project will contribute to better understanding of the physics and application of TPT improved understanding of piezoelectric-materials energy-harvesting using OHPs This research will bridge research perspectives and approaches from the thermal/fluid sciences and power generation Potential applications for these devices are numerous especially for waste heat recovery and/or renewable power generation The technology and basic science derived can result in: off-grid power generation for communications devices (eg third world country cellular phone charging and defense applications) more energy-efficient electronics packaging schemes and new opportunities for high heat flux thermal energy harvesting Geothermal temperature gradients may also be exploited for constant renewable power generation via the implementation of ultra-large OHP/TPT systems or OHP/TPTs aligned in-series This collaborative project will support both graduate and undergraduate researchers that have been traditionally underrepresentedThe OHP has yet to be investigated as a means to destabilize natural temperature gradients for the purpose of establishing a Stirling cycle nor has it been investigated as a means for power generation A unique opportunity for using TPT is atop a flat-plate oscillating heat pipe (OHP) - a device that effectively transfers heat via cyclic phase change of an internal working fluid - giving rise to an oscillatory temperature field on its surface The research will investigate the use of both TPT and OHPs for combined 1) power generation/energy harvesting and 2) highly-efficient heat transfer To accomplish this a unique energy harvester which is directly attached to the OHP surface will be designed and will consist of a micro-sized heat sink encapsulated gas and suspended spring-resisted piezoelectric material An aggressive schedule of well-designed experiments is planned to determine how the effectiveness of TPT depends on OHP and energy harvester design A highly-coupled set of governing equations will be defined and solved by joining common OHP thermo/fluidic models with the constitutive equations of piezoelectric materials Numerical multi-physics software will be utilized to simulate the convective air flow in the energy harvester and electricity generation inherent to the proposed method for OHP-integrated TPT The mechanical response and fatigue of various piezoelectric materials for TPT will be evaluated Thermoelectricity generation via the proposed OHP/TPT is a unique and potentially transformative approach to enthalpy-to-electricity conversion as the OHP/TPT can efficiently transfer heat from one location to another (with ultra-high thermal conductivity) while also generating power

PI: Koley Goutam Proposal Number: 1606882 The goal is to develop bio-implantable sensors utilizing the unique material properties of graphene and boron nitride which would offer much higher sensitivity for detecting concentration of various ions in blood and tissue in real time enabling prediction of the onset of disease states before their clinical manifestation The project activities would integrate research with education and training of high school undergraduate and graduate students with significant minority participation The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop novel graphene-based flexible ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) sensors for the measurement of K+ Ca2+ and Na+ ion concentrations and correlated ion fluxes in cardiomyocytes and glial cells with the overall objective of developing a new approach for assaying cell membrane ion transport in primary cell culture The detection of the aforementioned ions is clinically significant as they serve as important bio-markers for onset of myocardial ischemia and epilepsy The proposed graphene ISFET sensor array will enable critical understanding of K+ Ca2+ and Na+ membrane transport in glial cells and cardiomyocytes The approach of ISFET development utilizing the novel properties of boron nitride and graphene addresses several critical issues including: (i) the complicacy low throughput and cell invasiveness issues of patch clamp and microelectrode array based techniques and (ii) the low sensitivity and degradation of commercially available Si-based ISFETs The experimental plan includes growing cells directly on graphene and performing continuous real-time and label-free measurements of ion fluxes in cardiomyocytes and glial cells The measurements acquired are expected to provide electrophysiological properties of primary cells in culture especially regulatory and drug-induced changes in their electrical properties Successful completion would result in the development of useful ISFET sensors for in vivo detection of the onset of myocardial ischemia and epilepsy As part of the educational and outreach activities the PIs would each involve at least one undergraduate and one high school student to work on this project every year focusing strongly on recruiting minority students The PIs would also integrate research results in a graduate course and disseminate them through conference participation as well as research websites&#8195;
