Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) programs have positive effects on student understanding of the nature of science motivation and academic performance However little is understood about how UREs affect students' views of research their identities as researchers and their beliefs about knowledge in engineering Investigating students' researcher identities and beliefs about knowledge (epistemic beliefs) in the context of URE is important because they shape the students' perceptions values and interactions with others which can then be translated to their classes and future careers The outcomes of this study help develop meaningful ways for students to engage function and learn in research spaces as well as classrooms and laboratories Findings also expand theories about identity and epistemic beliefs in ways that are specific to engineering fields The goal of the project is to address the challenge of producing engineers who are well-equipped to tackle complex ill-defined and open-ended problems similar to those encountered when doing research The results enable engineering educators to provide novel educational experiences developing students as future researchers and engineers such that these experiences will have long term impacts The project's broader impacts include benefits to fields beyond engineering that engage students in research Also by including diverse student populations in the study a deeper understanding is gained about how students from different backgrounds engineering fields and types of institutions experience and benefit from participating in researchThe overarching research question for this project is: How do undergraduate engineering students develop their identities as researchers and their ways of knowing engineering through research experiences There are four specific aims of this project The first is to understand how undergraduate engineering students conceptualize and construct what it means to be a researcher The second is to discover what factors the students think affect their researcher identity development The third is to find out how these students describe what it means to know something in their fields The fourth is to understand how students form their beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing during research experiences A grounded theory approach is used to expand existing identity and epistemic belief frameworks to develop a theory within the context of research experiences in engineering The three-phase study uses open-ended surveys and interviews to identify themes that answer the research aims and can be used to develop workshops The intellectual merit of the project lies in developing an engineering-specific learning theory based on students' beliefs about ways of knowing and their identities as researchers This theory is used to inform and work with engineering educators to find ways to apply research findings in engineering degree programs and UREs Workshops for engineering educators focus on ways to incorporate the aspects of UREs that help build students' ways of knowing and their identities as participants in their research communities and their engineering fields

1534304(Sarupria) & 1533874(Battiato)This project addresses a grand challenge facing society today--how to make clean water available to a growing population at low cost Membranes used in water treatment processes are exposed to feed waters containing organic inorganic and biological species which leads to fouling and loss of membrane productivity over time Since performance loss due to fouling is one of the largest costs associated with membrane processes in water treatment discovery of new surface treatments that limit fouling would have significant economic and societal impacts Fouling propensity of a membrane depends greatly on its surface properties such as chemistry and morphology The goal of this project is to develop the multiscale mathematical framework to predict fouling behavior on the surfaces of membranes with different geometric patterns and chemical coatings The ability to predict fouling properties of new membrane surfaces in silico will accelerate the discovery of novel membrane designs and decrease the time from laboratory to market In this project comprehensive studies involving iterative feedback between computational modeling and experimental measurements will be performed to test two main hypotheses:  targeted combinations of geometric and chemical patterns on a membrane surface will significantly reduce membrane fouling and  experimentally-trained multiscale computational models will accelerate the discovery of novel geometric and chemical surface modifications that significantly reduce membrane fouling This research will (i) produce a mathematical framework and corresponding models to identify the physical mechanisms and geometric features controlling mass and momentum transfer through and over micro- and nanopatterned membranes (ii) provide a deep understanding of how foulants and energy fluxes are controlled and regulated by complex topologies and (iii) elucidate how the macroscopic behavior of filtration flow rates and reactive transport processes are coupled with phenomena at the micro- and nano-scale This work will be transformational because delivering an experimentally-validated computational framework will enable rapid screening of many membrane surface modifications to short-list the most promising ones for further testing and it will lead to a leapfrog improvement in membrane filtration technologies This project will provide a multidisciplinary environment for training graduate and undergraduate researchers New communication platforms such as Zoom video conferencing will be used to deliver virtual science demonstrations and laboratory tours to elementary school students Virtual and interactive conferences will be held bi-annually to educate a broad audience about membrane science water purification and materials engineering

Corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete structures is one of the critical parameters in deterioration of concrete structures It is hypothesized that reduction in grain size in steel can significantly reduce corrosion in reinforcing bars Analytical and experimental studies will be pursued to correlate between grain size and level of corrosion The experiments in this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will include putting the reinforcing steel in the simulated concrete environment The grain size in steel will be altered using thermal cycles to determine effects of grain size on corrosion and mechanical properties The reinforcing steel will be subjected to chloride contaminated concrete pore solution and the level of corrosion on the corroded steel bars will be assessed using different microscopic and spectroscopic analyses Mechanical properties of the steel with different grain sizes will be obtained with standard tests Cost analysis of the alteration of grain size will be pursued in this exploratory project to determine viability of the processElectron backscatter diffraction technique to obtain quantitative microstructural map will be used for crystallographic nature of the steel specimens This technique reveals grain size grain boundary character grain orientation texture and phase identity of the specimens The microstructural map in an analytical model will allow predicting the pitting corrosion behavior of steel with different grain sizes Physical and chemical composition of the steel will be obtained using scanning electrochemical microscopy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and optical profiler The analytical model will include pitting growth as a variable Life cycle cost analysis will be pursued as related to grain size necessary to reduce corrosion A procedure that is in a standard for cost analysis for measuring life cycle costs in buildings will be used for this purpose The final results of this exploratory project will be to understand corrosion as related to grain size of steel exposed to environment of concrete

The investigators are conducting fundamental research focused on the synthesis of a series of novel "vine-like" robots Vines are found throughout the natural (and human-made) world They have unique capabilities allowing them to adapt to congested spaces and/or irregular terrain significant voids and unpredictable dynamic environmental interactions Robots emulating the capabilities of vines can extend the reach (literally and figuratively) of robotics into previously inaccessible domains and applications This offers new and useful solutions across a wide range of endeavors important to society including persistent environmental monitoring field archaeology medical procedures and urban disaster reliefExploiting their combined expertise in continuum robots and biological vines the PIs are collaboratively designing modeling creating and demonstrating a series of innovative vine-like continuum robots Coordinated basic research in the laboratory at Clemson and the greenhouse at Cornell is providing inspiration from biology for the vine-like robots and returning insight from engineering to biology regarding open questions on mechanisms governing biological vines The key innovations in robot hardware representing a significant new direction in continuum robotics are enabling unprecedented workspace reach via augmentation with passive and active appendages (artificial thorns/tendrils) and creating the ability to "branch" into new continuum "growth" The novel navigation and manipulation capabilities enabled by these hardware innovations are providing both new theoretical insight and innovative operational modes for robots The overall results are pushing the range of access of robots to a new level currently beyond the reach of the field

Non-technical: This CAREER award made by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Clemson University will study the development of artificial implant materials with modified surfaces These coatings are expected to resist deterioration and failure of implant materials by actively decreasing the circulating oxygen-induced material damage The human immune system reacts to an artificial implant such as a replacement hip or knee joint by attacking it and degrading it chemically Eventually this implant could fail and then need to be repaired or replaced and involves surgeries that could be too risky for many elderly and infirm patients The immune system could still attack an artificial implant even under rigorously sterile conditions and even with "inert" materials such as stainless steel The studies carried out with this NSF CAREER award would lead to development of artificial implants with novel coatings that resist failure by actively preventing their chemical degradation The proposed research would benefit society significantly by:  extending the functional lifetimes of artificial implants;  reducing morbidity and mortality risks particularly among elderly and infirm patients; and (3) decreasing pain and inflammation that occur after implantation This investigator plans to integrate the research activities of college students into this research Additionally K-12 teachers will be offered a summer course designed to help them incorporate biomaterial topics into their K-12 science classes This award will address the current shortfall in science technology engineering and mathematics degrees by fostering interest in and successful completion of these degrees by underserved and underrepresented students This award is co-funded by the Physiology Mechanisms & Biomechanics program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and Emerging Frontiers program both in the Directorate for Biological Sciences Technical: Human implantation of an artificial material into a human triggers the foreign body reaction (FBR) which leads to adhering of macrophages to the artificial implant materials (AIM) and damaging them via the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) Eventually ROS-induced AIM damage could cause the implant to fail necessitating additional surgical procedures that could result in high morbidity and mortality risks These hazards are currently unavoidable as the FBR occurs under even rigorously sterile conditions and the accompanying ROS damages in chemically-inert implant materials such as stainless steel and fluoropolymer plastics This CAREER award would enable the development of biocompatible AIMs that resist deterioration and failure of implants by actively decreasing ROS-induced material damage The first aim of the project is to covalently link self-regenerating catalyst coatings based on N-heterocyclic carbine-ruthenium complexes to artificial implant materials such as polymers [poly(methyl methacrylate) polyethylene polypropylene etc] and inorganic materials (hydroxyapatite titanium titania stainless steel etc) In addition to the preparation of large number of substrates with catalyst coatings linker systems and surface loadings these modified implant materials will be tested against different cell cultures/media to establish the ability of these immobilized catalysts to reduce reactive oxygen before and after exposure to cells for up to two weeks The second aim of this award is: a) to study damage to implant materials under simulated FBR conditions in vitro; and b) to visualize and quantify the production of ROS and inflammatory cytokines of macrophages reacting to catalytically active substrates Additionally this CAREER award would also contribute in reducing the STEM degree shortfall facing the US particularly among underserved and underrepresented minority students by integrating technical college students into biomaterials research and teaching biomaterial concepts and topics to K-12 science teachers

On-line Process Analytical Technology (PAT) is needed in enabling biopharmaceutical companies to significantly improve drug quality and productivity Current in-situ monitoring in production plants and laboratories is still mainly based on measuring temperature pH dissolved oxygen pressure airflow and liquid flow These parameters do not give information on cell viability cycle size autophagy and apoptosis that are metrics to indicate reproducibility of the bioprocess FDA suggested key PAT technologies such as near-infrared mid-infrared Raman spectroscopy fluorescence and imaging and mass spectroscopy are all under active development but with limitations of one kind or another such as limited sensitivity difficult to use and high cost Dielectric spectroscopy is also studied as a promising approach but not yet appropriate for PAT due to limited sensitivity and information contentsThis project involves a novel radio frequency (RF) interferometer technique for On-line Process Analytical Technology (PAT) instrument development The obtained radio frequency (RF) probes exploit novel interference processes to enhance sensitivity while applying novel tuning mechanisms to cover broad frequency ranges and tune sensitivity for robust system operations The RF probes are expected to have unprecedented sensitivity and robustness to analyze cell viability autophagy apoptosis and size in a label-free and non-invasive manner Many of these cell properties are not available in other PAT methods The electronic approach is expected to enable mass produced low-cost and easy-to-use PAT instruments

Modern processing of signals is almost always performed on the digital (discretized) version of the original signals which is obtained by sampling the signals on a discrete set One of the fundamental issues when converting an analog (continuous) signal to a digital (discrete) one is the following question: Can the original signals be recovered from the samples and if so how accurately The answer of course depends heavily on the nature of the signals that are being processed For example signals that are more complex (oscillatory) in nature require more samples for accurate reconstruction The precise mathematical relationship between the rate of oscillation and the required rate of sampling is surprisingly delicate especially when the samples are non-uniform This project is centered on the problem of understanding precisely this relationship including several other mathematical questions that arise naturally from it Analytic function spaces have always played an important role in the mathematical theory of signal processing One natural class of such spaces that is particularly useful when studying non-uniform sampling is the class of de Branges spaces Introduced in the sixties the theory of de Branges spaces encompassed a great deal of mathematical analysis knowledge at that time and it continues to play an important role in modern mathematics providing a setting for the interplay of various areas of mathematics including Fourier analysis spectral theory operator theory random matrix theory analytic number theory and mathematical physics The main research objective of this project is to conduct a deeper analysis of de Branges function spaces and use the resulting findings to attack and resolve several long-standing open problems Many of these problems are much more general in nature and go far beyond the setting of de Branges spaces The reason that de Branges spaces serve as a model rests on the fact that this class of spaces already exhibits most of the key difficulties confronting signal processors Another important goal of this project is to develop a theory that will unify the theory of classical function spaces and use this unification as a guideline for developing new methods for resolving the remaining open questions about these spaces

Data overload especially in the visual channel and associated breakdowns in monitoring already represent a major challenge in data-rich environments One promising means of overcoming data overload is through the introduction of multimodal displays which distribute information across various sensory channels (including vision audition and touch) In recent years touch has received more attention as a means to offload the overburdened visual and auditory channels but much remains to be discovered in this modality Tactons or tactile icons/displays are structured abstract messages that can be used to communicate information in the absence of vision However the effectiveness of tactons may be compromised if their design does not take into account that complex systems depend on the coordinated activities of a team The PI's goal in this project is to establish a research program that will explore adaptive collaborative tactons as a means to support situational awareness that is the ability of a team to perceive and comprehend information from the environment and predict future events in real time Project outcomes will contribute to a deeper understanding of perception and attention between and across sensory channels for individuals and teams and to how multimodal interfaces can support teamwork in data-rich domainsThe work will integrate three disparate topics within human factors: multimodal interfaces situational awareness and adaptive systems The PI will create methods to design tactons that take into account both context and the types of information needed by a team by leveraging the multimodal aspects to develop quantitative and qualitative models and algorithms using physiological measures (in particular eye tracking data) These in turn will inform the functionality of adaptive tactons that support collaboration by adjusting the presentation of information in response to various sensed parameters and conditions

Coastal landscapes experience a variety of environmental stresses caused by changes in land&#8232;use climate storm frequency and intensity and saltwater intrusion Research at the Clemson University &#8232;Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science (BICEFS) focuses on understanding how three major components of the landscape - water vegetation and wildlife - are affected by and respond to man-made and natural disturbances Research at BICEFS spans from the heart of cities to the wildest places in the landscape in an effort to understand how these components&#8232;are interconnected In the last three years BICEFS has doubled the size of its faculty from five to ten adding new research lines in wildlife biology landscape ecology and ecosystem service economics This project responds to that growth by adding a 1110-square-foot screened lab to an existing lab building to provide new flexible workspace to support new research initiatives field lab activities and training The institute's location in coastal South Carolina enables outside activities year-round and therefore the design provides energy efficiency and simplicity for cleaning maintenance and project specific set up Like many field stations BICEFS operates its labs and major equipment on a shared basis Lab space is designated to various activities or analyses that support major research lines rather than to individual investigators As the faculty has expanded in the last two years common space has been repurposed for more specialized uses and upgraded or new instrumentation has been added as part of start-up or state-funded initiatives As a result the lab is limited by available workspace for staging experiments sample processing instrument maintenance etc Various space studies have provided recommendations for lab space on a per scientist basis that is sufficient to support a vibrant research program and the development of graduate&#8232;and undergraduate research To bring capacity up to these recommendations a 1110-ft2 screened workspace will be constructed on the side and end of the existing laboratory building The construction is a simple design with a concrete slab screened walls and a metal roof Basic electrical and plumbing hookups are included as well as shelving cabinets and portable furniture A walk-in cooler will be installed at one end of the space to store plant soil and animal samples The flexible all-season design facilitates research by faculty and students and in part that of collaborators from 39 other institutions that use the property The design also facilitates lab-type classroom activities and workshops The Institute's web site is wwwclemsonedu/baruch

Seasonally flooded freshwater cypress-tupelo wetlands are commonly found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States from Texas to North Carolina These wetlands are the main terrestrial source of natural organic matter (NOM) that causes the yellowish tea-colored water in coastal blackwater rivers such as Waccamaw River in South Carolina (SC) Importantly the concentration of NOM is highly correlated with concentrations of total mercury and methylated mercury mediating the bioavailability and transport of mercury in coastal ecosystems On October 1-5 2015 the interaction between a stalled extratropical cyclone (nor'easter) and hurricane Joaquin caused torrential rain and extensive flooding in a short period of time in the coast of SC resulting in a large volume of NOM exported from the forested wetlands into the coastal blackwater rivers Such large quantity of NOM exports on an unprecedented scale could potentially mobilize relatively stable and recalcitrant pools of mercury and carbon from the forested wetlands into the blackwater rivers This highly interdisciplinary research will dramatically improve understanding of mercury and carbon biogeochemistry under extreme weather conditions and demonstrate the relationships within the context of ecosystems This study represents a new and unique collaboration between four investigators with different specialties from three universities including two assistant professors respectively in a minority serving institution and an undergraduate institution This study will also raise the awareness of the impacts of extreme weather events on low-lying coastal areas in the Southeastern United States Coastal wetlands are considered as important carbon and mercury sinks However extreme weather events under the changing climate could alter the equilibrium status affecting the stability of carbon and mercury pools in the coastal ecosystems The goal of this RAPID research is to study the influences of the extreme flooding on carbon and mercury cycles and associated biogeochemical processes in coastal wetlands and blackwater rivers Specifically the study will integrate field investigations controlled field experiments and hydrological computer modeling to examine carbon and mercury exports sources and temporal trends along the hydrograph of the extreme flooding event The research team has been collecting water samples along the Waccamaw River since Oct 4 2015 representing the rising limb of the hydrograph Samples were analyzed for general water quality dissolved organic carbon ultraviolet absorbance nutrients cations anions total mercury and methylated mercury in the filtered and unfiltered samples To determine the carbon and mercury budget a hydrological model will be used to estimate the total water discharge from this flooding event that went into Waccamaw River The PIs will engage in a transformative research study to assess novel decomposition process routes of terrestrial organic matter in forested wetlands under the influence of extreme flooding event The PIs contend that the novel method of using stable mercury isotope along the hydrograph of the flooding event coupled with measurements of dissolved organic matter in water using ultraviolet/visible and fluorescence spectroscopy will be useful for understanding the relationships between carbon and mercury in coastal blackwater rivers Determining the temporal variation of carbon and mercury will be useful for developing a mechanistic and landscape-level understanding of how extreme flooding events affect the biogeochemical process of terrestrial organic matter in coastal ecosystems

The worldwide demand for freshwater is increasing rapidly while water resources are becoming increasingly scarce Exacerbating this imbalance is the deteriorated state of the water distribution infrastructure which is afflicted with leakages of 15-25% of the total water supply Consequently the severe deterioration of this infrastructure poses a serious challenge to water sustainability Leakage detection is an essential but challenging aspect of water supply management Real-time monitoring schemes based on the changes in the vibration characteristics of the water pipelines have potential to detect leaks in a timely manner Embedded wireless sensor networks are essential for such monitoring schemes; however model designs and architectures of currently available wireless sensing networks remain severely constrained by the small energy reserves of environmentally-harmful batteries that last only for a limited period of time This CyberSEES project is exploring possible hardware and software schemes for embedded wireless sensing systems powered by locally harvested energy to detect leakages in water distribution systemsLeveraging a real-size experimental pipeline set-up this project explores  the energy harvesting potential in the water distribution system environment for use in sustainable powering of smart embedded sensing networks;  the use of vibration sensing-based methods to detect and locate pipeline leaks in water distribution systems; and (3) energy-efficient sensing and communication schemes suitable for use in constrained and variable energy environments With advancements on several fronts the research outcomes will make it possible to build smarter and adaptable water supply infrastructures for a more sustainable futureBy adopting the developed sustainable monitoring set-up water utilities will be equipped to prevent leakage of treated fresh water conserve energy and potentially prevent catastrophic failures in water distribution systems through early-detection of defects The developed wireless sensing-based monitoring scheme can be easily adapted to other harsh dynamic and energy-constrained environments for defect detection The impact of this project on research infrastructure especially the expansion of the pipeline test bed on the Clemson University campus is significant as it offers several follow-up research and educational opportunities This project also offers research opportunities for undergraduates and underrepresented students in addition to graduate student mentoring

Abstract (Getman 1554385)The proposed research will refine molecular simulation models for catalytic reactions in the presence of liquid water and apply the calculations to an electrochemical process for ammonia synthesis that could potentially replace the long-standing but energy intensive Haber-Bosch gas phase process The research is integrated with an educational plan that introduces molecular level simulation concepts to students across levels ranging from high school to graduate researchTheoretical understanding of catalytic materials and processes has advanced significantly in recent years due to rapid improvements in computer resources This theoretical understanding is streamlining the process of catalyst discovery and moving the field of catalysis toward the prediction of new processes and materials and away from the traditional trial-and-error approach However this transition has been slow in the area of liquid phase catalysis especially electrocatalysis in large part because of incomplete understanding of the interactions that occur between fluid molecules and the catalyst surface The research proposed here will take a large step toward better understanding these interactions by considering their free energies whereas prior treatments have only considered their enthalpies Traditional modeling equations will be refined and extended by adding for the first time free energy contributions due to rotation translation and interaction occurring between liquid-phase molecules and species adsorbed to the catalyst surface The refined models will then be directed toward understanding the reaction between liquid water and gaseous nitrogen in an electrocatalytic environment to produce ammonia under near-ambient temperature and pressure conditions The improved simulation models will pave the way for a more rational approach to catalyst discovery across a broad range of liquid phase catalytic reactions and the educational materials will train coming generations of students in molecular-level phenomena and the effective use of molecular simulation tools

1511051AmyCurrently seawater reverse osmosis is the most commonly used desalination technology Specifically the blending of reverse osmosis desalinated water with single or multiple treated fresh waters drawn from other sources is a low-cost method to meet the demands of drinking water and to increase the concentration of some desired ions Therefore the objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive and systematic study to examine the formation and speciation of reaction byproducts of disinfection and the toxicity changes of seawater reverse osmosis desalinated waters as a consequence of blendingThis is the first comprehensive research that combines a disinfection byproduct study on the formation speciation and factors affecting bromide/iodide incorporation with a toxicology study to determine possible toxicities on mammalian cells In this study the PIs propose to investigate: 1) the formation and speciation of brominated/iodinated disinfection byproducts in the presence of hydrophilic organic matter (eg algal organic matter wastewater effluent organic matter natural organic matter) of different origins in treated waters that are likely to be used for blending with seawater reverse osmosis permeate 2) the effects of pH and temperature on the formation and speciation of brominated/iodinated disinfection byproducts 3) the change in mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of waters from blending and 4) the ability of total organic halide species and/or other individual brominated/iodinated disinfection byproducts to predict the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the blended waters based on a multiple regression The project will be conducted in two phases: Phase 1 which entails a disinfection byproduct study on the formation speciation and factors affecting bromide/iodide incorporation under various mixing scenarios and using chlorine and chloramine for post-disinfection (i and ii); and Phase 2 which entails a toxicity study on mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of waters from blending and multiple regression analysis between total organic halide components and experimentally measured water toxicities (iii and iv) Educational components of the project will provide opportunities for undergraduate (eg Creative Inquiry Program at Clemson UIUC WaterCamps program the UIUC Global Safe Water Institute) and high school student research including recruitment of underrepresented groups in scientific research

A strong workforce in the geosciences is needed today more than ever if America is to overcome resource security challenges for water food and energy in the face of global change and widespread land use transitions Despite this critical need there is a deficit of students opting to pursue geoscience-related career paths The overarching goal of this project is to increase the number of students at Clemson University intending to pursue a geoscience-related career by providing opportunities for both Geology majors and non-majors to engage in career-relevant geoscience research The approach that is being taken focuses on accessing the affective domain of learning as a mechanism to increase student engagement with the geosciences via student motivation emotion and connections to Earth Targeting non-geoscience majors in this project is an important goal as they represent a large population of students that are often exposed to the geosciences through service (eg general education) courses but rarely have an opportunity to participate in field or research activities both of which are well known to be important doorways to careers in geoscience This project enables thousands of students to be exposed to geoscience research and STEM communication thereby making a significant impact on the development of the geoscience workforce in South Carolina A new Industrial Affiliates program further engages students with existing geoscience professionals to promote student selection of careers in geoscience-related areas This project addresses the deficit in the geoscience workforce by creating a three tier extracurricular approach to gradually transform non-majors into geoscientists by leveraging the existing undergraduate research component of Clemson's Geology Bachelor's (BS) degree The first tier of engages non-major students enrolled in geoscience service courses in extracurricular inquiry-based thinking that draws on the research activities of Clemson's undergraduate geoscience majors Building on this effort students recruited to the second tier of engagement take part in non-major oriented project-based learning activities that utilize a "citizen science" approach to data collection geoscience problem solving with GIS or geoscience communication and outreach Students transitioned into the third tier of the program take part in formal undergraduate geoscience research projects Investing in Clemson's current research program not only strengthens research experiences for current Geology majors but also provides more diverse engaging and interesting projects to attract non-majors For example the project enables cutting-edge science questions to be addressed in areas ranging across the fields of climate change water sustainability geomechanics and geochemistry The newly-developed Industrial Affiliates program further strengthens the outcomes of both this project and the undergraduate BS degree program through: professional lectures co-mentoring of student projects and internships and evaluation of student preparation for careers in the geosciences Building on the existing BS degree program also allows the project to leverage Clemson's geoscience majors as ambassadors to non-majors and geoscience professionals thereby strengthening the overall geoscience community in South Carolina The activities in this project build on best-practices developed in the geoscience education literature and contribute to this body of research by studying how the affective domain of learning contributes to student motivation in pursuing a career in the geosciences

NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:The design of new materials is one critical aspect of engineering new platforms that will augment the energy security of the nation impact health and enhance economic competitiveness Driving innovation in technologies such as clean energy generation and storage and numerous biomedical technologies requires new materials that can serve in different capacities simultaneously One promising class of materials consists of very large molecules (polymers) able to transport ions and electrons while retaining their mechanical integrity often under extreme conditions of high temperatures solvents and external stresses that may affect their performance The ability of these materials to play multiple roles is attained by tailoring molecular segments with different chemical functionalities into one large molecule including blocks for transporting ions and electrons and blocks to provide mechanical stability Controlling the way these segments organize and perform electrically as they are integrated into devices is key to the design of new effective platforms In this project using large-scale computational studies coupled with state-of-the-art neutron measurements the effects of the structure of these polymers will be correlated with their dynamics as they are exposed to high temperatures and solvents The projected results will provide the understanding that will enhance the ability to design well-controlled multi-functional polymers tailored with desired properties for specific applications The project is closely integrated with interdisciplinary education and training of graduate and undergraduate students and high-school outreachTECHNICAL SUMMARY:Polymers that consist of ionizable blocks (ionomers or polyelectrolytes) tethered to additional segments with well defined functionalities constitute promising media for a large number of applications from clean energy and storage to sensors and drug delivery vehicles The role of the ionic groups is two-fold: they form physical crosslinks while facilitating transport of ions and polar guest molecules As these two functions often require dynamics of opposing nature the additional blocks affect the overall stability of such polymers Here using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations coupled with neutron scattering techniques the correlation of polymer dynamics with ionic associations and their cohesiveness will be investigated on a series of model copolymers that consist of styrene sulfonate as the ionic block tethered to different non-ionic segments Numerous studies have probed the structure of ion-containing polymers and polyelectrolytes revealing a rich variety of morphologies and establishing a clear correlation between structure and transport One key challenge that arises from these studies is the need to unfold the correlation between ionic associations and their impact on the mobility of the polymers The relationship of the dynamics with the number topology and stability of the ionic associations impacts the polymer properties and in turn affects a large number of technologies This research is set to resolve the effects of constraints formed by ionic associations on polymer dynamics Advances in computational techniques coupled with new developments in neutron scattering will enable a new insight into the dynamics of polymers under the confinement of physical crosslinks

1551534CatesMembrane processes are now being used for many environmental applications such as drinking water and wastewater treatment They are also used in indirect potable reuse and desalination plants One of the single biggest issues is membrane fouling which increases the operational and maintenance cost This project uses ultraviolet radioluminescence a potentially transformative tool for membrane biofouling prevention with many theoretical advantages over chemical antimicrobial strategies currently being researched The concept conceived by the PI involves incorporation of inorganic phosphor materials within reverse osmosis or nanofiltration membrane module feed channels which emit germicidal ultraviolet radiation when excited by X-rays The penetrating ability of high-energy X-rays could thus allow controllable ultraviolet treatment within the typically inaccessible confines of spiral-wound modules by employing externally-situated X-ray sources to excite the phosphors within This approach is attractive in theory but its predicted feasibility currently relies on cursory simulations involving simplified scenarios and approximate values of X-ray attenuation phosphor efficiency and microbial UVC dose response from the literature In order to predict if RL membrane biofouling control (RMBC) can become a viable technology in the future the PI proposes to conduct exploratory research involving simplified proof-of-concept experiments to probe internal microbial inactivation rates This data will then be assessed with regards to conventional X-ray sources and emerging high-efficiency flat panel sources Before full-scale research efforts are expended it should also be demonstrated that the expected X-ray and UVC doses required to adequately curtail fouling are not high enough to significantly impact the working lifetimes of membranes The PIs propose 10 months of experiments to explore these factors and reveal the feasibility of RMBC without requiring intensive prototype development The approach being proposed is;  the first known method of achieving UV inactivation of bacteria within small spaces confined by UV-opaque materials and  the first use of UV radiation in directly deterring biofouling within modules While the individual phenomena of X-ray transmission RL and UVC microbial inactivation are qualitatively well-understood - though in disparate contexts - this project will be the first to demonstrate how they perform in succession and to quantify the outcome The research will thus support the PI's goals of instilling greater interaction between students in these two fields in order to encourage advancement of transformative sustainable technologies The PIs have also developed a plan to include undergraduate summer interns of underrepresented minorities in future embodiments of this research
