    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the research program of Professor Vladimir Braginsky and his group at the Moscow State University (MSU) in Moscow, Russia. Braginsky and his group are members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and they propose to continue research on topics of great interest to the LIGO project to which the group has made outstanding contributions over the years. They will perform both experimental and theoretical research in two main areas of great interest to the LIGO project. The experimental portion of their research will focus on: 1) identifying and measuring the excess noise (noise of non-thermal origin) due to mirror coatings, electric charging of the mirrors, and interaction of mirrors and the surrounding structures; 2) in-depth searches for new unknown sources of noise of nonlinear origin; and 3) methods for modeling and controlling dynamic instabilities that can appear in the interferometers due to coupling of their high-Q mechanical and optical degrees of freedom caused by the high optical power in the interferometer arms. They will also continue theoretical and experimental investigations of novel optical topologies as well as new methods of quantum measurements that might be applied in the future to Advanced LIGO to allow operation at sensitivities below the Standard Quantum Limit. While most of the research will be carried out at MSU, Braginsky and his colleagues will be in frequent close contact with LIGO Laboratory and LSC members through visits and regular reports.&amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;Progress in the supported research program will contribute to the success of Advanced LIGO in opening the new gravitational wave window on the universe. The members of the MSU group are committed to combining first-rate education with their research. The faculty members in the group will continue to incorporate LIGO concepts and research results into their technical lectures for students and for colleagues working in other fields of science; they will continue to involve undergraduate and graduate students in their theoretical and experimental research; and they will continue to give public lectures about LIGO and the LSC's research, including lectures aimed at high school students.</AbstractNarration>
