    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to develop new colloidal diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum dots and quantum dot heterostructures for fundamental research and potential application in spin-based electronics or photonics technologies. Synthetic, analytical, and spectroscopic techniques will be integrated to optimize new physical phenomena and develop fundamental structure/function relationships for this emerging class of materials. Specific research objectives include:&lt;br/&gt;(i) development and investigation of new synthetic routes for preparing high-quality doped inorganic chalcogenide nanostructures&lt;br/&gt;(ii) detailed investigation of syntheses by application of dopant-specific spectroscopic probes in combination with mass spectrometry and other analytical techniques&lt;br/&gt;(iii) description of doped quantum dot electronic structures by application of an array of advanced spectroscopic and magneto-spectroscopic techniques&lt;br/&gt;(iv) development and demonstration of new structural motifs for spin manipulation in semiconductor nanocrystals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This research will combine innovations in chemical preparative methodologies with sophisticated optical and magneto-optical measurements in order to understand and harness the physical properties of new magnetic semiconductor nanostructures relevant to spin-based information processing technologies. In addition to yielding new fundamental scientific insights and new materials, this research will also provide undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities for advanced interdisciplinary education and training in technologically important areas in order to prepare them for future careers in science and engineering. Students will participate in UW's interdisciplinary Nanotechnology PhD program, will gain valuable exposure to our national laboratories through user facilities, and will gain valuable experience with international collaborations involving scientists and engineers interested in applications of these materials in locations as diverse as Brazil, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, the Republic of Korea, and Switzerland. Emphasis will be placed on integration of research and education at the undergraduate level through aggressive involvement of undergraduates in the research, incorporation of experiments and concepts from the research into the UW undergraduate laboratory curriculum, and collaboration with faculty and students from undergraduate institutions across the country.</AbstractNarration>
