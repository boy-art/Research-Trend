    <AbstractNarration>Scientific communities continually struggle to overcoming the challenges arising from interdisciplinary interaction. At this time, interdisciplinarity is at an important juncture: scientists and funding agencies are recognizing and promoting more interdisciplinary collaboration; technologies are enabling far greater and dispersed interdisciplinary interactions; and many are convinced that interdisciplinarity is a key to scientific breakthroughs in a number of arenas. This workshop will provide a forum for discussion of interdisciplinary research in the context of team science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning from what is known from research on teams of all sorts, the workshop will lay the foundation for exploring the team-based processes required for innovative solutions to highly complex scientific problems that cross disciplinary boundaries. The outcomes will include an assessment of the current state of the art for team science and assessments about what are the most promising and important directions for social scientists to pursue in order to advance the state of the art. Further, the products of the workshop will be useful to those who currently seek to mine social science knowledge in order to practice evidence-based management of team science.</AbstractNarration>
