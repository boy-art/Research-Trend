    <AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to improve the retention of graduate students in the first two years and increase the number of students going to graduate school. We do this by incorporating students in research and the mathematical community earlier and providing support programs for pre-graduate students. The main component is a set of interconnected summer programs involving research experiences and short courses for students. These are designed to engage them and encourage them to continue in mathematics. Several parts of this proposal are directly aimed at underrepresented students. The major programs include the following. (1) Research for Early Graduate Students (REG), designed to sustain the enthusiasm for collaborative original research that attracts students to Ph.D. programs by providing them with research experiences during the early years of graduate work. (2) Research and enrichment experiences for under-represented undergraduate students (REU+), designed to provide a supportive REU experience for underrepresented students who may not usually consider an REU program. An important feature is the inclusion of established mentors of underrepresented students to work with the program and us. (3) Enhanced Research Program for Early Graduates (REG+), a one-year program for students who have graduated from college and are not quite prepared for graduate studies in mathematics. This program targets underrepresented groups. The program includes a summer research experience, a year of remedial course work and significant mentoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four important groups are included: underrepresented undergraduate students, post-baccalaureate students considering returning to mathematics, under-prepared graduate students, and early graduate students. In particular, this grant features a collaborative effort between faculty at NCSU, and the Mathematics Departments of 6 Historically Black Colleges and Universities. We aim to increase the number of underrepresented students who get graduate degrees in Mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
