    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT HRD 0292148&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) has the primary objective to design and conduct a mixed method study (Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998), including both a quantitative and qualitative component, on STEM students? precollege and college factors, institutional characteristics, intellectual orientations, and vocational competence and commitment. National data indicates that the number of underrepresented women and men receiving STEM degrees has increased over the years (National Science Foundation, 2008; Nelson, 2007). However, there is a general agreement among stakeholders (Byars-Winston, Estrada, and Howard, 2008) that we need to recruit, retain, and graduate more racial and ethnic minority students in order to enhance America?s competiveness in the global economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other objectives of this HBCU-UP research project are to examine the similarities and differences between female and male STEM students in terms of their level of academic confidence and motivation, academic and social integration in the university environment, student involvement on and off campus, academic self-concepts, educational aspirations, and vocational competence. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to render quantitative and qualitative data to better understand the impacts of individual characteristics and institutional environments on the academic motivations and persistence strategies of female and male students majoring in STEM. Further, this study will determine if the academic environment at HBCUs influences students? vocational interest and commitment to STEM careers. Further, the findings should assist college professionals and policymakers in improving academic performance and graduation rates for STEM students at HBCUs.</AbstractNarration>
