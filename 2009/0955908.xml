    <AbstractNarration>Technical: The research objective of this CAREER award is to synthesize and investigate a new class of novel, rare-earth-activated, one-dimensional luminescent nanomaterials and to tune their optical properties through controlled synthesis. While previous research on one-dimensional nanostructures has focused mainly on elemental and binary materials systems, recent studies have demonstrated incorporation of additional components such as rare-earth ions into one-dimensional nanostructures, forming luminescent nanobelts that exhibit new compositions, new crystal structures, and new luminescence properties and mechanisms. To maximize the potential of using these new luminescent nanobelts as building blocks in nanophotonics, fundamental understanding of the interrelationships between synthesis conditions, materials properties, and optical properties is essential. This project 1) systematically investigates the luminescent nanobelts growth behaviors by studying the growth parameters, 2) performs morphological, compositional, and structural characterizations of the nanomaterials using a wide range of advanced analytical tools including electron microscopes and synchrotron x-ray microanalysis techniques, and 3) studies the optical properties of the luminescent nanomaterials using a broad excitation sources (including UV light, x-ray beam and electron beam) and explores their applications in nanophotonics.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The success of the project is expected to have impacts on the further advancement of nanophotonics and, in general, nanoscience and nanotechnology. The research and education activities of the project are integrated. The education activities include 1) incorporation of research themes into lecture and laboratory classes to engage students as active participants in the scientific process, 2) training and enrichment of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the proposed research by development of experimental and analytical skills, presentations at conferences and seminars, and authorship of research articles, 3) increase of minority undergraduate and K-12 students participation in science and engineering through the programs on campus, and 4) increase of general public awareness on nanotechnology by holding NanoArt shows on campus, local schools, and galleries.</AbstractNarration>
