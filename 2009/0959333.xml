    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;Funding from the NSF MRI-R2 program has been awarded to the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) to support the purchase of two Campbell Scientific TGA200 in situ trace gas analyzer systems for deployment at field sites and an Agilent Technologies G3242A/G3440A Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer system for analysis of trace organic compounds such as plant waxes and microbe cellular debris in atmospheric aerosols. These instruments provide new information about ecosystem metabolism and new understanding of the biogeochemical and ecological processes that result in net fluxes between ecosystems and the atmosphere. The instruments enable Ecosystems Center scientists to open new ground in the area of whole-ecosystem processes. Typically, fluxes are inferred from small-scale measurements often requiring enclosure and incubation of ecosystem components (e.g., soil, water) that may perturb organisms and the processes they catalyze, resulting in inaccurate estimates. The atmosphere, by virtue of relatively rapid mixing, acts as an integrator, so measuring concentrations of substances over time and above or downwind of ecosystems, enables estimation of fluxes. The new instruments are used to support the Center's research programs at three NSF Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites at Plum Island MA, Harvard Forest, MA and Toolik Lake, AK; at NSF and NASA-supported project sites in Brazil and new research sites in Africa. The TGA and GCMS systems directly impact educational activities in the Ecosystems Center. First, our Semester in Environmental Science (SES) Program draws undergraduates from small colleges around the country and world for an intensive "semester abroad" program in Woods Hole. SES students learn about terrestrial and marine environmental sciences, take field trips, do lab exercises and finally carry out an independent research project. Faculty at the MBL also participate in several NSF-REU programs, some associated with LTER and other field sites. These students employ the new instrumentation in their research projects. Ecosystems Center scientists also mentor PhD students in the Brown-MBL Joint PhD Program. Center scientists also sponsor and direct research by several postdoctoral fellows. Finally, the new, ecosystem-level flux estimates are directly relevant to new climate change policy formation. Data from these studies will be disseminated through regional and national presentations by students and faculty, and through peer-reviewed scientific journals.</AbstractNarration>
