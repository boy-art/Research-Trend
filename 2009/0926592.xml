    <AbstractNarration>Everyday, thousands of unauthorized migrants are repatriated to Mexican cities along the U.S.-Mexico border. While suspended in this interstitial space, unauthorized migrants must make a decision: cross again unlawfully, turn back, or choose some third alternative like stay in the city where they have been repatriated. This research seeks to better understand the decision-making process behind further migration intentions. At issue are the factors that lead some repatriated migrants to state that they will attempt another crossing to the U.S., some to state that they will return to Mexico, and still others to state they do not know. The role of gender and family considerations will be examined. For one year, the CO-PI will conduct 60 to 80 in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews with repatriated migrants at a migrant shelter in Nogales, Sonora as well as engage in direct and participant observation at the shelter. Secondary data will also be used to situate the qualitative findings within the larger context. This research will help inform the sociological discipline, as there is very little research on repatriation and there is no research to date that assesses how gender and family processes affect repatriated migrants? intentions regarding further migration. The research will also offer an empirical foundation for future research and will have broader impacts for immigration policy, humanitarian aid to migrants, the Southwestern community, and the people of Nogales, Sonora.</AbstractNarration>
