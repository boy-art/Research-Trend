    <AbstractNarration>Berest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research lies at the intersection of several areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and mathematical physics, including geometric analysis,&lt;br/&gt;representation theory, noncommutative algebra and algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;It is motivated by old (yet unsolved) problems in the theory of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. One such problem (known as the problem of lacunas)&lt;br/&gt;deals with propagation of waves without diffusion, another with heat&lt;br/&gt;kernels on Riemannian manifolds with finite asymptotics. Despite being&lt;br/&gt;analytic by their nature, these problems exhibit a remarkable feature:&lt;br/&gt;they have algebraic solutions. The earlier work of the PI and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators links these classical problems of analysis to various&lt;br/&gt;questions of algebraic geometry and noncommutative algebra, concerning&lt;br/&gt;rings of differential operators on algebraic varieties and their specific&lt;br/&gt;representations (projective D-modules). One of the primary goals of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal is to systematically study the properties of such modules, their&lt;br/&gt;endomorphism rings and moduli spaces. The results obtained so far (mostly&lt;br/&gt;in the case of curves) reveal many interesting connections with &lt;br/&gt;noncommutative geometry, representation theory, combinatorics and &lt;br/&gt;integrable systems. Another goal of the proposal is thus to investigate &lt;br/&gt;some of these connections. In a different direction, the PI intends to &lt;br/&gt;develop a new method for computing asymptotics of heat kernels based on&lt;br/&gt;ideas of homotopical algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical problems addressed in this project arise from the practical&lt;br/&gt;question: what happens when a short signal (light or sound, say) is omitted&lt;br/&gt;from a point A, travels through a medium and arrives at point B? There are&lt;br/&gt;many possibilities: there could be focusing, diffraction, persistence of faint&lt;br/&gt;echoes, or still a short `clean-cut' signal at B. This last possibility is of&lt;br/&gt;particular interest, but it may occur only under very special conditions.&lt;br/&gt;To describe these conditions in precise mathematical terms is one of the goals&lt;br/&gt;of the proposal. The results sought in this direction are fundamental for our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of wave phenomena and may have applications in related physical&lt;br/&gt;sciences, including the theory of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, space &lt;br/&gt;communication technologies, magneto-hydrodynamics, crystal optics, etc. As &lt;br/&gt;a broader impact, the PI expects that the interdisciplinary nature of this &lt;br/&gt;work will stimulate communication and collaboration between experts in the &lt;br/&gt;various areas involved.</AbstractNarration>
