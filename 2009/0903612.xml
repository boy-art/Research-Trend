    <AbstractNarration>College of Menominee Nation &lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College of Menominee (CMN) is a current NSF TCUP recipient that recently completed year five of its Curriculum Enhancement Project. That project has allowed CMN to aggressively advance its STEM curriculum and program offerings as well as increase the capacity of the college to act as a positive catalyst for STEM educational changes within the communities it serves. One current strategic initiative resulting from the STEM intensive planning and development of the College of Menominee Nation is the development of a STEM-intensive, standards-based Elementary Education baccalaureate degree program that will strengthen STEM learning by bringing STEM education full circle from the start of a child?s education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; CMN will build its capacity in the implementation phase by achieving the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? Objective one Build CMN?s capacity and infrastructure to sustain a math, science and technology infused Elementary Education Baccalaureate degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? Objective two: Implement an Elementary Education program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? Objective three: Infuse the use of technology into all facets of the Elementary Education Baccalaureate degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? Objective four: Establish critical student support services to ensure student success in the elementary education program.</AbstractNarration>
