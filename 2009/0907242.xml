    <AbstractNarration>This award supports theoretical research and education on inhomogeneous materials that contain layered nanometer scale superconducting and magnetic regions. The PI will involve undergraduate and graduate students at a Hispanic-Serving Institution in a research project to explore the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in these inhomogeneous materials and discover new phenomena. The magnetic regions contain domain walls in which the direction of the magnetization changes along particular directions. Superconductivity is a collective quantum mechanical state of electrons with remarkable properties, often noted is the ability to conduct electricity without dissipation. Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are generally incompatible and do not coexist in the same uniform material. In these inhomogeneous materials, novel spatially varying superconducting states may arise intertwined with magnetism. The PI will study the resulting spatially varying superconducting and magnetic states and how they may be tuned by applying an external magnetic field. The presence of superconducting regions that are weakly interacting with each other may lead to interesting dynamical effects that may be useful for future superconducting device technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project may lead to new understanding of the role played by inhomogeneities for the stability of spatially varying phases at the nanoscale, to the discovery of new phenomena for future electronic and spintronics nanodevices with new functionalities, to broader participation of underrepresented minorities in the physical sciences, and to new experimental activity in the department that provides newresearch opportunities for students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be carried out in a Hispanic-Serving Institution with a predominantly female student population and one that has a high population of underrepresented minorities in Physics. Integrating students in the proposed research project will therefore promote science among groups that are typically underrepresented in the sciences. This project will also contribute to developing a computational physics Master of Science degree program.</AbstractNarration>
