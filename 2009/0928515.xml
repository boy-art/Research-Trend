    <AbstractNarration>The conference "Perspectives in Mathematics and Physics" will bring together the legends and leaders of modern mathematics and physics to discuss the latest work at the interface between mathematics and physics. The conference will also honor the 85th birthday of Professor Isadore Singer.&lt;br/&gt;Interactions between mathematics and physics have long been important for the development of both disciplines. The extremely distinguished list of speakers at this conference will present many different perspectives on the future of these synergistic developments. A few of the speakers will give historical views of Singer's contributions in this area. The conference will take place May 22-24, 2009 in Cambridge MA and rotate between MIT and Harvard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction between mathematics and physics has produced the theoretical underpinning that informs the development of the technology that touches almost every aspect of modern life. At the vanguard of this interaction is the understanding of the fundamental laws of nature, whether at the small scale via quantum field theory and string theory or at the large scale of cosmology and gravity. To honor Isadore Singer's 85th birthday and his deep contributions in developing the mathematics used in these areas, this conference will bring together leaders in both mathematics and physics. They will speak about the current edge of our knowledge and highlight the areas that are likely to lead to future progress.</AbstractNarration>
