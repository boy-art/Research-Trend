    <AbstractNarration>This research aims to turn existing wireless mesh networks (WMNs) into productive and reliable computing platforms, made possible innovatively by reliability enhancement via adaptive checkpointing (REACT) to yield wireless Grids (WiGs). WiGs can expand immensely the wired Grid in support of rapidly growing cloud applications, besides serving as their original role of ubiquitous communications. It is extremely challenging and yet interesting to realize effective checkpointing in WiGs, due to their unique characteristics. This REACT project deals with three technical challenges, which together constitute the basis of our Checkpoint Manager, able to render WMNs into productive WiGs for enhancing and complementing wired Grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project holds great promise to advance technical understanding and scientific frontiers of effective checkpointing in WiGs. It will also improve the research and educational activities on Grid computing and wireless systems strongly in the University of Louisiana, with the testbed established under this project deemed a valuable asset. New research findings and technologies for effective checkpointing and wireless communication performance enhancement will be incorporated into relevant courses, helping to integrate research and education for enriched teaching, training, and learning experience and to educate quality future scientists critical to the NSF mission. Underrepresented students will be recruited aggressively to participate in this project, taking advantage of the established REACT testbed and working collaboratively with funded graduate research assistants to stimulate their research interest.</AbstractNarration>
