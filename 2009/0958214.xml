    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the acquisition of a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer with an elemental analyzer interface at Southern Oregon University (SOU). The instrumentation provides a powerful tool for understanding the fluxes of water, carbon and nitrogen though biological systems. Stable isotope analysis has permeated most sub-disciplines in biology, chemistry, geology as well as environmental and forensic science. Faculty and students are increasingly utilizing isotopic concepts and applications in both research and teaching. The instrument serves as both a pedagogical tool and a resource for research projects than span many disciplines. With access to this instrument, local scientists explore innovative new projects and obtain preliminary data that enhances research infrastructure and prospects for competitive funding. SOU has a strong commitment to teaching excellence. All scientific instrumentation is available for use in instruction. Students learn about stable isotopes in lecture and are able to enhance their understanding of this complex topic through active-learning exercises and hands-on research experiences. Acquisition of this technology enhances the instrumentation infrastructure at SOU for both the Biology and Chemistry departments and provides students with a powerful tool that can be utilized in senior independent research projects. Some of the potential projects listed above could benefit society through an increased understanding of climate variability and change, forensic applications that enhance criminal investigations and a greater appreciation for environmental issues facing aquatic and forest ecosystems. Results from the studies enabled by the new equipment will be disseminated by student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings, and through publication in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
