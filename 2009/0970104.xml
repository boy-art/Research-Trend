    <AbstractNarration>The Quark-Gluon Plasma existed in the early Universe. It can also be created and studied in laboratories by colliding heavy nuclei. This has led to many interesting discoveries about matter under extreme conditions. The beginning of the RHIC II program and the LHC heavy ion program will lead the exploration of the Quark-Gluon Plasma into a new era of unprecedented precision and energy. This award will help to advance the current description of the Quark-Gluon Plasma dynamics on several fronts with a recently developed radiative transport model. This includes the study of higher order processes in both gluon dynamics and flavor dynamics. The research will provide a more consistent picture of the Quark-Gluon plasma evolution and lead to better understanding of thermalization, viscosity, collective flow, and energy loss. It will help build the foundations of next generation transport models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate research assistants will participate in the research activity. They will learn physics at the forefront of current research and computer skills essential for scientific explorations. This will help them get ready for science and technology related jobs or graduate studies. In addition, we plan to outreach to local high schools, to convey the excitement of scientific discovery to a younger generation.</AbstractNarration>
