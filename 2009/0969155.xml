    <AbstractNarration>Thin films of single-walled carbon nanotubes show considerable promise for applications that require flexible conductive coatings, and the deformation mechanics of nanotube-nanotube contacts is what ultimately dictates the strength and durability of such films. Electronic type can have a significant impact on the strength of these contacts through the nature of the van der Waals interactions between contacted nanotubes. In work supported by this grant, we are separating nanotubes into metallic and semiconducting fractions and assembling them as pristine membranes on flexible polymer surfaces. Strain-induced structural changes will be investigated over a broad range of length scales using a diverse set of measurement techniques. To interpret these measurements, we will use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of nanoscale deformation in two-dimensional rigid-rod networks with adjustable friction and tunable interaction potentials. These simulations allow us to model anisotropic changes in network elasticity over a wide range of experimentally relevant parameters, providing critical insight into the local structural changes that govern the mechanics of flexible nanotube films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work can be found in both the commercial sector and the classroom. The insight gained will lead to improvements in the mechanical performance and durability of nanotube films, with emerging applications in photovoltaic devices and fuel-cell membranes. Undergraduate research participation is a significant part of this research. Our group has an established record of mentoring undergraduates, including women and under-represented minorities, through challenging research projects that culminate in publications in leading scientific journals. The insight we gain will also be directly incorporated into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum in Materials and Nanotechnology at NDSU, a newly established interdisciplinary program that spans the departments of Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Coatings &amp; Polymeric Materials.</AbstractNarration>
