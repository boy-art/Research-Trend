    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to demonstrate novel intrinsically switchable filters for frequency-agile communication systems and cognitive radios. The basis of the proposed effort is the investigation of field-tunable electrostriction effect in ferroelectric thin films. The resonant behavior of the ferroelectric thin film can be switched on and off through application of a DC bias voltage, and can potentially be utilized for designing low cost, high performance and integrated intrinsically switchable radio frequency (RF) and microwave resonators and filters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frequency-agile devices provide the ability to switch communication channels through switchable and tunable frontend filters. The realization of frequency-agile components with minimal complexity is further desired for miniature low-power wireless systems integrated into a single chip. In this work, a key building block for a frequency-agile transceiver is proposed, utilizing the acoustic wave and microwave interactions in ferroelectric thin films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will serve to educate graduate students through direct participation in the research. The proposed research is of particular value for students due to the interdisciplinary nature, where students will become experts in thin film materials deposition and characterization, device fabrication, acoustic resonance, and microwave devices. In addition, the efforts of this project will include supporting outreach programs aimed at promoting diversity among scientists and engineers. These efforts include involvement of undergraduate students through the University Research Opportunity Program (UROP) at the University of Michigan, the NSF REU, Marian Sara Parker and M-STEM Programs specifically designed to provide research experiences to undergraduate and graduate female and minority students.</AbstractNarration>
