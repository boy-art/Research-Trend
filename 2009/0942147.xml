    <AbstractNarration>This NSF CCLI Phase 1 project develops innovative mathematics teaching and learning videocases based on actual classroom practices, and then are used in methods courses for preservice high school mathematics teachers. In addition, the project conducts research on the influence of the cases on preservice teachers' learning. The High School Mathematics Teaching and Learning Videocases are defined as records of practice that include video and text documents that depict actual high school mathematics classroom situations in order to promote preservice teacher learning through the analysis of issues related to mathematics, teaching practice, and student thinking. Specifically, the cases are used to create contexts that facilitate preservice secondary teachers' development of mathematics knowledge for teaching, understanding of their implicit assumptions about mathematics, and mathematics teaching and learning while at the same time broadening their knowledge of the work entailed in teaching mathematics and supporting students' mathematical thinking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current research demonstrates the potential of videocases to foster teachers' ability to attend to student thinking, explore mathematical concepts, and to develop teachers' professional vision. In addition, in the last decade there has been a proliferation of case-based materials for teacher education, primarily aimed at the elementary and middle school levels. There is a considerable lack, however, of such cases focused specifically on high school mathematics, grades 9 through 12, and that address educational goals specific to preservice teacher education. This project contributes to the growing body of case-based materials for secondary teacher education.</AbstractNarration>
