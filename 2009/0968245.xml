    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;George Vourlitis, California State University, San Marcos 0968245&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed IRES offers mentoring and research opportunities in tropical ecology to undergraduate science students. The project is centered on collaboration between Dr. G. Vourlitis, California State University, San Marcos (CSUSM) and Dr. F. Lobo, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso (UFMT), and combines formal instruction and practical field work for four undergraduate students each year. The core scientific project focuses on an active, long-term ecosystem research program in the Brazilian cerrado and pantanal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project provides instruction and research opportunities in tropical ecology to undergraduate science students early in their careers. The program consists of three phases involving pre-field education in research methods, an in-field intensive research experience in Brazil, and post-field training in data analysis and dissemination. Student researchers will be mentored by Dr. Francisco Lobo (UMFT) who has collaborated extensively with the PI in understanding the physiological ecology of Brazilian ecosystems. Four US students will work for six weeks with Brazilian counterparts and mentors at field sites in cerrado and pantanal ecosystems. The PI will recruit a diverse group of undergraduate students to participate, with strong representation of women and underrepresented minorities. A focus on recruiting from community colleges, combined with the involvement of Brazilian undergraduate and graduate students, will promote the engagement of underrepresented minorities in this international research opportunity.</AbstractNarration>
