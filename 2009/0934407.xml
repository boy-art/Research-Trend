    <AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Water Equipment and Policy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0934407 University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee; Erik Christensen &lt;br/&gt;0934253 Marquette University; Michael Switzenbaum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Water Equipment and Policy will continue along existing efforts being made in the Milwaukee region with respect to fostering collaboration and promoting economic development in the area of water. University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) and Marquette University (MU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UWM as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By planning and coordinating research activities and programs on water equipment, quality and policy, this center will combine existing strengths with important problems in fresh water management. With recent advances in materials, sensors, and control hardware/software, the timing is right for advances in knowledge and application to improved water equipment and policy. The PI and research team are qualified, and both the UWM PI and MU PI have demonstrated leadership. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will have a wide impact on industry's competitiveness and ability to adopt new technology. The teams of researchers and the center director, in conjunction with the industrial advisory board will select high priority projects that have the potential to improve the profitability of water equipment manufacturers and help obtain higher quality of water. The proposed center plans to recruit underrepresented students to work on projects that are of direct industrial relevance, and to work with the Society of Women Engineers and the National Society of Black Engineers student organizations to attract qualified minority students.</AbstractNarration>
