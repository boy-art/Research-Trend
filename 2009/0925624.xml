    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to realize efficient infrared electroluminescence using a hybrid organic-inorganic light-emitting device based on emissive group IV semiconductor nanoparticles including Si, Ge and Si1-xGex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Group IV semiconductor nanoparticles have the potential to be efficient and tunable photon sources in the infrared. To date, these systems have not been extensively studied in light-emitting devices. In this work, performance will be maximized by engineering the device architecture, processing conditions, and nanoparticle passivation length. Device performance will be correlated to nanoparticle film morphology using various microscopies. With an improved understanding of architecture and film morphology for Si-based light-emitting devices, other novel group IV systems will be investigated in order to provide multiple infrared light-emitters. The focus on group IV systems will broaden the study of nanoparticles for photonic device applications, and will also contribute to the basic understanding of radiative and non-radiative processes in these materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The PIs have identified as a priority the education of high school, undergraduate and graduate students on issues relating to the synthesis of nanoscale systems and their optoelectronic properties. Programs are proposed including summer research experience for high school students and teachers, research opportunities for undergraduate students through programs at the University of Minnesota, and the integration of research results into undergraduate and graduate classes in Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering. Results will be disseminated to industrial partners through the Industrial Partnership for Research in Interfacial and Materials Engineering, where both PIs are active participants.</AbstractNarration>
