    <AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Lisa F. Szczepura at Illinois State University to carry out fundamental studies to determine the scope and mechanism of small molecule activation by octahedral hexanuclear metal complexes. The reactions of interest are [2+3] dipolar cycloadditions and nucleophilic additions involving nitriles, isonitriles, and azides. The reactivity of different terminal ligands will be investigated, and a study of the mechanistic aspects of these reactions will be performed. These investigations will result in a deeper understanding of the factors that influence small molecule activation by these cluster cores. In addition, these studies will help probe potential applications of octahedral cluster complexes as catalysts and as building blocks in new solid state materials. By incorporating successful concepts from the Enrichment Workshop Program, developed with funds from a CAREER award, into her mentoring and research efforts, the PI hopes to generate well trained, motivated, underrepresented scientists at the undergraduate and graduate levels. In particular, mentorship of freshman or sophomore students from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences will help increase the retention and success rate of these students at Illinois State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will provide a better understanding of the activation of small organic molecules by transition metal clusters and will lend insight into the mechanistic aspects of this activation. Small molecule activation involves the formation of a number of fundamentally important compounds that play key roles in organic synthesis, and in a number of different industries including: pharmaceuticals, explosives, dyes and agriculture.</AbstractNarration>
