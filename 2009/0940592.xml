    <AbstractNarration>Wayne State University, in partnership with local community organizations, proposes a demonstration project that integrates K-12 outreach activities, pre-college bridge programs, and undergraduate computing degree programs in Detroit, MI to increase the participation and success of under-represented students in computer science, particularly African-Americans and women. The pipeline is novel in that it joins K-12 outreach efforts with adult learners and undergraduate students in an urban context. The pipeline will offer a selection of summer camps, Saturday classes, after school and in-school programs in conjunction with community organizations having experience with the K-12 educational processes and with recruiting minority students. These activities will target students from 2nd grade through high school. Parents will also participate, in the form of parent caf√©s, in which they engage in dialog with computing educators about how to support and encourage their children in the computing disciplines. Finally, the project will offer pre-college and first year bridge instruction which remediates academic deficiencies and explicitly prepares disadvantaged students for undergraduate education in the computing disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All pipeline activities will incorporate a suite of interventions designed to explicitly counter stereotype threat, promote a growth-oriented mindset, and encourage learning as well as feelings of self-efficacy, particularly with respect to the computing disciplines. These activities include coaching of students and teachers about the growth-oriented nature of intelligence, developing and providing culturally-relevant role models who demonstrate striving and a growth-oriented view of intelligence, and asking the students to develop themselves or Alice-generated representations of self as role models and exemplars of striving and learning for others. Similar interventions have been shown to eliminate a significant share of the black-white achievement gap in urban settings; this project is the first to explore their use in large scale for computer science and engineering&lt;br/&gt;education.</AbstractNarration>
