    <AbstractNarration>This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor George Christou at the University of Florida on the synthesis and study of molecules capable of functioning as nanoscale magnetic particles (single-molecule magnets). Magnets are important to numerous areas of a modern society, and the continuing push towards device miniaturization by industry is driving the search for new sources of smaller and smaller magnets. Synthetic procedures to afford new examples of such molecules are being explored. Also, targeted modifications of known examples of such molecules to introduce or optimize desirable properties are being investigated. Methods to switch interactions on and off between two or more such molecules are being developed, because these properties are important to potential employment of these molecules in new technologies such as spintronics and quantum computing. For the latter, the physics (quantum) properties of the molecules are also important and therefore these are being studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multidisciplinary nature of the research is providing a range of students, from high-school summer researchers to postdoctoral fellows, a broad exposure to and training in many areas of chemistry, and even some physics, both at the University of Florida and (during occasional short trips) at laboratories of collaborators. An annual student chemistry symposium for ten Florida universities, undergraduate colleges and community colleges is organized by the program. The symposium provides students additional education in scientific communication and presentations and exposes students to the wide range of scientific activity available for their future studies and careers. Development of both new magnetic nanomaterials and of scientific manpower trained in their use provides the foundation for many future magnetism-based industrial applications such as high-density information storage, new computer technologies, medical imaging devices, solar energy conversion, and spintronics and other electronics technologies.</AbstractNarration>
