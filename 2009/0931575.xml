    <AbstractNarration>This EAGER award addresses the exploratory development of a new technology that can potentially be used for the detection of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and that can be used for studying the source of their origin. Owing to their very low event rates, one would need detectors that extend over very large areas, which with conventional technology is very costly. Therefore, the development of new and less expensive methods for UHECR detection over large areas is highly desirable. Radar detection, if proven viable, could be the alternative technology. The concept of UHECR radar detection is based on the scattering of electromagnetic waves by the atmospheric ionization produced by extended air showers. The MARIACHI (Mixed Apparatus for Radar Investigation of Atmospheric Cosmic-ray of High Ionization) experiment set up on Long Island (NY) has several small shower detectors and parasitic bi-static radars to test the concept of radar detection of UHECRs. The analysis of the early data has shown coincidence candidates between radar and shower arrays over distances of 60 km, giving strong motivation to continue with this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds to support the implementation of a radar station at the Telescope Array facility at Delta, Utah. An early survey of the radio noise at Delta shows a nearly ideal site for the bi-static radar. They propose to carry out a coincidence search with the Telescope Array whose fluorescence detectors and ground array will provide the PI with information on cosmic ray energy as well as direction, thereby allowing him a direct comparison to the radar data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the program includes activities involving teachers and students in various research programs. Several groups throughout the country have already shown interest to join this effort. The team is also committed to continue working with underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
