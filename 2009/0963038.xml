    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds for Virginia Wesleyan College to modernize Blocker Hall, the College's Natural Science Facility. The renovation will result in six moderns labs dedicated to research and three joint teaching/research labs. Upgrades will include replacement of electrical, plumbing, lighting, temperature control, ventilation systems, and cyberinfrastructure. For some of the labs, substantial changes to room configurations will be made. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Renovations to the facility will significantly increase the quality of faculty research by enabling investigators to address more complex research questions, thus broadening the scope of these activities. Modernization of the research labs will diversify and enhance hypothesis-driven research activities in areas that are not currently possible (scanning electron microscopy and ion chromatography). The creation of dedicated research spaces that are usable by faculty from different disciplines will also promote collaborations and enhance the overall quality of research training across the natural sciences. Modernization of the cyberinfrastructure will enable more effective communication, thus increasing connectivity with the global scientific community and fostering collaborative research through electronic media between the VWC community and scientists worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Renovation of the facility will dramatically improve research training and the pursuit of independent, hypothesis-driven research projects by students majoring in biology, chemistry, earth and environmental sciences. Students will gain invaluable experience with modern research tools, thereby providing opportunities to develop critical skills and techniques. Renovation of Blocker Hall will double the capacity for student research projects. VWC's student body is very diverse (31% of natural science majors are minorities). The renovation will have a positive impact on the participation of historically underrepresented groups in independent research projects in the natural sciences. Graduates from the College who participate in research training will be more competitive for admission into graduate and professional programs and will enhance their preparation for careers in natural sciences and science education.</AbstractNarration>
