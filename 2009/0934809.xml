    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Drexel University Noyce Scholarship Phase II project, in partnership with the School District of Philadelphia, is enabling 30 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) mid-career professionals from the community to earn the credentials they need to teach mathematics and science in Philadelphia's high need schools. Because these schools have a large proportion of low-income (80%) student populations and shortages of highly qualified teachers, the need for high quality instruction is critical. The program objectives are to 1) Recruit STEM mid-career professionals with strong content preparation who are dedicated to teaching in high need urban districts; 2) Provide strong preparation in content knowledge, technology integration, pedagogical content knowledge and knowledge about urban education issues especially as they pertain to teaching in high need schools; 3) Provide onsite well-designed mentoring and induction and resources in the form of teacher supplies to support teachers in the classroom; 4) Emphasize recruitment of minorities and persons with disabilities; 5) Ensure compliance to the teaching requirement; 6) Continue to support and monitor Noyce scholars from the previous Phase I Noyce award; and 7) Increase the number of students from partnering schools at Drexel who may see teaching as a viable career choice for mathematics and science majors. The project is contributing to the knowledge about effective ways of monitoring teacher performance and how mentoring works.</AbstractNarration>
