    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will unite science education researchers and education policy researchers in the common task of exploring approaches for identifying, analyzing and addressing shared problems in order to catalyze research in the area of science education policy. The focus of the proposed conference will be on two major policy issues: &lt;br/&gt;--Models of teacher preparation and their impact on policies regarding &lt;br/&gt;teacher certification and professional development, and&lt;br/&gt;--Articulating common standards--fewer, clearer, higher--for both generalist science education and career-oriented science education.&lt;br/&gt;About 40 experienced, influential science educations researchers and education policy researchers will be invited to this conference, along with about 10 promising, new science education researchers. The conference will be organized not only to provide fruitful discussions about the science education policy research that exists, but to maximize opportunities to develop productive collaborations for the science education policy research that is needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although science education research has been relatively effective in developing theories of science teaching, learning, and assessment and in studying how these theories play out in classrooms, the effects on science education is small in scale, and there has been little influence on policymaking. On the other hand, while general education policy research may address more directly the reform challenges faced by policymakers, schools, and school systems, such research rarely addresses issues of specific concern to science teaching and learning. This conference will bring together policy actors, policy analysts, scientists, and science educators. The discussion among these four expert groups should lead to collaborations that build the capacity for the improvement of science education through informed policy.</AbstractNarration>
