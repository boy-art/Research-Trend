    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS 09-22888&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Sun, Bo&lt;br/&gt; Makki, Kami; Osborne, Lawrence J.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Lamar University Beaumont&lt;br/&gt; Beaumont, TX 77705-5748&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI/Acq.: Acq. of Equipment to Develop an Energy Efficient and Reliaable Wireless Sensor Network for Urban Landscape Irrigation Management System &lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, designing and implementing an energy efficient and reliable Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for Urban Landscape Management System (ULIMS), aims to provide significant cost-savings and alleviate urban water shortage problem by combining WSNs, data management, system integration, and web-based delivery. The constructed WSN will consist of a long-lived, real-time reliable network with remote control capability. Based on engineer portable, low-energy sensor nodes that can provide sensed data, the resulting system (W-ULIMS) addresses fundamental constraints faced by WSNs deployed in outdoor harsh environments, including energy supply, limited memory, the need for unattended operation for a long period of time, and the lossy and transient behavior of WSN communication. The project presents the following activities:&lt;br/&gt;- Randomized scheduling with a connectivity guarantee,&lt;br/&gt;- Extremely low duty-cycle data forwarding, and&lt;br/&gt;- Remote control (using the idea of Trickle).&lt;br/&gt;The randomized scheduling with connectivity guarantee and extremely low-duty cycle data forwarding protocols under study are expected to collect sensor data in an energy efficient manner. The testbed provides an infrastructure to study practical estimation, data collection and dissemination, and energy conservation faced by WSNs in harsh environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project applies new technologies to traditional agricultural environments and other applications while advancing the complex behaviors of WSNs. It should contribute to alleviate the significant water shortage problem facing many cities by providing cost-savings through efficient usage of agricultural labor and timely notification of situations requiring managerial decisions. Furthermore, it establishes an environment to broaden student?s knowledge and research experience.</AbstractNarration>
