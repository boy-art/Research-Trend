    <AbstractNarration>An NSF-CMBS Regional Conference, "The Mutually Beneficial Relationship of Matrices and Graphs," will be held at Iowa State University July 12 - July 16, 2010. Richard Brualdi, the principal speaker, is one of the founders and continuing leaders of the area of Combinatorial Matrix Theory, author of more than 200 papers, and an award-winning teacher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will discuss the symbiotic relationship between matrices and graphs and the significant role that they jointly play in pure and applied mathematics, science, and technology. Topics to be discussed include eigenvalues of matrices of graphs (adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, etc.), eigenvalues of digraphs, tournaments, sign pattern matrices, the class A(R,S), matrix polytopes, and total nonnegativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will equip beginning researchers with the necessary background and involve them in research collaborations in combinatorial matrix theory. Women, underrepresented minorities, graduate students, post-doctoral associates, junior faculty, and faculty at undergraduate colleges will be specifically recruited to participate.</AbstractNarration>
