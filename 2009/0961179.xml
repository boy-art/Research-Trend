    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ramapo College of New Jersey is a public undergraduate institution devoted to liberal arts and science education and training. Funds provided by this award will permit the renovation of the Biology Research Suite, a shared research laboratory for faculty-directed student research projects. The renovations include reconfiguration of the space to have an open design for student research allowing for improved faculty-faculty and faculty-student collaborations. In addition, the renovations include individual faculty research rooms, and common-use spaces including: cold room, tissue culture rooms, imaging room, and microbiology prep room. The renovated facility will provide the opportunity for undergraduates to conduct experiments involving protein purification, cloning, microbial gene expression and tissue culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improving the research training facility will deepen the College's offerings in biology and biochemistry and continue to provide opportunities for women, minorities and physically disabled students to gain employment and win spots in graduate and professional schools. The new Biology Research Suite will increase collaboration between senior and junior faculty. Strengthening and increasing the interaction between undergraduates and faculty will widen student experience and better prepare them for careers in graduate school and/or public and corporate research laboratories. Producing graduates with skill sets that are current with sophisticated contemporary research and who understand the social system of science will increase the nation's science enterprise wherever they practice their profession. This experience will result in students who are prepared to move seamlessly into research environments in industry or graduate schools because they have experience with the technology and methods that are in common use in these settings.</AbstractNarration>
