    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the renovation and modernization of approximately 2,900 square feet of space within the University of North Texas' (UNT) Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART), located in the university's Discovery Park (about 4.5 miles north of the main campus). As part of CART, UNT will create a modern, model facility, called the UNT Nanofabrication Analysis and Research Facility (NARF), which is to be an open-access "one-stop-shop" for advanced device fabrication and analysis across multiple length and time scales. The renovations will consolidate currently spatially distributed, advanced characterization and analysis instruments; upgrade the space to include high speed cyber connectivity permitting remote access and control of these instruments; and integrate this space with a clean room and technology incubator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: NARF will use "open system design" architecture to maximize collaboration and shared use of equipment, "integration for fabrication" to maximize entrepreneurial activities characterized by co-location of a clean room and technology incubator, and a "community/school-friendly" setting, where researchers share results and explain their work in real-time or via distance to visitors. The facility will host a unique trio of tools consisting of a dual-beam focused ion beam instrument, a high resolution transmission electron microscope, and a local electrode atom probe, capable of true atomic scale analysis of the structure and chemistry of materials, as well as many other advanced instruments, into direct proximity of one another. NARF will foster fundamental research involving nanoscale characterization and analysis applied to a wide variety of materials systems and devices, and will allow for the first time at UNT, true 3D characterization of the nanoscale structure and composition of specific components and failure sites in semiconductor devices, as well as interfaces in hybrid materials for aerospace, biomedical, and energy-related applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: One of the primary impacts enabled by NARF will be the research training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as post-docs and external researchers from industry, in the use of sophisticated characterization and analysis equipment. NARF will provide researchers a range of different equipment under one roof and allow them to appreciate the novel research possibilities afforded by these various techniques. Such an impact is not possible if the equipment is isolated and located at geographically scattered locations across the campus, as it is currently.</AbstractNarration>
