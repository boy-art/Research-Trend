    <AbstractNarration>The "Enhancing the Quality of STEM Education and Retention @MVSU through Mentoring Strategies and Student Professional Development" project seeks to implement mentoring strategies and student professional development activities to affect the growing exodus of students from STEM majors between the freshmen and sophomore years at Mississippi Valley State University. The project seeks to assist underrepresented students who often have numerous difficulties which deter them from attending college and being totally dedicated to academics. The project will further improve the infrastructure and quality of the STEM programs by strengthening the academic skills and support structures. &lt;br/&gt;Specific components of the project are: 1) a STEM mentoring model to enhance the quality of education to affect the number of students leaving STEM majors between the freshmen and sophomore year; 2) faculty/student research teams to increase opportunities for faculty and students to engage in collaborative research; 3) a teacher education clinic to enhance the science and mathematics skills of K-12 students by strengthening the content knowledge and the pedagogical skills of middle and high school teachers; and 4)infusion of computer security concepts into the curriculum to create and build an infrastructure which supports it as a viable research option for undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;This project is important because a disproportionate number of students arrive at the University with poor preparation for the STEM disciplines. This phenomenon is partially attributable to the preparation and skill level of teachers in the K-12 school system. The geographic region targeted for this project is the Mississippi Delta where 26 percent of all African Americans in Mississippi reside. Program activities are designed to provide improved educational experiences and opportunities for academically talented students who are pursuing STEM degrees, and to prepare them for graduate school and the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
