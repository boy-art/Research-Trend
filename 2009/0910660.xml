    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on combining foundational and lightweight formal &lt;br/&gt;methods to verify the safety, security, and dependability of &lt;br/&gt;large-scale software systems. Foundational approaches (to formal &lt;br/&gt;methods) emphasize expressiveness and generality, but they have not &lt;br/&gt;been successfully scaled to large-scale systems. Lightweight &lt;br/&gt;approaches emphasize automation and scalability, but they are less &lt;br/&gt;effective on low-level programs and on providing explicit proof &lt;br/&gt;witness. The PIs are developing new high-level and low-level &lt;br/&gt;lightweight methods and adapting them into various foundational &lt;br/&gt;verification systems. More specifically, at the high level, the PIs &lt;br/&gt;are developing lightweight dependent-type systems and &lt;br/&gt;separation-logic shape analysis, and connecting current methods such as &lt;br/&gt;conventional type systems, slicing analysis, and flow analysis; at the &lt;br/&gt;low level, the PIs are designing specialized provers and decision &lt;br/&gt;procedures to verify low-level programs and to support certified &lt;br/&gt;linking of heterogeneous components. If successful, this research will &lt;br/&gt;dramatically improve the scalability of foundational verification &lt;br/&gt;systems and provide new powerful technologies for building trustworthy &lt;br/&gt;software systems. Combining lightweight and foundational approaches &lt;br/&gt;also provides a common thread that will pull different verification &lt;br/&gt;communities together and unify them into a single framework.</AbstractNarration>
