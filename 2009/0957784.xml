    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Lingjun Li at the University of Wisconsin-Madison seeks to develop sensitive and versatile approaches to assessing the neurochemical response to environmental stress. Probes include mass spectrometric imaging and capillary electrophoresis, with novel tagging reagents and improved bioinformatics software. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools will have broad applicability to analysis of biochemical and peptidergic signaling in nervous systems. Insights gained should lead to better understanding of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms involved in adapting to environmental stress, a process that is highly conserved among all living organisms to maintain their survival in the face of both externally and internally generated stimuli. In simple terms, the long-term aim is better understanding of the detailed functioning of nervous systems. The tools will be promulgated rapidly to the neuroscience community through long-term and active collaborations with biologists in the field. Collaboration with industrial partners will also facilitate both improvement and promulgation of the CE-MS interface design. A large group of graduate and undergraduate students with diverse background (including many women scientists) is actively engaged. A partnership with the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) provides opportunities to host and mentor high school students during summer research internships.</AbstractNarration>
