    <AbstractNarration>Studies show that "distance matters" in the sense that geographic, temporal, and cultural differences lead to software engineering coordination and control problems that differ qualitatively and quantitatively from those in co-located development. Nonetheless, while software development has become a global enterprise, computer science education so far remains largely parochial in course content and student experience. This CPATH project is establishing a self-sustaining, international community of educators committed to teaching key computational thinking skills in the context of the human problems of communication, coordination, and interdisciplinary coordination in globally distributed software development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key premise of this project is that the challenges of globally distributed projects are an ideal context for students to develop and value computational thinking skills such as abstraction, modularization, and formalization. The project will gather and develop a common collection of relevant pedagogic materials, and assemble the necessary infrastructure for software engineering project courses in which students work in globally distributed teams. A set of community-building workshops will bring together parties from universities, industry, and professional organizations to foster collaboration, generate ideas, share experience, and improve common pedagogical assets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revitalizing computer science education to encompass globally distributed software development is necessary to prepare the U.S. workforce and maintain leadership in the future of software engineering. This includes fostering cultural understanding and sensitivity in the practical exercise of internationally collaborative work. In addition to developing pedagogical materials and infrastructure, this CPATH project also addresses systematic dissemination, formation of teaching partnerships, and other collaboration between academic institutions and industry. By lowering barriers to adoption and participation it will grow the teaching community, educate more students, and include universities in underserved communities.</AbstractNarration>
