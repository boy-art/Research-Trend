    <AbstractNarration>Through this award, travel support is being provided for young researchers to attend the 2009 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy to be held in Oakland, California, USA. The 2009 symposium marks the 30th annual meeting of this flagship security and privacy conference. Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for presenting developments in computer security and electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field. The Symposium is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy. The Symposium, as many other academic activities, relies on the experience of senior members of the community but requires fresh ideas and new researchers to join the community. As such, and to encourage graduate students and young faculty members to participate in the always exciting technical program and events at the Symposium, the travel support is used to sponsor the travel expenses for graduate students and junior faculty members to attend the Symposium. The total amount of the award is $25,000 on the basis of an average travel grant of $1,200 for each selected junior faculty participant and $900 for each selected graduate student. Attendance at SP 2009 will be very beneficial to young scientists who otherwise would be unable to participate. Travel support for student and junior faculty attendance is advertised nationwide, and women, minorities and disabled students are especially encouraged to apply for the grants.</AbstractNarration>
