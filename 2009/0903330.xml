    <AbstractNarration>Geospatial Teaching Across the Curriculum (Geo-STAC) developed by Lane Community College, is providing a mentored professional development opportunity for high school teachers and hands-on lessons in geospatial thinking and technology for high school students. The need for students to think spatially and use geospatial technologies is becoming more critical as these tools and concepts are increasingly incorporated into a broad range of occupations and academic disciplines. Geo-STAC addresses important needs to improve geospatial education and community college program recruitment by creating a pathway between the community college and high school teachers and their students. Geo-STAC is providing professional development workshops for high school teachers representing STEM and non-STEM disciplines to help teachers: (1) understand the importance of geospatial thinking; (2) learn how to use geospatial thinking in their particular discipline; (3) learn about geospatial technologies; (4) develop a Web-based GIS lesson; and (5) implement a Web-based GIS lesson. Geo-STAC also is working directly with high school students so that they: (1) understand the importance of geospatial technologies and careers in future job markets; (2) learn how to use Web-based GIS to solve problems; and (3) visit the community college GIS lab and experience using desktop GIS. The Geo-STAC project is strongly supported by the new National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence (GeoTech Center), the Lane County Education Service District (Lane ESD), high school teachers, and several community colleges across the country. Geo-STAC is actively disseminating this collaborative model to community colleges across the country.</AbstractNarration>
