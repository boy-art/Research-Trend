    <AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Marc Bermann, Roberto Campbell will explore residential variability within and among settlements and how this variability relates to processes of political leadership and community integration on Isla Mocha, Chile. Isla Mocha, an island located 30 kms from the Chilean coast, was during most of its prehistory a part of native Araucania, with a significant occupation dating to after 1000 AD. In 1550 AD, Araucania experienced European arrival but, contrary to most native societies of Latin America, the Spaniard's advance had been successfully repelled by the Araucanians by 1602, and a "free-Indian" nation persisted there and on the adjacent mainland until 1882. Yet while indigenous sociopolitical structures persisted until that late date, remarkably little is known about late prehispanic and early historical native sociopolitical organization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, the main sources to reconstruct the native sociopolitical organization and dynamics have been European chronicles and limited archaeological research. Each of these has tended to focus on chiefs and their activities. Therefore, they have failed to provide a fuller picture of the social variability that existed within the wider society. This research will investigate by means of intensive surface collection and limited excavation a 6 square km area. Mr. Campbell will attempt to reconstruct residential density, economic practices, wealth accumulation, patterns of consumption, status, and ceremonial practices. The fieldwork will provide data for: (1) understanding how communities were integrated economically and socially in both vertical and horizontal terms; and (2) identifying processes underlying social authority and regional social integration. The surface collections and excavations will recover ceramics, lithics, bones and shells (food remains and artifacts) and macrobotanical remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also have broader impacts. First, it is expected that the project will stimulate further projects and help to develop a patrimony consciousness in the local community. The project will impact current and planned development plans by underscoring the relevance of the Isla Mocha's archaeological record. It will further training of archaeology students in basic fieldwork techniques and more advanced material analysis training, encouraging them to approach archaeological research from a anthropologically and problem-oriented perspective.</AbstractNarration>
