    <AbstractNarration>String theory is a very rich subject, with a history full of surprises. Born as a model of the strong nuclear force, it was recognized in the mid-1970s as a theory of quantum gravity, and in the mid-1980s as a candidate unified theory of all particle interactions. In the last decade, it has partly gone back to its original roots, giving insights into the the strong interactions. This project has a dual research goal: (i) to investigate conceptual and fundamental aspects of string theory, and its relations to mathematics; and (ii) to use string theory as a language and a tool, especially to obtain insights into the dynamics of ordinary quantum field theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The PI intends to develop and teach graduate classes, deliver special lectures, and organize weekly graduate seminars. The research to be performed as part of this project is also envisioned to be instrumental in the training of thesis students and Stony Brook postdocs, who will be directly involved as collaborators.</AbstractNarration>
