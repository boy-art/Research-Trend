    <AbstractNarration>The Casimir force acts between two bodies placed in empty space (vacuum). According to the laws of modern physics the vacuum is not an absolute emptiness, but is filled with an infinite number of virtual particles. The Casimir force results from the modifications of the properties of these virtual particles due to the presence of the two bodies. Thus its value and nature is critically dependent on the shape and geometry of the bodies. The last five years have seen rapid theoretical advances in the area of the dependence of the effect on simple geometry, motivated in part by our demonstration of the lateral Casimir force for sinusoidally corrugated surfaces (gratings). For such gratings, the diffraction-like coherent scattering effects of the virtual photons cannot be predicted by standard theories which merely add up the effects of small sections of the interacting bodies. Our objectives are to completely map the coherent scattering of virtual photons in the lateral Casimir force with both sinusoidal and saw toothed (blazed) gratings. Many applications for such lateral Casimir forces for bringing about noncontact lateral translations in nanoscale gears and rack and pinion systems have been predicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has been involved with many synergistic activities of broader impact. He has mentored two K-12 students, 12 undergraduates (7 minority), 8 graduate students and 6 postdoctoral fellows in lab research. Funding for mentoring one minority undergraduate and graduate student is requested. UCR is a minority institution. The PI's research is published in leading journals and has also been reported in many public announcements. The PI has developed teaching modules for high school and community college students as part of a NSF funded project. He has co-organized five workshops. The force measurement technique has been transferred for the development of ultrasensitive microfabricated biosensors.</AbstractNarration>
