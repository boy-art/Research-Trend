    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray Computed Tomography with loading capabilities will be used to study: a) granular material crushing and evolution of granular material fabric during crushing; b) evaluation of deformation of the ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and bonding materials under stress of Magnetostrictive-Piezoelectric Laminates to optimize performance; and c) the performance of Magnetorheological Elastomers (MRE) during compression loading leading to a more fundamental understanding of its performance and thereby facilitating the creation of the next generation of MRE materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rowan University and Southern New Jersey will be positively impacted by the acquisition of the equipment by providing undergraduate and graduate students with training in use of cutting edge technology and expanding the equipment available for research at the South Jersey Technology Park. Undergraduate students will be a vital part of the proposed research especially through the Engineering Clinics. The timely acquisition will also enable various other research projects especially with the addition of the medical school to Rowan University. Every effort will be made to include minorities and women in the research. As a result of the equipment acquisition and research that will be enabled, the research team expects some publishable results, which will be widely disseminated. The acquisition of the apparatus will also enable expanded opportunities for foreign collaborations. The PI and co-PIs have also been involved with various outreach efforts and the preliminary research will be incorporated into these outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
