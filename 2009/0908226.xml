    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Nicholas Winograd of Pennsylvania State University seeks enhanced understanding fundamental aspects of the interaction of energetic particle beams with solids to enable novel applications in a variety of surface chemistry studies. The focus is to utilize cluster ion beams, particularly those composed of energetic C60 molecules, for molecular depth profiling experiments with an aim of examining buried interfaces of multilayer molecular thin film structures with a depth resolution of less than 5 nm, thereby providing 3-dimensional analysis of materials with complex architectures. Computer simulations support experimental measurements aimed at understanding the changes in topography during ion beam erosion, and compensating for differential erosion rates across heterogeneous materials. Methods to inhibit chemical damage accumulation and increase sensitivity are also sought. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this research should find widespread application in such diverse fields as mass spectrometry, polymer science, astrophysics, drug discovery, geology and chemical imaging. Students participate in K-12 presentations in economically disadvantaged nearby school districts as well as gaining invaluable skills that can be applied in a professional career.</AbstractNarration>
