    <AbstractNarration>Technical: Semiconductor nanowires are one of the primary nanostructured materials under investigation in the field of nanoscience. Because of their compatibility with existing semiconductor device processing methods and the possibility to control their electronic properties via such mechanisms as diameter selection, doping and heterostructure creation, they hold great promise as active elements in future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Significant industrial efforts focus on aspects of nanowire electronics such as integration and device performance. Critical to the success of these efforts is a fundamental understanding of the crystal growth processes involved in nanowire creation. In this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project, real-time transmission electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the mechanisms of semiconductor nanowire growth. The research aims to quantify growth kinetics relevant to the creation of advance device geometries, with a focus on heterostructures creation, interface abruptness and dopant effects. It seeks to provide fundamental insight into the semiconductor nanowire growth process via the technologically important vapor-liquid-solid and vapor-solid-solid growth processes. These insights are expected to lead to improved understanding of the self-assembly process and will provide a much needed scientific underpinning to the development of nanowire integration methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. Nanoscale electronic devices offer the potential of allowing advances beyond the limits imposed by traditional lithographic fabrication methods. Graduate and postgraduate training forms a core activity of the project, with a program encompassing extensive lab experience at the world's leading industrial lab for basic research in semiconductor electronics. Additionally, in-situ transmission electron microscopy is one of the primary "eyes" into nanoscale behavior, allowing exciting, dynamic videos of real physical processes to be obtained. The PI will continue work with a scientific visualization company to develop realistic and scientifically accurate animations of nanowire growth. These animations will be used to describe the science of nanotechnology to a broad audience through multiple dissemination routes, and will be utilized along with real dynamic observations in a web-based class on Thin Film Deposition coordinated through Purdue's NSF sponsored NanoHUB.</AbstractNarration>
