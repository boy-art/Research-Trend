    <AbstractNarration>Research in algebraic geometry is concerned with the solution sets &lt;br/&gt;to systems of algebraic equations, and it offers tools and models &lt;br/&gt;for non-linear problems across the mathematical spectrum. It now &lt;br/&gt;has numerous applications in the sciences and in engineering. This &lt;br/&gt;project is aimed at four specific directions: Spectrahedra and &lt;br/&gt;Orbitopes, Algebraic Statistics, Tropical Geometry, and &lt;br/&gt;Implicitization of Higher-Dimensional Varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectrahedra and Orbitopes are fundamental objects in convex &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, an emerging interdisciplinary direction that &lt;br/&gt;focuses on convex bodies with a distinguished algebraic representation.&lt;br/&gt;It is driven by applications in convex optimization, especially in the &lt;br/&gt;theory of semidefinite programming. The project will cement the &lt;br/&gt;development of convex algebraic geometry, and it will lead to new &lt;br/&gt;semi-numerical algorithms for non-linear optimization problems with &lt;br/&gt;a special algebraic structure. Such problems arise frequently in &lt;br/&gt;Algebraic Statistics. That area is concerned with statistical &lt;br/&gt;models that can be represented by polynomials in the model parameters. &lt;br/&gt;These include graphical models for both Gaussian and discrete random variables.&lt;br/&gt;The project will resolve fundamental questions concerning these models, and it&lt;br/&gt;promises novel computational tools for statistical inference. Tropical Geometry&lt;br/&gt;is a piecewise-linear version of algebraic geometry that is custom-taylored &lt;br/&gt;for modeling applied problems. The project is aimed at key open problems on &lt;br/&gt;the combinatorial side of the field. Implicitization in Higher Dimensions is&lt;br/&gt;a new paradigm for computer algebra, and it will lead to new tools for finding&lt;br/&gt;the defining equations of parametrically specified algebraic varieties.</AbstractNarration>
