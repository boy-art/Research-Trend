    <AbstractNarration>Chen&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0908663&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award is funded under the American Recovery and&lt;br/&gt;Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies some mathematical models that occur in three specific&lt;br/&gt;areas: electromagnetism, solid mechanics, and fluid mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;In the first project on electromagnetism, the investigator and&lt;br/&gt;his collaborators establish an identification of the self-dual&lt;br/&gt;Chern-Simons vortices, as well as study the electric and magnetic&lt;br/&gt;effects on the stability of the dually charged vortices. The&lt;br/&gt;second project concerns the dynamics of gel swelling. The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical construction of well-posedness of classical and weak&lt;br/&gt;solutions is proven in the context of hyperbolic conservation&lt;br/&gt;laws. The third project involves the well-posedness and&lt;br/&gt;stability of various nonlinear dispersive equations arising from&lt;br/&gt;solid and fluid mechanics. Methods of mathematical analysis are&lt;br/&gt;the primary tool employed in the investigations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Physical phenomena are usually well modeled via nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations. Such equations are exceedingly&lt;br/&gt;difficult to study, both theoretically and numerically, yet their&lt;br/&gt;understanding is important to further progress of many areas of&lt;br/&gt;physics and engineering. One of the objectives of this project&lt;br/&gt;is to study the behavior of electrically and magnetically charged&lt;br/&gt;particles in the classical field theory. Another objective&lt;br/&gt;concerns the study of soft condensed matter, which is relevant to&lt;br/&gt;drug manufacturing and bacterial motility. The third objective&lt;br/&gt;is to understand a new type of transonic wave arising in solid&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, which is different from the context of transonic flow&lt;br/&gt;in gas dynamics. The fourth objective is to study water waves&lt;br/&gt;that may occur in the ocean that are affected by the earth's&lt;br/&gt;rotation, and to understand how they can form tsunamis and how&lt;br/&gt;they can become turbulent. The results of this project&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the identification of physical problems of great&lt;br/&gt;scientific importance that offer new opportunities for the&lt;br/&gt;integration of applied analysis in research and in the training&lt;br/&gt;of graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
