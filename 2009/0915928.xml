    <AbstractNarration>0915928 - NeTS: Small: Collaborative Research: Supporting unstructured peer-to-peer social networking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;09/01/09-08/31/12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G. de Veciana, PI, U.T. Austin, and G. Kesidis, PI, Penn State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peer-to-peer systems have seen continued growth, in terms of traffic volume, and as the architecture of choice to build new applications and network services ? notable benefits lie in their distributed design leading to higher reliability and flexibility. However as users/peers increasingly become content providers, and generally conduct more of their business on the network, privacy is a critical concern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By leveraging peers? trust relationships through referral mechanisms based on underlying reputation systems, applications that deliver a new standard of privacy are being devised. Peer-to-peer systems that dynamically adapt, in a distributed and scalable manner, based on the outcomes of peer transactions, are being modeled and analyzed. The focus is on unstructured networks where peer-membership correlations among communities of interest can be learned to improve the search performance of reputation-biased random walks and limited-scope flooding. Content-sharing applications are being designed based that leverage this framework to incentivize cooperative behavior while enabling collaborative filtering and content pushing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected results include the development analysis and testing of a new framework for privacy-preserving search for large-scale, unstructured, on-line, peer-to-peer networks. Complementary incentive mechanisms resulting in improve file sharing and promoting honest referrals will be devised. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed venues and, where possible, industry concerns, while data and simulation tools are made available on the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The efforts impact will lie in contributing new ways to improve privacy and promote more honest and efficient cooperation in large-scale on-line peer-to-peer systems, for content sharing, as well as a broader set of social networking applications.</AbstractNarration>
