    <AbstractNarration>The International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS) is a bi-annual conference sponsored by the International Society of the Learning Sciences that will next take place June 28 to July 2, 2010 in Chicago with the theme "Learning in the Disciplines." This award provides support for two day and one-half pre-conference workshops: a Doctoral Consortium hosting 15 PhD students at the dissertation stage and an Early Career Workshop for 20 young researchers in the field. The primary purpose is to enhance the capacity of researchers in the young Learning Sciences field to conduct interdisicplinary work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will interact prior to the conference through workshop web portals so they can become familiar with one another's work and help organizers identify possible thematic groups for presentation and discussion. Participants will present their research and receive feedback from peers and faculty mentors, discuss issues surrounding the establishment of research programs, career planning, and professional networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop effectiveness will be evaluated through two surveys. One will be conducted at the conclusion of the workshops and the other one near the end of the subsequent academic term.</AbstractNarration>
