    <AbstractNarration>This project will focus on the relationships among novel manufactured nanomaterials, parasitism of a keystone grazer species, and aquatic ecosystem structure and function. Aquatic ecosystems are experiencing increased stress from multiple anthropogenic influences, including alteration of physical habitat and water chemistry, and the introduction of novel materials. The way in which these stressors modify cryptic food web interactions, such as between parasites and their hosts, is largely unexplored. Trematodes are common parasites of freshwater snails that affect their body elemental composition, reproduction, and behaviors that may subsequently influence stream and lake benthic ecosystem processes. Despite their small size, parasites such as trematodes may have a disproportionate effect on ecosystems by altering the cycling of nutrients or flow of energy in aquatic habitats. Engineered nanomaterials are increasingly used in manufacturing, medical applications, and consumer products, and are currently entering ecosystems. These materials have novel properties and unknown consequences on ecological processes. Freshwater communities consisting of bottom-dwelling microbes, plants, and animals will likely be influenced by water soluble nanomaterials such as nanosilver. This project will examine the interactive effects of nanomaterials and trematode parasites on aquatic communities. Field surveys and mechanistic, multi-species and whole community experiments will be used to study how nanomaterials and parasites indirectly alter species interactions and nutrient cycling in simple communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance a broader understanding of how disease ecology is modified by the introduction of novel materials. It will bridge gaps among disease and stress ecology, parasitology, and ecosystem function. A significant broader impact of this project will be to provide opportunities for local high school students to learn about the quality of their own water resources. Relationships between researchers and the local community will be created while integrating basic ecological research with in-depth research experiences for high school students and the development of K-12 classroom and field curricula.</AbstractNarration>
