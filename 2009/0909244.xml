    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early historical records about people of the Aleutian Archipelago of Alaska emphasized the importance of coastal resources to the cultures, leading Laughlin (1980:20) to conclude ?The interior land surfaces on the other hand were irrelevant to their way of life.? The project researchers argue that archaeologists limited surveys for sites to the shoreline and eventually concluded there were no sites upland. The research team of Hanson, Staley, and Corbett found an upland site in 1983 with 17 bermed, circular, cultural depressions on Adak Island leading to a profound shift in their understanding of land use in the Aleutian Chain. In 2007, the three archaeologists returned and found eight new sites in the same area, demonstrating that upland sites are not anomalous nor were ?interior lands irrelevant?. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to determine the function of upland sites on Adak Island. The objectives of this project are to incorporate data from site surveys and excavations into culture histories for the Central Aleutian Islands; develop a predictive model for upland sites; share the resulting information with colleagues, Aleut people, and the interested public; and provide a film about Aleutian Island archaeology to children attending Alaska Public schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project activities will occur over three years. During the first year, the project will expand on earlier surveys to develop a predictive model for upland sites. The archaeologists will record new sites using a handheld GPS and map the new sites and sites found during the 2007 survey using a Trimble GeoXT or a tape and compass. Archaeological excavations will be undertaken in year two and an educational video about Aleutian Island archaeology will also produced as a means of community outreach and public education. In addition, the project includes the facilitation of individualized research programs for graduate, undergraduate and local community high school students.</AbstractNarration>
