    <AbstractNarration>For the first time in human history, more than 50 percent of the world's population resides in urban centers. By the year 2015, this fraction is expected to rise by more than 10 percent. The increasing expansion of urban centers is significantly impacting ecosystem services and the human communities dependent on these services, not least because the biogeophysical environments of urban regions and their surrounds are substantially different from those of rural areas. The effects of this difference can be seen in modified water cycles and climates within urban centers and exurban areas, amended urban soil properties and ecosystem species, and polluted urban airways and waterways. In many cases, degraded urban biogeophysical environments also are contributing to severe health problems among urban populations. Concern about the major ecological impact of urbanization has prompted the development of numerous strategies for improving ecological services within cities, many of which are focused on the preservation and/or recreation of natural landscape features. One strategy that is gaining rapid attention in the U.S. is the concept of an urban Green Area Factor (GAF) program. The goal of a GAF program is to provide a cost-effective, decentralized approach to the restoration or expansion of ecosystem services in urban environments, by setting targets for the percentage of "greening" to occur in the development of different parcels of urban land. The use of the GAF as an urban planning tool has multiple potential benefits from the perspectives of improving urban ecology and health, improving the aesthetics and habitability of urban environments, and engaging urban stakeholders in strategies for sustainable development. But despite its potential, scientific linkages between GAF guidelines and ecological outcomes remain nascent. Furthermore, information about U.S. public willingness to provide support and stewardship for various GAF strategies is limited. The goal of this research project is to conduct interdisciplinary research on the dynamic interactions between people, natural ecosystems, and green technologies in the dense urban environment of New York City. The investigators will build on their own prior research as well as partnerships with diverse local community groups and practitioners to monitor and quantify the ecological and public health benefits of natural ecosystems and evolving green technology interventions in three New York City neighborhoods; to establish the acceptance and value of such systems and interventions to stakeholders; and to develop a GAF-based tool that might work as a common planning platform for urban stakeholders interested in optimizing the ecological and public benefits associated with different urban greening strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help provide the underlying scientific basis to advance and refine the GAF concept in order to more effectively take account of human interactions with urban greening strategies, including environmental justice communities. Optimally, it could be applied to dense and diverse urban environments such as the mega-city of New York. As well as advancing scientific knowledge, the project will deliver a new planning tool that can provide a common platform for different New York City stakeholders to explore various greening strategies in the context of their different missions and goals. The project also will build a team of scientists, community organizations, and practitioners who can work together to create new knowledge on urban ecosystem sustainability and functionality. Research training will be provided to post-doctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and educational, outreach, and teaching activities will form major components of the project. This award was funded as an Urban Long-Term Research Area Exploratory (ULTRA-Ex) award as the result of a special competition jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service.</AbstractNarration>
