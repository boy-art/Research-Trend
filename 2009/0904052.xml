    <AbstractNarration>The University of West Georgia will be the site of the Integers Conference 2009, a conference in the areas of combinatorics and number theory. The conference will follow the style of the successful Integers Conferences of 2003, 2005, and 2007. The 2009 conference will be held over a four-day period, October 7-10, 2009. One of its main goals will be to serve as a catalyst for important collaborative projects among mathematicians and computer scientists representing the areas of additive number theory, multiplicative number theory, probabilistic number theory, combinatorics, combinatorial optimization, game theory, and Ramsey theory. There will be five or six plenary speakers, who will give one-hour talks. There will also be approximately seventy 20-minute talks. The conference will be held in honor of the sixty-fifth birthday of Carl Pomerance, a distinguished mathematician who has made major contributions in number theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will gather mathematicians, graduate students, undergraduate students, and others interested in combinatorics or number theory. It will include student research talks, and promote interaction among research mathematicians at all stages from the talented undergraduate to the internationally distinguished researcher. A variety of areas of expertise will be represented from within the general area of discrete mathematics. Leading experts will present their latest work, and there will be much collaboration among participants. The research areas have many applications, including cryptography, genetics, neural networks, mathematical biology, radio frequency assignment for mobile telecommunications, coding theory, sequences for communications applications, and interconnection networks.</AbstractNarration>
