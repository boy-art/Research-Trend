    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will be used to support the renovation of one synthesis laboratory, two laser laboratories and a computational chemistry facility, totaling 3300 square feet. Renovations to this research facility will directly impact five Chemistry faculty members and their research groups, which include about 25% of department graduate enrollment. Through collaborations and instrumentation sharing, the improvements also are expected to significantly enhance research and research training across the department, as well as in other departments. The renovations will directly impact the externally-supported research in computational chemistry, biophysical chemistry and organic, organometallic and inorganic synthetic chemistry from the research groups of Beck, Connick, Dima, Gudmundsdottir and Stan. The renovated facilities will update the research infrastructure, enabling new experiments and research activities for the participating faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These renovations will promote scientific collaborations, especially among undergraduate and graduate students, as the improved laboratories will allow synergistic interactions between synthesis and analysis, as well as increase computational capabilities. These renovated facilities will expose students of all ages to a dynamic research atmosphere, which will reinforce efforts to excite these students about the study of Chemistry. It is anticipated that these renovations will significantly impact the department's recruitment of underrepresented minorities into Chemistry at the undergraduate level, while also enhancing recruitment of all students at the graduate level.</AbstractNarration>
