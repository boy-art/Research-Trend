    <AbstractNarration>BioSensing-BioActuation (BSBA) is a compelling new research frontier that will have profound impact on both engineering and biology in sensing/actuation science and technologies. This project establishes a series of three Summer Institutes on BSBA (SI-BSBA) for early career researchers and graduate students from the U.S. and Taiwan. SI-BSBA is jointly organized by the PI and Professor Shuo-Hung Chang of National Taiwan University and is funded in the U.S. by the National Science Foundation and in Taiwan by the National Science Council. The goals of the Summer Institute are to provide a platform for researchers from a diverse background to exchange ideas in the BSBA area, to train students and researchers in the highly interdisciplinary BSBA area who are knowledgeable in both engineering and biology, and to promote international collaborations in the BSBA area between researchers in the US and in Asian Pacific region. Each institute will include approximately twenty students/early career researchers from each side. SI-BSBA activities include a 2-week Summer Institute on BSBA alternately held in the US and in Taiwan. Experts in the BSBA area from engineering and biology will be invited to give lectures on the basics of sensing/actuation technologies and fundamentals of biology, as well as on the state-of-the-art research topics. Hands-on laboratory training of basic engineering tools such as micro- and nano-fabrication, basic tools from cellular level to organism level studies, and BSBA components such as neuron-networks and computational tools will be conducted. The impact of SI-BSBA will be significant and far-reaching, including developing new research tools, transforming the existing research methodologies, and potentially leading to solutions to some of the biggest challenges in society such as the environment, healthcare, sensor networks, and multi-functional materials. Furthermore, the international experiences of the participants will be extremely valuable to the next generation of US scientists and researchers. The Engineering Directorate Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation cofunded this award with the Office of International Science &amp; Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
