    <AbstractNarration>Quality Education for Minorities Network's one-year project has the goal to provide an opportunity for leadership of minority serving institutions (MSIs) to learn about current priorities and initiatives at NSF and to reinforce their role as catalysts for STEM initiatives on their campuses. The activities planned are: i) a Day at NSF in Arlington, VA for Presidents/CAOs of fifty MSIs; ii) dissemination of materials and follow-up evaluation on the effectiveness of the activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Day will expose participating Presidents/CAOs to new knowledge about and understanding of the critical need for transformative research and education at our Nation's higher education institutions. Through reflection with peers, NSF staff, and program officers during NSF Day, participants will explore their pivotal role in catalyzing innovative, integrated, and transformative STEM initiatives on their campuses. NSF Day will foster ongoing relationships between MSI leaders and NSF staff. through roundtable discussions. NSF staff and program officers will become better informed about MSIs and their contributions to advancing the STEM enterprise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcomes of the project are that participants will benefit from insights critical to the development of STEM education and research and become aware of strategies that can be used to improve and transform STEM education and research at their institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QEM Network brings leadership and expertise in working with MSIs to this project.</AbstractNarration>
