    <AbstractNarration>Goriely&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0907773&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The theme of the project is the study of growth, structure,&lt;br/&gt;and function in physiological and biological systems through the&lt;br/&gt;use and development of exact elasticity theory and the associated&lt;br/&gt;methods of applied mathematics. The project divides into&lt;br/&gt;specific but interconnected lines: the mathematical development&lt;br/&gt;of a theory of elastic growth in soft materials; the long-time&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of growth; the linear and nonlinear stability analysis&lt;br/&gt;of growing elastic systems with application to morphogenesis and&lt;br/&gt;pattern formation; the problem of cavitation and void-opening in&lt;br/&gt;growth; and the study of reduced theories. The Principal&lt;br/&gt;Investigators study elastic growth within the framework of exact&lt;br/&gt;elasticity theory, where growth is modeled through the&lt;br/&gt;multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. The&lt;br/&gt;mechanical consequences of growth, its long-time dynamics, and&lt;br/&gt;its potential to either generate instabilities through changes in&lt;br/&gt;geometry and stresses, or to act as a regulatory mechanism, are&lt;br/&gt;examined. Furthermore, a study of growing tissues is carried out&lt;br/&gt;through the development and application of the techniques of&lt;br/&gt;weakly nonlinear analysis. The development of reduced theories&lt;br/&gt;for rods, membranes, plates, and shells for growing structures is&lt;br/&gt;also undertaken. Various applications in biology and physiology&lt;br/&gt;are studied; in particular the ideas of growth are applied to&lt;br/&gt;bacterial and fungal systems, stems, leaves, arteries, and blood&lt;br/&gt;vessels. The various theoretical analyses and specific models of&lt;br/&gt;growth are carried out through the use and extension of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;analysis techniques developed by the Principal Investigators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Growth is a fundamental scientific problem of great&lt;br/&gt;complexity coupling biological, chemical, and physical phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to develop mathematical tools to&lt;br/&gt;understand and model a variety of problems related to growth,&lt;br/&gt;including plant and microbial morphogenesis, the stability of&lt;br/&gt;arteries, the development of aneurysms, and the regular and&lt;br/&gt;abnormal functions of organs such as the heart, the esophagus,&lt;br/&gt;and the trachea. Despite the great biological diversity of these&lt;br/&gt;systems, they share common features that can be modeled through&lt;br/&gt;the use of similar mathematical tools. These models help the&lt;br/&gt;scientific community to understand the intimate coupling between&lt;br/&gt;mechanics and biology in growth processes and to predict better&lt;br/&gt;the response of many biological and physiological systems.</AbstractNarration>
