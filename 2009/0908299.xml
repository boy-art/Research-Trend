    <AbstractNarration>Hicks&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0908299&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Until approximately ten years ago, it was only possible to&lt;br/&gt;machine optical quality mirrors and lenses that were surfaces of&lt;br/&gt;revolution. Due to advances in optical machining technology it&lt;br/&gt;is now possible to essentially machine a surface of any shape. &lt;br/&gt;This increase in design possibilities calls for new design&lt;br/&gt;techniques. Traditionally, partial differential equations and&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry did not play a role in optical design&lt;br/&gt;because of the restrictions of what surfaces could actually be&lt;br/&gt;made. Now, using these methods, and in particular the viewpoint&lt;br/&gt;of exterior differential systems, we have a framework to attack&lt;br/&gt;these complex problems. Additionally, new models for optical&lt;br/&gt;systems are developed based on functional differential equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In recent years a plethora of difficult new optical design&lt;br/&gt;problems have appeared. Energy conservation has become a problem&lt;br/&gt;of global concern, and in particular the problem of efficient&lt;br/&gt;lighting. Significant advances are currently taking place in&lt;br/&gt;illumination technology, due to the rise of the light emitting&lt;br/&gt;diode. Yet the design problem for illumination systems has&lt;br/&gt;proven to be notoriously difficult, and is currently more of an&lt;br/&gt;art than a science. The investigator and his colleague develop&lt;br/&gt;new mathematical methods to deal with these challenges in optical&lt;br/&gt;design. The project provides a framework for illumination&lt;br/&gt;design. Another application is to automotive safety. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator has already designed a driver-side mirror&lt;br/&gt;without a blind spot, that has no distortion. The problem of&lt;br/&gt;designing a similar mirror for the passenger side of a car is&lt;br/&gt;more complex, and is pursued in this project. Finally, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators disseminate this work through interactive exhibits&lt;br/&gt;based on the project that are hosted by The Franklin Institute, a&lt;br/&gt;major US science museum located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,&lt;br/&gt;which is visited every year by over 750,000 people.</AbstractNarration>
