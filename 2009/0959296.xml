    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from the MRI-R2 program was provided to support the purchase of an Gas Chromatograph (GC) to provide on-site capabilities for research projects in ecosystem and restoration ecology, microbiology, and chemistry at Northern Kentucky University (NKU). Research with the new instrumentation is focused on understanding how community plant dynamics influence the flux of greenhouse gases (e.g. nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and methane) in aquatic ecosystems. Specific projects focus on managing and restoring aquatic systems to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. Additional research is being conducted to examine microbial ecosystem dynamics within starved, subterranean cave environments. The GC system will allow an expansion of research capabilities to examine the role of methanogenesis, fermentative hydrogen production and nitrogen fixing and cycling in community energetics. Data from these studies provide for a better understanding about what drives greenhouse gas fluxes in aquatic systems, which is critical when proposing ecosystem management strategies to curb global warming. Also, understanding the factors that induce mutualistic interactions and energetic associations in microbial communities, we may better understand the factors that render the majority of microbial species unculturable in the laboratory. NKU is a regional university serving the Greater Cincinnati metropolitan area. The university is primarily an undergraduate institution dedicated to hands on research as a teaching tool. In support of this rationale, the Biology Department puts a heavy emphasis on undergraduate research experience. The GC will allow faculty at NKU to mentor undergraduate students in additional field and lab techniques on an instrument that is commonly used in industry, and academic labs. Professors in both the Biology and Chemistry Departments at NKU will also utilize the GC in hands-on courses to demonstrate analysis of known and unknown gases to expand the teaching potential of this machine. Data and findings from the research and education activities enabled by the GC system will be disseminated through student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings, and through publication in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
