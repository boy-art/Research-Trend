    <AbstractNarration>0968984 University of Oklahoma; Floyd Grant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Oklahoma (UO) seeks to join the existing I/UCRC "Electromagnetic Compatibility" consisting of the Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST), the University of Houston (UH). And Clemson University (CU). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is an essential feature of virtually all high speed digital electronic assistants and home entertainment centers to essential control and information processing systems. EMC is the ability of these electronic systems to function reliably without causing interference to other electronic systems, being overly sensitive to weak signals generated by other electronic systems, and generating signals in one part of the system interfering with the operation of another part of the same system. The proposed research projects include both experimental and simulations and also include projects which aim to improve predictive and modeling capabilities so that future generations of devices can be designed to more effectively deal with this problem. The projects range from broad and ambitious (e.g. EMI effects on humans) to targeted and near-term (e.g. the design of a less "noisy" inverter for hybrid vehicles). The University of Oklahoma operated an NSF IUCRC Wireless EMC for several years and virtue of this experience, the University can contribute significantly to the management of the proposed site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will encourage collaboration amongst the four institutions, and is committed to providing a skilled and diverse workforce in the area of EMC as required by industry. The research will expose students and faculty to state-of-the-art research projects to the industry. The close collaboration with various industry partners will help establish a strong research base to enable development of consumer electronics and control and information systems. The proposing institution has the Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP) designed for the recruitment and retention of students who contribute to the diversity of the College of Engineering. The program provides services primarily for under-represented minority population.</AbstractNarration>
