    <AbstractNarration>IIS - 0916129 &lt;br/&gt;HCC: Small: Collaborative Research: Asynchrony and Persistence for Complex Contact Simulations&lt;br/&gt;Grinspun, Eitan &lt;br/&gt;Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Proposals&lt;br/&gt;IIS - 0914833 &lt;br/&gt;Guibas, Leonidas J &lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the challenge of complex contact simulations by working entirely in an asynchronous setting. The project operates along three lines, combining tools from Asynchronous Variational Integrators (AVIs) and Kinetic Data Structures (KDSs) with a novel effort to perform and exploit qualitative analysis of contact simulation data. The first investigation will show that AVIs, meant to handle the continuous aspects of the physics, can be integrated well with KDSs, meant to handle discrete geometric events. The second research component addresses the fundamental problem of event scheduling when future trajectories are uncertain. Methods will be explored that improve event detection times, reduce the number of auxiliary events that have to be processed, and allow events to be processed in parallel. The third research task will be to initiate a study of the qualitative behavior of contact simulation by building a hierarchy of coarser models which can then be used for better resource allocation, for the validation of various approximations, and in improved simulation design to attain desired effects.</AbstractNarration>
