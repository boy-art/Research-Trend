    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to investigate a new magnetorheological (MR) brake actuator with an embedded Hall-effect sensor in its flux path to eliminate hysteresis using closed-loop control. The new actuator will also incorporate a permanent magnet, coil and serpentine flux path to reduce the overall size to improve its torque-to-volume ratio. MR-brake actuators have been implemented in many applications including civil engineering, haptics, exercise equipment, automobile suspensions and tactile displays. However, their hysteretic behavior makes control challenging. The research will result in a systematic methodology to identify the dominant parameters of the actuator and study their complex interactions. The research approach progresses from parameterized finite element simulations to analysis of the data with design of experimental techniques and to verifications with a prototype actuator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will transform the state-of-the-art MR-brake actuator technology into a smart actuator technology. Example applications include automotive industry, aerospace, robotics, civil engineering, prosthetics, haptics, vibration control, game industry and rehabilitation. The results will be disseminated to allow the creation of commercial devices. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. A new workshop on smart fluids and actuators will be organized for the underrepresented middle and high school students during the annual MESA events on campus. The workshop will allow children to conduct experiments with magnets, coils and MR fluid and emphasize how research leads to development of new knowledge and products.</AbstractNarration>
