    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a framework for the development&lt;br/&gt;and deployment of next-generation medical systems consisting of integrated and&lt;br/&gt;cooperating medical devices. The approach is to design and implement an&lt;br/&gt;open-source medical device coordination framework and a model-based component&lt;br/&gt;oriented programming methodology for the device coordination, supported by a&lt;br/&gt;formal framework for reasoning about device behaviors and clinical workflows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in the formal foundations of the&lt;br/&gt;framework that will enable rapid development, verification, and certification&lt;br/&gt;of medical systems and their device components, as well as the clinical&lt;br/&gt;scenarios they implement. The model-based approach will supply evidence for the regulatory approval process, while run-time monitoring components embedded&lt;br/&gt;into the system will enable "black box" recording capabilities for the forensic&lt;br/&gt;analysis of system failures. The open-source distribution of tools supporting&lt;br/&gt;the framework will enhance its adoption and technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rigorous framework for integrating and coordinating multiple medical devices&lt;br/&gt;will enhance the implementation of complicated clinical scenarios and reduce&lt;br/&gt;medical errors in the cases that involve such scenarios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, it will speed up and simplify the process of regulatory approval for coordination-enabled medical devices, while the formal reasoning framework will improve the confidence in the design process and in the approval decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the framework will help reduce costs and improve the quality of the&lt;br/&gt;health care.</AbstractNarration>
