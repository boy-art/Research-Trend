    <AbstractNarration>Motta &lt;br/&gt;0932026 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experimental work will study a new and unique passive boundary-layer separation control methodology derived from shark skin, functioning at the micro-scale level. The skin and denticles (scales) of sharks represent over 400 million years of natural selection for swimming efficiency. Evolutionary adaptations in the morphological structure of the shark skin, to develop unique boundary layer control (BLC) mechanisms, stem from the ensuing decrease in drag, probable increase in fin performance (e.g. thrust production) and enhanced turning agility for fast-swimming sharks. Previous work, confirmed by the PIs, has shown the capability for shark denticles to bristle. The PI discovered that a bristled microgeometry results in the formation of a system of interlocking embedded cavity vortices. Three mechanisms are hypothesized which lead to boundary layer control via deterrence of separation over the shark skin. The first mechanism is the formation of embedded micro-vortices that increase momentum in the very near-wall region due to the partial slip condition resulting on the outer boundary layer flow. The second mechanism is that the preferential flow direction inherent in the surface geometry inhibits global flow reversal. The third mechanism, occurring during transitioning and turbulent boundary layer conditions, involves an exchange of flow with the cavities resulting in turbulence augmentation, or an additional energizing of flow in the near-wall region and cavities. The study involves engineers, working together with biologists, to fully comprehend the morphological bristling mechanism of shark denticles. This study will provide the first comprehensive characterization of the morphological mechanism resulting in denticle bristling and will classify the scope and degree (or angle) of bristling, yielding data for the building of shark skin models for hydrodynamic testing. The three passive BLC mechanisms will be evaluated through flow visualization and measurement using Time-Resolved Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (TR-DPIV). Innovations in the field of BLC are needed to provide efficient methodologies to decrease drag (resulting in increased payload, range or fuel savings), improve performance of control surfaces and enhance turning agility of modern technologies (e.g., submarines, aircraft). Dissemination of results will occur in journals/conference proceedings and the public media (e.g. Discovery Channel Canada). Undergraduate student involvement will take place through participation with two NSF REU programs (University of Alabama and Mote Marine Laboratory) with a focus on involving underrepresented groups; an REU supplement will also be sought to involve additional underrepresented undergraduates. Finally, the results from this research will be incorporated into educational outreach programs/exhibits at the Mote Marine Laboratory on sharks by the co-PIs and at the McWane Science Center in Birmingham, AL by the PI. Outreach through these two outlets alone should educate over 700,000 people each year about the drag-reducing properties of shark skin.</AbstractNarration>
