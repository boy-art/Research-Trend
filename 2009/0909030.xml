    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Giles Novak (Northwestern University) will carry out a campaign to observe the magnetic field morphology in 13 relatively isolated molecular cloud cores containing embedded low-mass protostars. The observations will be carried out using the Submillimeter High Angular Resolution Polarimeter (SHARP), a fore-optics module that adds polarimetric capability to the powerful Submillimeter High Angular Resolution Camera generation II camera at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna Kea. The survey is designed to test a wide class of protostellar collapse models that invoke magnetic fields as a dominant factor in controlling the collapse. According to these models, the field regulates the transfer of angular momentum thereby solving the so-called "angular momentum problem", and strongly influences the properties of the protostellar disks out of which new planets are formed. Preliminary results for two of the 13 targets indicate that levels of polarization are above the detection threshold. If these levels are typical, the magnetic field survey will provide a conclusive test of the magnetically-controlled collapse models. The survey data will either rule these models out, or set them on a sound observational footing as an important step in their further development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a part of this work, Dr. Novak and collaborators will upgrade SHARP to convert it into a "Facility Instrument" available to the world astronomical community. The upgrade will allow investigators from around the world to use SHARP to study a diverse range of objects including external galaxies, evolved stars, and the black hole at the Galactic Center. In addition, the investigator's research group will continue to provide students with hands-on experience in building and using cutting-edge astronomical instrumentation, preparing them for a variety of careers both inside and outside of academia.</AbstractNarration>
