    <AbstractNarration>This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professors Lisa McElwee-White and Tim Anderson at the University of Florida to develop processes for the growth of thin films of barrier material for Cu metallization used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuits. The initial target material is ruthenium, which can serve in interfacial layers for seedless Cu metallization. Mechanism-based design accompanied by computational chemistry allows evaluation of Ru-containing film growth precursors before synthesis. An important aspect is the use of alternative precursor delivery systems designed for all molecules independent of volatility, thus expanding the range of possible precursors. Following preparation of potential precursors, rapid screening selects the most promising candidates for film deposition and characterization. Collaboration with industry facilitates process development and optimization including reactor modeling. Graduate students are trained in interdisciplinary team-based problem solving in chemistry, chemical engineering and materials science. Industrial internships, mentoring of undergraduate researchers and interactions with industrial research personnel are used to broaden the students' perspectives. A workshop that one of the PIs (Anderson) has presented on career development for new and prospective faculty for the last 6 years at national meetings is being adapted for presentation to chemistry faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deposition of thin films is a key technological capability. Innovation often relies on the ability to deposit films with very specific composition, surface morphology, microstructure, thickness, and interfacial chemistry. Developing a process for deposition of a barrier material for Cu metallization will address a current challenge in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuits.</AbstractNarration>
