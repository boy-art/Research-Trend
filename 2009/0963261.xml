    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Interdisciplinary Molecular Biology Education, Research and Advancement (CIMERA) is a research equipment facility shared among faculty from the departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry at California State University, Sacramento. CIMERA is housed in an eight-room suite in the basement of Sequoia Hall originally built as an animal care facility. The original design of the suite limits its utility as a cell and molecular biology laboratory. Recent funding for additional cell analysis and cell culture equipment, and recent expansion of student/faculty research and research training activities, necessitates expanding and updating the facility. Funds are provided to allow the CIMERA facility to expand and modernize. The renovation involves (1) removing an incinerator, unusual floor and loft, autoclave and cage washer to generate additional space to allow expansion of the cell analysis and mammalian and bacterial cell culture laboratories, (2) updating the ceiling, lighting, flooring, electrical service and network connectivity to a standard appropriate for a modern molecular cell biology laboratory and (3) updating the benches, cabinetry and plumbing for use as a molecular cell biology laboratory. These renovations will create: a modern cell analysis laboratory, an expanded the mammalian cell culture laboratory, a large equipment room, a bacterial cell culture laboratory, and a modernization of the molecular biology laboratory. The facility provides basic cell culture, molecular biology and cell analysis equipment that support the research programs of 16 faculty, addressing fundamental problems such as the molecular events of vertebrate egg fertilization, the structure and function of apolipoprotein A-I, cellular differentiation during embryogenesis and fundamental techniques in forensic DNA analysis. In addition, the facility supports five different research training programs, several of which are targeted at underrepresented groups that provide undergraduate and Master's-level students with independent or semi-independent research experiences. These renovations will enhance the research programs of participating faculty and the training of their students, resulting in the ability to provide research experiences for approximately 20 additional students. This project will advance individual faculty research programs addressing fundamental problems in protein biochemistry, molecular and cell biology and forensic molecular biology. Furthermore, the renovation will enhance the research training of undergraduate and Master's level students by providing a modern molecular and cell biology equipment facility. It will increase the involvement of underrepresented groups in the sciences by providing specific research training experiences to students from underrepresented groups at Sacramento State and transferring from local community colleges.</AbstractNarration>
