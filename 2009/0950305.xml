    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award seeks to use nanoscale electronics technology to develop brain-like computing structures that possess the density and plasticity that allow arrays of synapses to perform sensing, pattern recognition, and motor control at performance levels beyond what is possible with traditional computers. The goal is to determine if nanoelectronics configured in a self-assembled crossbar array can achieve the density and plasticity of synapses. To address plasticity, the research focuses on phase-change and metal-oxide materials for neuromorphic systems. To address density, the project investigates ultra-dense interconnects for self-assembled nanoelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the research builds on recent progress in the use of phase-change and metal-oxide memory cells for nonvolatile memory, but takes the technology in a different direction to use phase-change and metal-oxide memory cells for implementing electronic synapse arrays for brain-like computing. The research uses an experimental approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, this research has the potential to dramatically alter how computation is done for a number of tasks, such as pattern recognition and motor control. An undergraduate student from an underrepresented group will be engaged in the research. The project also facilitates multidisciplinary interaction between nanoelectronics and bioengineering researchers.</AbstractNarration>
