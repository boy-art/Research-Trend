    <AbstractNarration>OISE 0922684&lt;br/&gt;Bargu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relatively little is know about the distribution of marine diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia, in offshore, oceanic environments and corresponding ecosystem-wide consequences associated with the diatom?s potential production of the toxic Domoic Acid (DA). Though this research planning visit, Sibel Bargu and a graduate student from Louisiana State University and A &amp; M College will initiate a collaborative project with Danish partner, Nina Lundholm at the University of Copenhagen. They intend to study diversity and toxin production of the Pseudo-nitzschia species in sub-Arctic and Arctic regions with a particular focus on iron enriched regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate species identification and molecular studies of this source organism are needed to further evaluate the ecology and toxin production of the taxa. The U.S. principal investigator?s strengths in ecological measurements of DA in iron rich waters, seaward of continental margins, complement the Danish partner?s extensive knowledge of systematics and molecular biology in Artic and sub-Arctic locations. Together the international team will begin work to confirm the ultimate identity of the Pseudo-nitzschia species by using electron microscopy and genomic analysis. Their efforts are expected to begin to reveal more about the production and transfer of DA through food chains in places like the Gulf of Alaska and Greenlandic waters, with the long-term goal of documenting Pseudo-nitzschia distribution and toxicity in world oceans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research visit fulfills the program objective of advancing basic knowledge of this genius and the relative toxicity of strains by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to share research resources and plan beneficial projects in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Broader impacts include providing one Louisiana State University graduate student with an early career introduction to forefront international collaboration and field work. Based on previous observations, team members conclude that iron enrichment may selectively promote growth of the toxin producing strains. Therefore, new results could identify potential DA hazards that should be considered in iron fertilization experiments designed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through sequestration in deep oceans.</AbstractNarration>
