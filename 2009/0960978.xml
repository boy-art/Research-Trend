    <AbstractNarration>Title: DMTCP: Checkpoint-Restart on the Desktop&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gene Cooperman&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal Number: 0960978&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work builds upon the existing open source, user-space DMTCP package&lt;br/&gt;for transparent, distributed checkpointing. Three goals will be accomplished:&lt;br/&gt;(i) checkpoint-restart of long-running computations on the desktop;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) save-restore of interactive software packages; and (iii) a universal&lt;br/&gt;reversible debugger. The first two goals will allow software development&lt;br/&gt;teams to add to their package a reliable "save workspace" feature --- with&lt;br/&gt;no requirement for a kernel module or other privileged operations.&lt;br/&gt;The third goal is to enhance any debugger with reversibility (e.g. a&lt;br/&gt;back-step command), and with a reverse expression watchpoint command to&lt;br/&gt;move backwards from a software error to the original software fault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:&lt;br/&gt;While checkpointing has existed for over 20 years, earlier packages&lt;br/&gt;were difficult to maintain. The unprivileged, user-space design of&lt;br/&gt;DMTCP has a five-year track record. It is ideal for integration into&lt;br/&gt;other software, where any end-user requirement for installation of a&lt;br/&gt;kernel module or other administrative privilege is incompatible with&lt;br/&gt;widespread distribution. Finally, DMTCP is the first package able to&lt;br/&gt;directly checkpoint a gdb session (the gdb process and its target process)&lt;br/&gt;-- a key feature for the envisioned new type of reversible debugger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT:&lt;br/&gt;Checkpointing and process migration have long been of interest for science&lt;br/&gt;and engineering, but too often suffered from software fragility or special&lt;br/&gt;requirements. The DMTCP approach removes these obstacles. Further,&lt;br/&gt;the wider use of ``time-traveling (reversible) debuggers'' will greatly&lt;br/&gt;accelerate software development due to the greater ease of finding bugs.&lt;br/&gt;A NIST report estimates the cost of software bugs to the economy at&lt;br/&gt;$59.5 billion per year. Finally, the excitement factor of checkpoint-restart&lt;br/&gt;on the desktop helps attract and motivate students toward the learning&lt;br/&gt;of sometimes arcane systems issues in this critical technology.</AbstractNarration>
