    <AbstractNarration>Abstract: Cultural Shift: Bringing the JOY (Joint Organization to inspire Young people) back to computation &lt;br/&gt;Through this CPATH planning project, Marietta College is exploring effective means of introducing and/or revitalizing computational thinking across disciplines on its campus and among teachers and students in the surrounding K-12 educational community. Led by faculty in computer science, computer information systems, management information systems and mathematics, this project will create a cultural shift among faculty in multiple areas of study. Faculty from these varied departments are serving on the advisory committee for this planning project and have agreed to pilot threads that introduce computational thinking into their courses: physics, biology, education, graphic design, petroleum engineering and theater. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activities &lt;br/&gt;At a small liberal arts institution, the dependence of each discipline on another is perhaps more pronounced than at larger institutions. Rather than creating discipline-specific computer curricula, professors in most other disciplines rely on the computer science department to offer courses that provide a strong base for computational learning. The expectation is that as students develop mastery within their disciplines, they will be able to integrate this knowledge with their computational skills, which will strengthen their ability to manage information, and enable them to transition to increasingly higher levels of discovery and comprehension. The intellectual merit of this CPATH project stems from its focus on revising basic computer courses to emphasize computational thinking, and integrating computational thinking as a method that informs learning across many disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activities &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this CPATH planning project is evident in three elements: campus-wide involvement, community outreach, and piloting threads of computational thinking (CT) in non-computer courses. Faculty and staff from any discipline are invited to explore the concept of computational thinking by participating in workshops, attending presentations and/or serving on a CT project advisory committee. Through creative road shows and summer learning opportunities, middle and high school students are being introduced to CT. An introduction to CT is being added to in-service math teachers? workshops at the college. Faculty in at least two and perhaps as many as six other disciplines are piloting efforts to introduce CT within their courses. The anticipated project outcomes include broadening fluency with computational thinking among faculty at Marietta College and among math teachers in the K-12 educational community; revision of two key computer courses to create a stronger alignment with computational thinking for first year computer students; and increasing excitement about and awareness of the myriad uses for computational thinking among K-12 youth. The project?s evaluation process will measure the effectiveness of the various elements of this project and inform the development of a full implementation proposal in the spring of 2011.</AbstractNarration>
