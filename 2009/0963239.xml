    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will renovate laboratory space in Smith Hall, which was first occupied in 1968. Smith Hall houses the Chemistry, Physics, and Computational Science Department and the aquaculture laboratory of the Environmental Science and Biology Department. The building does not have air conditioning, and lacks hood space, adequate power, and a vacuum and distilled water distribution system. These infrastructure issues are the target of the proposed renovation. The effort is part of a larger renovation project funded by the State University Construction Fund that is limited to asbestos abatement and energy efficiency improvements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renovation of the research laboratories will benefit at least eleven faculty members who have a strong track record in securing extramural funding and publishing in peer-reviewed journals. The renovations will enable and improve research infrastructure which is heavily used for undergraduate student training. Several faculty members are involved in research concerning ionic liquids, which are salts that are liquid at or near room temperature and have received increasing attention because of their unique properties and their use as neoteric solvent in chemical synthesis and processing. Other faculty collaborate on research to grow and characterize layers of thin films of superconducting metals or are working on computational aspects of mathematical knot theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 50% of SUNY Brockport science graduates go on to graduate school. These students will benefit from improved research facilities and be better prepared for success in graduate school. Improved facilities will further help in recruiting research-active faculty, helping to grow and expand SUNY Brockport's thriving program.</AbstractNarration>
