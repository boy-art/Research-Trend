    <AbstractNarration>This project maintains and enhances existing community software &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, and creates new community data infrastructure to &lt;br/&gt;enable the information retrieval research community and related &lt;br/&gt;research communities to conduct research on a "web scale", &lt;br/&gt;meaning datasets of a billion or more web pages together with &lt;br/&gt;large query logs. The software infrastructure is based on the &lt;br/&gt;Lemur Toolkit and the associated Indri search engine, which are &lt;br/&gt;used by many information retrieval researchers due to the support &lt;br/&gt;for multiple retrieval models, multiple forms of evidence, and a &lt;br/&gt;powerful probabilistic query language. The enhancements to Lemur &lt;br/&gt;include support for the popular MapReduce style of distributed &lt;br/&gt;processing and other efficiency improvements to make it practical &lt;br/&gt;to do research on large web datasets 'out of the box' in common &lt;br/&gt;computer hardware environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new data infrastructure consists of maintenance and &lt;br/&gt;distribution of a newly created billion-page dataset, another new &lt;br/&gt;web dataset, and large, anonymized search logs that match the &lt;br/&gt;datasets. The combination of large datasets and corresponding &lt;br/&gt;large search logs enable a broad community to conduct research &lt;br/&gt;with more realistic data resources than were available &lt;br/&gt;previously. This research will lead to further advances in the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the underlying issues for large-scale, &lt;br/&gt;personalized search, which will be an important part of the next &lt;br/&gt;generation of search engines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information, see the project web site at the URL: &lt;br/&gt;http://www.lemurproject.org.</AbstractNarration>
