    <AbstractNarration>Technical. This project addresses new understanding and progress in fabricating novel nanodot and nanowire arrays of semiconductors and ferromagnets. The approach involves a multi-step process using porous alumina templates, and is being studied for precise control of nanopatterns and its use in fabrication of novel nanoarrays. Synthesis and processing phenomena associated with the fabrication of vertically heterostructured, ferromagnet/semiconductor nanodevices based on MBE-grown III-V semiconductors and Heusler alloys will be pursued. Nanowires of GaAs have been achieved via MBE using Au-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth and will be further studied on this project for growing arrays of hybrid nanowires composed of ferromagnetic (e.g., MnAs) and semiconducting materials. A wide range of experimental tools and expertise will be utilized for systematic investigations aimed at gaining greater fundamental understanding of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of nanostructured materials and devices. &lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. There is potential that the research could substantially impact the development of novel electronic devices such as nonvolatile memories and nanowire electronic circuits. Development of novel nanostructures could even open doors to new device designs never before contemplated. Educating and training young people in the areas of electronic, magnetic and optical nanostructures--areas which are crucial for future applications in information technology is of primary importance to this project. In addition to training students in diverse aspects of science and engineering, this project couples with existing educational outreach to K-12 students, women, and underrepresented groups through activities in programs already established at Northeastern University with active participation by these PIs. Four to eight undergraduates will contribute to the research through Northeastern's unique Co-op program, and high school students will be involved in summer research programs.</AbstractNarration>
