    <AbstractNarration>This research will develop methods for the detection and monitoring of engineered nanomaterials in aquatic systems. Advanced low-invasive fractionation techniques will be refined to fractionate across the nanoscale (e.g. between 2 and 450 nm). Elemental distributions, size and charge distributions, as well as isotopic signatures and morphology, will be explored among various sources of engineered and other nanomaterials. Critical steps in the research include developing a new analytical methodology (SPLITT) that splits elements into dissolved versus particulate fractions. Research will explore to what extent SPLITT fractionates nanomaterials that have equilibrated with aquatic media. It will also examine the optimal fields for different nanomaterial sources, and to what extent composition, size, and charge distributions affects differentiation: (a) between natural and incidental/engineered nanomaterials and (b) among various sources of a nanoparticle class. The research will determine to what extent existing manufacturing processes produce nanomaterials with distinct isotopic signatures relative to natural and incidental nanomaterials and among various sources of a nanoparticle class. Broader impacts of this work include significant outreach to students and teachers at the K-12 level. It also supports an investigator at an institution in an EPSCOR state.</AbstractNarration>
