    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Marist College technology research lab provides students and faculty access to cutting edge technologies for research and research training projects. It supports applied research projects with industry and academic partners and also provides a research training environment for over 600 members of the Enterprise Computing Community that was formed through a NSF CPATH award.&lt;br/&gt;Faculty members use the facilities to conduct research in a wide variety of STEM areas, including mathematical modeling of ocean currents and wave propagation, data mining for the detection and prevention of errors in the coding of medical diagnoses, application of computationally intensive routines to address problems in classical thermodynamics, and exploration of the use of cutting edge large system technologies such as virtualization and cloud computing to help small to medium-sized companies become more efficient and cost effective. &lt;br/&gt;Many of the research questions explored in the new lab are introduced by industry partners. These applied research collaborations are aimed at solving real-world business problems. Undergraduates and graduate students also benefit by learning the discipline of inquiry based research and experience the rigor of scientific methods and practices. Students learn firsthand how to apply new skills through their participation in research projects with faculty as well as academic and industry partners. &lt;br/&gt;Researchers will disseminate their findings through peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national conferences. Students will also present their work at both regional and national conferences. Applied research results will bring practical benefits to individual companies and by extension to the marketplace.</AbstractNarration>
