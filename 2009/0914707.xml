    <AbstractNarration>The "Increasing Diversity in Earth Sciences (IDES)" project is the first partnership of its kind in the state of Oregon, involving community colleges, a research university with major strengths in Earth Science research and education and an institutionalized commitment to enhancing diversity, along with state and federal agencies, and centers of informal education. The project has two integrated goals: to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who pursue careers in Earth Science research and education, and to strengthen the understanding of Earth Sciences and their relevance to society among broad and diverse segments of the population. IDES is built around a proven model of tiered mentoring, an interactive student cohort, research and education internships, and financial support. This 4-year program will recruit 15 students (mainly rising juniors) each year for four years (60 students in all) from science majors at Oregon State University and five partner Oregon community colleges. The program will reach its goals by implementing a plan to prepare participants in IDES for success in the Earth Sciences through training in the application of geospatial technologies to Earth Science problems of personal relevance and participation in a two-year mentored research project that will culminate in internships with academic units, state and federal agencies, and centers for informal education in Oregon. IDES participants will gain knowledge of potential career paths through contact with Earth Science professionals as mentors, a professional internship, and a learning community that includes a speaker series, which provides personal connections, role models and direct work experience. An extentsive outreach and public education campaign will instill an understanding of the context and relevance of the Earth Science Enterprise to the participants, their families, their communities.</AbstractNarration>
