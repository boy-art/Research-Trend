    <AbstractNarration>A wireless summer school workshop is to be held on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) for one week in August 2009. Wireless communications and networking has been a topic of intense research activity in recent years. There is a general consensus that cross-layer design of protocols would help improve wireless network performance. With the goal of facilitating cross-layer research, the topics of the lectures at the summer school workshop are chosen to provide the attendees exposure to developments in theory, practice, physical layer, and higher layers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school workshop will provide an opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to gain a better understanding of a broad range of issues that affect the design of wireless systems. Attendance at the workshop by women and minority students will be encouraged. It is expected that the summer school workshop will improve the quality of future research output by the graduate students. Attendance at the summer school will also help the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students gain a better understanding of the research challenges in the area of wireless systems and to motivate them for higher studies. The interactions between the attendees at the symposium may also lead to future collaborations between different attendees.</AbstractNarration>
