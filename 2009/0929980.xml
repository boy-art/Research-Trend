    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program will support an international workshop on Desorption Induced by Electronic Transitions (DIET), which will convene on April 19-23, 2009 in Pine Mountain, GA. The workshop is co-chaired by Prof. Thomas Orlando of Georgia Institute of Technology and Prof. Ulrike Diebold of Tulane University. It will bring together physicists, chemists, material scientists, planetary scientists and biologists to address recent theoretical and experimental advances in the study of desorption and surface dynamics induced by electronic transitions. These events are important in photo conversion and photovoltaics, nano-scale fabrication of device materials, radiation induced alteration of surfaces and the development of novel surface spectroscopic techniques, which are useful in material science and biology. The workshop will be in honor of the late Prof. Theodore Madey, a pioneer in the study of surface physics/chemistry and DIET processes. The award will enable the participation of 40 undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows of whom many are from under represented groups, in the planned workshop.</AbstractNarration>
