    <AbstractNarration>Victor Batista of Yale University is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational chemistry program to continue the development of computational methods and applications to investigate photo-induced quantum reaction dynamics in systems of biological and technological interest. The PI and his research group focus on photoinduced isomerization dynamics in photochromic compounds and molecular switches that have been studied by high-resolution gas-phase and solution spectroscopy. The projects include collaborations with Nibbering (Max-Born Institut) and Yan (Yale University) in a joint experimental and theoretical effort to characterize the nature of ultrafast phototransduction mechanisms at the detailed molecular level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program is integrated with the continued development of Wikidchem, established by the PI and co-workers to facilitate the dissemination of new pedagogical approaches, research findings, and software developments on the World Wide Web, as well as with the Science, Technology and Research Scholars (STARS) program to foster the participation of underrepresented minority students in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OISE has contributed funds for international travel.</AbstractNarration>
