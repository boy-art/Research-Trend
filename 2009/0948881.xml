    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of this award is to support U.S. students and researchers to participate in the biennial International Symposium on Plasma Chemistry, ISPC-2011, to be held July 24-29, 2011, at the Lowes Hotel in Philadelphia. Funding is provided to provide partial support for up to 40 US graduate and postdoctoral students for travel expenses, lodging, and registration fees while attending the conference. Some portion of the funding is planned also to be used to extend participation of specialists from industry to intensify university/industry collaborations in the field of plasma chemistry. To qualify, the digest of a research paper must be submitted to the International Organizing Committee, accompanied by a personal letter describing the past, current and future research and by a letter of support from the student?s scientific advisor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biennial forum is organized by the International Society of Plasma Chemistry, focusing on both the fundamental science and advanced applications of plasmas in this field. Its charter is to be a forum for exchange of the state-of-the-art achievements in plasma chemistry and also a tutorial environment for those new to the field. As such, ISPC-2011 will bring together leading authorities, as well as beginning researchers, engineers and scientists, in the field of Plasma Chemistry. Invited speakers will come from industry and universities in the US, Canada, South and Central America, western and eastern Europe, Russia, Japan, China, and southeast Asia. It is expected that up to 1,000 scientists and engineers will attend the symposium. The expectation is to have at least 250 students and young researchers at ISPC-2011. About 100 to 150 of them will be from the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts are in technology and education. The conference is intended to aid a range of technological advances, as described above. Educationally, the tutorial experience mentioned above is obtained through the formal lectures and poster sessions and by the opportunities the students have to interact with the leaders in the field during the informal discussion times. The symposium will also be preceded by a summer school on plasma fundamentals, generation and applications for the newcomers into the field.</AbstractNarration>
