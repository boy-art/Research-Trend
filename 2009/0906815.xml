    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charged block copolymer solution assembly will be used to construct extraordinary polymer nanostructures. The understanding of the mechanisms by which such assemblies form, and the harnessing of those processes to achieve well-defined, reproducible nanostructured materials, will be sought.&lt;br/&gt;The syntheses of, and experiments with, block copolymers based on both currently studied and new block chemistries will help produce this understanding. A fundamental understanding will be sought of the effects that multivalent, organic counterions complexing with charged corona chains of block copolymers have on the charged block conformation as well as the overall morphology formed during polymer self-assembly. The work will explore a series of multiamines towards this purpose. Likewise a series of triblock vs. diblock copolymers will be made to explore the effects of chain architecture and relative composition between blocks, as well as new hydrophobic core chemistry. The new core chemistry allows for blending experiments in order to kinetically trap multiple molecule types in the same assembled nanostructure. The new chemistries will also allow experiments to&lt;br/&gt;a) be performed in pure water as opposed to THF/H2O mixtures thus greatly simplifying assembly protocols as well as b) permit the photodegradation of hydrophobic cores for the production of potentially functional, porous polymer nanoparticles. In summary, a simple but transformative solution assembly paradigm for creation of complex polymer nanostructures for potential technology will be sought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed materials science will work towards two important needs.&lt;br/&gt;First, the technical results will help work towards making nanotechnology a reality for future technology ranging from energy to biomedical applications. More complex nanostructures are needed for future technology, and this work strives to create new methods to produce the needed nanostructure. Second, by performing the research, graduate students will be trained in scientifically rigorous, interdisciplinary environments, critical components for their future successes in the U.S. work force.&lt;br/&gt;At the undergraduate and graduate levels, collaborative scientific foundations will be developed during the proposed research by integrating educational expertise in the multi- and interdisciplinary fields of synthetic polymer chemistry, physical chemistry, polymer physics and materials science and engineering. Exchange of knowledge and expertise will be accomplished by a dynamic exchange of personnel between the University of Delaware and Texas A&amp;M University. In each of the four years of support, each of the students will engage in collaborative research by conducting site exchanges for multiple and extended periods of time. Perhaps one of the greatest possible outcomes of the proposed work is the translation of knowledge uniformly to the chemists and materials scientists/engineers involved in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal are of far reaching importance in terms of scientific advances, educational outreach, and student development through active mentorship. This collaborative research proposal constitutes a unique base for research and educational activities, each at the forefront of the fields of polymer chemistry, physical chemistry, polymer physics and materials science. The graduate students supported by this collaborative grant will be trained additionally through involvement with the development and implementation of established outreach activities in the Wooley group including K-12 educational outreach activities (assisting with the teaching of a semester-length course on hands-on experiments for K-8 teachers, educational visits to and by local pre-college students in Newark through the Materials Awareness Program or MAP), and it is expected that each student will spend up to a week per year involved in K-12 activities.</AbstractNarration>
