    <AbstractNarration>The University of California, Irvine (UCI) Schools of Physical and Biological Sciences is collaborating with the UCI Department of Education, regional school districts, community colleges, informal science centers, and industry partners to provide the infrastructure for recruiting, training, and providing professional and financial support for future mathematics and science teachers who are to teach in high-need school districts in Orange County, California. Over the five years of the grant, approximately 100 summer internships for freshman and sophomore students are to be awarded. Interns fulfill their commitment by completing academic year preparation activities, summer teaching and training with informal science centers, enrolling in funded summer classes, and cohort trainings with Noyce scholars and UCI faculty. Thirty four junior and senior students enrolled in UCI's Cal Teach 4-year STEM degree with Credential program are to receive scholarships. Scholarship recipients fulfill their commitment by completing their Cal Teach 4-year STEM degree with Credential curriculum, teacher development in-service, and online training. Twenty percent of these internships and scholarships are to be held for students from the local community colleges, all of which are minority-serving institutions. The supportive infrastructure for new teachers includes funding to California Science Teacher Association conferences, semi-annual reunions with Cal Teach and Noyce alumni and fellow new teachers, and mentoring by Cal Teach and Noyce alumni in the schools.</AbstractNarration>
