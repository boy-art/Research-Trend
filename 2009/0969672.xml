    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foremost objective of this project is to extend the local representation of the&lt;br/&gt;characteristic classes of noncommutative spaces to the more intricate spaces &lt;br/&gt;described by the spectral triples of type III introduced by Connes and the PI. The &lt;br/&gt;resulting local-global theory will be applied to the transverse geometry of&lt;br/&gt;foliations, to modular forms, Hecke operators and Rankin-Cohen brackets, and to &lt;br/&gt;the refinement of the mathematical formulation of the standard model of particle&lt;br/&gt; physics. In the process, the Hopf cyclic theory of characteristic classes for &lt;br/&gt;foliations will be extended to all classical types of transverse geometries. In a &lt;br/&gt;different direction, the concept of boundary will be incorporated in the spectral &lt;br/&gt;triple approach, and the characteristic classes of the noncommutative spaces &lt;br/&gt;with boundary will be developed by means of relative cyclic cohomology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In various branches of science, the concepts of local and global form two markedly &lt;br/&gt;different but coexisting facets of a theory, which are often correlated in an &lt;br/&gt;interesting way by a local-global principle. The present project will develop new&lt;br/&gt;tools for the implementation of this principle in the setting of noncommutative &lt;br/&gt;geometry, a modern variant of geometry inspired by quantum mechanics which&lt;br/&gt;allows for non-commuting operator-valued coordinates. Although this feature &lt;br/&gt;precludes ab initio any naive spatial conceptualization based on points, there is a &lt;br/&gt;more subtle interpretation of the notion of locality, inspired by the Bohr &lt;br/&gt;correspondence principle in quantum mechanics, which will be fully exploited. The &lt;br/&gt;proposed work will engender new connections between several fields of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and physics, thus stimulating their mutually enriching interaction.</AbstractNarration>
