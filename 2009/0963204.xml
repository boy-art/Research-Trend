    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While cryospheric research at National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) documents evidence of climate change, it is ironic that the carbon footprint of its computing systems is large. NSIDC is installing an energy-efficient, carbon footprint reduction upgrade to its research computing facility that includes reconfiguring the layout of its computer equipment; replacing conventional air conditioners with indirect evaporative cooling systems; installing a roof mounted solar power array; and upgrading connectivity to the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgraded facility positively impacts NSIDC's scientists conducting cryospheric research; assures the flow of critical data to hundreds of off-site scientists; expands NSIDC's IT systems reliability and ability to provide internet web services such as rapid data browse and online data analysis. It also illustrates several ways how similar data centers can reduce carbon footprints and sustain the cyberinfrastructure critical to future scientific activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSIDC's scientists are working on NSF, NASA, and NOAA funded research addressing the Earth's cryosphere - its snow and sea ice cover, permafrost, glaciers and ice sheets - both as a key indicator and as a driver of climate change. Science questions include: why is the Arctic's sea ice cover shrinking at a faster rate than expected; how will Arctic warming affect the permafrost and could warming lead to release of carbon presently stored in these frozen soils; and how is the Antarctic ice sheet changing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several local partners join NSIDC in this effort. An undergraduate engineering research project is evaluating this energy conservation project and will develop a website to make monitoring and design support data available to the public. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is co-authoring a technical report, to distribute the concept to other data centers across the country.</AbstractNarration>
