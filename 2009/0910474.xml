    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports Professor Jason Coym of the University of South Alabama to explore novel additives (e.g. cholesterol) for varying selectivity and retention in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Perhaps the most commonly used form of liquid chromatography, RPLC is a key method for separating analytes in solution, and is used heavily in pharmaceutical and biochemical settings. The work entails dynamically coating cholesterol onto the stationary phase, as a simpler and more flexible alternative to typical covalent linkage. A parallel aim is to use cholesterol-enhanced and lipid-coated phases as membrane mimics for studies of biopartitioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of unique chromatographic selectivities, and the ability to easily modulate selectivity, is of broad interest to analytical and bioanalytical chemists. Students working on this project will gain knowledge and practice working with chromatography, physical chemistry, and biochemistry, thereby coming to realize the interdependence of the various disciplines of chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
