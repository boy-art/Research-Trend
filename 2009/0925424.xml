    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop broadband dielectric spectrometers with 1-10 nm planar nanofluidic channels for the study of confinement effects of fluids and molecules. The approach is to use wet etch of native silicon dioxide and wafer bonding to form nanofluidic channels and to use doped silicon as transmission lines to provide broadband characterization capabilities. Parasitic signal de-embedding procedures for accurate measurement will be developed. The obtained spectrometer will be used to study confined water properties under DC electric fields. The measured water properties will also serve to demonstrate the functionality of the developed spectrometers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits: This is the first effort to integrate broadband dielectric spectroscopy with individual nanofluidic channels. The obtained critical channel dimension approaches 1 nm, which is vital for studying confined fluids and confined molecules. The measured dielectric properties of confined water under DC electric field stresses have also not been reported to date. These results are important to verify models in molecular dynamics studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The dielectric spectrometers are powerful new tools for use in biology, chemistry, nanofluidic electronics, health science and tribology. Transformational research results are expected in these areas with the developed spectrometers. Social, economical and environmental impacts include novel analytical instruments for health services and high performance electrochemical capacitors, which is critical for electric cars to mitigate energy challenges and greenhouse gas emissions. The integration of research and teaching will enrich high-speed circuit courses, inspire and attract students of diverse backgrounds into the science and engineering disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
