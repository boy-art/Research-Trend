    <AbstractNarration>CBET 0903742&lt;br/&gt;S. Saha&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the 5th International Conference on Ethical Issues in Biomedical Engineering that will be hosted by The SUNY Downstate Medical Center in collaboration with the Polytechnic Institute of New York during April 3-5, 2009. The conference will bring together faculty, researchers and students in the rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of biomedical engineering to discuss the challenging ethical issues faced by biomedical engineers in their research and practice. Biomedical engineering is responsible for many of the dramatic advances in modern medicine. However, biomedical technology has also contributed to dilemmas and has challenged some of our moral values. These include ethical issues in stem cell research &amp; cloning, privacy and bioinformatics, nanobiotechnology, conflicts of interest, allocation of scarce resources, research misconduct, animal experimentation, clinical trials and marketing of new medical devices and many other new emerging issues. In addition to the conference sessions, there will be two panel discussions (1) Surgeon-Industry Interactions: Ethical Challenges and (2) Ethics Education in Biomedical Engineering. The conference will raise awareness and will promote discussions on ethical issues in the broader and interdisciplinary field of Biomedical Engineering. The conference is expected to have a broad spectrum of attendees (faculty, scientists, philosophers, students, physicians, lawyers and industry representatives).</AbstractNarration>
