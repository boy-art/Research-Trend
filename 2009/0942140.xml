    <AbstractNarration>Computing-Others (35)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embedded systems play more and more important roles in all aspects of our society. The rapid growth of embedded systems has resulted in a shortage of professionals for embedded software development. This project is creating a new model of embedded systems education with the following emphasis: (1) Portable and affordable. The developed courseware is providing portable real labs based on a popular microcomputer unit development kit that is expandable and affordable. This removes the barrier of setting up high cost embedded systems labs; (2) Modular and flexible. The courseware and projects that are being developed are modular and have multiple learning levels. The modular design gives instructors the flexibility to adopt the full course or integrate selected modules based on their specific needs. The proposed modules and projects are infusing modern technology of embedded software to promote students' creativity and to inspire life-long learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This courseware is delivered in an integrated package including a supporting textbook bundled with a portable embedded system development kit. The courseware is providing a "ready-to-adopt" model and greatly saves resources and time for broadening embedded systems education to meet emerging workforce and education needs in science, technology, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portable and modular design of this new courseware is benefiting a wide range of universities and colleges that have a for need of embedded systems education but are hindered by limited financial budget, lab facilities, and scarce dedicated staff and faculty. This project includes an academic community that has eight institutions from five states.</AbstractNarration>
