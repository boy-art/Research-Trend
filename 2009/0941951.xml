    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12) The Discovery Chemistry (DC) pedagogical approach is being incorporated into the Honors General Chemistry (107H/207H) sequence at Skidmore College. CHEM 107H is being revised by implementing all new laboratory experiences that use inquiry-based protocols and result in large data sets. In a method that mimics authentic scientific inquiry, the laboratory results form the basis for classroom instruction. Additionally, the PI is developing a novel, laboratory-based course in forensic chemistry (CHEM 207H). Laboratory exercises in this course are challenging students to develop a holistic understanding of chemical methodology and will culminate in a simulated forensic investigation. A thorough, multi-pronged assessment plan involving both quantitative and qualitative methods is being employed. Baseline data on student attitudes, learning, and engagement before the implementation of DC as well as both formative and summative data are being collected. Benchmarks for success include increased numbers of students progressing from CHEM 107H to CHEM 207H; increased numbers of students progressing from CHEM 207H to further science courses; improved retention and progression of students from populations typically under-represented in the sciences, improved student attitudes about science; and better results on three measures of student learning. The implementation of the proposed work is having significant impacts for students beyond those enrolled in the CHEM 107H/207H sequence. A workshop on the implementation and assessment of DC will encourage region-wide discussions of pedagogical innovation by inviting chemistry faculty from all of the two-year and four-year institutions in the greater Albany/Capital District as well as AP Chemistry teachers from six local high schools.</AbstractNarration>
