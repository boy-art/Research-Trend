    <AbstractNarration>With the steady increase of discovery of new anthropogenically generated nanomaterials with novel properties and the increase in their use in consumer products and manufacturing, periodic assessments of the state-of-the-art in the fate and transport of nanomaterials in the environment is essential. This workshop responds to this need by bringing together stakeholders and experts from academia, industry, the government, and non-profit consumer advocate groups to discuss the state of the field. This workshop sheds light on where we are in terms of understanding how human-engineered nanomaterials react with natural materials in the environment, the mechanisms and extent to which they are transported from their point of release to their final resting place, and how we detect and characterize them and their interactions in air, soil, and water. The workshop also focuses on identifying gaps in our present knowledge and looming challenges that need to be addressed in the next decade. Broader impacts of the workshop include engaging in dialog a diverse group of stakeholders that do not generally communicate with each other. Broad participation by the public and other interested parties is fostered via live broadcast of the meeting over the Internet. Conveners have also been sensitive to diversity in terms of selecting steering committee members and forum speakers.</AbstractNarration>
