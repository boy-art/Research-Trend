    <AbstractNarration>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) consists of 4 km baseline detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, and an additional 2 km detector in Hanford. LIGO's operating principle is to use precision laser interferometry to measure the relative motion of seismically-isolated test mass mirrors due to the extremely small forces from gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by distant astrophysical events. Louisiana State University (LSU) is located approximately 40 km from LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO) and has a long-term collaborative relationship with LIGO as a member of the LIGO Scientic Collaboration. The LSU group is heavily involved in the Detector Characterization group, the Calibration Committee, and the groups searching for gravitational waves from Coalescing Binary Compact systems, and for waveform-independent searches for Burst signals. In a broad context, the funded activities involve LSU faculty, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates at LIGO, bringing LSU people the benefits of working with experienced LIGO and LIGO Scientic Collaboration (LSC) scientists, and with apparatus that allows an excellent possibility of signicant scientic discovery. LSU shares its libraries, networking facilities, and workshops. LIGO personnel participate in the LSU Physics and Astronomy departments' colloquia and astrophysics discussion groups, and often work directly with students. This impact on LLO, a close and extensive relationship with a nearby research university, is expected to be strengthened with continued collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this award provides funds to(1) Characterize LIGO data to be taken in 2009-2010 with Enhanced Detectors (S6 science run), monitoring the noise characteristics and short transients; (2) Continue contributions to the detector calibration team for the calibration of data in S6 with Enhanced LIGO, developing methods to improve the precision of the calibration and the monitoring of systems changes in time that affect calibration; (3) Search the LIGO data to be taken in S6 for inspiraling compact objects, and for unmodeled burst sources; (4) Contribute to reducing the technological risk in the Advanced LIGO upgrade by participating in the commissioning, and performance studies of optical readout and seismic isolation systems in Enhanced LIGO.</AbstractNarration>
