    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UTeach model is transforming the STEM teacher education program at the University. Features of intellectual merit include developing compact four-year degree programs that include both a content degree in mathematics, physics, biology or chemistry and teaching licensure. This is being accomplished by melding education coursework with science, engineering, mathematics, and technology content. Free one-credit courses and paid summer internships provide early and continuing opportunities for STEM-area freshman and sophomores to learn about STEM teaching as a career. Juniors and seniors who commit to becoming Noyce Scholars receive $10,000 per year. The Scholars complete field experiences in local, high-need schools that have student populations that will expose the student teachers to an environment that mirrors that anticipated at the first teaching job. New teachers receive ongoing support through graduate coursework and professional development opportunities, visits from UTeach Master teachers, and a dedicated online community for ongoing discussions and networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this new model for teacher preparation breaks with the traditional college of education program, it retains all of the important features including research-based theories for delivering content in the urban classroom, including culturally relevant pedagogy and teaching students with exceptionalities. A total of 20 new STEM teachers are being prepared by this UTeach Model. The University is the first institution in Ohio to implement the UTeach model and promises to have broad impact because the Chancellor of the University System of Ohio has indicated interest in expanding this model to other state institutions. Partners in this effort include the National Math and Science Initiative, the UTeach Institute, the Ohio STEM Learning Network, and the Cleveland Metropolitan School District.</AbstractNarration>
