    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Michael C. Heaven of Emory University and his research group will investigate unusual bonding mechanisms in (1) beryllium clusters containing 3 - 30 Be atoms, and (2) the interactions between beryllium oxide (BeO) and rare gas atoms (helium, neon and argon). The ultimate aim of these studies is to develop a better understanding of the unusual modes of bonding that are not well-characterized in terms of conventional models, and to advance our understanding of bonding when clusters grow from a few atoms in size to large systems that approach bulk metal behavior. The BeO rare gas studies will address intriguing theoretical results that predict unusually strong bonds involving normally inert rare gas elements. A variety of experimental tools will be employed, including photodetachment spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence, resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization, and cavity ring-down spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from these studies will help chemists to develop a deeper understanding of bonding that encompasses the traditional models of bonding as well as the unusual interactions that are one of the themes of the present study. The research will provide the graduate and undergraduate students, and post-doctoral associates involved with a rich experience in advanced experimental and theoretical methods. A collaboration will be established with Spelman College, to expand the research experience to students from a historically Black women's college.</AbstractNarration>
