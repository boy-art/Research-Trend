    <AbstractNarration>Now in its second year, the BUGCAT is a venue where algebra and topology graduate students in all stages of their research can present their work and meet other mathematicians with related research interests. It encourages participation from a diversity of schools. The conference organizing committee, all graduate students, is remarkably diverse in gender, ethnicity, and&lt;br/&gt;background, and hence is well positioned to encourage participation by women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year it will be a two-day conference (Nov. 14-15, 2009) on the Binghamton University campus. Participants will include graduate students at all levels. Speakers will be selected based on status as graduate student, postdoc, or professor; relevance of the talk to the algebra and topology theme; and time of registration. Speakers will be chosen with the intent of representing each school from which a&lt;br/&gt;speaker applies, but if there is not space, quality of talk content will be considered. Graduate students will give at least 75% of the presentations, and in total there will be 50 thirty-minute presentations delivered by participants. There will also be two keynote speakers, one in algebra&lt;br/&gt;and one in topology.</AbstractNarration>
