    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Almost all living cells in the human body contain whip-like appendages called primary cilia. These structures serve as cellular antennas that sense the external environment, detect signals, and transmit this information to the cell nucleus, which then responds appropriately according to the signals it receives. This project uses the single celled green alga Chlamydomonas as the model system to study how cilia are assembled and function. The two flagella of Chlamydomonas are analogous in almost all respects to primary cilia in humans. Cells assemble and disassemble their cilia (and flagella) during each round of cell division. Cells that are unable to disassemble their cilia cannot divide properly, and cells that cannot construct cilia cannot sense the environment properly. This project is directed at understanding the factors that are important in controlling the process of ciliary disassembly that occurs prior to each cell division. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project will provide several educational opportunities for students at different levels: (a) Undergraduate students will become involved in original research, an activity that is consistent with data showing that undergraduate research experiences increase learning and foster deeper commitment by the participants. In addition to deriving strong growth and development benefits, students gain a much greater understanding of the career options open to them. (b) A graduate student will participate as part of his/her thesis research leading to the Ph. D. (c) Advanced high school biology students from Hartford (VT) High School will visit the lab and be exposed to these experiments and the microscopic techniques used to observe cells with cilia. Through collaboration with Dartmouth's Office of Outreach, this project will be described to the local communities through a series of informal events called "science cafes". To achieve broad dissemination of relevant findings from this project Dartmouth's Office of Public Affairs will communicate new findings and significant publications to the news media as appropriate.</AbstractNarration>
