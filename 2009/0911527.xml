    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Douglas Vander Griend of Calvin College for the in situ characterization of multi-component chemical solutions. Equilibrium Restricted Factor Analysis, a mathematical technique for modeling such complex solutions, allows information to be ascertained about the number and nature of specific chemical species without the need to chemically isolate them. This approach employs spectrophotometric titrations in the study of: 1) step-by-step assembly processes for supramolecular cubes based on 1st row transition metals, 2) precise thermodynamic interactions between the parts of a pseudo-rotaxane nanomachine, and 3) nickel complexes which demonstrate thermochromic properties. Like many potential applications in chemistry today, these systems showcase different types of molecular organization that can be difficult to characterize by conventional means. The proposed thermochromic windows that tint in response to sunlight are expected to lead to substantial energy savings. Undergraduates at all levels will work with Professor Vander Griend to learn a plethora of laboratory skills and develop chemical intuition through comprehensive involvement in the project. These students also regularly interact with collaborators at graduate and industrial laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
