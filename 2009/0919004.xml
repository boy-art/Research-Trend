    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a Doctoral Consortium to be held in conjunction with the 2009 Conference on Communities and Technologies, June 24-27, 2009. The Communities and Technologies (C&amp;T) conference addresses communities as social entities comprised of actors who share something in common. Further, C&amp;T addresses the ways that computing and communication technologies influence, enable or hinder, communities and the actions that they take. The Doctoral Consortium focuses on the intellectual contributions of the diverse set of doctoral students who are competitively selected to attend. The Doctoral Consortium will help build a future set of community informatics researchers by providing an intellectually intense pre-conference event that attracts and energizes a key set of faculty advisors and doctoral candidates. The Doctoral Consortium will build on the diversity of community informatics researchers and help establish their connection to the broader computing research community. Developing this diversity is valuable for the NSF and for the vitality of the CISE/IIS research community.</AbstractNarration>
