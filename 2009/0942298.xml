    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Materials Science (57)&lt;br/&gt;This project is modifying a sophomore level introductory materials science course to enable every student in the class to benefit from a one-semester undergraduate research experience. The key premise of the project is that by using modern pedagogies and team-based research projects a scalable and sustainable model can be developed for universal undergraduate research experiences that does not require one-on-one mentoring. By implementing this approach during the sophomore year, the project also seeks to improve engineering student retention. The specific objectives of the course reform are to (1) to improve the learning process in an introductory materials science course by emphasizing active learning pedagogies, (2) to allow the development of scientific reasoning skills and to provide students with direct experience in the scientific process, and (3) to increase the interest of sophomore undergraduate students in science/engineering and materials science. The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an independent evaluator. The evaluation plan includes an advisory board consisting of representatives from seven institutions that are interested in adopting the revised course materials and pedagogical approach. The project's results are being disseminated through conferences and journal publications and through professional societies.</AbstractNarration>
