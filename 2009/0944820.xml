    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel membrane for hydrocarbon separations. The initial focus of the project is the development of a selective membrane for efficient separation of hydrocarbons from methane in natural gas processing and separation of hydrocarbons from hydrogen in refinery applications. The chemically robust polymeric membrane will be of a composite configuration comprised of a hollow fiber porous support with a superimposed separation layer that is several hundred angstroms thick. The nano-structured morphology of the separation layer will enable selective fractionation of hydrocarbon molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be reduced energy consumption in separation and purification of hydrocarbons in oil, gas, and petrochemical industries. The environmental benefit is the associated reduction in emissions of green house gases methane and carbon dioxide. The technology will effect molecular level separation of hydrocarbons and will be capable of operation in harsh environments and high temperatures. A large initial market with an immediate impact for hydrocarbon selective membrane technology is the recovery of natural gas and hydrocarbon liquids from associated natural gas (gas generated during oil production) currently flared at remote geographic locations. Development of the proposed technology will enable recovery of the methane and high value hydrocarbons at the well with extensive economic and environmental benefits. The membrane is expected to find broad utility in high value gas and liquid separation applications including hydrogen recovery from refinery fuel gas, olefin/paraffin separation and generic hydrocarbon fractionation.</AbstractNarration>
