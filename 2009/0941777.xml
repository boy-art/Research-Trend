    <AbstractNarration>Earth Systems Science (40)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates shallow geophysical data collection, analysis, and interpretation into the Geoenvironmental Studies curricula. The approach differs from models implemented at other institutions by focusing on undergraduate education and by incorporating geophysical technology in multiple geography and geology courses and in individual student research experiences. The project builds on past programs that developed field learning opportunities in surface watershed processes, and is integrating investigations made possible through Ground Penetrating Radar, Electrical Resistivity, and Electromagnetic Imaging in multiple courses via construction of a "curriculum bridge". The project design incorporates studies of local geology, including investigations of karst terrains (sinkhole development, losing streams, caves, springs), complex hydrogeologic settings (surface water-groundwater interaction in variable geologic materials), structural controls (faults, variations in lithology, etc.) of hydrology, and management issues (wellhead protection, site development, landfill leachate monitoring). This project provides opportunities for hundreds of students (over several years) to acquire advanced technical and quantitative skills for conceptualizing and addressing complex environmental problems, builds critical skills related to problem conceptualization, analysis, and solution, exposes students to the temporal and spatial context of field data collection, and provides opportunities to understand the theoretical basis as well as the practical capabilities and limitations of the various geophysical field methods used. The project incorporates formative and summative evaluations to measure the success of the "curriculum bridge" approach it utilizes. Project outcomes, including curricular/instructional materials, results of student research projects, and the evaluation results are being disseminated via the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) website, a special session on geophysics in undergraduate education at a Geological Society of America (GSA) meeting, a series of regional community workshops, and by presentations and publications by undergraduates and faculty members in appropriate venues.</AbstractNarration>
