    <AbstractNarration>This project will explore the development of new methods for the formation of C-C and C-N bonds via platinum-catalyzed C-H activation reactions. Although platinum complexes are known to mediate C-H activation to form alkyl-platinum or aryl-platinum species, few studies have been directed toward formation of C-C or C-N bonds from these intermediates. Development of new platinum-mediated methods for formation of C-C and C-N bonds from direct functionalization of C-H bonds will be undertaken. The reaction mechanism will be elucidated and the new methods will be employed in the synthesis of complex molecules. Applications of these new reactions in the synthesis of natural products will be performed by Professor He's Chinese collaborator, Professor Yong-Qiang Tu, of Lanzhou University. Professor Tu's work is separatately supported by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This International Collaborations in Chemistry award, funded by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering, will support the work of Professor Chuan He, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago. Professor He's research efforts revolve around the development of facile C-H activation methods for the formation of C-C and C-N bonds. Such chemistry will contribute to energy efficient and environmentally benign synthesis of various chemical and pharmaceutical agents.</AbstractNarration>
