    <AbstractNarration>0954990&lt;br/&gt;Corr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated research and education CAREER proposal is focused to understand the role of fiber network architecture on overall tissue function, and thus establish the structure-function relationship. In the PI's scaffold-free approach, the natural ability of cells to grow and create their own extracellular matrix is harnessed, using geometric constraint, to form functional single fibers. This bottom-up approach will be utilized to create and tune fibers that will serve as building blocks for muscle-tendon structures, in which the architecture can be specified to fiber-level precision. The mechanical characterization of these muscle-tendon structures, when coupled with fiber-based theoretical modeling, will provide insight required to establish the structure-function relationship.&lt;br/&gt;The key novelties to this approach are: (1) scaffold-free engineering and mechanical evaluation of single fibers formed by directed cell growth, and (2) building functional muscle-tendon structures to precise fiber-level architecture. This represents a fundamental shift in tissue engineering approach; one necessary to create functional muscle-tendon units in which both muscle and tendon fiber architecture dictate the physiological and biomechanical function of the structure. &lt;br/&gt;This research program will utilize a scaffold-free approach to engineer muscle and tendon fibers by directing the growth of myoblasts and fibroblasts using geometric constraints to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) develop a fundamental understanding of the influence of environmental stimuli on cellular growth and fiber formation, in both muscle and tendon. &lt;br/&gt;(2) determine set(s) of bioreactor parameters for optimal muscle and tendon fiber performance&lt;br/&gt;(3) characterize the influence of fiber and crimp geometry on crimped engineered tendon fibers viscoelastic low-load and failure properties, using theoretical modeling and experimentation. &lt;br/&gt;(4) create functional muscle-tendon structures with fiber-level architectural fidelity to achieve the desired mechanical performance, as guided by theoretical modeling simulations.&lt;br/&gt;(5) establish the structure-function relationship for engineered muscle-tendon structures; including the contributions of each tissue, and compatibility at the muscle-tendon interface.&lt;br/&gt;The research will be complemented by integrated educational projects at the graduate, undergraduate and K-12 academic levels, both within Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and as educational outreach. The latest research findings and methods will be incorporated into 3 graduate/undergraduate hybrid courses currently taught or co-taught by the PI, and a related 5-week lab experiment will be developed for the Cell &amp; Tissue Engineering track of the Biomedical Engineering Laboratory course. Tissue engineering knowledge gained will be integrated into the PI's ongoing undergraduate (BIR Workshop) and K-12 (Design Your Future Day) outreach seminars. Furthermore, the PI will introduce a week-long biomaterials module into the summer American Society of Materials "Materials Day Camp", using an interactive series of hands-on experiments to establish the structure-function relationship of collagen networks present in soft tissues.</AbstractNarration>
