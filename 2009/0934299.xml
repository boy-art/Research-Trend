    <AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Electromagnetic Compatibility &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0934299 Clemson University; Todd Hubing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clemson University (CU) seeks to join the existing I/UCRC "Electromagnetic Compatibility" consisting of the Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST) and the University of Houston (UH). MST is the lead institution of the proposed Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is an essential feature of virtually all high speed digital electronic assistants and home entertainment centers to essential control and information processing systems. EMC is the ability of these electronic systems to function reliably without causing interference to other electronic systems, being overly sensitive to weak signals generated by other electronic systems, and generating signals in one part of the system interfering with the operation of another part of the same system. The PI's move to CU and the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR) provides a unique opportunity to significantly expand the automotive research being done. The CU-ICAR faculty and facilities will help attract new center memberships representing the automotive, aerospace, and industrial automation industries. The Clemson Vehicular Electronics Laboratory has helped more than a dozen companies address EMC-related problems through research projects, consulting and short courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will encourage collaboration amongst the institutions, and is committed to providing a skilled and diverse workforce in the area of EMC as required by industry. The research will expose students and faculty to state-of-the-art research projects of value to the industry. Much of the material developed as a result of the research performed by the university participants has been incorporated into short courses, and CU intends to use some parts of this short course to address diversity by improving its recruiting of underrepresented groups among the graduate student population. CU also intends to develop some demonstrations suitable for K-12 programs designed to interest high school students in technical careers. In September 2008, CU was honored at the National Role Models Conference in Arlington, VA for its success in several high-profile diversity programs.</AbstractNarration>
