    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to discover novel foundational principles&lt;br/&gt;for developing highly-efficient and reliable software that can achieve&lt;br/&gt;sustainable performance on the exascale computing platforms expected by&lt;br/&gt;2020. Such platforms will deliver three orders of magnitude beyond&lt;br/&gt;today?s systems; harnessing this raw computational power could&lt;br/&gt;revolutionize our modeling and understanding of critical phenomena in&lt;br/&gt;areas like climate modeling, energy, medicine, sustainability,&lt;br/&gt;cosmology, engineering design, and massive-scale data analytics. Yet,&lt;br/&gt;developing software for exascale systems is a tremendous challenge&lt;br/&gt;because the hardware is complex and it is not believed that the most&lt;br/&gt;productive ?high-level? software development environments (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;programming languages and libraries) will be able to effectively exploit&lt;br/&gt;these exascale systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator aims to address this challenge by using automated&lt;br/&gt;tuning (autotuning) to eliminate the low performance traditionally&lt;br/&gt;associated with high-level programming models. This research (a)&lt;br/&gt;develops new model-driven frameworks for tuning parallel algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;data structures, going beyond existing techniques that focus on&lt;br/&gt;low-level code tuning; and (b) studies autotuning for programs expressed&lt;br/&gt;in high-level programming models, with the aim of eliminating the&lt;br/&gt;performance gap. Concomitant with this research, the PI will create a&lt;br/&gt;new practicum course: The HPC Garage. The HPC Garage physically&lt;br/&gt;co-locates interdisciplinary teams in a social collaborative lab space;&lt;br/&gt;the teams engage in a year-long competition, called the XD Prize, to&lt;br/&gt;develop highly scalable algorithms and software for NSF TeraGrid?s&lt;br/&gt;next-generation XD facilities. The HPC Garage also hosts summer interns&lt;br/&gt;in Georgia Tech?s Computing Research Undergraduate Intern Summer&lt;br/&gt;Experience (CRUISE) program, whose mission is to encourage students,&lt;br/&gt;especially those from underrepresented groups, to pursue graduate&lt;br/&gt;degrees in computing.</AbstractNarration>
