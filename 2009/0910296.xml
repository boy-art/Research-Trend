    <AbstractNarration>Whole genome duplication, also known as polyploidy, has occurred many times during the evolution of a wide variety of organisms, including most valuable crops, and may be a critical mechanism for the evolutionary origin of novel traits. The genetic mechanisms and evolutionary forces that govern the fate of newly duplicated genes, and how these forces lead to broad-scale genomic changes are unknown. This study will utilize ultra high-throughput DNA sequencing technology to test specific hypotheses regarding evolution in polyploids in the emerging model wildflower genus Mimulus. The genomic and phenotypic evolution that has taken place in naturally-occurring polyploids will be compared to experimentally-generated synthetic polyploids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide novel insight into the effects of polyploidy on ecologically-important traits, including traits affecting the survival and reproduction of organisms in relation to their environment. Because many crops are of polyploid origin, a thorough understanding of the immediate and long-term effects of polyploidy may provide promising avenues for crop improvement. The proposed research also will provide many novel avenues for talented undergraduate and high school students to conduct independent, but related research projects in ecology, evolution, genomics, and bioinformatics.</AbstractNarration>
