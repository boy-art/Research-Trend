    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will improve the structure of the Northern Tier Network (NTN) by linking North Dakota and South Dakota's NTN segments (NTN-ND and NTN-SD). NTN is a regional optical research and education network connecting institutions in thirteen states across the northwestern U.S. Connecting the South Dakota and North Dakota networks involves, acquiring a 20-year Indefeasible Right of Use (IRU) to dark fiber between NTN-ND and NTN-SD, acquiring the necessary equipment to light the new fiber between NTN-ND and NTN-SD, and upgrading NTN-SD's equipment in Aberdeen, SD where the connection to the South Dakota network is made. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples of research activities that are likely to benefit from the network connection are: high-energy physics research, when the planned Dakota Ion Accelerators for Nuclear Astrophysics and Long-Baseline Neutrino Program experiments come on line; work on improving the information content of satellite imagery involving collaborations between South Dakota State University, Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Data Center in Sioux Falls, SD, along with commercial satellite imaging companies located around the world; environmental science research in the Dakotas and elsewhere in the United States that takes advantage of network access to the remotely sensed images of the Earth's surface archived in the EROS Data Center; and real-time predictive modeling of drought, rainfall, and hail. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratories at higher education sites in South Dakota, nationally and internationally provide student research training and mentoring activities for students across a variety of disciplines that exploit network access to large data archives or supercomputing resources around the United States, including the EROS Data Center in South Dakota. In addition, the new network connection will enable scientists in South Dakota to exploit more effectively the scanning electron microscope located at North Dakota State University.</AbstractNarration>
