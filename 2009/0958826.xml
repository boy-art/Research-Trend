    <AbstractNarration>0958826&lt;br/&gt;Gryko&lt;br/&gt;Jacksonville State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary: The Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer combining Differential Scanning Calorimetry and ThermoGravimetrical Analysis (DSC/TGA) will be coupled with Perkin-Elmer mass spectrometer and FTIR to study new materials and thermal signatures of biological specimens. The materials research will focus on novel aluminum-based alloys with open-framework silicon clathrates. DSC studies of these materials provide a unique opportunity to determine phase diagrams of aluminum alloyed with two different crystallographic forms of silicon. Open silicon framework is broken at the clathrate surface resulting in a large number of Si dangling bonds, which, in turn, form strong connections with the aluminum matrix, resulting in better aluminum alloys. Furthermore, since large varieties of substituted clathrates are possible, DSC studies may result in synthesis of "designer alloys", and open new routes to tailor properties of these materials. Combined DSC/TGA-mass spectroscopy of biological samples will concentrate on thermal transitions exhibited by spores and bacteria. Main goal of these studies will be to develop new methods for fast identification of selected biological species in addition to recently developed luminescence-based approach. DSC will be also used to measure the effect of growth medium and environmental conditions on the ultrastructure of selected environmental bacterial samples. The acquisition of the DSC/TGA will make significant impact on undergraduate research and education in rural area of northeastern Alabama by expanding educational and multidisciplinary research opportunities for a diverse student population of Jacksonville State University, which is 60% female and 29% African American.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: Demand for better materials and fast identification of biological samples is increasing. Thermal analysis plays an important role in these areas. In this method, thermal response of the sample, and/or sample mass is recorded as a function of temperature. Such thermal signature is often unique for many biological specimens. In conjunction with other methods, such as optical fluorescence, thermal data allow for a fast identification of unknown spores or bacteria. Thermal analysis is also indispensible in search for and understanding of new materials. In this project, thermal methods will be used to determine stability of new class of aluminum alloys. These novel alloys are built around silicon "scaffolding" forming a silicon-reinforced aluminum. In fact, these alloys structurally are quite similar to the reinforced concrete. Since silicon scaffolding can be modified by incorporating other atoms, such as copper or nickel, these alloys can be tailored for a particular application. Hence, detailed studies of these materials could improve aluminum alloys which are widely used from aerospace industry to manufacturing household items. The acquisition of thermal analyzer will make significant impact on undergraduate research and education in rural area of northeastern Alabama by expanding educational and multidisciplinary research opportunities for a diverse student population of Jacksonville State University, which is 60% female and 29% African American.</AbstractNarration>
