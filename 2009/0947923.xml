    <AbstractNarration>Environmental science graduate students at the University of California Santa Cruz will work with teachers and students at Watsonville High School to develop and implement inquiry-based components of their Environmental Science and Natural Resources Academy curriculum. The objectives of SCWIBLES (Santa Cruz - Watsonville Inquiry-Based Learning in Environmental Sciences) are to (1) train graduate students to effectively represent the process and outcomes of ecological and evolutionary research to a culturally diverse society, and to work with diverse stakeholders to identify critical scientific needs for environmental problem solving, and (2) provide teachers with research experience and inquiry-based tools to help students become well informed natural resource stakeholders who can work with scientists to solve environmental problems in the future. The project includes a summer program for joint Fellow-Teacher research and curriculum development, a summer program to motivate student involvement in environmental sciences, mentoring year-long Senior capstone projects, and community forums to highlight student science activities and STEM-based careers. Fellows will receive specialized graduate training in educational theory and practice focused on effective science communication in a multilingual, multicultural society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental issues disproportionately affect communities of color, while professionals in environmental sciences are overwhelmingly white. SCWIBLES aims to increase the diversity in the environmental sciences by increasing the academic success and career opportunities for students in a rural public school district with &gt;75% Hispanic students and a history of under-performance. It will enhance pathways to jobs and postsecondary education in regionally important fields of agriculture, environmental management, and green technology.</AbstractNarration>
