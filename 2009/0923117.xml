    <AbstractNarration>Personal odors can be influenced by genes of the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc), which is a cluster of genes essential for immune function. These odors impact recognition and preference in mammals, lizards and fish, but whether Mhc-associated odors could play a similar role in birds is currently not known. The tube-nosed seabirds (Order: Procellariiformes: petrels and albatrosses) are an ideal group for investigating this possibility. These birds mate for life. They also have a remarkable sense of smell, and some species can tell each other apart using only odors. This latest finding suggests that personal scent may play a role in social behaviors, which, until now, has not been seriously considered in birds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To investigate this possibility further, Professor Gabrielle Nevitt, a sensory ecologist specializing in bird olfaction, has teamed up with Professor Scott Edwards, an evolutionary biologist and expert in the field of Mhc in birds. They will investigate this problem using the Leach's storm-petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) as a model system. The primary objectives of this project are: 1) To perform the first multigene characterization of Mhc class II genes, and other genes related to olfactory and immune function, in a procellariiform seabird; 2) To investigate the role of Mhc in individual scent recognition; and 3) To investigate whether Mhc is involved in life-long partner choice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results showing that birds can either detect Mhc odors or use them to choose mates would represent a paradigm shift in how biologists typically view mate choice decisions in birds. Just as importantly, many species of petrels and albatrosses are facing extinction, and understanding the factors driving mate choice will make a valuable contribution to comprehensive management plans for endangered species. Finally, the project will provide interdisciplinary training at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels, particularly for minorities and women, who will be targeted for these positions.</AbstractNarration>
