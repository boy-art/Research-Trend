    <AbstractNarration>This project is dedicated to the study of prime chains and applications,&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of integers in progressions which are the &lt;br/&gt;product of two primes, divisors of integers and of shifted primes,&lt;br/&gt;generalized Wieferich primes, and the efficiency of covering congruences. &lt;br/&gt;Prime chains are sequences of primes &lt;br/&gt;so that p|(p'-1) for each pair of consecutive primes p, p' in the sequence, e.g.&lt;br/&gt;2,5,31. We study the distribution of prime chains with a given starting&lt;br/&gt;prime, given ending prime, and chains with a given length. Applications &lt;br/&gt;are given to the height of Pratt trees, and to the distribution of arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;functions. One of the highlights of the work is the development of a &lt;br/&gt;model of prime chains with a given ending prime which is&lt;br/&gt;based on a probabilistic random fragmentation process. It is known&lt;br/&gt;that there are subtle inequities in the distribution of primes in &lt;br/&gt;arithmetic progressions with the same modulus, and we develop a parallel&lt;br/&gt;theory for number which are products of two primes, emphasizing the &lt;br/&gt;similarities and differences compared with the primes case.&lt;br/&gt;Such problems are intimately connected with the distribution of zeros&lt;br/&gt;of Dirichlet L-functions, the multiplicity of zeros being important in&lt;br/&gt;our studies. We will investigate factorization problems, such as &lt;br/&gt;the distribution of primes p so that p-1 has a divisor in a given interval,&lt;br/&gt;and the distribution of factors when integers are written as the&lt;br/&gt;product of k factors, for general k. We will improve known&lt;br/&gt;estimates for the smallest positive integer b such that&lt;br/&gt;p is a generalized Wieferich prime to base b. A set of congruence&lt;br/&gt;classes whose union is all the integers is a covering system of &lt;br/&gt;congruences. The sum S of the reciprocals of the moduli must be at least 1,&lt;br/&gt;and we study how close S can be to 1 if the moduli are distinct and&lt;br/&gt;greater than N.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions about properties of positive integers, especially the way in&lt;br/&gt;which integers factor and the distribution of prime numbers, have &lt;br/&gt;fascinated people for thousands of years and have recently found&lt;br/&gt;applications in computer science and information security.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with a number of projects about&lt;br/&gt;configurations of prime numbers, how number that are products of few &lt;br/&gt;primes are distributed in arithmetic progressions, the distribution of&lt;br/&gt;divisors of integers, and how efficient covering systems of congruences&lt;br/&gt;can be. The research projects will involve graduate assistants and&lt;br/&gt;post-docs.</AbstractNarration>
