    <AbstractNarration>An important need in the climate modeling, observational and user communities is to be able to provide climate projections at spatial and temporal scales of utility to resource managers and decision makers. Coarse resolution global climate models (GCMs) were not designed for this purpose; however, improvements in model design, computing capacity, and various strategies are being developed for this purpose. An Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) session in 2006 proposed experimental design for the next round of coordinated climate change experiments that explicitly included short-term climate predictions to be performed for assessment by the international climate modeling community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop builds upon several recent efforts including an AGCI workshop last year on decadal prediction and several on climate change, natural variability, and extremes. This workshop also builds upon a 2004 workshop aimed at bridging the gap between the modeling, scenarios, and user communities at the regional scale. It directly is a follow-up to the decadal prediction workshop held last year with the aim of engaging the user community more directly in exploring climate modeling capability now and in the near future and how this capability can be integrated into resource management.</AbstractNarration>
