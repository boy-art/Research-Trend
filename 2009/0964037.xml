    <AbstractNarration>The aim of this research is to develop new algorithms and algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;techniques for solving fundamental optimization problems on planar&lt;br/&gt;networks. Many optimization problems in networks are considered&lt;br/&gt;computationally difficult; some are even difficult to solve&lt;br/&gt;approximately. However, problems often become easier when the input&lt;br/&gt;network is restricted to be planar, i.e. when it can be drawn on the&lt;br/&gt;plane so that no edges cross each other. Such planar instances of&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems arise in several application areas, including&lt;br/&gt;logistics and route planning in road maps, image processing and&lt;br/&gt;computer vision, and VLSI chip design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators plan to develop algorithms that achieve faster&lt;br/&gt;running times or better approximations by exploiting the planarity of&lt;br/&gt;the input networks. In addition, in order to address the use of&lt;br/&gt;optimization in the discovery of some ground truth, the investigators&lt;br/&gt;will develop algorithms not just for the traditional worst-case input&lt;br/&gt;model but also for models in which there is an unusually good planted&lt;br/&gt;solution; for a model of this kind, the investigators expect to find&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that produce even more accurate answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will likely uncover new computational techniques whose&lt;br/&gt;applicability goes beyond planar networks. In the recent past, once a&lt;br/&gt;technique has been developed and understood in the context of planar&lt;br/&gt;networks, it has been generalized to apply to broader families of&lt;br/&gt;networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, new algorithms and techniques resulting from this&lt;br/&gt;research might enable people to quickly compute better solutions to&lt;br/&gt;problems arising in diverse application areas. For example, research&lt;br/&gt;in this area has already had an impact in the computer vision&lt;br/&gt;community. Further research has the potential to be useful, for&lt;br/&gt;example, in the design of networks, the planning of routes in road&lt;br/&gt;maps, the processing of images.</AbstractNarration>
