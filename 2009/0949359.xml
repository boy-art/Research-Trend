    <AbstractNarration>A primary concern of biologists is the discovery and documentation of earth's biodiversity. Documentation and investigation of the evolutionary relationships of organisms are the first steps towards understanding the origin and distribution of that diversity and what forces were involved in its generation. Lizards of the genus Anolis are model organisms for such studies in the Caribbean. This project aims to: 1) understand the evolutionary relationships of mainland (Central and South American) anoles and 2) investigate and explain the origin and distribution of this mainland lizard group. To achieve these aims, the project will collect specimens across a broad distributional range and analyze morphological and molecular data to test hypotheses of the evolution and distribution of these lizards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves graduate and undergraduate students from varied disciplines. Biology students will be trained in field and laboratory techniques, including publication and presentation of results at international meetings. Students completing a minor in Museum Studies (from diverse majors such as History, Art, and Anthropology) will be trained in the everyday tasks of museum work from managing specimens to developing exhibitions on the results of this project.</AbstractNarration>
