    <AbstractNarration>Technical Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magneto-optics Kerr effect (MOKE) for in-situ dynamic studies is an indispensable tool to probe size effects, surfaces, and interfaces of thin films and multi-layers during deposition by magnetron sputtering. This project aims to develop an instrument that will provide the capability to grow and characterize materials under controlled environment which is ideal to gain critical and fundamental understanding of optical, electronic, and magnetic properties of multifunctional materials, multiferroic materials, and filled carbon nanotubes. The proposed instrument will be developed and operated out of the Department of Physics at Morgan State University. This instrument will be used to enhance outreach programs to assure the maximum opportunity for training and research by minority students. The Unique aspect of this proposal is samples of interest prepared and studied with MOKE in-situ and ex-situ will further be studied using advanced x-ray techniques such as x-ray magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray element mapping spectrometry at the National Synchrotron Light Source of the Brookhaven National Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magneto-optics Kerr effect (MOKE) used in preparation chamber of materials is an indispensable tool in controlling the magnetic properties of materials that are useful to advance technology such as ultra high-density data storage for next generation personal computers and in developing fast, miniaturized, and reliable electronic devices. This project aims to develop an instrument that will provide capability to grow and characterize materials under controlled environment which is ideal to gain critical and fundamental understanding of optical, electronic, and magnetic properties of materials useful in all areas of science and technology. The proposed instrument will be developed and operated out of the Department of Physics at Morgan State University.
