    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI-R2) award is to acquire a driving simulator for collaborative research focusing on the relationship between the automobile driver and the road environment. As field data collection related to driver performance has become increasingly difficult due to safety issues as, a driving simulator is an alternative research approach which allows for experimental control and data collection efficiency. The driver and road environment relationships that will be investigated include roadway design, traffic operations, driver skill development, and driver distraction; all of which incorporate driver safety. The driving simulator can rapidly demonstrate road geometry or flow modifications, correlate cognitive skills with driver performance particularly involving fatigue or distraction, identify physical capabilities which limit or do not impact driver performance, and the impact of driver training. Due to the crash risk associated with older, adolescent and disabled (emotionally or physically) drivers, simulator research studies allow for the expansion of research with these populations into a critically important domain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the driving simulator will be incorporated into courses to enhance curricula, student research, and outreach activities to engage a broad spectrum of individuals, professionals and researchers. The driving simulator provides a tool to integrate traditional classroom topics into an interactive learning experience. Outreach and public education activities previously established at Ohio University will immediately be enhanced with the addition of a driving simulator interactive module. Researchers and students will also utilize the driving simulator to assist disabled individuals with sensory, such as hearing or vision, physical and mobility limitations to improve their quality of life. Research and educational efforts undertaken with the use of the driving simulator will reduce traffic fatalities and crashes thereby reducing the economic burden on society resulting from the loss of life.</AbstractNarration>
