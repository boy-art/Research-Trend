    <AbstractNarration>Award Number: 0943286&lt;br/&gt;Title: Sea Change: What Was/May Be&lt;br/&gt;Start/End Dates: November 2009-November 2012&lt;br/&gt;Program Officer: Sandra Welch&lt;br/&gt;PI: Maureen Raymo&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Trustees of Boston University&lt;br/&gt;Program: Informal Science Education (ISE)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this Communicating Research to Public Audiences project is to develop a suite of media products to raise awareness about global-warming-induced sea level rise and how scientists study it. The project will focus on Dr. Maureen Raymo's NSF funded research which looks to the Pliocene era thought to be the most recent time in geologic history with a concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere with levels as high as today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multimedia materials including video footage, photographic images, and audio recordings will be widely distributed on the internet, on kiosks in science centers, and through podcasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborations with numerous organizations will ensure widespread dissemination of the multimedia materials. Some of the collaborators include Climate Central, a new nonprofit science and media organization; Encyclopedia of Earth, a peer-review, open access electronic reference about the Earth; and Audubon magazine among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also disseminate its resources through organizations and websites that reach teachers and students in classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rockman Et Al will evaluate the project impacts conducting both formative and summative evaluations. Focus groups and online surveys will be conducted at various stages providing feedback to the project team as well as a summative evaluation of audience impacts.</AbstractNarration>
