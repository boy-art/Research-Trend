    <AbstractNarration>With the steady increase of discovery of new anthropogenically generated nanomaterials with novel properties and the increase in their use in consumer products and manufacturing, periodic assessments of the state-of-the-art and the impacts of these new materials on people and human health is essential. This workshop responds to this need by bringing together stakeholders and experts from academia, industry, the government, and non-profit consumer advocate groups to discuss the state of the field. This workshop sheds light on the where we are in terms of understanding how nanomaterials interact with cells in the human body, on advances being made in the field of nano-toxicology and metrology, and in identifying gaps in our present knowledge and looming challenges that need to be addressed in the next decade. Broader impacts of the workshop include engaging in dialog a diverse group of stakeholders that do not generally communicate with each other. Broad participation by the public and other interested parties is fostered via live broadcast of the meeting over the Internet. Conveners have also been sensitive to diversity in terms of selecting steering committee members and forum speakers.</AbstractNarration>
