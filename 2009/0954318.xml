    <AbstractNarration>The research objectives of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award are to create a model-based control method for discrete parts machining at the process level, and to show that this method can be scaled to effectively control systems of machining operations. The approach to accomplishing these objectives will be to apply model-based techniques from the chemical process industry to the control of machined parts production, and to address issues of scaling the method to control of machining networks, especially model form adaptation and changes in uncertainty with system complexity. The educational objectives of this work are to improve the instruction and experience of young technical thinkers in South Carolina, and to attract future potential researchers to pursue a graduate education in manufacturing. This will be accomplished through leveraging ongoing work with the state of South Carolina to augment the instructor education structure for the Gateway to Technology program, part of a nationwide nonprofit middle-school technology curriculum that encourages the involvement of women and minority students. The project structure includes an annual teacher workshop to communicate and demonstrate research results, as well as semiannual visiting days to the Clemson research center for middle school students to explore research hands-on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the broader impacts of this work will be more profitable machining and more competitive manufacturing of high-quality parts for automotive, aerospace and consumer products industries. The results will be promulgated through the collaborating machine tool organization and their partner network of 35 equipment companies, positively impacting manufacturing quality and profitability at a national level. Broader impacts of the educational activities will be to educate and directly expose students who are at a critical decision point in their life plan to possibilities of a research career and to establish a layered mentoring program whereby sponsored students will mentor teams of Clemson undergraduates to prepare demonstrations of the concepts. These efforts will help to improve the quality and number of engineering students available to US manufacturers.</AbstractNarration>
