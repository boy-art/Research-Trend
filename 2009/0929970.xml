    <AbstractNarration>0929970&lt;br/&gt;Amarasekara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop an efficient and environmentally sound hydrolysis method useful for the production of glucose and other fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic biomass. The glucose and other fermentable sugars produced from abundant lignocellulosic biomass provide an economical path to ethanol production. This anticipated goal would be achieved by the development of a recyclable acidic ionic liquid solvent system that can easily dissolve lignocellulosic biomass and act as the hydrolysis catalyst as well. In the initial stage of the project three different types of acidic ionic liquids will be synthesized by using 1-methylimidazole, triethanolamine and pyridine as bases. These acidic ionic liquids will be tested for their ability to dissolve cellulose under thermal, microwave, and sonication conditions. The resulting cellulose-acidic ionic liquid solutions will be then diluted with water to a critical concentration and allowed to hydrolyze by the internal -SO3H group in the ionic liquid, acting as the catalyst. Glucose and its oligomers produced in the hydrolysis will be analyzed by HPLC. Furthermore, the total reducing sugars formed will be analyzed by 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid or alkaline copper methods. In the second stage of the project acidic ionic liquids with a built-in superacid group (-CF2-SO3H) will be synthesized and then similarly tested for the dissolution and hydrolysis of cellulose to study the catalytic effect of the superacid group. In the third phase, the use of acidic/superacid ionic liquids for the dissolution and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass (corn stover, switch grass, miscanthus grass, wood chips) to fermentable sugars will be investigated. In the fourth phase of the project optimization of reaction conditions to produce the maximum yield of fermentable sugars, recovery and recycling of these acidic ionic liquids will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the project are (a) acidic/superacid ionic liquid is the solvent and the catalyst as well, therefore no waste in acid and no separation of acid catalyst is necessary (b) single step dissolution and hydrolysis under mild temperatures and atmospheric pressure (c) superacid ionic liquid is a novel concept. Broader impacts of the project are (a) participation of minorities, as this project will be carried out at Prairie View A&amp;M University, which is a historically black university (b) postdoctoral research associates, graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the project providing them professional development, research training and education (c) broad dissemination of knowledge about sustainable energy technologies by presentation of the results at conferences, group meetings, and publications in journals.</AbstractNarration>
