    <AbstractNarration>Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves are a common feature in Earth's magnetosphere. They are thought to play important roles in the formation of the radiation belts and the formation of the magnetospheric ring current that causes strong suppression of the magnetic field on the ground during magnetic storms. The waves may also play a role in such phenomena as magnetospheric substorms, sawtooth events, and steady magnetospheric convection. A key to understanding the variability of the intensities and types of ULF waves is understanding the baseline condition of the magnetosphere during magnetically quiet times. In addition to enhancing our understanding of the baseline state of the magnetosphere this project will also have significant educational benefits. The research will include a number of undergraduate students and the work will closely integrate the research being done with the education of the students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most recent sunspot minimum was an unusually quiet period that was marked by extended intervals during which the magnetosphere was in a quiet, steady state. While much prior research has been done on ULF waves during magnetically disturbed times, surprisingly little is known about the distribution of ULF waves during quiet times. This project will investigate the role the solar wind plays in the generation of ULF waves during the recent sunspot minimum when the magnetosphere was unusually quiet. It will develop statistical maps of the compressional and toroidal wave power in various frequency bands as a function of location in the magnetosphere and the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters. The statistical maps will be developed using ground-based magnetometers as well as data from the European Cluster satellite mission and the NASA THEMIS mission.</AbstractNarration>
