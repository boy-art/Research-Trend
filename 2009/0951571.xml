    <AbstractNarration>This research project applies contrasting motives to understand the complexities of relationship initiation and development. Specifically, the research examines when and why people attempt to initiate a relationship, who pursues the initiation, how rapidly the relationship develops, and the trajectory it takes as it becomes more established. Given the importance of relationships and lasting connections to well-being, research in this area has sought to develop a better understanding of how people establish meaningful social connections and transition from initial attraction, to affiliation, to stable and interdependent relationships. Although much is known about the qualities and circumstances that produce attraction as well as the regulation of closeness and intimacy in already established relationships, very little is known about the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors involved in the transition from attraction to intimacy. The investigators of this project make predictions for people's behaviors in relationships that are associated with either promotion or prevention-oriented goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These predictions will be tested across seven studies that either measure or manipulate people's motivations for promotion or prevention and then assess their (a) perceptions of interest and the potential for social support from others, (b) intentions to initiate and pursue relationships, and (c) behaviors associated with such pursuit (e.g., conveyed attraction to and self-disclosure toward others). The studies will also analyze both short-term interactions between strangers and the more extended development of friendships or romantic partnerships. By studying these types of relationship processes, findings from this research could help to attenuate the problem of loneliness as well as facilitate social transitions following relocation, change of employment and divorce.</AbstractNarration>
