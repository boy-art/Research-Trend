    <AbstractNarration>0967423&lt;br/&gt;Sun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is to carry out a fundamental study of carbon as a new element for quantum dot-like fluorescent nanomaterials. Recently, the PI?s group found and reported that small carbon nanoparticles could be surface-passivated to exhibit strong fluorescence in the visible and nearinfrared spectral regions. The focus of the proposed project will be on the further exploration and development, both fundamentally and technologically, of these fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (dubbed ?carbon dots?). While the original discovery of carbon dots was driven largely by carbon being obviously non-toxic, subsequent studies have revealed their many superb characteristics, including their being highly competitive in fluorescence performance. There are very good reasons to expect that with further development the carbon dots technology will play a significant role in advanced optical imaging and sensing for biomedical and human health related applications. In addition, an understanding of the fact that nanoscale carbon exhibits semiconductor-like optical properties should contribute to the fundamental knowledge on materials at the nanoscale, which may inspire the discovery of new concepts and new materials.</AbstractNarration>
