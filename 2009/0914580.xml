    <AbstractNarration>Abstract - Thiele&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses three sets of problems in the intersection of image processing, computer graphics and computer vision: (1) image segmentation with applications to object tracking in videos, (2) inpainting problems, both in the pixel domain and the transform domain, and (3) applications of variational PDE-based models to image processing on manifolds. The approach makes use of powerful concepts from computational mathematics, such as duality, convexification, non-smooth optimization, fast combinatorial optimization, numerical PDE techniques, harmonic analysis, and computational differential geometry. The research is focusing on key issues, such as computational efficiency, feature extraction, object tracking, global analysis, and optimization, and preserving both geometric and texture information, which are keys to further advances. The research will impact many areas ranging from entertainment through homeland security and medical imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For image segmentation, typical models are generally nonconvex and admit many local optimal solutions, making them sensitive to initial guesses. Moreover, numerical algorithms can be trapped in local non-optimal minima. To obtain better segmentation algorithms, we are extending a novel convexification technique (through the deep connection between TVL1 models and level sets) developed earlier for the Chan-Vese segmentation model to other segmentation models, such as non-local segmentation models inspired by texture synthesis techniques. For inpainting, recent advances include PDE and geometry techniques, texture synthesis, and a hybrid framework for inpainting missing transform (e.g. wavelets or Fourier). This research is examining the synergy between these methods and deriving models and algorithms that combine the best features of each. For image processing on manifolds, we are using conformal mapping techniques and PDE-based image processing models to derive efficient algorithms for general surfaces. New applications include the automatic tracking of landmarks on general surfaces and the incorporation of shape information in landmark matching.</AbstractNarration>
