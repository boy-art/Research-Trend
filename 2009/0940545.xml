    <AbstractNarration>Pacific University proposes to engage girls in computing with a multifaceted, modular pedagogical strategy that focuses on women computer scientists as leaders. The approach will feature a four-week long computer science summer camp for 7th and 8th grade girls - G2CS (Girls Gather for Computer Science) - with original curriculum that utilizes active learning and focuses on computational thinking, a mentoring program, a multi-media approach and interactive web site, as well as a ten-year commitment to the students involved. Using female computer science leaders as instructors and removing students from their usual surroundings and preoccupations free young women to concentrate on the science, and imagine themselves as scientists. The camp will run for three years and systematic follow-on activities within electronic environments will create an ongoing community of students, their families, mentors and teachers as well as partners. The focus in this particular project is on overcoming the lack of young women in computer science, though its approach would be suitable for use in a variety of scientific fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a partnership between Pacific University and Oregon's nationally recognized public broadcasting station, Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB). Other partners include the Berglund Center for Internet Studies at Pacific, the Intel Corporation, the educational media company Flying Rhinoceros, Vernier Software &amp; Technology, leaders from tribal groups, local Latino community representatives, and local school district heads. The outcomes of the project include video coverage of the camp, featuring young scientists and their mentors at work, game-like "interactives" for the camp web site, and a broad collection of media tools.</AbstractNarration>
