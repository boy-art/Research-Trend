    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "The Phenology of Plant Invasions: How changing seasons and temporal niches assemble plant communities" for Elizabeth Wolkovich. The host institution for this research is the University of California - San Diego, and the sponsoring scientist is Elsa Cleland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding why certain exotic species become invasive in particular habitats but not others is complex but important for conservation. Several common theories suggest invasive species benefit from exploiting unused resources in an ecosystem (vacant niche), establishing before native species each season (priority effects) or responding more rapidly to variability in climate (increased plasticity). Most studies to date have attempted to examine these theories using empirical data on a single location or species. This research employs extensive phenological datasets that include a large number of species, including those newly available through U.S. National Phenology Network (NPN), to test all three theories at once over tremendous spatial and temporal scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include advancing ecoinformatics skills as well as mentorship and outreach abilities. This research will contribute new data products to the NPN and project Budburst, and will hopefully be used to inform management practices of invasive species. The major database created will include climate data, leafing and flowering periods, and other key information, and will be made available through the US NPN website. Additionally, a set of educational materials will be produced and will be shared with the NPN. The results will also be disseminated through publication in major research journals, presentations to citizen science groups, and at national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
