    <AbstractNarration>This project is building on prior NSF-funded research on graduate education in geography, as well as research performed since the mid-1990s by major foundations. This prior work clearly indicates that STEM graduate programs are not fully preparing students for potential careers beyond academe. As in other social and environmental sciences, research on professional development in geography has focused on academic career issues. The outcome is a broad-based academic infrastructure in geography for supporting the professional development of early career faculty. This project is premised on the belief that similar infrastructure is needed to support the professional development of new and transitional scholars entering Business, Government, and Nonprofit (BGN) work settings. A key first step is to clarify the types of learning experiences, both theoretical and applied, which will equip graduates with the competencies for geographic work in BGN organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To take this first step, this project is developing further a methodology designed in prior research to assess workforce needs, expectations, and core competencies in professional geography work. It is conducting research focused on BGN professionals and employer organizations in order to determine the value of coursework, internships, and other forms of educational experiences that graduates acquire in graduate geography programs. The project scope includes assessing the expectations of different workplace cultures, and developing measures of how BGN professionals experience their working environments, resulting in a better understanding of the knowledge and skills geography graduates need to prepare themselves for entry into BGN positions.</AbstractNarration>
