    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to integrate a GIS-enabled design approach across a sequence of six required civil engineering courses. A collaborative development model is ensuring that curricular links between the courses are explicit and that a clear path for student skills progression in terms of technical competency, data synthesis and analysis, and problem solving is articulated in the developed materials. Through the use of these materials, students are developing an improved ability to analyze engineering problems in multiple contexts using a GIS platform. Furthermore, the project is leading to a new curriculum infusion model for critical cross-disciplinary topics and a sustainable curriculum transformation. It is also contributing to the body of knowledge on improving student understanding of core content and engineering decision-making abilities through the use of visualization software as the platform for a completely integrated and project-based, collaborative approach to learning. It is identifying best practices in terms of curriculum transformation to achieve the goal of enhanced student skill level not only in technical content, but also in societal and global context. The project is building on an existing program (Girls Experiencing Engineering) to engage K-12 teachers and middle and high school students. Other dissemination efforts include conference and journal papers and faculty workshops. Project evaluation, under the direction of a independent campus center, is using competency assessments and questionnaires to monitor the impact of the new material on the students knowledge, skills, and beliefs. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the instructional material, the faculty workshops, and the outreach to female K-12 students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>
