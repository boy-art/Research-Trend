    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from the NSF MRI-R2 program has allowed Marshall University to purchase a Leica TCS SP5 II AOBS and MP High End System. This system includes the ability to perform very high resolution imaging, and very fast imaging for the rapid detection, with good temporal resolution, of fast physiological changes that can last 1 msec or less. These features thus allow the combination of fluorescent imaging in live tissues with other physiological techniques required by Marshall researchers. The initial user group for the new system consists of 5 major and 10 minor users, representing researchers from 5 departments, with projects that span a broad range of biological and biochemical research in neurobiology, genetics, physiology, molecular biology, and bioengineering. Major projects use multiphoton microscopy to study signal transduction mechanisms in single neurons, and to analyze the effect of environmental variables on bone elongation by imaging skeletal growth plates in vivo. Other research projects that benefit from the high resolution imaging, multiple color channels, rapid scanning, and precise optical sectioning capability of the proposed instrumentation include a study using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model to investigate the orientation and shape of cells within the plane of an epithelium; an analysis of stem cell integration and differentiation in tissues; and the evaluation of DNA damage repair mechanisms. Additional projects include the intracellular localization of an important cell cycle regulatory protein in the protist Acanthamoeba; molecular signaling triggered by oxidized dietary lipids; neuronal mechanisms underlying the regulation of body load in stick insects; and the development of single-molecule sensor systems. The new equipment enhances the cutting edge research programs and student research opportunities. The projects include 17 undergraduate and 23 graduate student researchers. Confocal microscopy is regularly used in coursework (laboratory exercises, and capstone and independent research projects) at Marshall, and as part of outreach programs. These programs include the Marshall Chapter of the WV Space Grant Consortium's NASA Research Scholarships Program; the NSF Kentucky-WV Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation; the WV-IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence; The Biomedical Sciences Summer Research Internship for Minority Students; and the state-funded Marshall Summer Undergraduate Research Experience. In addition, summer Bridge programs expose high school students, their teachers, and Marshall's rising sophomores to cutting-edge research which includes the use of confocal microscopy. Publication and presentation are major dissemination criteria, and all participating faculty have support student presenters at national and/or international conferences as well as at local events such as Undergraduate Research Day at the WV Capitol.</AbstractNarration>
