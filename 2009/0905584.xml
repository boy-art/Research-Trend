    <AbstractNarration>The rewriting model of computation is simple, yet general and flexible. A system of any kind, for example, an algorithm, a database, a hardware&lt;br/&gt;system, a programming language, a network protocol, a sensor network, or&lt;br/&gt;the molecular biology dynamics of a cell, can be modeled by a set of&lt;br/&gt;rewrite rules that&lt;br/&gt;describe the systems behavior. The rewriting model of computation is&lt;br/&gt;intrinsically concurrent, without any need for explicit concurrency constructs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any set of rules that apply to nonoverlapping system components can execute concurrently. For a large distributed system such as a network&lt;br/&gt;or a cell, this means that at any given time thousands or millions of&lt;br/&gt;concurrent transitions may be happening in parallel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maude is a language based on rewriting logic. The current Maude implementation provides a high performance rewrite engine, as well&lt;br/&gt;as builtin search, unification, and model checking tools to support&lt;br/&gt;execution and analysis of systems specified in Maude. To realize&lt;br/&gt;inherent concurrency of rewriting, the proposed project will develop an&lt;br/&gt;implementation of Maude called Distributed and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concurrent Maude (DCMaude) that will exploit the concurrency available in multicore/multiprocessor machines, and support distributed computing&lt;br/&gt;and systems programming. The rewriting semantics of Maude supports&lt;br/&gt;seamless transition between concurrent and distributed execution of a&lt;br/&gt;system: execution in one process, multiple processes/cores, or multiple&lt;br/&gt;machines. In addition to built in strategies for concurrency, the design&lt;br/&gt;of DCMaude will include a means for the programmer to control&lt;br/&gt;concurrency at a high level of abstraction in a declarative way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DC Maude will provide new methods and tools that can significantly improve both the design and the implementation of open distributed&lt;br/&gt;systems, including web-based systems and next-generation networks.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, by being directly based on rewriting logic, DCMaude&lt;br/&gt;will close the gap between formal specifications and actual&lt;br/&gt;implementations, making it possible to gain substantially higher&lt;br/&gt;assurance about the formal requirements, including the security&lt;br/&gt;properties, of such systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be carried our jointly by Drs. Jose Meseguer (UIUC)&lt;br/&gt;and Dr. Carolyn Talcott (SRI International). Both UIUC and SRI will&lt;br/&gt;take joint responsibility for the DCMaude design. The DC Maude&lt;br/&gt;implementation will be the primary responsibility of SRI International,&lt;br/&gt;while the testing, benchmarking and development of DCMaude applications&lt;br/&gt;will be the primary responsibility of UIUC.</AbstractNarration>
