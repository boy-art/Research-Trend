    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this planning grant, steps are being taken to develop the framework for a Master Teaching Fellows program. The planning activities are beginning with a needs assessment survey to determine the level of interest in the region for the program and the expected outcomes. As part of this planning project, key high needs school districts are being identified and recruited for participation in the program and a non-profit organization that has the capacity and expertise to support the goals of the program is being selected. The educational program for professional development of master teachers is being designed, drawing on existing courses and structures where appropriate. Other planning activities include identification of sources of university cost share, securing school district support for implementing salary supplements for the Fellows, and developing an evaluation plan aimed at measuring the impact of the project on the retention of mathematics and science teachers as well as the Fellows' ability to serve as leaders within their districts.</AbstractNarration>
