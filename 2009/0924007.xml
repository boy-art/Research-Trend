    <AbstractNarration>Oregon State University proposes to support technical services on R/V Wecoma, a 185? general purpose research vessel as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation. The proposal requests support for both basic and specialized services. For basic services, they will provide one or two shipboard technicians on each cruise of R/V Wecoma to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. As part of specialized services, they will continue to operate and maintain the NORCOR facility, a shared use coring facility available to all operators as well as continue development and support for the SWAP effort, a ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications protocol. The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.</AbstractNarration>
