    <AbstractNarration>The Institute for Mathematics and Education (IM&amp;E), the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arizona (UA), and a consortium of key stakeholders including high-needs schools and districts, university departments and programs, local educational agencies, non-profits and businesses are engaged in planning to develop a Master Teaching Fellows proposal. The AZ-MTM Consortium is bringing together a wide group of stakeholders interested in the retention of mathematics teachers in low-income schools through the development of teacher leaders. Participants in the planning include high needs schools and districts (Tucson and Sunnyside Unified School districts); experts in mathematics education and professional development (CRR, IM&amp;E, and Arizona Teacher Initiative (ATI).); and regional education and business agencies: the Office of Pima County Schools, a State Education Agency (SEA), and Tucson Values Teachers, a regional business/education partnership working to provide incentives, internships and professional development opportunities for teachers. During the planning period the consortium is designing a comprehensive program for the Arizona Master Teacher Program for Mathematics (AZ-MTM), making use of existing professional development opportunities, identifying and securing commitments for matching funds, and developing a comprehensive evaluation plan. Planning activities include establishing a timeline and process for a needs assessment regarding teacher shortages as well as an action plan for designing the AZ-MTM program including protocols for recruiting teachers, courses and professional development and comprehensive program evaluation. The Institute for Mathematics and Education (IM&amp;E) which has acquired a national reputation for bringing together mathematicians, educators and teachers for effective collaboration, is coordinating the planning year. The program will build on courses being developed under a NSF Math Science Partnership grant, the Arizona Teacher Initiative (ATI).</AbstractNarration>
