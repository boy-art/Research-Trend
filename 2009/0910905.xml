    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dmitry Matyushov of Arizona State University has an award from the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry Division to study the electrostatics at the interface of a polar liquid and a solute of nanoscale dimensions using a combination of numerical simulations and analytic techniques. These studies focus on a range between the macroscopic and microscopic scale where the electrostatics is not understood and where neither microscopic nor macroscopic pictures apply to the nanometer liquid interface. The research is performed in conjunction with experimentalists studying these phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies address many important questions regarding electron transport in biology, artificial photosynthesis and solar energy harvesting. Additionally, Professor Matyushov and his research group are involved with outreach activities involving high-school teachers geared toward inspiring interest in science in local schools.</AbstractNarration>
