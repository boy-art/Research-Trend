    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project furthers the research and development of a completely new low cost high efficiency electric motor for use in HVAC compressors and transportation (electric and hybrid electric) power trains. Parallel Magnetic Circuit (?PMC?) technology is a breakthrough magnetic force control technology that is applicable to any electromagnetic device. Unlike alternative existing/conventional electric motors, which use series magnetic circuits limited by the flux density of the most powerful single magnet element, PMC moves flux from multiple permanent magnets and field coils into a coherent and additive geometry - dramatically increasing both efficiency and power density. The increased power density, efficiency and operating speeds intrinsic to PMC designs are enabling performance characteristics for HVAC and transportation systems providing lower cost, smaller, lighter weight, faster and more reliable alternatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve the efficiency of over $500 billion a year in electricity usage by up to 10% or more, the potential reduction of over 20% of the world?s coal fired electricity generation and the potential elimination of up to 30% of global CO2 emissions. Higher energy prices and usage have accelerated the growing global demand for lower cost energy efficient products. Since over 50% of all global electricity is consumed in electric motor systems and over 26% of fossil fuels are used in transportation applications, it provides a significant opportunity to reduce energy costs, pollution and national security concerns. PMC motors can be used to significantly increase the efficiency and lower the cost of all electric motor driven systems including electric and hybrid electric vehicles, HVAC systems, industrial, consumer, military applications.</AbstractNarration>
