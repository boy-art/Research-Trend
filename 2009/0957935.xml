    <AbstractNarration>Kaspari&lt;br/&gt;0957935&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI-R2 award will fund the purchase of a particle soot photometer (SP2) for black carbon analysis. The SP2 system allows measuring mass, mixing state, and optical size of black carbon particles. It does so with lower detection limits and less sample alteration than traditional thermal-optical methods. Gaseous samples can be introduced directly while liquid samples (ice core sections, for example) are nebulized before introduction. Black carbon is produced from incomplete combustion and derives from biomass, coal and fossil-fuel burning. It absorbs light in the atmosphere and leads to increased temperature. In ice or snow, black carbon can reduce surface albedo leading to increased melting. It is thought to play a major role in global warming. Black carbon will be analyzed in ice cores to provide proxy data for paleoclimatological reconstructions. The SP2 system will be critical to obtaining high-resolution measurements on very small sample quantities. Sampling will focus on several regional systems including the Himalayas, the North Cascades, Greenland, Antarctica and other North American sites. Black carbon impacts on snow and ice albedo will be determined and the impact on climate forcing assessed. These data will be placed into context with other measures of snowmelt and climate gradients. The analyzer will also be used to better understand anthropogenic and natural aerosols. Research conducted with the new instrument will, at its core, have tremendous societal relevance as black carbon and its associated heat forcing may account for a considerable portion of the uncertainty in estimating global climate change. The SP2 will be incorporated into 2 graduate and 4 undergraduate courses at CWU. University science programs are established which target underrepresented groups. The instrument will be housed in newly renovated laboratory space. The adjacent spaces house clean laboratories and ice core processing facilities. The PI will be responsible for instrument purchase, installation, maintenance, calibration and training. The PI has managed this instrumentation as a post-doc. Two full-time engineering technicians are available through the department. Consumables will be purchased through research grants and laboratory fees charged to outside users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
