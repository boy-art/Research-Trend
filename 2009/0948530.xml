    <AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Constraining P-T-t-D paths of metamorphic tectoniteswith the TitaniQ thermobarometer &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The recent development of several trace-element thermometers has provided powerful new tools for geologists to constrain pressure-temperature-time-deformation (P-T-t-D) histories of many crustal rocks to understand their tectonic and petrologic histories. Key to this approach is the recent development of a Ti-in-quartz (TitaniQ) thermobarometer that can ideally provide T or P information from the content of Ti dissolved in quartz. This approach remains to be tested in a well-characterized environment. To this end, an integrated microstructural, petrologic, and geochemical study is proposed to evaluate P-T-t-D paths of metamorphic tectonites from well characterized and previously dated gneisses, schists, and mylonites from the Strafford Dome complex (Vermont). These rocks record progressive deformation during crenulation cleavage development and, locally, complete transposition of the S1 fabric and mylonitization. S1 is preserved as quartz-rich inclusions suites in minerals such as garnet, staurolite, and kyanite, suggesting that CL imaging combined with in situ analyses of Ti-in-quartz in different microstructural contexts from the same sample may elucidate discrete segments of the P-T-t-D path. Electron backscatter and CL imaging will be used to investigate the strain field associated with P-T conditions and provide insight into the physical processes associated with quartz reequilibration with respect to Ti distributions. What is unique about this study is the potential to determine not just the temperature, but also the depth at which a fabric is developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The proposed research efforts will foster collaboration at the interface of tectonics, petrology, and geochemistry. The project will support the research programs of two early career geoscientists (Webb and Thomas) and enhance graduate and undergraduate student education and training through the use of cutting-edge technology and hands-on field and laboratory experiences. Students will gain experience in linking observations from micron to plate scales. The results of this work will be broadly applicable to many problems in continental tectonics and disseminated at international meetings and in peer reviewed journals. Samples, field data and analytical data collected during the course of this study will be used in L. Webb's class, Microstructural Analysis and P-T-t-D Paths, for senior level undergraduate and graduate students at UVM. Photomicrograghs, CL images, and analytical data sets will be available to the scientific community for research and teaching through an NSF supported Database System for Metamorphic Geochemistry 'MetPetDB'.</AbstractNarration>
