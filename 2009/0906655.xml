    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education that is motivated by experiments on unconventional superconducting materials. Superconductivity in close proximity to checkerboard charge density wave order and spin density wave order has been discovered in the underdoped cuprates; an unusual pair density wave superconductivity has been found in organic superconductors, in a cerium-cobalt-indium heavy fermion material, and also in a lanthanum cuprate material; superconductivity has been found at oxide interfaces; unexplained and puzzling physics has appeared in some Kondo lattice materials, all materials without parity symmetry. Unconventional superconductivity has been discovered in close proximity to a variety of quantum phase transitions.&lt;br/&gt;This research project focuses on the appearance of novel order in such materials. The PI aims to develop a new theoretical framework for pair density wave superconductors and their interplay with charge density wave and spin density wave order. The PI will further examine the appearance of new phases arising from fluctuations in pair density wave superconductors. He will examine the role of interactions in broken inversion materials applied to both bulk materials and to oxide interfaces. Theories describing the interplay between high-field quantum critical points and superconductivity with applications to specific heavy fermion materials will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides educational experiences for graduate and undergraduate students and contributes to the PI?s participation in the Research Experiences for Teachers program at the University of Wisconsin ? Milwaukee and his public presentations on condensed matter physics. The PI aims to broaden participation through involving underrepresented groups in the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education that is motivated by experiments on specific materials that exhibit unusual superconducting states. Superconductivity is a cooperative electronic state of matter with remarkable properties. Among them is the ability to carry electric current without dissipation. The PI aims to develop a theoretical framework for classes of materials that show unusual superconducting states, often when superconductivity competes with magnetism or some other way electrons can spontaneously organize themselves in an ordered way. A deeper understanding of superconductivity may lead to the discovery of new superconducting materials that may be practical for dissipationless electric power transmission or novel electronic device applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides educational experiences for graduate and undergraduate students and contributes to the PI?s participation in the Research Experiences for Teachers program at the University of Wisconsin ? Milwaukee and his public presentations on condensed matter physics. The PI aims to broaden participation through involving underrepresented groups in the research.</AbstractNarration>
