    <AbstractNarration>This proposal describes plans for the Twelfth Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability, a conference series sponsored by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, to be organized by and held for junior researchers. The primary objective is to provide a much needed venue for interaction among new researchers. In contrast with large meetings, this conference will be restricted in size, with a target of 85 participants. Sessions will be followed by panel discussions and breaks to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference will take place July 28 -- July 31, 2009 at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and the National Cancer Institute, to immediately precede the annual Joint Statistical Meetings in Washington DC. Housing, meals, and conference facilities will be provided on campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be statisticians and probabilists that have received their Ph.D. within the past five years or are expecting to receive their degree within the next year. Each participant will present their research. Topics will range across a variety of areas in statistics from theory and methods to applications. Senior speakers will discuss topics of particular interest to new researchers. Panel discussions during the conference will cover the topics of journal publications, funding, career development, and mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is based on its human resources development. The professional development of new researchers is stimulated by promoting their interaction and creating networks of colleagues. Participants present their work in a smaller, more controlled conference environment, maximizing their intellectual interaction and growth. Women,&lt;br/&gt;minorities, and the disabled are explicitly encouraged to attend, and we have an established track record of attracting participants from these categories.</AbstractNarration>
