    <AbstractNarration>The 3rd Pan American Membrane Biology Workshop will be held in Puebla, Mexico May 27-30 2009. The workshop will cover the most important breakthroughs in understanding both basic and applied aspects of plant membrane biology. The meeting will focus on transport, signaling and trafficking, as these fields of investigation are expanding at an extremely rapid pace. Given the importance of membrane biology and its potential to continue to make groundbreaking discoveries of broad fundamental importance and the large scientific demand for opportunities to communicate and interact, the topic of this meeting is both exciting and timely. The specific objectives are to (1) organize and support a meeting on the latest scientific advances in the research area of plant membrane biology (2) promote interactions between scientists and trainees to share new discoveries in the field of membrane biology as it relates to normal growth, development and nutrition and to enhance training and new collaborations that will move the field forward and (3) to directly involve newly independent scientists and trainees including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, women, minorities and the disabled in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
