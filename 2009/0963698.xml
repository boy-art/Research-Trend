    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Life is controlled by chemistry. The thousands of vital chemical reactions that allow life are catalyzed by enzymes. Despite being studied systematically for more than a century, it is still not clear how enzymes accelerate chemical reactions. Enzymology has delved deeply into uncovering the mechanism of catalysis in biology and now attempts to understand reactivity in terms of macromolecular structure and in the dynamic motions of macromolecules. Structures and their movements promote some chemically complex, biologically critical reactions. Just as important, these same structures prevent deleterious side-reactions. The elegant tuning of enzyme reactivity is the result of evolution under selective pressure. Changing environments, or changing metabolic imperatives, cause new enzyme activities to evolve. The task of understanding how enzymes catalyze reactions, how their activity is controlled, and how new activities can emerge requires insight from many perspectives. This Gordon Conference on Enzymes, Coenzymes and Metabolic Pathways will provide a highly interactive venue to present discuss and debate the cutting-edge of enzyme research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Enzymes, Coenzymes and Metabolic Pathways is now one of the most influential in the broad area of enzymology. It gathers the leaders in the field, trainees at the student or postdoctoral level, and those in between. The collegial, informal atmosphere, coupled to the GRC non-disclosure policy, is extremely effective in fostering the free exchange of ideas and cutting-edge results. The Enzymes GRC has truly been the birthplace of many fruitful collaborations and new research directions. The Enzymes GRC has also been a very effective mechanism for incorporating women and underrepresented minorities into enzymology and the metabolic pathway community. The event allows participants to build invaluable networks with leaders in the field from academia, industry, and government. This year's conference continues this tradition of inclusiveness, with a very high proportion of speakers and discussion leaders being women and underrepresented minorities. The conference also provides important networking opportunities and intellectual development for graduate students and postdoctoral associated, and, therefore, helps to sustain the field by developing new talent.</AbstractNarration>
