    <AbstractNarration>CBET- 0902215&lt;br/&gt;HUANG, YINLUN, WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial funding, primarily for the travel and attendance at the First International Congress on Sustainability Science and Engineering: Where Science and Engineered Technologies Meet the Needs of Society, organized by a group of scientists, educators, engineers, and governmental officials from 12 countries. This congress will be held in Cincinnati, Ohio, Aug. 9-12, 2009. Industries have been actively seeking approaches and plans of action that lean them toward the goal of sustainable development. There is a clear need to organize an international conference that can address broader issues of sustainability science and engineering, and discuss how the development of science and technologies in the industries can meet the needs of the society. The congress will seek to assess the state-of-the-art sustainable engineering and science, and to share knowledge and experience for achieving genuine economic, environmental and social sustainability. The broader impacts of the project will facilitate the exchange knowledge and experience among scientists, researchers, educators, and practitioners around the world, and help the US delegates identify international collaboration opportunities in the research and education of sustainable engineering. This project will support a total of 20 faculty (preferably those in their early career development stage), postdoctoral fellows, and graduate/undergraduate students to attend the conference. Those in the groups underrepresented in science and engineering are strongly encouraged to participate.</AbstractNarration>
