    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to gain a fundamental understanding on the fatigue degradation properties of metallic nanostructures in non-inert environments. The specific research objectives of the proposed research are to develop an experimental technique using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices to accurately measure the fatigue properties of nanostructures in non-inert environments and to investigate the size and environmental effects on the stress-life fatigue curves and fatigue crack growth rates in metallic nanostructures. The novelty of the approach is to use electrical (resistance) measurements to infer structural changes, such as cracking, without the need for in-situ SEM/TEM capability (testing will instead take place in an environmental chamber).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will address unexplored reliability issues regarding the use of metallic nanostructures in nanoscale devices; such issues may ultimately limit their successful commercialization. A thorough understanding of the degradation properties and their dependence on size and environment is fundamental to ensure proper structural reliability of devices fabricated with emerging nanotechnologies. The educational broad impact of the proposed research lies in the opportunities to promote motivation, learning and academic success of high school students from underrepresented groups in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and to develop the teaching skills of high school teachers. The PI intends to develop, with high school teachers, a summer enrichment program dedicated to the fracture of engineering materials and targeted for high school students in grades 9 and 10.</AbstractNarration>
