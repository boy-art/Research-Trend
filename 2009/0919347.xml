    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;This project is tailored to the newest generation of engineering students who are more computer literate, electronically connected, and simulation game-oriented than any prior generation. Through this project, a computer game is being developed that models authentic engineering practice. The game is being tested with first-year engineering students to help them develop an epistemology of engineering practice. In this game, students are employees in the Nephrotex Company that designs kidney dialysis machines for people with end-stage kidney disease. As entry-level engineers, student players are being charged with troubleshooting client questions and developing guidelines for proper use of the company's product in clinical settings, and for generating and testing ideas about the design, operation, and performance of dialysis equipment. Student players also interact with non-player characters who represent other members of the firm, clients, and potential customers. To complete their tasks, students need to research kidney function, machine design, transport phenomena, and fundamentals of optimization. Game play is taking place face-to-face during class time as well as outside of the classroom. Results from the project are being rigorously assessed to evaluate the impact of the game on student learning and motivation as well as the development of an engineering epistemic frame for the students.</AbstractNarration>
