    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the development of an applied energy curriculum including field and laboratory training. The curriculum is comprised of traditional coursework, laboratory work, field study, and advanced analysis in energy efficiency, production, and life cycle assessment. Undergraduates use various instruments in the energy courses and in conducting research projects under the umbrella of existing faculty research programs. Thus, through the integration into course curricula and use in undergraduate research, purchased energy equipment offers powerful pedagogical tools for helping students learn and perform investigations in energy and sustainability. Environmental scientists, engineers, and technologists graduating in the 21st century need to be competent in energy efficiency, production and impact. This project provides the modern equipment and appropriate curricula for students and working professionals seeking specific training and certification in these areas. Also, the collective activities of this project help fill a crucial missing curricular gap for students, including those from underrepresented groups. For example, this institution serves primarily nontraditional first generation college students and also actively supports students with disabilities, including returning veterans, majoring in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Many of these students are being trained in the use of this equipment. In addition, existing faculty affiliations leverage student exposure to international projects related to sustainability and energy in Africa. Because the breadth of energy and environmental issues on the continent are so extreme, these internships provide students with a unique perspective on energy and environmental issues present for half of the world's population that still rely on polluting and development crippling biomass fuels like firewood, charcoal, and dung to meet their needs.</AbstractNarration>
