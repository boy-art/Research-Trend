    <AbstractNarration>Dynamic visualizations - interactive, computer based models, simulations, and virtual experiments of scientific phenomena - provide alternative pathways for students to understand science concepts. Of special interest are those visualizations that make unseen processes visible and those that support inquiry around complex phenomena. Research concerning the educational values of dynamic visualizations has been contradictory and inconclusive. This study provides modules and assessments to obtain evidence for how students process dynamic visual data and integrate what they see with what they know. The project proceeds in three phases. The first 18 month phase is to study how visualizations can improve science learning for students with a wide range of disciplinary knowledge, background, beliefs, and spatial experience. The second phase lasting 24 months investigates successful strategies to embed visualizations, combined with hands-on activities, in curriculum materials to enable all students to learn complex science topics. The last phase of 18 months works to show how practices and cyberlearning tools can be generalized to be more easily used in different environments by developing visualizations for new topics and curricula. Forty middle and high school science teachers and their students in five diverse districts participate in the study of visualizations applied to the learning of physical science. The studies build on existing work and tools, but new tools and materials are to be developed as needed.</AbstractNarration>
