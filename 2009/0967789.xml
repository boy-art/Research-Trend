    <AbstractNarration>0967789&lt;br/&gt;Luo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic polymer based photovoltaic (PV) cells are a sustainable and potentially cost-effective device platform for the conversion of solar energy to electricity. However, the solar energy conversion efficiency of current polymeric solar PV devices is still only around 6%. A fundamental issue that limits the performance of polymeric solar cells is the disparity in achieving high efficiencies for light absorption, exciton dissociation, and free electron diffusion towards the cathode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, self-aligned, electrochemically grown, conducting polymer nanowires will be used to create an ordered, inter-digitated, donor-acceptor heterojunction that has the potential to substantially increase photovoltaic efficiency. The first objective is to understand the growth of self-aligned conducting polymer nanowires and nano-porous polymers by an electrochemical deposition process, in order to control nanowire dimension and density. The second objective is to optically and electrically characterize these materials, and then establish a correlation between growth conditions and nanowire properties. The third objective is to fabricate and test a conducting polymer, nanowire based, interdigitated heterojunction photovoltaic device. These studies are expected to establish fundamental relationships between device performance parameters and material / device preparation conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is potentially transformative because it seeks to develop a new approach for the fabrication of low-cost, high-efficiency polymeric photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, the proposed research has the potential to improve basic understanding of nanoscale material growth mechanisms for conducting polymers, and therefore has the potential to open up new opportunities for organic optoelectronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed education and outreach activities focus on course development and training of high school teachers. Research outcomes will be integrated a course on optoelectronic and nanoelectronic devices at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The principal investigator will use the Leonard Gelfand Center for Service Learning and Outreach at CMU to deliver a training/education program for high school teachers in nanoscience, where they will receive hands-on experience in nanoscence and learn how to bring these concepts into the classroom. Teachers will receive training/education credit hours.</AbstractNarration>
