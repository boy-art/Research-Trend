    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saint Joseph's College of Maine is purchasing a 60 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR), an infrared spectrometer (IR), and software to investigate the effect of both horizontal and vertical inter-laboratory integration on STEM students' ability to collaborate, cooperate, mentor and learn. The project is using spectroscopy (UV-Vis, IR, and NMR) as a unifying theme between courses. Each physical science course is implementing lab experiments where students in different groups or sections are exchanging data and working with students in another group or section (horizontal integration). Students are also exchanging data between different courses and academic levels (freshmen, sophomore, etc.) (vertical integration). Facilitated and ad hoc meetings and virtual communities are forming to accomplish tasks, solve problems and to gain skills in forming professional relationships and scientific collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project evaluation is being accomplished through surveys and academic assessments by the internal and external consultants. Results are being reported on websites, at national professional society meetings, and in peer-reviewed journals. This project is being conducted in an institution where nearly 70% of all students and half of all students majoring in science disciplines are women. Approximately 60% of the students are the first in their families to attend college, one quarter qualify for Pell grants, and of these, about half are from families whose incomes fall below the federal poverty line.</AbstractNarration>
