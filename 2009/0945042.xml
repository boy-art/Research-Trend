    <AbstractNarration>This Phase I SBIR project is for the development of an "atom chip" technology that advances state-of-the art miniature ultracold atom systems. Ultracold matter is an emerging arena of science and technology involving macroscopic quantum states of matter achieved using laser cooling and other purely electromagnetic cooling techniques. The proposed new technology will provide unprecedented capability for controlling and manipulating ultracold atoms that will enable development of ultracold atom applications such as navigation, frequency standards and clocks, and quantum simulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science of ultracold matter is among the most active and rapidly growing sub-disciplines of physics. Ultracold matter is recognized has considerable applications potential in sensing applications but also in applications of quantum science such as quantum simulation, computing, and communication. The proposed ultracold matter products lower the barrier to research and development and provide a pathway for non-experts to develop real world applications. This project will enable further research and development efforts within industry as well as academic and government research institutions.</AbstractNarration>
