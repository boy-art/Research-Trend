    <AbstractNarration>This is a research project that would contribute to further understanding of STEM teaching and learning in informal settings by conceptualizing and measuring computational thinking for middle school students. Three research questions will be addressed: 1) What is an appropriate definition of computational thinking in middle school? 2) Does creating a computer game promote computational thinking? 3) Under what conditions does pair programming produce greater gains in computational thinking than solo programming? The study will be conducted over three years. Approximately 240 students will use Storytelling Alice to create 3-D animation games over 16 weeks. Participants will be drawn from extended learning programs in two school districts that include primarily Latino and white students. Classes will be randomly assigned to either pair or solo programming conditions. Paired students will choose their partners and statistical analyses designed for longitudinal dyadic interdependent data will be conducted. Data will include pre and post-test surveys, interviews, computer logging data, observations, students games, videotape, and performance assessments. They will also employ a group-randomized controlled trial; randomization will be by class to either a pair programming or solo programming condition. The qualitative and quantitative data will measure computational thinking, students experience programming, closeness with partner, affect, and behavior on the computer. The project will produce evidence about the strength of working in pairs compared with working on technology games alone and it is intended to inform discussions of the meaning of computational thinking.</AbstractNarration>
