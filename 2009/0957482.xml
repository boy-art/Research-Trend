    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professor David Forbes at the University of South Alabama for a research project that will develop a method of creating sulfur ylides that are useful in forming carbon-carbon bonds and three-membered rings. This is a commonly used reaction in organic synthesis but is usually difficult to get good yields consistently. Professor Forbes has proposed a process that overcomes this limitation, and has found a way to improve reactions that have been reported in this area, which could lead to the development of new processes. Increased understanding of these key processes would provide a new method of high utility that can be used in a wide range of organic syntheses. The major goal of the proposal is to render this methodology catalytic in the sulfide promoter, making the methodology more atom efficient and opening avenues for chiral catalysis. This research is likely to lead to processes that are of great value to synthetic chemists and will have a significant impact on the chemistry community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Forbes will perform research that addresses a long-standing problem in the potentially useful area of organocatalytic synthesis: that of catalytic sulfide-mediated methylene transfer using non-dangerous chemicals. This versatile and potentially environmentally benign methodology would have industrial applications of economic and environmental benefit. Broader impacts involve the training of undergraduate students in chemistry, outreach to local high school chemistry teachers through the Alabama Science in Motion (ASIM) Program, and ongoing collaborations, especially with industry.</AbstractNarration>
