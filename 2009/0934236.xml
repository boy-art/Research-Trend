    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the Buffalo-Case-Cornell-Syracuse Workshop on Cosmology in Fall 2010. This is the latest in a series of highly successful regional conferences covering aspects of physics at the interface between modern high-energy physics and cosmology. This is a particularly ripe time for research at the boundary between particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology. This is due, in large part, to the fact that data is soon expected to emerge from a plethora of experiments in both particle physics and astrophysics. These include the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), experiments seeking the direct and indirect detection of Dark Matter, and Cosmic Microwave Background probes such as Planck. Indeed, in many instances these different experiments are complementary to each other, each providing a different window into the as-yet-unexplored physics beyond the Standard Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support of this conference will enable young researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) to attend this conference at reduced expense. Participation by students and postdocs will enhance their education and promote their research. It will permit face-to-face interactions between physicists at different stages in their careers, allow all to network in an informal setting, enable them to share ideas and establish personal contacts, and provide younger researchers the opportunity to lively exhibit their own expertise through presentations of their research.</AbstractNarration>
