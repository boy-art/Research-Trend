    <AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks funding to begin a research effort on characterizing and extracting galactic dust emissions from the data that will be collected by the NASA-funded Antarctic Long Duration Balloon-borne (LDB) ?E and B Experiment? (EBEX). A leading cosmological paradigm for the beginning and evolution of the Universe posits a period of Inflation shortly after the Big Bang. Inflation generated primordial gravitational waves in the Universe that imprinted a distinct signature called the "B-mode signal" on the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. This signal is extremely weak, around 100 microKelvins or smaller, and astrophysical foregrounds such as polarized emission from galactic dust and synchrotron radiation swamp the Inflationary signal over most of the sky. The EBEX balloon payload will have the sensitivity to detect the B-mode signal if it is stronger than 1/10 of the current theoretical upper limit. The balloon observations will be carried out in frequency bands between 150 and 410 GHz. The higher end of this band is not accessible from the ground; thus, EBEX can provide valuable information on the properties of galactic dust emissions. This information is critical for all the CMB experiments searching for the Inflationary signal. EBEX is currently awaiting its flight from Antarctica in the austral summer of 2010/2011. The requested funds will be used to support a post-doctoral fellow and a graduate student to work on the characterization and extraction of galactic dust foregrounds from the EBEX data.</AbstractNarration>
