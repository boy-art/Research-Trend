    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT TITLE: Collaborative Research: LiT: Effects of Temperature and Elevated CO2 Levels on Biomineralization and Metabolic Physiology of Marine Bivalves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS: Inna Sokolova and Elia Beniash&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT NUMBER: IOS-0951079 and IOS-0951139 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global climate change driven by an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels is expected to significantly change biodiversity worldwide. Marine ecosystems are affected by warming due to the "greenhouse effect" and acidification of seawater, because higher partial pressure of CO2 causes a decrease in calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation. Marine organisms, especially calcifiers such as corals and mollusks that build CaCO3 skeletons, are adversely affected by these changes, but effects of elevated CO2 levels on their physiology and calcification are not well understood. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marine calcifiers produce two types of CaCO3: aragonite and calcite. It is hypothesized that high sea water CO2 levels will affect aragonite-producing organisms more than those with calcite skeletons, since aragonite is more soluble than calcite. This project studies three common North American mollusk species with different shell mineralogies: eastern oysters (calcitic), hard shell clams (aragonitic), and blue mussels (mixed calcitic/aragonitic). Investigators will use state-of-the-art analysis to determine how elevated temperature and CO2 affect shell formation, mineralogy, structural and mechanical properties, as well as survivability, growth, energy metabolism and expression of calcification-related genes in these species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide new insights into the effects of temperature and CO2 level on energy metabolism and shell calcification in three important mollusk species representing the major calcifiers in coastal ecosystems as well as key species for fisheries and aquaculture. The proposed studies will also provide data for the marine carbon cycle models and help to predict effects of climate change on marine ecosystems and coastal economies worldwide. The project provides training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral and K-12 students with improved learning through peer- and hands-on programs, curriculum development and will strengthen collaborations among UNC Charlotte, University of Pittsburgh and Johnson C. Smith University.</AbstractNarration>
