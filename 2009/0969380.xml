    <AbstractNarration>Almost all of the visible mass that we see in the universe is contained in the atomic nucleus. It is of vital importance to gain experimental data about how nuclei are constructed to explain the early history of the universe, the abundances of the chemical elements in our solar system and even the distribution of these elements in our galaxy. An excellent nucleus to study for this purpose is the common isotope of helium, He-4. This nucleus will be a subject of study at Jefferson Lab by measuring the probability of knocking out protons with different energies using the high-energy electron beam. Another method of gaining insight into how nuclei are constructed is by placing short lived particles called hyperons in nuclei and observing the energy levels of these hypernuclei. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These experiments will provide vital training for graduate students and undergraduate students in nuclear and particle physics. The activities of these students will include helping set up the experiments, making the experimental measurements, analyzing the data and learning sophisticated simulation techniques. There is a desperate need for well trained physicists in the near future. The training the students receive has been shown to be transferable to other fields besides physics that benefit from the keen analytical skills they learn.</AbstractNarration>
