    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0907590 PI: Rajagopalan, Padmavathy ORG: Virginia Tech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Self Assembled Polymer Scaffolds for Liver Mimics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This proposal describes the development of liver-mimetic cellular architectures using self-assembled polymeric scaffolds. There is currently no generally applicable methodology to layer liver cells in vitro. Although two dimensional (2D) cell cultures and co-cultures are used extensively as model systems, they do not recapitulate key spatial, geometric, and physiological characteristics of cellular architectures found in vivo. The specific features of this proposal are the design of detachable polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films, the ability to incorporate cell-adhesive ligands such as galactose, tuning the physical properties of the scaffold, and the design of nanoporous detachable polyelectrolyte multilayer films. The specific objectives of the proposal are: (1) Design detachable chitosan/hyaluronan PEM films and demonstrate the feasibility of using them to assemble highly functional 3D liver-mimetic cellular architectures. (2) Tune PEM scaffold film properties to control cell growth and function. (3) Design and assemble nanoporous PEM scaffolds with tunable porosity for efficient transport of nutrients and metabolites. Such liver-mimetic tissues can serve as an accurate model for applications in bioreactor devices, understanding disease pathogenesis, toxicity evaluations, and in the testing of pharmaceuticals and drugs. The detachable PEM-scaffold can be modified, both chemically, and physically to incorporate a diverse range of cell types. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: Hepatocyte tissue culture has challenged the regenerative medicine field for some time. This proposal holds promise for facilitating a range of investigations of liver pathogenesis, toxicity, and, ultimately, liver-like bioreactor devices. The PI and Co-PI are both active participants in outreach and educational initiatives on the Virginia Tech campus. The PI will continue to participate in the VT STARS program, a 3-year residential program focusing on low-income, under-represented youth from South West Virginia, and she has just completed a term as Chair of the AIChE Women's Initiative Committee. The proposal also details her outreach to female middle and high school students designed to acquaint them with career opportunities in science and engineering. The Co-PI is a long time participant in the VT Summer Undergraduate Research Program supported by NSF REU and IGERT awards. Continued commitment to these and other educational initiatives can be anticipated.</AbstractNarration>
