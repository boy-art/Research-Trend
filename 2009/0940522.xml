    <AbstractNarration>The Ana G. Méndez University System (AGMUS) and its institutions - Universidad del Este (UNE), Universidad del Turabo (UT), and Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) - in collaboration with universities in Puerto Rico - the University of Puerto Rico, Inter American University (IAU), Universidad Politécnica de Puerto Rico (UPPR), and the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) - proposes to create an alliance to forming the Caribbean Computing Center for Excellence (CCCE). Additional partners for this project include the Puerto Rico Department of Education, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society Chapters in San Juan and Mayaguez, public and private high schools, INTECO and INTENOR (consortia of municipalities, institutions of higher education and industrial partners from the north and central east of the Island), the industrial and business community of Puerto Rico, and community-based associations in Puerto Rico. Extended partnerships include a number of research institutions on the US mainland and abroad. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CCCE aims to increase the recruitment and retention of students in the computing disciplines, with an emphasis on students from the underrepresented groups. It will recruit high school seniors with hands-on research experiences in university settings, deliver professional development to in-service high school teachers, provide undergraduates with a rich set of research opportunities in Puerto Rico, on the mainland and abroad, and work to prepare undergraduates for graduate school success.</AbstractNarration>
