    <AbstractNarration>A Summary&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary: This project focuses on the synthesis of new implicit learning-based methods that&lt;br/&gt;can optimally achieve some control objective for an uncertain nonlinear system. The main research goals&lt;br/&gt;include the development and experimental verification of implicit learning and adaptive methods that enable&lt;br/&gt;the mismatch between the desired and actual response of an uncertain nonlinear system to converge&lt;br/&gt;while optimizing a trade-off between performance and control energy. Efforts will investigate if different&lt;br/&gt;learning and adaptive methods have properties that yield more optimal solutions or lead to improved stability&lt;br/&gt;margins. Progress on this research topic has been stymied by the challenge of solving a Hamilton-Jacobi&lt;br/&gt;equation, and the lack of mathematical tools to asymptotically compensate for generic disturbances with a&lt;br/&gt;continuous controller. With the emergence of new implicit learning methods and general Lyapunov analysis&lt;br/&gt;techniques, the community is now well positioned to focus increasing attention on simultaneously achieving&lt;br/&gt;optimality and stability for uncertain nonlinear systems. The learning capacity of the developed controllers&lt;br/&gt;will enable analytical optimal control solutions for a broader class of engineering systems than is currently&lt;br/&gt;possible. Optimizing the performance of a control system along with the required control effort will yield&lt;br/&gt;improved efficiency that can lead to timely economic and environmental cost savings.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Few mathematical tools exist to synthesize controllers for nonlinear systems with model&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty and unmodeled disturbances. Of the few tools that exist, either the developed controller requires&lt;br/&gt;discontinuous feedback or exhibits degraded steady-state performance in the sense of residual errors.&lt;br/&gt;Recent developments have produced a new class of continuous controllers that can implicitly learn such&lt;br/&gt;disturbances through a nonlinear differential equation. This advancement opens new possibilities to refocus&lt;br/&gt;the nonlinear systems community on the dual stability and optimality problem for general systems. Efforts in&lt;br/&gt;this project seek to explore how such implicit learning controllers (and potential permutations) can be used&lt;br/&gt;to yield analytical solutions to different optimal control problems. The ability to integrate the proposed class&lt;br/&gt;of implicit learning controllers (and such controllers integrated with other adaptive and learning techniques)&lt;br/&gt;with optimal control methods is an unexplored concept. New closed-loop error system development, stability&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and optimal analysis methods will be required to determine the interplay of optimality, learning&lt;br/&gt;capacity, and robustness. Outcomes from these aims may provide an inroad to new ways to augment&lt;br/&gt;controllers to incorporate optimality into the design process.&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: The theoretical discoveries are expected to have a transformative impact on optimal control&lt;br/&gt;methods for uncertain nonlinear systems. One approach to solve current optimal control problems is to&lt;br/&gt;use numerical methods that only provide local optimal results (at best), typically do not have a proof of&lt;br/&gt;stability or optimality, and are typically open-loop. Also, numerical methods are black box approaches, so&lt;br/&gt;the designer is shielded from any intuition regarding the effect of the system parameters on the optimality.&lt;br/&gt;These issues motivate the need for analytical methods. Yet, the challenge to develop analytical solutions&lt;br/&gt;is that they often do not optimize the real engineering problem because of the narrow class of systems&lt;br/&gt;that can be analytically examined. The expected outcomes of this project are new mathematical tools to&lt;br/&gt;develop analytical stability and optimality solutions for broad classes of nonlinear systems. Further broad&lt;br/&gt;impact will be realized by integrating the research outcomes into educational and outreach efforts. Efforts&lt;br/&gt;will seek to disseminate the research outcomes to engineers in industry, researchers, and students ranging&lt;br/&gt;from grade school through graduate school with an emphasis on under-represented groups. Outcomes of&lt;br/&gt;the research will be disseminated to these groups through outlets including: peer-reviewed publications,&lt;br/&gt;conference workshops, curriculum development, the development of a new certificate program for industrial&lt;br/&gt;control engineers, undergraduate honor?s thesis research, existing University of Florida programs for highschool&lt;br/&gt;and under-represented students, and a robotics summer camp for grade school children.&lt;br/&gt;A-</AbstractNarration>
