    <AbstractNarration>Alkyl nitrates from the oceans significantly affect tropospheric ozone concentration. However, not all sources of oceanic alkyl nitrates have been identified. A few studies have demonstrated a photochemical source of oceanic alkyl nitrates but to date, limited, if any other sources have been identified. For this reason, a scientist from Loyola College proposes to investigate the biological source of alkyl nitrates from marine diatoms. Specifically, the research goals of the project would be the following: (1) determine if cultures of phytoplankton produce alkyl nitrates under 'normal' growth conditions and the rates of production of alkyl nitrates in the cultures; (2) determine if there are specific factors such as light, nutrients, and temperature that influence alkyl nitrate formation; and (3) determine if adding triggers or inhibitors of nitric oxide production in phytoplankton cause changes in alkyl nitrate production. The proposed work will improve our overall understanding of the potential sources of oceanic alkyl nitrates and the factors that may control these sources, as well as lead to new considerations in biogeochemistry as to what role phytoplankton may play in the nitrogen cycle specifically with regard to reactive nitrogen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards broader impacts, it is anticipated that results from the research will be incorporated into Biochemistry and Instrumental Analysis classes taught by the researcher. Two undergraduate students will be supported and trained as part of this project. These students will learn about culturing techniques and how to operate a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer.</AbstractNarration>
