    <AbstractNarration>This award allows the Illinois Institute of Technology to continue a program of research undertaken with Argonne National Lab to identify natural or constructed photoemissive materials that can produce bright electron beams of lower intrinsic (thermal) emittance than is currently achievable. Lowering the emittance of bright electron beams is a goal in the field of accelerator physics for the realization of next generation light sources and linear colliders. Investigation of samples of varying materials and surface preparations will be carried out for the purpose of determining optimal photocathode characteristics for the production of low emittance beams. This research should also lead to an evaluation of potential surface preparation techniques, such as thin film or atomic layer deposition, for use in control of emission properties. Another goal of the research is to aid in design optimization of the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectrometer (ARPES), which is being developed for intrinsic emission measurements at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). This research has been designated by the Physics Division as Potentially Transformative Research. It is challenging in nature yet the results could have major worldwide effects on accelerator design. Broader impacts include education and impacts on other fields of research. The research proposed would also provide opportunities for students at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) to become involved with a research effort at Argonne National Laboratory, while allowing them to work on contributions to the project in an IIT laboratory. The application oriented nature of this research can help cross the boundary between basic research and technological advance. Better light sources will advance research in medicine, geology, environmental science, and the biological, chemical and physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
