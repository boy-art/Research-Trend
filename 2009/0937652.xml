    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the EAGER project is to validate a completely new and untested concept: the superhydrophobic hybridization of concrete. This concept engages novel interdisciplinary perspectives by combining biomimetics, chemistry, and nanotechnology to produce a new generation of concrete that resolves the fundamental problems related to concrete behavior, such as durability and corrosion resistance. The objectives of the project are to 1. Evaluate the effect of: siloxane-based admixtures, superplasticizer, and mineral additives/ supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs). 2. Realize the concept of superhydrophobic hybridization of concrete pore space capable of providing a controlled air-void structure. 3. Obtain a basic understanding of concrete hydration and microstructure development with siloxanebased admixtures and superplasticizer, novel superhydrophobic admixtures, and mineral additives/SCMs. 4. Evaluate the strength and durability of cement based materials with superhydrophobic admixtures, which are important for designing UHPC to meet the performance criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This preliminary investigation will serve as a platform for the development of new types of cement-based materials, including those with ultra-high durability and increased volumes of mineral additives such as Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC), and self-healing materials. Furthermore, the cement industry currently contributes up to 5% of global CO2 emissions; thus, the application of concrete made with higher volumes of mineral additives also will provide greener solutions at lower costs.</AbstractNarration>
