    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses the question: What privacy rules should bind private corporations? It does so through a collaboration between a legal scholar knowledgeable about computer science issues and a computer scientist knowledgeable about legal and policy issues. The common themes running&lt;br/&gt;through the research are the current lack of agreed social norms concerning privacy, the interplay between computer security and privacy concerns, and the economic motivations that often are an important part of understanding various agents? actions. The goal is to contribute to the development of social norms concerning privacy that will simultaneously shape and inform both the development of appropriate technologies and appropriate business practices and laws. The interdisciplinary approach is essential to achieving this goal; it is also surprisingly unusual: There are remarkably few interdisciplinary examinations of privacy that effectively combine legal and computer science expertise. This project is a step toward remedying this lack. Together, the four aims address the immediate, serious, and unmet need for an approach to information privacy that is at once technically and legally sophisticated. The research will simultaneously shape and inform both the development of appropriate technologies and appropriate laws.</AbstractNarration>
