    <AbstractNarration>California State University (CSU) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program is a collaborative effort between the National Science Foundation and California State University institutions to increase the quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities matriculating to completion of the doctoral degree in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields (STEM) fields. The program at California State University, Northridge prepares students to meet the challenges of completing doctoral programs of study and for academic careers in higher education. In addition, the program develops leadership skills necessary for success in the STEM workforce nationally and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating research and education, the BD fellows will be nurtured over two years as a cohort community that will benefit from a program of academic and personal development activities as well as social support to sustain their commitment and success to the terminal Ph.D. STEM degree. Program activities include linkages with Graduate Education in the Professoriate (AGEP) institutions and other graduate education programs to advance students in Ph.D. programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve students from underrepresented minority populations in STEM fields will participate in the program at California State University, Northridge during the 2009-2011 academic years. Results from this support will broaden the participation of African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Pacific-Islanders in the STEM pipeline globally. Results from rigorous evaluation of the project will add to the body of literature in the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project anticipates that at least 95% of the new participants will complete Master?s degrees, and that at least 90% of these students will earn STEM doctorate degrees. This project not only targets a student population that might not otherwise pursue doctoral level training, but also makes a special effort to target STEM disciplines that have relatively low overall doctorate degree production and the lowest shares of URM students. In these disciplines (specifically, geological sciences, physics and astronomy, mathematics, engineering, and computer science), small increases in the number of doctorates awarded to URM students will have a significant impact on discipline demographics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BD project activities include a variety of valued ?best practices? for supporting and advancing LSAMP students. Specifically, the project provides the following: &lt;br/&gt;? rigorous Master?s-level course-work &lt;br/&gt;? a two-year research experience with the guidance of a faculty mentor;&lt;br/&gt;? professional development workshops and activities, including participation in scientific conferences; &lt;br/&gt;? monthly meetings to monitor student progress, &lt;br/&gt;? networking with other BD Fellows in doctoral programs, and &lt;br/&gt;? provide assistance with graduate school and fellowship applications.</AbstractNarration>
