    <AbstractNarration>0960177&lt;br/&gt;Holt&lt;br/&gt;Southern Illinois U. at Edwardsville&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI-R2: Acquisition of Raman and Infrared Microscopes for Interdisciplinary Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State-of-the-art physical methods offer as much to an anthropologist as they do to a chemist or biologist. Specifically, Raman and infrared (IR) microscopy will redefine our relationship to our research samples. Working together, these tools will enable new kinds of analyses that will significantly advance our research. For archaeological and museum research, Raman and infrared microscopy will add quantifiable dimensions to complement traditional methods of analysis. This precision will enable anthropologists to identify the provenience of many Native American artifacts that are scattered around the world in museums and private collections. Quantitative comparison of their fingerprint spectra will demonstrate with precision and objectivity whether archaeological pottery samples were manufactured at the same locale or not. Raman and IR microscopy are non-destructive, unlike many other techniques with similar goals. This feature is critical because each artifact is unique; when one is destroyed, the research cannot be repeated. In the biological and chemical sciences, IR and Raman analysis will enable innovative studies with significant impact on human health and the environment. These instruments are singularly well suited to the study of toxins and contaminants in complex substances such as animal tissues, as well as in naturally occurring soil-water environments. The identification and characterization of short-lived HNO complexes will further our understanding of the physiological role of the elusive HNO molecule. The Raman and IR microscopes will be housed and cared for by the Department of Chemistry at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, which is a primarily undergraduate institution serving both urban and rural communities. Acquisition of these instruments will enable our students to realize broader research and career potential in these diverse fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State-of-the art microscopic techniques are increasingly important to anthropologists, as they always have been to the chemist or biologist. Raman and infrared (IR) microscopes will enable us to determine with unparalleled precision the origins and chemical makeup of the samples that are the focus of our research. Specifically, these microscopic techniques will enable anthropologists at SIUE, and our colleagues at other institutions, to determine where and/or when Native American artifacts were made, and from what materials they were made. Our samples include archaeological pottery and stone tools, as well as more recent Native American artifacts. These can be compared with Native American materials held in museums and private collections around the world to determine trade patterns as well as migration routes. It is important to note that Raman and IR analysis, unlike many similar types of analysis, are not destructive to the artifacts or other materials being studied. Biologists and chemists in our group will use the microscopes to analyze samples including bones and soils to look for the presence of poisons and other contaminants. The results of their work will provide information about past human health, and will also provide timely information about the potential impact of environmental contaminants on the health of living humans. The Raman and IR microscopes will be housed and cared for by the Department of Chemistry at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, which is a primarily undergraduate institution serving both urban and rural communities. Using these microscopes will enable our students to realize broader research and career opportunities in anthropology, archaeology, biology, chemistry, and environmental sciences. This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
