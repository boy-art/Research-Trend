    <AbstractNarration>The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Gregory Tew of the University of Massachusetts Amherst whose research will develop a novel class of biomimetic polymers with potent cell-penetrating activity. Preliminary work has demonstrated the ability to build cell-penetrating peptide, or protein transduction domain mimics. The comprehensive structure-activity relationship proposed is essential for gaining novel insight and laying a foundation for understanding the behavior of these unique molecules. This work will probe fundamental concepts between polymer chemistry and membrane transduction activity. And, since these molecules traverse the phospholipid membrane, new insights will be gained on how molecules bind with and move across this critically important biological barrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research by Professor Tew combines state of the art organic and polymer chemistry with translocation across membranes and provides the opportunity to develop non-peptidic molecules that traverse the biological cell membrane barrier. This will have important applications in drug and non-viral gene delivery and also lay the foundation for learning how to target membranes within cells. Students trained within this multi-disciplinary proposal will become young scientists who are able to work across traditional disciplines. Professor Tew is an active participant in the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) National Meetings. He conducted a workshop entitled "Landing Your First Tenure Track Faculty Position" at the 2006 National Meeting and was recently appointed to the technical programming committee. This successful workshop was scheduled again for the 2009 Annual Meeting. A peer-mentoring program was established within Polymer Science and Engineering (PSE) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2005 which has received campus-wide recognition. The current proposal will be integrated into these on-going activities and specifically will be used as a platform for a new workshop at NOBCChE between students, the NOBCChE community, and industry focused on intellectual property and science. A provisional patent application has been filed covering the materials discussed in this proposal. It will be used as the platform to engage NOBCChE students in the topic of "translational research".</AbstractNarration>
