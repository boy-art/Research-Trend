    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on a plan to develop building blocks for a ligand type that has been shown to provide metal complexes possessing unique reactivity, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. NHCs are being exploited as ligands for a variety of transition metal catalysts, in a number of cases possessing better reactivity than ligands investigated previously. They have been shown to be instrumental in a number of important reactions the most important of which may be olefin metathesis. Additionally, NHCs have demonstrated activity in the area of nucleophilic catalysis. This work will develop approaches to provide building blocks that facilitate the synthesis of a variety of different NHC ligands. The methods developed in this work will facilitate the synthesis of a wide variety of N-heterocyclic carbenes and an even larger number of transition metal complexes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Scott R. Gilbertson in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Houston. Professor Gilbertson's research efforts revolve around the development of new ligands for catalysis. The discovery of new catalysts is often limited by the availability of new ligands. Consequently, the development of chemistry that provides access to new ligand types is important. New and efficient catalysts are critical in the manufacturing of many products, including therapeutic agents, agrochemicals, and commodity chemicals.</AbstractNarration>
