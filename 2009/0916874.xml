    <AbstractNarration>Due to the importance of uncertain data for a large number of applications,&lt;br/&gt;there has been significant recent interest in database support for uncertain&lt;br/&gt;data. Existing work in this area includes new models for uncertain data,&lt;br/&gt;prototype implementations, and efficient query processing algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;specific types of queries. Despite the recent efforts, several important aspects&lt;br/&gt;of uncertain data management remain unexplored. This project addresses two&lt;br/&gt;of these areas: Query Optimization and Support for Non-Relational Operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first goal is about efficient execution of uncertain data queries. As with&lt;br/&gt;traditional data, efficient execution is necessary for ensuring the viability of&lt;br/&gt;uncertain data management systems. However, due to the complications of&lt;br/&gt;ensuring correct results, and the need for CPU-intensive operations over&lt;br/&gt;probability distributions, the goal is critical and challenging. In this project,&lt;br/&gt;automatic query optimizations are developed, through query rewriting rules&lt;br/&gt;that involve probability threshold operators, corresponding access methods,&lt;br/&gt;and cost estimation functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difficulty of handling uncertainty when dealing with non-relational&lt;br/&gt;operators has been expressed in many domains. The project aims to&lt;br/&gt;advance the capability of tracking the exact impact of uncertain inputs as&lt;br/&gt;data is processed by arbitrary programs, leveraging advanced techniques&lt;br/&gt;from the area of program analysis. A key problem with traditional Monte&lt;br/&gt;Carlo based solutions lies in correctly identifying independence in the output&lt;br/&gt;of Monte Carlo simulations. Data lineage tracing, which identifies the set of&lt;br/&gt;inputs used to compute an output value, is used to address the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, a program dependence tracing based approach is devised to&lt;br/&gt;trace the propagation of uncertainty during execution of arbitrary binary&lt;br/&gt;code. The technique does not rely on Monte Carlo simulations, and does&lt;br/&gt;not require access to source code or domain knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/sunil/uncertainty</AbstractNarration>
