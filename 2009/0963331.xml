    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vassar College, an undergraduate liberal arts college with a long tradition of supporting faculty research and a commitment to educating students in the theory and practice of scientific research, will continue the transformation of research and research training by completely upgrading the electrical service and replacing the emergency electrical generator in Vassar's largest science building, the Olmsted Hall of the Biological Sciences. This will assure adequate electrical power for current equipment, future infrastructure upgrades, sophisticated new equipment, and increased computational power. The electrical service upgrade will support the research of fourteen current tenure line biology faculty members, including five hired in the past five years, all of whom have active and vibrant research programs. In addition, the upgrade will support the work of new hires that are anticipated in the next three to five years. Core research facilities that are shared with other science departments and that are housed in Olmsted Hall will be direct beneficiaries of the updated electrical service. Furthermore, the electrical service upgrade of Olmsted Hall will prepare the building to serve as the core of an integrated science center.</AbstractNarration>
