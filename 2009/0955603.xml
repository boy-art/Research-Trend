    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports the research of Professor Michael J. Baldwin of the University of Cincinnati (UC) Main Campus to develop stimulus-responsive chelates for light-triggered release of metal ions. Several families of metal chelators based on alpha-hyrdoxyacids (AHAs) are under investigation. This research program evaluates the extent to which modifications of the ancillary functional groups in AHA-containing chelates control the photochemical properties of their corresponding Fe(III) complexes. The researchers also determine the effect of the structural position of the AHA chelates (internal or external) on the photochemical properties of their Fe(III) complexes and identify other metal ions that form photoreactive complexes with the AHA-containing chelates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron has been recognized as an essential element in biological systems for centuries. Despite the recognition of this metal's importance, iron deficiency remains a problem for at least a third of the world's population and iron overload/toxicity caused by hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disease. This resesarch effort plays a role in understanding the mechanisms of iron uptake and release in bacterial pathogens, antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, and human iron deficiency and genetic diseases. On demand iron release can also be envisioned to be useful in many materials science applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also enhances the scientific workforce. Professor Baldwin and his group have strong, synergistic collaborations with faculty at two primarily undergraduate research institutions (PUIs) - Professor Michael Goldcamp at Wilmington College and Professor Richard Holtz at the College of Mount St. Joseph. The undergraduate students at these PUIs conduct experiments and share instrumentation at the UC. The graduate students in Professor Baldwin's research group are inspired by this interaction and often seek teaching positions at small colleges. Professor Baldwin also mentors Project SEED students - high school students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds - giving them relevant research experiences in a laboratory setting.</AbstractNarration>
