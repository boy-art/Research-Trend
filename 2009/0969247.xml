    <AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Mechanisms and Dynamics Program, Professor John Fourkas of the University of Maryland and his research group will develop a technique called parametrically amplified vibrational sum frequency generation (PAVSFG) for the study of the structure and dynamics of surfaces and interfaces. PAVSFG is an advanced version of conventional sum frequency generation spectroscopy, which is based on a second order nonlinear optical (NLO) process in which two low energy photons combine at a surface or interface to produce a high energy photon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since second order NLO processes are very weak in intensity, the parametric amplification process developed in the Fourkas lab will have positive consequences for a wide range of surface and interfacial science investigations, including biological membranes and catalyst surfaces. This project will also be the vehicle for training students and post-doctoral researchers in cutting-edge optical physics and physical chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
