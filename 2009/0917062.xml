    <AbstractNarration>Databases are typically used as a subsystem in a larger system that&lt;br/&gt;contains Web servers, application servers, and network-attached&lt;br/&gt;storage servers. Such complex systems experience some form of change&lt;br/&gt;all the time, e.g., an update to a Java module in the application&lt;br/&gt;server, a statistics update in the database, or a RAID rebuild in a&lt;br/&gt;storage volume. Such changes in different subsystems can cause an&lt;br/&gt;overall performance degradation whose cause is hard to diagnose. The&lt;br/&gt;diagnosis task is all the more daunting because enterprise&lt;br/&gt;environments have isolated administration teams and tools for each&lt;br/&gt;subsystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing an integrated tool called DIADS that&lt;br/&gt;automates complex administrative tasks like problem diagnosis, what-if&lt;br/&gt;analysis, orchestrating disaster recovery, and online tuning when a&lt;br/&gt;database is used as a subsystem in a larger system. DIADS contains two&lt;br/&gt;technical innovations. Problem diagnosis involves reconstructing&lt;br/&gt;system behavior at various points of time using historic and current&lt;br/&gt;monitoring data collected from the system. However, the amount and&lt;br/&gt;quality of monitoring data available from production systems is&lt;br/&gt;constrained by the need to keep monitoring overhead low. DIADS uses an&lt;br/&gt;abstraction called Annotated Plan Graph to represent and reason about&lt;br/&gt;database behavior in the context of a larger system. Annotated Plan&lt;br/&gt;Graphs are generated from light-weight monitoring data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other innovation in DIADS is a suite of workflows for&lt;br/&gt;administrative tasks that combine machine-learning techniques with&lt;br/&gt;domain knowledge from system experts. For example, for problem&lt;br/&gt;diagnosis, the machine-learning part of the workflow provides core&lt;br/&gt;techniques to handle large and noisy streams of monitoring data, while&lt;br/&gt;the domain-knowledge part acts as checks-and-balances to guide the&lt;br/&gt;diagnosis in the right direction. This unique design enables DIADS to&lt;br/&gt;function effectively even in the presence of multiple concurrent&lt;br/&gt;problems as well as noisy monitoring data prevalent in production&lt;br/&gt;environments. DIADS is being prototyped for research and educational&lt;br/&gt;purposes in a datacenter setting with PostgreSQL databases and an&lt;br/&gt;enterprise-level storage area network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page at &lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.duke.edu/~shivnath/diads.html</AbstractNarration>
