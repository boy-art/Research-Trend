    <AbstractNarration>Natural language processing, information extraction, information&lt;br/&gt;integration and other text processing solutions are central components&lt;br/&gt;of computer science, and key tools for addressing the ever-increasing&lt;br/&gt;problems in information overload. Issues of information overload are&lt;br/&gt;not only personal problems, but critical for business productivity,&lt;br/&gt;national defense, and increasingly government decision-making and&lt;br/&gt;transparency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State-of-the-art natural language processing is increasingly based on&lt;br/&gt;machine learning. However, the methodologies can be complex, and&lt;br/&gt;software infrastructure necessary for such systems is generally&lt;br/&gt;difficult to develop from scratch. To address this need we have&lt;br/&gt;created MALLET (MAchine Learning for LanguagE) and FACTORIE (Factor&lt;br/&gt;graphs, Imperative, Extensible), open-source software toolkit that run&lt;br/&gt;in the Java virtual machine. They provide many modern&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art machine learning methods, specially tuned to be&lt;br/&gt;scalable for the idiosyncrasies of natural language data, while also&lt;br/&gt;applying well to many other discrete non- language tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will fill three critical gaps: (1) broadening these&lt;br/&gt;toolkits' applicability to new data and tasks (with better end-user&lt;br/&gt;interfaces for labeling, training and diagnostics), (2) greatly&lt;br/&gt;enhancing their research-support capabilities (with infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;flexibly specifying model structures), and (3) improving their&lt;br/&gt;understandability and support (with new documentation, examples,&lt;br/&gt;online community support).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a direct positive impact on NLP and other&lt;br/&gt;machine learning research, on teaching, and on collaborative research&lt;br/&gt;activities. Well-designed toolkits not only help researchers avoid&lt;br/&gt;duplicate implementation effort, but (a) they encourage sharing of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and code, and thus also cultivate increased collaboration&lt;br/&gt;and intellectual flow of ideas; (b) they foster the communication of&lt;br/&gt;detailed clarity of algorithms and scientific reproducibility; (c)&lt;br/&gt;they help "level the playing field" by providing state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;implementations of foundational building blocks and recent methods to&lt;br/&gt;top-tier and small institutions alike; (d) they supply a teaching&lt;br/&gt;tool, not only by making it easy for students to experiment with the&lt;br/&gt;supplied research methodologies. Furthermore, by providing multiple&lt;br/&gt;ready-to-use systems, non-programmers will have access to modern,&lt;br/&gt;scalable implementations of text processing tools that will spread&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and use of these techniques across fields, to the social&lt;br/&gt;sciences, humanities, and bio-medical fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/nsf-mallet</AbstractNarration>
