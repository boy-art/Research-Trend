    <AbstractNarration>The PI plans to continue research in three inter-related areas. The first &lt;br/&gt;concerns geometric approximation of Kaehler metrics by Bergman metrics. &lt;br/&gt;The work of Tian, Yau and Zelditch shows that Kaehler metrics can be &lt;br/&gt;smoothly approximated by Bergman metrics, and this ``quantization process&lt;br/&gt;has found numerous striking applications to Kaehler geometry. The PI, in &lt;br/&gt;joint work with Phong, has shown that this approximation holds as well at &lt;br/&gt;the geometric level: thus, geodesic segments and geodesic rays can be &lt;br/&gt;canonically approximated by segments and rays in the space of Bergman &lt;br/&gt;metrics. The first project is aimed at deepening our understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;structure of the space of Kaehler metrics: The PI will investigate higher &lt;br/&gt;dimensional analogues of such Bergman approximations using methods of PDE &lt;br/&gt;and pluri-potential theory. The second project concerns K-stability and &lt;br/&gt;constant scalar curvature metrics. Here the motivating question is a &lt;br/&gt;conjecture of Donaldson which asserts that the non-existence of a csc &lt;br/&gt;metric should imply the existence of a geodesic ray along which the &lt;br/&gt;K-energy decreases. The PI will study this via the geodesic rays &lt;br/&gt;associated to test configurations (constructed in joint work with Phong). &lt;br/&gt;The next key step in this program is to prove C^{1,1} regularity of these &lt;br/&gt;rays using some of the recent advances in pluri-potential theory. The &lt;br/&gt;third project concerns the Kaehler-Ricci flow. The goal is to relate the &lt;br/&gt;S-condition and the B-condition (introduced in joint work with Phong, and &lt;br/&gt;studied as well in joint work with Song and Weinkove) to some of the more &lt;br/&gt;classical notions of stability in algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of this proposal concerns the Einstein equation, which &lt;br/&gt;originally arose in the theory of general relativity. The great insight &lt;br/&gt;from physics is that many of the mysteries of the universe can be &lt;br/&gt;explained if one accepts the notion that our universe is curved. This &lt;br/&gt;conceptual breakthrough may be compared to the discovery, dating back to &lt;br/&gt;the early Greek philosophers, that the surface of the earth is curved. The &lt;br/&gt;Einstein equation gives a mathematical formulation of the curvature &lt;br/&gt;properties of the universe which is precise enough to make accurate &lt;br/&gt;predictions for a vast range of large scale physical phenomena. It turns &lt;br/&gt;out, for reasons that remain quite obscure, that the same Einstein &lt;br/&gt;equations can also be used to resolve deep and longstanding problems in &lt;br/&gt;topology and geometry. The partial differential equations that arise in &lt;br/&gt;this approach are non-linear, and their study requires a broad range of &lt;br/&gt;tools from real and complex analysis, as well as algebraic and &lt;br/&gt;differential geometry. This project will investigate the interplay between &lt;br/&gt;these various branches of mathematics, with the goal of furthering the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of fundamental geometric structures.</AbstractNarration>
