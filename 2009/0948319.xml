    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research will examine sediment transport and deposition under varying fluvial discharge and oceanic conditions on the Waipaoa River shelf, New Zealand, and combined with work done at other river-shelf sites along the US West coast margin, create a framework to explain the differences and similarities amongst these river systems and assess transport and depositional patterns on as yet unexamined river-shelf systems.Objectives are to investigate the conditions under which preservable flood and storm beds form on the river shelf systems and to create a conceptual framework to predict preservation potential of flood and storm beds on margins.The study will entail rapid response sampling, experimental numerical modeling of hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics, and a global-scoped statistical analysis of the fluvial and oceanic conditions during sediment transport on shelf systems. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact include the support of a new, young female post-doctoral researcher and involvement of undergraduate and graduate students. The results could be useful to wide range of workers concerned with the coastal research and policy issues.</AbstractNarration>
