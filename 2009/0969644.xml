    <AbstractNarration>The PI's Tensor Triangular Geometry is an umbrella program covering the &lt;br/&gt;geometric study of tensor triangulated categories in algebraic geometry, &lt;br/&gt;modular representation theory, stable homotopy theory, motivic theory, &lt;br/&gt;noncommutative topology, and beyond. Be they modules, spaces, motives or &lt;br/&gt;C*-algebras, objects are usually too wild to be classified up to &lt;br/&gt;isomorphism. However, one can always classify classes of objects stable &lt;br/&gt;under the basic constructions which are: suspension, cone and tensor &lt;br/&gt;product (such classes are known as thick tensor-ideals). This &lt;br/&gt;classification is made by means of subsets of a certain topological &lt;br/&gt;space, constructed by the PI and called the triangular spectrum. This &lt;br/&gt;space has been computed in stable homotopy theory, algebraic geometry &lt;br/&gt;and modular representation theory, using the work of Hopkins-Smith, &lt;br/&gt;Neeman-Thomason, Benson-Carlson-Rickard and Friedlander-Pevtsova. &lt;br/&gt;Computing the triangular spectrum in noncommutative topology &lt;br/&gt;(equivariant KK-theory) or in motivic examples is a major ongoing &lt;br/&gt;project where progress has recently been made. The broader ambition of &lt;br/&gt;tensor triangular geometry is that of building brides across some parts &lt;br/&gt;of mathematics as follows: Identify the concepts, results and techniques &lt;br/&gt;from any area covered by tensor triangular geometry which can be &lt;br/&gt;abstracted and consequently applied to all other areas under the &lt;br/&gt;umbrella. Recent activity has exhibited numerous such phenomenons, in &lt;br/&gt;the PI's work and beyond, like filtration by dimension of supports, &lt;br/&gt;gluing techniques, Picard groups, Witt groups, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tensor triangular geometry is a relatively new theory which can &lt;br/&gt;simultaneously claim a large catalog of examples ranging from Algebra to &lt;br/&gt;Analysis, a strong corpus of abstract techniques and a broad range of &lt;br/&gt;applications. The strength of tensor triangular geometry is illustrated &lt;br/&gt;by several new theorems in algebraic geometry and modular representation &lt;br/&gt;theory, whose statement does not involve tensor triangular geometry but &lt;br/&gt;whose proof does. This project is highly interdisciplinary and appeals &lt;br/&gt;to mathematicians from very different horizons.</AbstractNarration>
