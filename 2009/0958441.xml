    <AbstractNarration>While areas of the US such as California and the East coast have major&lt;br/&gt;medical centers near every population center, there are many areas,&lt;br/&gt;even in developed countries, with a widely dispersed patient&lt;br/&gt;population with significant obstacles to advanced medical care.&lt;br/&gt;Victims of large scale natural disasters and battlefield casualties&lt;br/&gt;also lack state of the art care. Telesurgery could potentially meet&lt;br/&gt;these needs. There is a growing interest in computational research on&lt;br/&gt;intelligent telesurgery. Today's telesurgery systems do not integrate&lt;br/&gt;with medical imaging or have intelligent functions to assist the&lt;br/&gt;surgeon. This project is building seven teleoperated surgical robot&lt;br/&gt;and surgeon-interface systems powerful and precise enough to support&lt;br/&gt;research on advanced robotic surgery techniques at seven major&lt;br/&gt;research universities. University of Washington and University of&lt;br/&gt;California Santa Cruz are building the seven robots and will&lt;br/&gt;distribute them to Harvard, Johns Hopkins, University of Nebraska,&lt;br/&gt;U.C. Berkeley, and UCLA. When completed, the seven research lab&lt;br/&gt;robots will be networked together for sharing of software,&lt;br/&gt;interoperability, and on-line telesurgery experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will enable a network of researchers to&lt;br/&gt;prototype advanced surgical robotics techniques, and evaluate them in&lt;br/&gt;realistic contexts including appropriate animal procedures. Besides&lt;br/&gt;new and less invasive cures, such a technology can provide easier&lt;br/&gt;access to care in remote parts of the US, and the developing world.&lt;br/&gt; The seven cooperating labs, and external partners will be able to&lt;br/&gt;interconnect their systems, share modules of software, and replicate&lt;br/&gt;each others experiments.</AbstractNarration>
