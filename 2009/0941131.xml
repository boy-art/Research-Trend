    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide an interactive educational experience for business students that relates their science electives directly to their business curriculum through technology-enhanced, problem-based learning. The project will (1) advance the pedagogic integration of Earth and environmental sciences and related courses into a business curriculum by developing new trans-disciplinary active-learning course modules through a series of summer workshops for science and business faculty; (2) create new technology-enhanced class and laboratory activities by incorporating recent university investment in environmental and geochemical field and laboratory analytical instrumentation; and (3) assess the effectiveness of the curriculum enhancements during and following implementation of the technological innovations, multi-disciplinary course enhancements, and new active-learning course modules. The learning modules will address sustainability themes such as water resources, global climate change, environmental hazards, energy and mineral resources, and agriculture, and thus will provide a number of opportunities for interdisciplinary problem solving. Through a series of formative evaluations, the course modules will be refined and improved. Ultimately, the course modules will be made available to the larger science and business communities through educational websites. Outcomes and experiences will be communicated to the broader science and business education communities at national conferences and through educational publications. The project will not only enhance science learning and knowledge retention and improve the scientific literacy among future business leaders, but it also has the potential to increase the appreciation and understanding of science and the scientific method among business faculty, as well as to increase the appreciation of business issues among scientists.</AbstractNarration>
