    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Nanofluidics is a promising area where the fields of Chemistry, Biology, and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering all play a role. As the name implies, nanofluidics involves nano-scale&lt;br/&gt;channels used to transport fluids. By scaling down the size of the channels only a tiny&lt;br/&gt;amount of fluid is required to fill them, an important quality when dealing with expensive&lt;br/&gt;reagents. Scaled channels also enable concepts such as ?Lab on a Chip?, where nano&lt;br/&gt;channels transport reactants and analytes to a number of pico-liter sized reaction&lt;br/&gt;chambers so that a number of tests can be carried out quickly in a very small package.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal presents a methodology to interface electronics to nanofluidics. The&lt;br/&gt;electronics portion will provide ultra-sensitive electrometers placed in one wall of the&lt;br/&gt;nanochannel. An electrometer senses charge, so it can be used to detect charge change at&lt;br/&gt;the wall of the nanochannel or in the fluid near the wall. The surface of the electrometer&lt;br/&gt;could be functionalized to provide specific binding of reaction products, and the&lt;br/&gt;electrometer signal would then represent the density of the bound product. The goal is to&lt;br/&gt;achieve single ion detection in the channel.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is that it addresses the lack of a suitable&lt;br/&gt;electrical transducing element. Most fluidic experiments done today use optical&lt;br/&gt;transduction based on fluorescence. Electrical transduction would enable a simple&lt;br/&gt;interface to standard electronics, leading to reduction in system size and cost. Singleelectron&lt;br/&gt;transistor electrometers are the most sensitive known, but have yet to be applied&lt;br/&gt;to nanofluidics. The proposed research is transformative in a number of ways. It will&lt;br/&gt;develop a process that should be scalable and manufacturable, and it will extend CMP&lt;br/&gt;processing into nanoscale dimensions. The integration of room temperature electrometers&lt;br/&gt;with nanofluidic channels will enable a number of applications, perhaps even the rapid&lt;br/&gt;sequencing of DNA. A key feature is the easy integration of these devices with CMOS&lt;br/&gt;will form an excellent bridge between nanoelectronics and the enormous base of CMOS&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed project will be in both scientific and educational&lt;br/&gt;impact. The scientific impact will come from the research developing the theory and&lt;br/&gt;devices for silicon-based QCA. This project will also make a significant outreach to&lt;br/&gt;middle school students in the South Bend, Indiana area. South Bend public schools have&lt;br/&gt;a diverse student population with a large number of students from groups&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in the areas of science and technology. The outreach program proposed&lt;br/&gt;will target middle school students through classroom activities involving faculty and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, and field trips to bring students to the Notre Dame labs. Middle school&lt;br/&gt;aged children are an excellent group for outreach since they are advanced enough to&lt;br/&gt;understand science, but are still making choices about their areas of interests. The&lt;br/&gt;outreach will benefit the middle schoolers by giving them a first-hand taste of science in&lt;br/&gt;both the classroom and lab.</AbstractNarration>
