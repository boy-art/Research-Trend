    <AbstractNarration>The object of this research is to develop a new platform concept, BioBolt, as a distributed wireless neural interface for minimally-invasive, fully-implantable epidural recording. The approach is to implement a stand-alone wireless link for a number of microelectrodes, which can be easily placed on the dura mater through a small hole in the skull by simple operation procedure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical challenge is to implement an extremely low-power wireless link in a small form factor. The proposed system consists of multiple BioBolts and MasterBolt. Spatially distributed BioBolts in the region of interest record the neural activities and send signals to MasterBolt. We explore the intra-skin wireless communication between BioBolt nodes and MasterBolt, which allows extremely low power signal transmission under 5?√ùW. MasterBolt transmits all the collected neural signals from the neighboring BioBolts using single-channel FM modulation with a power budget of &lt;1mW. This system gives flexibility and expandability for long-term chronic monitoring of neural signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully-implanted distributed wireless microsystems for epidural neural recording will provide a new tool to study and understand the collective brain activities for practical interface with computer, prosthetic devices and control of impaired body. The completed system developed in this project will expand the potential applications for brain-to-computer interfaces beyond simple cursor control and offer people with motor disabilities a good alternative to natural communication and movement. This project will train graduate and undergraduate students across the different disciplines to implement an important interface between brain and electronics.</AbstractNarration>
