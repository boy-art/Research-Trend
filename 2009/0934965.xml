    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The La Verne Noyce Teacher Scholars (LVNTS) program is a collaborative effort between the University of La Verne's College of Arts &amp; Sciences (CAS),the College of Education &amp; Organizational Leadership (CEOL), and local high need school districts in Southern California. The LVNTS program provides two scholarship options. The first option is for undergraduate transfer or in-house Biology, Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics majors interested in teaching. The undergraduate scholarship provides tuition support for the junior and senior years, and credential year one. The second option is for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) graduates from other institutions who desire to become teachers in STEM disciplines. The graduate scholarship provides tuition support for the year long certification program. Twelve three-year awards (junior through fifth year) and 8 one-year awards (certification only) are anticipated. In addition, the LVNTS program provides summer internship opportunities for undergraduates focusing on STEM disciplines and teaching in summer science camps and working with faculty. Fourteen internship opportunities are being offered. Every candidate that is recommended for a credential by the state of California must complete a two-year Beginning Teacher Support &amp; Assessment Induction Program to clear his/her credential. As part of this program, a qualified mentor teacher supports the new teacher. In addition, the LVNTS program coordinator and a support group, composed of former La Verne students now past their first two years of teaching, maintain contact with the Noyce Scholars to provide support, assess their needs, and verify service.</AbstractNarration>
