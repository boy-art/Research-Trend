    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to quantify the inherent predictability of observed precipitation variations over the U.S. on seasonal to multi-decadal timescales. The questions to be addressed include: 1) What amount of observed seasonal-mean precipitation variability is uniquely related to variations in the background state of the observed system during a given time-period? 2) When and where do these inherently predictable variations in seasonal-mean precipitation occur within the U.S.? 3) What is the inherent predictability of short-term (&lt;12-months) and long-term (&gt;12-month) drought occurrences? 4) Do numerical climate models adequately reproduce the inherent predictability of precipitation variations over the U.S.?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer these questions, the investigators will (i) construct stochastic weather-generation models based upon observed station-based daily precipitation, which can be used to establish the envelope of variability that arises solely from the random behavior of precipitation events, (ii) identify observed interannual to multi-decadal scale variations in seasonal-mean precipitation across the U.S. that lie outside this envelope produced by chance, (iii) use the observed and stochastically-generated daily-precipitation time-series to detect inherently-predictable variations in the severity of drought, as represented by the Standard Precipitation Index, and (vi) evaluate numerical model capability in reproducing the observed inherent predictability of seasonal-mean precipitation and drought over the U.S., using daily precipitation estimates from numerical model representations of the climate of the 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project will include improving our confidence in climate forecasts for many regions of the U.S by identifying "hot-spot" regions of historical predictability that are strongly influenced by climate-change processes. Further it will establish the groundwork for a better understanding of the role that regional- and large-scale atmospheric circulations and ocean- and land-surface forcings play in modifying regional precipitation on interannual to multi-decadal time-scales. It will also guide future investigations into numerical model systems' portrayal of physical mechanisms that give rise to observed predictability. Finally, it will help determine the applicability of using stochastic weather-generation models for identifying and analyzing inherently predictable precipitation variations in other regions of the world.</AbstractNarration>
