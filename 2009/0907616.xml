    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: This project advances fundamental understanding of diffusion bonding in iron- and nickel-based alloys. Diffusion bonding could play a critical role in the development of the next generation of metal alloys used in power plants and turbines, as higher working temperatures will require careful control over metal alloy composition and microstructure. In this research results of experimental testing are integrated with the Ther-moCalc/DICTRA software packages and user-created MATLAB algorithms to create modeling tools capable of estimating the performance of diffusion-bonded joints. Increased demand for energy conversion efficiency means that components like heat exchangers and turbines must run hotter and last longer without a shutdown. A variety of nickel- and iron-based alloys can meet these demands using carefully controlled chemistry and processing. Fabrication and repair using these alloys demand development of robust joining methods that preserve properties in the region of the joint. Diffusion bonding is an excellent candidate for this purpose. The research employs a combination of microstructural analysis, mechanical testing, and numerical calculation to create tools that predict the properties of diffusion-bonded joints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL: The educational structure of the program incorporates the current best practices of engineering education including hands-on activities, peer mentoring and practical applications of engineering theories. Undergraduate and graduate researchers collaborate in the research activities. The integrated research and educational objectives broaden access to engineering for students that might not have otherwise considered it while also improving the skills and expertise of those already enrolled. Educational activities including peer mentoring, collaborative high school/undergraduate design projects, a summer academy, and activities for underrepresented minorities. Native American students participate in educational activities as part of a larger program designed to attract and retain them in math, science and engineering. High school students that his-torically have not pursued engineering in college are targeted by a collaborative design project and summer academy. The program?s experimental tests and results will be integrated into at least four upper-division or graduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
