    <AbstractNarration>This project is awarding scholarships to 30 academically talented but financially needy upper-division undergraduate students who are pursuing baccalaureate degrees with majors or minors in mathematics. It is also awarding scholarships to 15 graduate students in applied mathematics. The undergraduate scholarships are targeting students transferring from community colleges, and the intent is that financial support will provide additional incentive for these students not only to finish their undergraduate degrees, but also to pursue graduate degrees. The success and eventual graduation of the scholars is being supported through common course scheduling, peer mentoring, and internship and research experiences. Some of the goals of the project are to increase the number of students pursuing degrees in mathematics, to establish supportive cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students, to expand recruitment of STEM undergraduates from community colleges, to broaden the career options of students by encouraging advanced mathematics coursework, and to provide workforce-ready graduates trained on industry-standard software packages.</AbstractNarration>
