    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to design and demonstrate integrated circuits that can generate signals at terahertz frequencies and process information at tens of giga-samples per second with low power consumption in standard silicon processes. The approach is based on special wave propagation phenomena and applying them to nonlinear or inhomogeneous electrical lattices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The research is focused on developing a new method of circuit design when the devices operate close to or even beyond their maximum unity power gain frequency. The main contribution is to demonstrate fundamentally novel high frequency signal generation and processing systems with orders of magnitude better performance in terms of maximum output power, operating frequency, power efficiency, and bandwidth compared to the existing methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The expected research results have the potential to have a transformative impact on electronic systems, such as communication devices, radars, signal sources, and processors, where higher operation frequency translates to higher data rate or better resolution. The research blends multiple disciplines within the fields of electrical engineering, applied physics and mathematics into a coherent research theme. This provides an excellent educational opportunity for the students that carry out the research. Women and minority students from underrepresented groups will be actively recruited and trained in this research environment. The research results will be used to develop new courses that emphasize on fundamental understanding and are project-based. To involve the public in the research, workshops and short online videos are planned.</AbstractNarration>
