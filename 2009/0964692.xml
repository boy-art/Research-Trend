    <AbstractNarration>This project will examine how Earth's magnetosphere-ionosphere system reacts to the high-speed plasma wind streaming from the Sun. It will extend the mathematical model called WINDMI to describe the storage and release of energy in multiple reservoirs for plasma trapped in the magnetosphere. It will develop a theoretical description for the dynamics of the supersonic solar wind plasma energy, through the magnetosphere to the high-density cold ionospheric plasma. The model will be by projecting the ideal MHD continuum equations and the more accurate kinetic theory equations onto the currents and plasma components of the driven magnetospheric magnetic components. The projections will lead to a set of coupled differential equations for the key plasma currents, densities, and temperatures. New physics components will be developed for the dayside of the magnetosphere. The dayside physics has a collisionless bow shock that reduces the supersonic flow to subsonic, while compressing the plasma and the embedded interplanetary magnetic field. A complex set of plasma currents control the plasmas in the magnetosphere and in the magnetopause boundary layer. The model will use kinetic theory calculations to describe the boundary layers and the mechanism for how the plasma is heated. The model will integrate diverse aspects of the plasma physics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system and use scientific computing to derive real-time dynamics for the system. The model will predict the magnetic field that are used to define magnetic storms and substorms. These predictions will be compared with observations to validate the model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is of intrinsic scientific interest in its investigation of the interaction of supersonic plasma winds with dipole magnetic obstacles. It also has societal relevance by providing a new tool for forecasting the occurrence of dangerous space weather storms. Much of the research will be performed by graduate students and the project therefore has significant educational benefits.</AbstractNarration>
