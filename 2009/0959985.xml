    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 09-59985&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Adjouadi, Malek; Barreto, Armando B.; Gaillard,William; Jayakar,Prasanna; Rishe, Naphtali D.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Florida International University &lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI-R2/Dev: Instrument for Information Science and Computing in Neuroscience&lt;br/&gt;This project, developing an instrument for information processing and computing that enables cohesive study of the brain, involves the new concept of a 5-D brain processing platform while addressing the challenge of finding the best way to put together five dimensions to provide a complete picture of brain dynamics. This unified approach brings together fields of Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Bioengineering to create an instrument for precisely measuring and visualizing significant information and results across the five dimensions, three from spatial data, time, and an imaging modality that serves as the fifth dimension. Accomplishing this mission involves advanced designs, hardware-software integration mechanisms, and novel interfaces that bring competing, and sometimes diverging, technologies into a unified brain research platform. Combining a Multi-site Data Repository, Modality Integration and Computational, Visualization, and Operation Support Units, this new instrument is expected to bring:&lt;br/&gt;- New insights into brain structure, functional correlations and dynamics, both in its normal state and under specific pathological conditions,&lt;br/&gt;- Far improved mapping of patterns of brain activity,&lt;br/&gt;- Integration of multimodal technologies in order to augment their capabilities with new insights while consolidating high spatial resolution with high temporal resolution,&lt;br/&gt;- Database design and management augmented with mechanisms for fast user interaction and visualization to meet the challenge of managing complex spatio-temporal datasets, posing complex queries, and establishing effective methods for data representation and visualization, and&lt;br/&gt;- Resolution of those paradigms that confront heavy computational requirements and compatibility problems that arise from the use of different recording modalities and diverse software platforms.&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to collectively overcome the primary barriers in identifying the different factors that influence the functional organization of the brain and its underlying pathology. As an example, it delves in the epileptic seizure that can be mapped over time as it moves along specific fiber tracts that may enable better identification of specific areas of treatment and consequently protect functionally important parts of the brain during surgery that may lead to better and safer outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Fostering an environment that supports cross disciplinary initiatives, joint collaboration and programs, the instrument establishes a research platform that enables academic institutions and hospitals to investigate multi-site collaborative studies in accordance to systematically administered standardize protocols to a database of common assessments and measures. The project extends the breadth and depth of multidisciplinary efforts including new paradigms and findings. Moreover, the project advances the education, research, and training of many students in a minority serving university.</AbstractNarration>
