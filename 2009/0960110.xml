    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0960110&lt;br/&gt;Sellmyer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;Installation of the proposed field-emission (scanning) transmission-electron microscope (FE(S)TEM), in a custom-designed facility at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, will provide all researchers in nanoscale science and technology and in advanced materials throughout the University of Nebraska with access to advanced instrumentation for research use, research training, and related education. It will enable faculty and students to characterize flexibly and efficiently the detailed structure, composition, morphology and many properties of nanoscale materials and devices, including interfaces and important imperfections at near-atomic scale. This key enhancement will expand the ability of researchers to visualize their particles, thin films, patterned surfaces, wires and devices in ways that they need, but do not yet have access to in Nebraska or nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial scientific goals of research include materials research on: quantum electronic, spintronic and magnetic phenomena and device applications; chiral nanostructured hybrid materials; novel low-work-function and semiconducting materials; and nanoscale hard-magnet materials destined to provide more energy-efficient motors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The related research and training activities include greater emphasis on outreach and research collaboration across the Nebraska and beyond, with the aid of the integrated telemicroscopy facility of the FE(S)TEM. The FE(S)TEM will enable enhanced recruitment of, and research productivity by, more graduate students, and will enable the investigators to expand recruiting and work with students from under-represented groups beyond present levels. The FE(S)TEM will be featured in upper-level and graduate courses, and in materials research science and engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LAYMAN ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;The operation and performance of each generation of the new materials and technology that we quickly take for granted in the work place, in travel, in communication, in entertainment and in personal life depends on the structure and properties of the key constituents at the level of individual atoms and molecules. Advanced electron microscopes, especially the field-emission (scanning) transmission-electron microscope (FE(S)TEM) that will be acquired in this project, provide researchers with the analysis tools they need to understand the performance of their latest materials and devices and to conduct research that enables the next generations of new materials and technologies. Installed in our custom-created electron microscope environment, the FE (S)TEM will provide for research use, research-training, and related education and will expand the ability of researchers to visualize their particles, thin films, patterned surfaces, wires and devices in ways that they need, but do not yet have access to in Nebraska or nearby. The materials and technology applications include: alternative and renewable energy capture, storage and supply; faster, smaller and more secure communications and information technologies that also demand less energy; detectors for use in national security, medicine, science and space; and light, strong magnets for energy-efficient cars and transportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's research and training activities include added emphasis on outreach and research collaboration across the Nebraska and beyond, aided by the integrated telemicroscopy facility of the FE(S)TEM. The FE(S)TEM will help in recruiting, educating and training a more diverse range of students for the U.S. and Nebraskan workforce. The FE(S)TEM will enhance advanced-undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as all materials research science and engineering education.</AbstractNarration>
