    <AbstractNarration>Based on the NSF-funded design study of the High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz (HEAT) telescope and successful deployment of its prototype at Dome A, this proposal seeks funding to build a fully automated, 0.6-meter THz astronomical observatory for remote operation at the highest location on the Antarctic Plateau (Ridge A, ~200 km south of the Chinese summer station Kunlun). The HEAT telescope will cover the 158 to 372 microns band observing the brightest spectral lines from the Milky Way Galaxy in which the most crucial astrophysical spectral diagnostics of the formation of galaxies, stars, planets, and life are found. The telescope will be mounted on top of the Australian University of New South Wales' PLATeau Observatory (PLATO) module that provide housing for the instrument's electronics and diesel engines used to generate electrical power during winter observations. The PLATO and telescope will operate autonomously for over a year at a time, with commands and data being received and transmitted from/to the home institutions via Iridium satellites daily. It is expected that HEAT will see good atmospheric transmission above the 200-microns band during much of the winter, and usable transmission in the pivotal 160 microns window will be seen for more than 10% of the wintertime. The Ridge A site is undeveloped but may actually be the driest, calmest, and clearest point on the Dome A summit. Thus, the proposed telescope will test this site while obtaining important astronomical spectral data and forging entirely new capabilities for ground-based infrared and submillimeter astronomy that otherwise would be unachievable except via expensive airborne or space-based platforms. This pioneering mission will pave the way for future astronomical investigations from the Antarctic Plateau and other potential high-altitude sites around the World. The proposed project contributes to the education of a graduate student, thus helping to grow a generation of young researchers in the field of astronomy.</AbstractNarration>
