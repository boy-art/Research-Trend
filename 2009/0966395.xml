    <AbstractNarration>This U.S.-India International Research Experience for Students(IRES)award is for a Summer Research Program in Green Chemistry that will take place at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science(IACS)in Kolkata, India. It is an opportunity for twelve Southeast Missouri State University(SMSU) undergraduates to conduct research in Green Chemistry at the IACS under lead mentor, Professor B.C. Ranu, Head of the Department of Organic Chemistry and four organic chemists in his department. For each of three years, four students will spend 8 weeks at the IACS working on collaborative research projects investigating catalysts for organic synthesis and visiting nearby research facilities. &lt;br/&gt;Conducting research in Green Chemistry at a well-known post-graduate research institution in India with highly qualified investigators has great strength and the potential to provide an innovative, quality research experience for SMSU undergraduates. The intellectual merit of this proposal is strong and the research topic timely. The technical qualifications of the Indian lead mentor are unquestionably high, the proposed research topics are well-thought-out, and they address cutting-edge topics of both academic and applied chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
