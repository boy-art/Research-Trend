    <AbstractNarration>The origin of species remains an especially difficult problem in biology because the processes through which reproductive barriers arise between diverging populations remain poorly understood. This project will advance understanding of the origins of diverse tropical plant taxa through study of the nature of reproductive barriers in Metrosideros, a highly diverse genus of tropical forest trees that vary in their degree of divergence and isolation. This project will integrate molecular genetic methods and field experiments to determine the nature and degree of pre- and post-zygotic barriers to hybridization between co-occurring taxa at sites that vary in rates of natural hybridization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide insight into the speciation process in long-lived forest trees, a group that is responsible, directly or indirectly, for much of the high diversity of tropical forest ecosystems. This CAREER project integrates research and education to promote scientific literacy and skills at all levels of the education pipeline in one of the most culturally diverse regions of the U.S. The project will engage students from underrepresented groups in the STEM pipeline, which will broaden the career choices for these individuals while helping to advance the diversity of the science and technology workforce. The project includes development of graduate and undergraduate courses that include authentic research experiences, mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach to K-12 teachers and students.</AbstractNarration>
