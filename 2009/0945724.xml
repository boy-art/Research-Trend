    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a unique material constructed from processed dairy manure for the replacement of peat moss in horticultural media. The new material will also incorporate beneficial microbes for improving plant growth. This product will solve two problems at once, eliminate environmental damage caused by the harvesting of peat moss and provide a new use for millions of pounds of animal waste produced in the U.S. each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be a new use for dairy waste in the U.S. The product would be a major improvement in support material presently used to grow turf for lawns and golf courses and lead to reduced use of peat moss. Formulations containing beneficial microbes would improve the performance and stress tolerance of plants and reduce the use of fertilizer containing chemicals. The technology is also carbon neutral and environmentally green.</AbstractNarration>
