    <AbstractNarration>Endocrine signaling during embryonic development regulates many physiological processes and can produce long-term effects that may persist throughout the lifetime of an organism. For example, the embryo may be exposed to steroid hormones produced by the mother. In mammals, including humans, the placenta produces enzymes that metabolize, and render inactive, maternal steroids before they reach the developing embryo. Thus, the embryo is buffered from the potentially detrimental effects of maternal steroids. In species that lay eggs, embryos are exposed to maternal steroids present in the yolk when the egg is laid. This project examines how maternal steroids move from the yolk to the embryo in turtles. In addition, a variety of molecular and biochemical techniques will be employed to characterize how these maternal steroids are metabolized during embryonic development. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of how embryos regulate their endocrine environment. Importantly, many of the same metabolic enzymes examined in this proposal are also responsible for metabolizing exogenous chemicals such as plasticizers and pesticides. Characterizing these enzymes will enable researchers to investigate whether these foreign chemicals may disrupt steroid metabolism to produce detrimental effects. Compared to those from live-bearing species, embryos from egg-laying species provide a powerful system in which to study how various factors influence embryonic steroid metabolism because they develop outside of the maternal environment and can be readily manipulated. All experiments in this proposal will provide training opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students, as well as a post-doctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>
