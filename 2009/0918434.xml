    <AbstractNarration>This project combines the expertise and resources of the University of Illinois at Chicago Learning Sciences Research Institute, the University of Texas Dana Center, the Urban Mathematics Leadership Network, and the Agile Mind educational software company to design, develop, and test student and teacher instructional materials and software for Algebra I. The innovative course is explicitly designed to address the needs of students whose interest and prior achievement in mathematics make that subject especially challenging for them. The project starts from the assumption that those struggling students need to and can master the concepts and skills of a rigorous Algebra I course. However, the developers argue that chances of success will be greatly enhanced if algebra classes for those students provide more instructional time and special complementary activities focused on social, affective, linguistic, and strategic cognitive and meta-cognitive dimensions of learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has identified a set of design principles for instructional materials that draw from research on students with special learning needs, and it uses those principles in a design-based research process to construct and study effects of the Intensified Algebra materials. The core of the curriculum materials is the Agile Mind computer-based Algebra I software, a program that is enhanced by inclusion of coordinated youth development experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses a series of research questions about usability and effects of the new Algebra I course. Those questions are studied with a two-tier research effort over three years. Teaching and learning are examined intensively in a small set of experimental classes to gain insights necessary for iterative development of the curriculum materials and teacher resources. A larger sample of experimental classes are studied less intensively, with survey methods, in order to gain understanding of the challenges confronting dissemination of the emerging program to a larger, less directly supported family of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of the final products will gain substantial momentum through the Urban Mathematics Leadership Network whose members are 22 of the largest U. S. urban school districts and have expressed strong support for the importance of the planned algebra initiative.</AbstractNarration>
