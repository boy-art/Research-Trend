    <AbstractNarration>This project establishes the Seattle Hub for Industry-driven Nanotechnology Education (SHINE) to promote nanotechnology education in the Pacific Northwest. The two main thrusts of the project are educational program improvement and faculty development. The program improvement activities are designed to create a sustainable outreach network that engages K-12 classrooms, after-school programs and informal learning events throughout the Seattle area. The program improvement activities are also intended to diversify the student population that is enrolled in the nanotechnology programs at North Seattle Community College. The faculty development activities are designed to educate high school and community college STEM instructors in nanotechnology and advanced pedagogical techniques. The project includes both formative and summative assessment plans that measure the progress of the project and its impact on students, instructors and the community. All of the materials developed during the course of the project are going to be freely disseminated via a website hosted by NACK, the NSF funded ATE national center located at Penn State University.</AbstractNarration>
