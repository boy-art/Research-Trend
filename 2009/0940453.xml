    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;09 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0940453&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI)&lt;br/&gt;PI: A. Suchy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support (SSSE) items for the vessels operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute; namely the R/V ATLANTIS, KNORR, and OCEANUS. The requests specifically include items that have been recommended from past NSF inspections, Navy INSURV's, or Post-Cruise Assessments (PCA's) and have been otherwise deferred by the operator due to cost. All of the items requested will either improve safety, enhance science support capability, or extend vessel service life. Due to the nature and timing of these requests, the vendor quotation standards normally required by the SSSE Program were waived out of necessity with many of the figures provided as estimates for budgetary purposes and based mainly on past experience of the vessel operators for similar work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute vessels support federally-funded scientific research throughout the world's oceans and routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. WHOI also participates in a large number of outreach programs including web broadcasts from vessel while at sea, open house events, and other initiatives such as Dive and Discover with the submersible ALVIN. All told, WHOI vessels are scheduled to complete over 560 NSF sponsored days in 2009.</AbstractNarration>
