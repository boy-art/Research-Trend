    <AbstractNarration>The 2009-2011 Bridge to the Doctorate Program of the Greater Philadelphia Region Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Philadelphia AMP)will expand and intensify the alliance's on-going efforts to substantially increase the number of qualified African American, Hispanic and Native American students entering graduate study in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), attaining doctoral degrees, and moving into the professoriate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Philadelphia AMP represents a diverse alliance of nine institutions consisting of public and private, 2- and 4-year research and non-research, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and majority institutions. Delaware State University is the site for the 2009-2011 Bridge to the Doctorate program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of Philadelphia AMP's Bridge to the Doctorate project are to: (1) recruit twelve students into masters degree programs at Delaware State University; (2) retain these students through the completion of the Masters program providing them with full qualifications for admission into a highly regarded Ph.D. program in their chosen STEM specialty with full financial support; (3) enable their admission and smooth transition into a Ph.D. program; and (4) monitor their progress through Ph.D. completion into employment. We aim to have 100% of these students successfully complete their graduate study and enter a STEM career, with many progressing into the professoriate at institutions of higher education. The students will be able to matriculate into 10 STEM M.S. programs (chemistry, applied chemistry, applied mathematics, mathematics, physics, applied optics, natural resources, biology, neuroscience, and plant science), many of which are underrepresented by minorities.</AbstractNarration>
