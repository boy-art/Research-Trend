    <AbstractNarration>This theoretical physics research revolves around the unprecedented opportunities created by our experimental ability to measure and control atoms and molecules. For example, individual atoms can be used as a clock to measure time and space to an incredible precision, and are used in the global positioning system satellites to enable location pin-pointing here on Earth. The experimental advances drive the need for high-precision calculations on the interactions of atoms and their ions with electric and magnetic fields. The physical interactions between two, three and four atoms will also be characterized through the development of novel theoretical and computational tools towards improving the control of chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The massive set of data produced during the course of this project will be compiled into a prototype atomic, molecular and optical physics database, called 'Atom Foundry'. Computational science and physics undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in all aspects of the research including the development of a website, designed around a periodic table, except that it will access the Atom Foundry database. This will give other researchers more information on how to manipulate our atomic building blocks for future applications such as the ions used in quantum computers and the atoms used in nanotechnology. All of which are part of the quest for the building of smaller and smaller useful things.</AbstractNarration>
