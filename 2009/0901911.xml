    <AbstractNarration>The last few years have seen tremendous progress in the field of Geometric Functional Analysis (also known as Asymptotic Geometric Analysis), which is the mathematical study of geometric objects of many dimensions or many parameters. The conference The State of Geometry and Functional Analysiwill focus on the present achievements and future directions of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis, and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference The State of Geometry and Functional Analysis will be held at Tel-Aviv University (3 days) and at the Dead-Sea (2 days) in the last week of June 2009. This proposal seeks funding for US participants of this conference. The conference will be an opportunity to attract some of the leading mathematicians of our time and also to create an environment in which students could profit from the interaction with such top experts.</AbstractNarration>
