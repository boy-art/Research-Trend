    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is supporting the organization of a series of interactive, web-based faculty development workshops to improve the participants' proposal writing skills for educational development projects that are submitted to the Course, Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) Program and other NSF programs. The workshops, which are based on a successful pilot effort, are being presented by the engineering program directors of the Division of Undergraduate Education using webinar software. The principal investigator is organizing ten interactive-web-based proposal writing workshops with each involving 15-20 institutions and a 150-200 participants. He is scheduling the workshops, inviting all institutions with accredited engineering degree programs to participate, handling all questions and registration details, providing operational guidelines to local facilitators, and collecting and reviewing participant demographics and assessment data collected to improve the workshops. The broader impacts of this project include outreach to a large and diverse set of faculty who may not have access to proposal writing workshops in any other way.</AbstractNarration>
