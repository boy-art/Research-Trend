    <AbstractNarration>0959679&lt;br/&gt;Wu&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina Central U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanostructured materials are increasingly important to fundamental and applied research in a wide range of scientific disciplines. This proposal requests funding for a high resolution environmental field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) to support nanoscience research and education across science departments and research institutes at North Carolina Central University (NCCU), including projects focused on: (1) Development of semiconductor quantum dots and nanowires for advanced optoelectronic devices; (2) Health and environmental effects of nanoparticles; (3) Polymer nanocomposites for drug delivery and photovoltaic applications; (4) Nanostructures for biomedical imaging; and (5) Metal nanostructures for control of light through surface plasmon resonance effects. This FESEM, which includes energy dispersive x-ray and electron backscattered diffraction systems, will provide timely access to size, shape, elemental composition and crystallographic phase data with nanoscale resolution that are critically important to ongoing research at NCCU. The low vacuum capability of the requested FESEM enables imaging of the wide variety of materials studied at NCCU (including nonconductive or biological samples) without time consuming and resolution limiting preparation steps. Acquisition of the FESEM will enhance research across multiple scientific disciplines at NCCU, increasing the depth, productivity and scope of ongoing projects, opening new research avenues, and improving the research experiences of many NCCU students. A remote operation software accessory will enable demonstration of the instrument in any location with internet access, facilitating introduction of nanoscience to large introductory classes at NCCU and local K-12 classes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanometer sized materials are of great interest due to their unique physical properties and their potential impact for applications ranging from imaging of cancer cells to generation of electricity from sunlight. This proposal requests funding for a high resolution environmental field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) to support nanoscience research and education across science departments and research institutes at North Carolina Central University (NCCU), including a wide range of projects focused on the impact of nanoscale materials in optical devices, biomedical imaging and human health. This FESEM, which includes energy dispersive x-ray and electron backscattered diffraction systems, will provide timely access to data on sizes, shapes, elemental compositions and structures with nanoscale resolution that are critically important to these projects. This FESEM is capable imaging of the wide variety of materials studied at NCCU (including biological samples that are difficult to image with conventional scanning electron microscopes) without time consuming and resolution limiting preparation steps. Acquisition of the FESEM will enhance research across multiple scientific disciplines at NCCU, increasing the depth, productivity and scope of ongoing projects, opening new research avenues, and improving the research experiences of many NCCU students. A remote operation software accessory will enable demonstration of the instrument in any location with internet access, facilitating introduction of nanoscience to large introductory classes at NCCU and local K-12 classes.</AbstractNarration>
