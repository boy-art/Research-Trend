    <AbstractNarration>Professor Robert Hamers of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the use of molecular layers as electronic interfaces to oriented single crystals of TiO2 in the anatase and rutile forms, and extending to other oxides including SrTiO3. Studies will focus primarily on single crystals but will also use nanocrystalline materials as appropriate. The studies are aimed at achieving a fundamental understanding of how differences in surface structure impact the resulting molecular layers and the electronic properties of the interfaces. The structural and electronic properties of these grafted layers on well-defined single crystals of oxide semiconductors will be evaluated using a variety of chemical, structural, electronic, and spectroelectrochemical probes. Oxide semiconductors are the basis for several new and emerging types of dye-sensitized solar cells, quantum dot solar cells, and photocatalysis devices. The ability to integrate these materials with molecular and nanostructured sensitizers could lead to the development of inexpensive solar cells made by simple wet-chemical methods. The educational activities include mentoring of 8th grade students on science projects in renewable energy, summer internships for high school students, and year-round research opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
