    <AbstractNarration>0958711&lt;br/&gt;Lawrence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High resolution mass spectrometers are increasingly important in chemical analysis. More specifically, an LC QTOF can provide accurate mass determination, characterization of small molecules and identification of proteins and peptides. This broad array of functionality is ideally suited to the requirements of the UWSP chemistry department. In this proposal, 7 different research projects are described that require high resolution mass spectrometric instrumentation. All of these projects are currently funded by either external or internal granting agencies. A high resolution QTOF instrument will also be used in upper-level chemistry and biochemistry courses. Students will have multiple hands-on opportunities with the QTOF instrument in both teaching and research laboratories. This experience will immediately prepare the students for research opportunities at UWSP and ultimately prepare them for graduate and professional careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UWSP offers Bachelor's degrees in Chemistry. In 2006, for the first time, the Chemistry department began a Biochemistry major also. It is the Chemistry department's long term goal to improve student's educational experience through hands on laboratory experiences as well as faculty guided undergraduate research. Modern instrumentation is mandatory to achieve our commitment to our students and community. A high resolution QTOF instrument would be an important part of that commitment. The QTOF will be used in Sophomore, Junior and Senior level chemistry classes that will provide practical experiences for the students. Many of these students go on to individual research projects at UWSP. In addition, because high resolution mass spectrometry is so prevalent in chemical and biochemical applications and our students will have multiple opportunities to use the QTOF, our graduates will be well prepared to enter graduate or professional careers. &lt;br/&gt;Knowledge gained from the research supported b</AbstractNarration>
