    <AbstractNarration>Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem is essentially a 2-part result, whose&lt;br/&gt;second facet establishes that all conventional axiom systems are unable to&lt;br/&gt;prove a theorem corroborating their own consistency. This latter effect,&lt;br/&gt;called the Second Incompleteness Theorem, is quite counter-intuitive&lt;br/&gt;because human beings seem to implicitly believe that their cogitation&lt;br/&gt;processes are consistent (in order for them to gain the needed motivational&lt;br/&gt;energy for cogitation). Yet quite surprisingly, the Second Incompleteness&lt;br/&gt;Theorem has demonstrated that conventional logics cannot corroborate such a&lt;br/&gt;seemingly very natural consistency assumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of Willard's research project will be to explore to what&lt;br/&gt;extent a logic formalism can wiggle around the Second Incompleteness&lt;br/&gt;Theorem and formalize a type of at least partial instinctive faith in&lt;br/&gt;its own consistency. Willard has already published several articles&lt;br/&gt;exploring boundary-case exceptions to the Second Incompleteness&lt;br/&gt;Theorem and generalizations of it, thus establishing the basic&lt;br/&gt;foundational concepts for this quite unorthodox research approach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Willard's planned investigation will have an inter-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;emphasis, being germane to computer science, mathematics, the&lt;br/&gt;cognitive and information sciences, philosophy and linguistics. It&lt;br/&gt;will show that while self-justifying axiom systems have a very&lt;br/&gt;unconventional outer shell, they do retain an ability to simulate most&lt;br/&gt;of the practical computer-oriented knowledge of the data needed by any&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary logically valid axiom system. It will also show how&lt;br/&gt;computerized floating-point real number arithmetics behave very&lt;br/&gt;differently from integer arithmetics and how self-justifying&lt;br/&gt;formalisms retain an ability to expand their knowledge base by hopping&lt;br/&gt;and skipping form one formal self-justifying axiom system to another&lt;br/&gt;(via the use of Mind Change Theory and sundry trial-and-error&lt;br/&gt;experimental methodologies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second Incompleteness Theorem is sufficiently robust that its&lt;br/&gt;evasion is feasible only in a limited context, where the specified&lt;br/&gt;logic possesses a component that is unconventional in a nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;way. The reason that such unconventional logics are of interest is&lt;br/&gt;that human beings evidently possess some type of innate instinctive&lt;br/&gt;understanding of their own self-consistencies (at least under some&lt;br/&gt;formal definitions of consistency). It is therefore desirable to&lt;br/&gt;understand what type of algorithmic processes and foundational&lt;br/&gt;precepts from symbolic logic can simulate a Thinking Being's&lt;br/&gt;conception of its own consistency (in either a full or partial sense).&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research project will be to investigate the nature of&lt;br/&gt;and the potential uses and implications of logics that possess some&lt;br/&gt;type of well-defined partial knowledge of their own consistency.</AbstractNarration>
