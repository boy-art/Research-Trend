    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the Division of Chemistry. The project is pertinent to the understanding of nanoscale solid-state and materials properties and to space-time imaging of chemical and physical processes. Specifically, the focus is on: (a) studies of interfaces with atomic-scale resolution; (b) studies of phase transitions at the nanoscale; and (c) development of novel microscopy and diffraction techniques to examine structure and dynamics of chemically-modified and assembled layers on solid surfaces and in bulk. These techniques include applications of convergent-beam and near-field imaging and the examples of molecular, interfacial, and bulk systems to be studied are numerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In over a century of developments, one of the most significant achievements in science is the ability to observe atoms and to capture their motion in matter. Such observations make it possible to understand the behavior of matter and to control it at the atomic scale. The development of imaging with electrons, which represents the focus of this proposal, in space and time, enables direct visualization of the function of complex matter, from materials design in nanotechnology applications to the mis-behavior of proteins in diseases such as Alzheimer's. The group at Caltech has had over the years more than 300 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and visiting associates, the majority of whom are now in leading academic, industrial, and educational positions. This tradition of mentoring and advancing the state of the art in technology is expected to continue in the group of the PI at Caltech.</AbstractNarration>
