    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to enable operation of synthetic and&lt;br/&gt;cyborg insects in complicated environments, such as outdoors or in a&lt;br/&gt;collapsed building. As the mobile platforms and environment have&lt;br/&gt;significant uncertainty, learning and adaptation capabilities are&lt;br/&gt;critical. The approach consists of three main thrusts to enable the&lt;br/&gt;desired learning and adaptation: (i) Development of algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;efficiently learn optimal control policies and dynamics models through&lt;br/&gt;sharing the learning and adaptation between various instantiations of&lt;br/&gt;platforms and environments. (ii) Creation of control learning&lt;br/&gt;algorithms which can be run on low-cost, low-power mobile platforms.&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Development of algorithms for online improvement of policy&lt;br/&gt;performance in a minimal number of real-world trials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance learning and adaptation&lt;br/&gt;capabilities of practical cyberphysical systems. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;approach will be generally applicable and lead to a new class of&lt;br/&gt;learning and adapting systems that are able to leverage shared&lt;br/&gt;properties between multiple tasks to significantly speed up&lt;br/&gt;learning and adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in this research project will bring society closer to solving&lt;br/&gt;the grand challenge of teams of mobile, disposable, search and rescue&lt;br/&gt;robots which can robustly locomote through uncertain and novel&lt;br/&gt;environments, finding survivors in disaster situations, while removing&lt;br/&gt;risk from rescuers. This project will provide interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;training through research and classwork for undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students in creating systems which intimately couple the cyber and&lt;br/&gt;physical aspects in robotic and living mobile platforms. Through the&lt;br/&gt;SUPERB summer program, under-represented students in engineering will&lt;br/&gt;experience research in learning and robotics.</AbstractNarration>
