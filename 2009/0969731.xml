    <AbstractNarration>Novel magnetic materials are important for many applications. However, magnetism still has unresolved mysteries, especially in systems involving strong interactions and strong correlations between the particles. One approach to study magnetic materials is to realize magnetic phenomena in the simplest possible systems which are well controlled and well characterized. The simplest systems are ultracold atoms, which are very dilute gases (a million times less dilute than air). At very low temperatures, these gases can behave like liquids, solids, metals, superconductors, or magnets. The work at MIT studies quantum magnetism in three different systems: Two component Bose and Fermi gases in optical lattices, and so-called itinerant ferromagnetism of delocalized fermions in free space or in optical lattices. This work addresses important questions at the frontier of many-body physics and will have impact on future research in atomic physics, condensed matter physics and many-body theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact. Research on quantum magnetism using ultracold atoms stimulates theoretical work on strongly interacting Bose and Fermi gases and will advance our understanding of macroscopic quantum systems and of magnetic materials. A deeper understanding of magnetism and superfluidity may lead to new materials and novel devices in the future. This work provides research training for several undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, and prepares them for successful careers in technology and science. Former students and postdocs continue to find distinguished positions in the area of science and technology. All the research will be performed on campus and will be fully integrated in teaching and education, through research opportunities for undergraduates, lab tours, and by being used in lectures as illustrations for basic concepts in physics. Through his public lectures, Prof. Ketterle reaches out to more general audiences. He regularly gives talks for high school students, e.g. at the annual RSI (Research Summer Institute) program at MIT, at the TOPS (Teaching opportunities in the physical sciences) program at MIT, and during visits to high schools. An additional outreach activity initiated by Prof. Ketterle is the Virtual Journal of Atomic Quantum Fluids.</AbstractNarration>
