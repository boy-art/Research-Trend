    <AbstractNarration>Through the S-STEM project "Engineering the Husky Promise," the University of Washington (UW) establishes a scholarship program for talented low-income undergraduates in UW's College of Engineering, thereby supporting the "Husky Promise" - a guarantee for full tuition and fee scholarships for Pell Grant-eligible Washington State residents. In the S-STEM program, each student is awarded a scholarship for up to $9000 per year for up to two years, depending on financial need. The program supports at least 15 students per year, and more, if not all students have this much unmet need. The significant financial support offered by S-STEM scholarships provides financially disadvantaged students additional time to focus on their studies, because they can work fewer hours at part-time jobs. Beyond the scholarships, College of Engineering professors serve as mentors to S-STEM Scholars, especially through undergraduate research, and the scholars are offered an opportunity to develop a professional portfolio. The College also reserves slots for scholarship recipients in its Engineering Community, an exciting experiential learning opportunity for engineering and pre-engineering students. Four Resident Advisers, mostly engineering students, connect Community members with resources and programs and act as peer mentors. On-site academic support, such as drop-in advising sessions, registration assistance, departmental and corporate information sessions, and tutoring sessions, is provided by the College of Engineering. Social and informational events are planned by both the Advisors and the College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives for "Engineering the Husky Promise" are that:&lt;br/&gt; - minority students underrepresented in engineering, including those from local programs (Washington State GEAR-UP, MESA, and Rainier Scholars), receive at least 20% of the S-STEM scholarships;&lt;br/&gt; - women receive at least 35% of the S-STEM scholarships;&lt;br/&gt; - transfer students, of which half will be from UW MESA partner Community Colleges, receive at least 25% of the S-STEM scholarships, &lt;br/&gt; - 81% of the S-STEM freshmen be admitted to a UW College of Engineering Department by the end of the sophomore year; &lt;br/&gt; - 95% of S-STEM transfer students from community colleges graduate from a College of Engineering Department within three years; and&lt;br/&gt; - at least 60% of S-STEM recipients participate in undergraduate research with College of Engineering faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to serve students in the future and build on the basis of the S-STEM program, the College of Engineering is raising a sustainable endowment for additional scholarships.</AbstractNarration>
