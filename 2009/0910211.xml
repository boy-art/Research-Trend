    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to understand the genetics of body construction and diversity in a group of aquatic invertebrate animals called hydrozoans. This group includes a well studied freshwater invertebrate Hydra, whose body consists of a tubular column with a ring of tentacles on top. Because the genetics and physiology of Hydra have been thoroughly examined and it grows well in the laboratory, the species is a valuable genetic and developmental resource. The goal of this study is to document the role of genes controlling development in Hydra and two related species that differ markedly in the construction of their body columns and the size and location of tentacles on the column. These differences in body plan are caused by differences in the timing of gene expression and the locations on the body column where genes are turned on and off. By examining when and where these developmental genes are active in the bodies of the animals, this study will gain insight into the evolution and function of these genes in the development of body plan morphology in these simple invertebrates. Using a comparative approach of studying three closely related species with different body plans, the study will provide insights into the role of developmental genes in the evolution of morphological diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The research will be integrated into an undergraduate course on embryology and development. Additionally, an undergraduate student will take conduct an independent research project. A web site for the public and other researchers will synthesize information on developmental genetics of these organisms, which are important models for understanding development in many species.</AbstractNarration>
