    <AbstractNarration>Hampton University (HU) is implementing an educational research investigation to answer the question: Does a proposed new model of curricular instruction focused on the integration of financial applications significantly increase achievement in calculus for STEM majors? The Financially Oriented Research Calculus Experience (FORCE) project outlines an education research effort to enhance student learning outcomes in mathematics and financial literacy. This effort is associated with the HU 2008 Reaffirmation of Accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Hampton?s Quality Enhancement Plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about the effectiveness of financial literacy programs at the college level has not been adequately examined. A survey of college students revealed they wanted their universities to offer financial literacy information outside of the normal focus of financial aid (Cude et al., 2006). Though there was no general consensus regarding the mechanism by which financial literacy should be delivered, the most common request was to begin financial literacy during the freshman year. In addition, students suggested the development of a financial literacy center, student workshops, seminars and even the inclusion of financial education in required college courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most STEM majors at Hampton are required to take either the MAT 151 Calculus I or MAT 130 Calculus gatekeeper course for the major. This study investigates the impact of curricular instruction focused on financial applications on student learning outcomes in calculus and retention of STEM majors. The findings contribute to the body of evidence that increased academic achievement in calculus is a significant factor in retention of STEM majors.&lt;br/&gt;A carefully designed education research study is being implemented and evaluated. Mixed methods research paradigms is being employed. Institutional, instructional and individual factors is being employed. Baseline survey data on student performance is being captured. Student and faculty interviews and survey instruments will be conducted. The research involves the sequential and simultaneous use of quantitative and qualitative data collection and multivariate analysis techniques. Data analysis techniques includes graphical displays, descriptive summaries, contingency table analysis, one- and two-way analysis of variance and paired data comparisons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hampton University, founded in 1868, is an HBCU, privately endowed, co-educational, nonsectarian institution of higher education.</AbstractNarration>
