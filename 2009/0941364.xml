    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;In this project, new microscale imaging and chemical identification capabilities are being developed through the innovative coursework based on the Raman Scattering microscopy and Raman spectroscopy instrumentation acquired by the State University of New York at Potsdam. The innovative coursework involves hands-on experience with Raman instrumentation for students of two science departments (Chemistry and Biology) and the Anthropology department. A series of new experiments are being developed for use in lower division undergraduate courses, and a series of new laboratories incorporating advanced technologies are being introduced in upper division courses. The new instrumental capabilities are also being utilized to engage students in undergraduate research in the fields of nanoscience phenomena to enhance students' preparation for solving future challenges in the work place, industrial labs or academia. At the same time, demonstrations are being carried out for anthropology students with the aim to spread the information about the unique features and outstanding possibilities of compound identification and microscale analysis. While the high resolution Raman imaging techniques and chemical identification of species down to single molecule level have been presented in textbooks and research papers, the new hands-on experiences for students creates the opportunity to enhance students' comprehension of chemistry at the nanoscale level and enables them to gain new laboratory skills. These experiences integrated across the curriculum are advancing the learning process to the challenges of the explosion of nanoscience discoveries and emerging nanotechnologies requiring new approaches to the identification and monitoring of active chemical species in nanostructures.</AbstractNarration>
