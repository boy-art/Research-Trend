    <AbstractNarration>Numerous observations indicate that an unidentified form of dark matter drives the growth of structure in the Universe. Significant experimental progress on this issue is anticipated from a number of independent projects, including direct searches for dark matter particles impacting nuclei in sophisticated experiments on Earth and indirect searches for signatures of dark matter in cosmic rays that bombard the Earth as well as the properties of stars and galaxies. A possible weak link in the dark matter identification program is that theoretical predictions for phenomena relevant to direct and indirect dark matter searches remain inadequate to address expected improvements in experimental techniques. The proposed project is a broad theoretical program to improve the predictions for signals in dark matter direct and indirect search experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The graduate and undergraduate students participating in this research program will cultivate unique skill sets. The PI will continue numerous education and outreach projects under this proposal. These projects include the development of general education courses on the physics of energy and the physics of sports, public lectures at the Allegheny Observatory, educational events at the Carnegie Science Center, and participation in the Carnegie Science Center's programs to foster interest in science in school-aged children.</AbstractNarration>
