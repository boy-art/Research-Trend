    <AbstractNarration>Professors Sarah Rutan at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and Peter Carr at the University of Minnesota are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop quantitative aspects of two-dimensional liquid chromatography, with a focus on applications in metabolomics. Specifically, this work addresses the optimization of the separation conditions and exploration of novel means to accelerate both the second dimension separation and the analysis of the resulting data. The aim is to transform a time-consuming process that is semi-quantitative at best into a rapid and efficient method that will provide precise quantitative results for applications such as biomarker identification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the work will provide important new tools for biological scientists and will contribute towards improved understanding of complex biological systems. In order to make the concepts of metabolomics more accessible to a broader audience, a website with online simulators for metabolism and separations will be developed, along with associated activities designed for use in the high school classroom.</AbstractNarration>
