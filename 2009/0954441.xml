    <AbstractNarration>0954441&lt;br/&gt;Sunderland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project is a study of soot oxidation in flames with an interest in a cleaner environment. Environmental soot kills more people than any other pollutant owing to its association with respiratory illness and cancer. It also contributes significantly to climate change. Soot in unwanted fires increases radiation, fire spread rates, and carbon monoxide emissions. Ironically, soot is desired in many processes; for example soot is responsible for the yellow color of candle flames and it is processed into the toner used in most printers.&lt;br/&gt;Soot remains one of the least understood subjects in combustion. There are particularly large gaps in understanding soot oxidation processes. The leading numerical models of soot use disparate soot oxidation submodels. These submodels are based on experiments with significant uncertainties. Inaccuracies in these submodels are impeding not only the ability to model soot numerically, but also the understanding of soot formation processes in flames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a new double flame system with an unprecedented ability to establish soot oxidation reaction mechanisms. A broad array of advanced diagnostics is proposed. The system will be the first to allow mature or early soot from hydrocarbon diffusion flames to be oxidized in H2 or CO diffusion flames. The ability to control the species present, plus the expansive range of conditions to be considered, hold great promise for developing accurate and robust expressions of soot oxidation rates. &lt;br/&gt;If this promise is realized, the resulting improvements in numerical soot models and understanding of soot formation and oxidation processes should be substantial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The research should advance the understanding of soot oxidation, formation, and emissions from flames. It should improve the accuracy of numerical models of soot kinetics. It is hoped that it will significantly benefit the environment. This project will have several educational impacts. Graduate students and undergraduates will conduct much of the research. The research results will be integrated into two combustion courses taught by the PI. The PI will team with two organizations at the University of Maryland, the Women in Engineering Program and the Center for Minorities in Science and Engineering to foster interest in science and engineering among female and minority secondary school students. The PI will develop a day-long flame laboratory for secondary school students that is directly related to the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>
