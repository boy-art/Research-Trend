    <AbstractNarration>This Integrative Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project will educate a diverse cadre of neuroscientists and engineers at the University of Illinois with an advanced understanding of both neuroscience and engineering, enabling them to engage in both sophisticated collaboration and independent research across the traditional gap between these domains. Many of the most important and exciting scientific and technological challenges for the future are centered on neuroscience, the study of the brain. Many recent (and most future) advances in understanding the brain depend on engineering new technologies for sensing, imaging, and analyzing the brain and their innovative use by neuroscientists. Similarly, some of the greatest and most important technological challenges, such as creating neural prostheses for the disabled, require engineers with a profound understanding of neuroscience. IGERT students will thus carry out innovative interdisciplinary research on neuroscience areas of great scientific and engineering importance, such as speech and audition, brain and imaging, and neural implants that may lead to revolutionary advances in understanding the brain and in new technologies such as neural prostheses for the disabled. IGERT trainees will also receive training in leadership, communication skills, and the responsible conduct of research as well as preparation for academic or industrial careers. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
