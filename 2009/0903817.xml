    <AbstractNarration>Meeting the world's rapidly growing energy needs while protecting Earth's increasingly threatened climate and ecological balance is one of the greatest challenges facing society. This project will explore a new route to producing an advanced liquid fuel from biomass by constructing a thermophilic microbial platform to convert cellulose to isobutanol. Compatible with current engines and with higher energy density, isobutanol is superior to ethanol as a fuel. Isobutanol can replace dwindling and politically unstable petroleum supplies without contributing to global warming and, unlike ethanol, can be incorporated into the energy economy using current technology and infrastructure. To target the fundamental hurdle in advanced biofuel research of utilizing cellulose as the feedstock, the goal will be to develop a thermophilic and (partially) cellulolytic Geobacillus host organism to produce cellulase(s) to augment the native cellulolytic activity. The ability of this organism to grow at the moderately elevated temperatures where cellulases are highly active and to utilize the sugar products of cellulose degradation that normally inhibit the cellulases will enhance performance and minimize the need for additional expensive enzyme addition during fermentation to generate biofuels. Specific objectives of this project will be to generate stable, active bacterial cellulases and express those new enzymes in Geobacillus. Simultaneously, the isobutanol pathway will be established in this moderately thermophilic host. The final goal will be to integrate and optimize cellulose degradation and isobutanol production pathways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This research effort will train some of the most talented students and postdoctoral researchers in the world in protein and metabolic engineering, two technologies that are in very strong demand in the biotechnology industry, particularly the rapidly-growing biofuels/chemicals industry. This project will support extensive undergraduate research while interfacing with numerous outreach programs. The educational plan includes joint research meetings and co-advising of graduate students as well as the integration of parts of the research project into modules for laboratory courses. This project proposes a novel approach to addressing one of society's greatest challenges, developing a renewable source of transportation fuels and chemicals.</AbstractNarration>
