    <AbstractNarration>This joint award from the NSF Division of Chemistry and Division of Materials Research supports the Gordon Research Conference and Graduate Research Seminar on the timely and important topic of solar fuels. Participants from diverse disciplines including chemistry, materials research, biology and physics will discuss the conversion and storage of energy from sunlight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC program features a diverse and international group of invited speakers and discussion leaders. Two GRC poster presentations will emphasize the participation of junior scientists, and one session has been reserved to be an open session in which attendees with timely new results will be able to present a synposis of their recent work to the conference attendees. The GRS program will feature oral and poster presentations by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, accompanied by informal and formal discussion with junior and senior faculty GRS attendees.</AbstractNarration>
