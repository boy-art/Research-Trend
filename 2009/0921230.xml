    <AbstractNarration>University of California, San Diego, Doctoral student Charlotte van den Hout, with the guidance of Dr. Steven M. Parish, will investigate the impact of the socio-cultural environment on personal experiences of mental illness. The research will explore how culture and society shape conceptions of illness; how illness, treatment, and their cultural meanings impact the sufferer's sense of self and relationship to the social environment; and how cultural conceptions of illness are employed by the sufferer when coping with distress and seeking catharsis. This research on the socio-cultural dimensions of psychological distress will contribute to improved understanding of human cognitive universals and culturally specific variations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out among Muslim women in Morocco using a comparative research design. Van den Hout will collect data on women's interaction with two different sources of treatment for psychological distress: a psychiatric hospital that identifies and treats mental disorders according to the bio-medical, DSM-IV manual of diagnostic criteria, and a center for spiritual healing that takes part in a heterodox Islamic cult of spirit possession and saint worship. The researcher will observe treatment sessions and will interview psychiatrists and healers. She also will carry out intensive life-history interviews with patients at both sites. Finally, the researcher will conduct a brief diagnostic interview with each patient, in order to enable comparison of patient experiences at the two sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to better insight into the cultural dimension of illness experience and treatment-seeking behavior. Findings will inform cross-cultural social science illness theory as well as policy makers and professionals in the field of global healthcare. Funding this research also supports the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>
