    <AbstractNarration>Since our knowledge of the excited states for nucleons and mesons still possess major gaps and ambiguities, any description of those particles faces severe handicaps. This research and education program will utilize intense polarized beams of high energy photons in Hall B at Jefferson Lab to reveal new details of the structure of protons and neutrons by isolating the distribution of angular momenta and spin among the quarks and gluons within them. These data are absolutely necessary for progress in understanding the structure of the proton, and are specifically aimed at enabling achievement of one of the NSAC critical milestones for hadronic physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While advancing discovery and understanding, the project incorporates teaching, training, and learning through the integrated involvement of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Participating students and postdoctoral personnel will be trained in the techniques of experimental nuclear and particle physics, as well as be coached and encouraged to participate and make presentations at professional meetings. The work will strengthen existing collaborative ties between ASU and institutions around the world. The group will continue to maintain and operate the tagged photon facility at Jefferson Lab for the user community. Results will be disseminated through presentations at international meetings and publications in high-visibility journals. Lay descriptions will be provided on the group's web site and the ASU Physics Department newsletter.</AbstractNarration>
