    <AbstractNarration>The CTEQ Collaboration is an informal group of 32 experimental and theoretical high energy physicists from eighteen universities and five national labs, engaged in a program to advance research in and understanding of quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) governs the strong interactions of elementary particles, and its study at high energies is increasingly shared by both elementary particle and nuclear physics. One of the activities organized by the CTEQ collaboration is a series of CTEQ Summer Schools whose aim is to promote knowledge of QCD and its applications to precision electroweak physics and new physics searches among the younger generation of high energy and nuclear physicists, especially experimentalists. This proposal requests partial support for the 2010 and 2011 CTEQ Summer Schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the CTEQ Summer School on the high energy physics community worldwide is by now well recognized by the major laboratories. On the order of one thousand physicists have attended CTEQ schools. Some of the early students have gone on to be lecturers at more recent schools. The broader impact of these Schools is felt through the students' strengthened awareness of the context of their research in the overall undertaking of fundamental physics. The interactive nature of the schools also encourages the skills necessary for communicating the excitement and results of fundamental physics within collaborations and to the wider public.</AbstractNarration>
