    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This project is tracing future teachers understanding of foundational big ideas (those that span all science disciplines) as the teachers engage in the phenomena and practice of science within the context of specific topics in life, earth, and physical science in the K-8 science curriculum. Based on the analysis of students learning progressions, three on-line learning modules are being developed for use in a range of pre-service courses. The foundational big ideas are conservation of matter and energy and the causative role of energy in changing matter. The modules focus on specific topics in life science (photosynthesis), earth science (weathering), and physical science (combustion) that are essential to an elementary teachers understanding and provide an opportunity to apply the big ideas within and across disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each learning module includes three components. An introductory knowledge component includes a sequenced framework of disciplinary big ideas tied to the foundational big ideas along with common misconceptions. The second component is a system of assessments that allows for eliciting misconceptions and gaps in understanding at multiple time points in students learning progressions. A third component consists of a set of evidence-based teaching strategies developed from assessment data, misconceptions, and big ideas. These teaching strategies provide faculty with a range of responses at specific points in students learning progressions. The learning modules are based on following the learning progressions of 450 pre-service elementary teachers and using that assessment data to develop evidence-based teaching strategies and learning materials. Continual assessment is being used to track individuals learning progressions toward understanding the big ideas in a broad range of disciplinary phenomena. Clinical interviews and focus groups are being used to provide a deeper exploration of student understanding and of the teaching strategies and learning materials that promote understanding in individual students. An iterative process of assessment and analysis of student understanding is being used to inform subsequent design and implementation of teaching strategies. This design-based approach ultimately will lead to the development of the learning modules for use by other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
