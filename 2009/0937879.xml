    <AbstractNarration>The increasing performance and decreasing cost of processors has enabled increased system intelligence at peripherals such as disk drives. This computational capability at the disk has led to the development of object-based storage whereby some of the file system functionality is moved to the disk. The computation capability can also enable computation at the storage node in what has been called active disks or active storage. This active storage computation serves as a mechanism to enable parallel computation using distributed storage nodes.&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the use of these active disks for parallel file system and storage management. A functional active storage system architecture built on the standardized object-storage device specification is being developed. The architecture supports a variety of execution engines allowing multiple programming languages and models. Using this active object storage architecture, mechanisms to improve overall scalability and large-scale system reliability are being investigated. In addition, active and object storage are used to enable customizable and extensible file systems including autonomic (self-configuring and self-managing) storage as well as application aware storage such that the storage can be optimized for application and user needs.</AbstractNarration>
