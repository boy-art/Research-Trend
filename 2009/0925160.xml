    <AbstractNarration>University of Minnesota graduate student Thomas Walton, under the guidance of Dr. Karen Ho, will conduct anthropological research on the economic, social, and political contexts of shifting psychiatric practice in Port Moresby, New Guinea. He will investigate the relationship between the politics of public health, psychiatric logic, and everyday experiences of self and mental illness. Disease categories are known to affect perception; the case of New Guinea allows a researcher to investigate these processes in new and dynamic situation while they are developing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary research in New Guinea found that psychiatric practitioners often reformulate diagnostic categories, particularly those related to stress, to compete for resources with other, better known, medical needs such as the treatment of communicable diseases. The researcher will investigate the multiple effects of these efforts on the urban poor. He will carry out the research at two hospitals and a mental health rehabilitation center in Port Moresby. He will employ a combination of social science research methods, including: long-term participant observation, semi-structured and unstructured interviews, and the collection illness narratives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to better understanding of how limitations on healthcare resources in the developing world impact those with less visible forms of disease, sometimes in ways that only become visible through micro-level social science research and analysis. The project is timely because it also can contribute to discussions about whether or not contemporary global health initiatives adequately address mental illness prevalence in low and middle-income countries. Funding this award also supports the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>
