    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to demonstrate a prototype radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag system based on organic transistor technology with improved communication range. Traditional organic transistor based RFID systems have a limited communication distance as they are fundamentally restricted by the capability of delivering a high power supply voltage. The approach is to fabricate ion-gel dielectric organic transistors with extremely high mobility capable of low-voltage operation and to design reliable digital and mixed-signal circuits optimized for these novel devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop key technologies to transform organic transistor technology into a viable device platform for future large area electronic systems. New printable high capacitance dielectrics, stable n-type channel materials with high mobility, and fabrication methods for device reliability assurance will be developed. Each circuit building block will be optimized for low voltage operation based on the ion-gel devices and integrated into an RFID prototype. Fabrication of printed, flexible RFID circuits will be accomplished using a readily available, direct-write, aerosol-jet-printing method. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have a major impact in the general arena of printable, flexible, large-area electronics. New course materials will be developed on organic transistors for the undergraduate and graduate curricula. A laboratory module will be prepared that simultaneously teaches students about materials issues and basic transistor operation. This interdisciplinary laboratory module will be incorporated into an undergraduate laboratory course in materials science and engineering or in electrical engineering. This project will proactively recruit and nurture under-represented minority students, women, and K-12 students, and strongly leverage existing university-wide outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
