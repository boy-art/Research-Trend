    <AbstractNarration>Many plants have multiple copies of their entire genome within every cell; such plants are called polyploids. In most known cases, a plant becomes polyploid by hybridizing with another plant, which appears to trigger copying of the genome. This sort of polyploidy is studied extensively. However, in a few species the genome seems to have copied itself without hybridization, a phenomenon known as autopolyploidy. The evolutionary importance of autopolyploidy is unknown. Galax urceolata (Diapensiaceae) is a flowering plant that occurs only in the Appalachian Mountains and adjacent regions, and includes both polyploid and non-polyploid individuals. This study will use DNA sequences and statistical analysis of chromosome numbers to study autopolyploid evolution in G. urceolata. It is possible that G. urceolata actually represents more than one species, but that the species are cryptic, not easily recognized on the basis of superficial shape or form. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data from this study will help in conservation of species in the Appalachian Mountains. Data will be published in international peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific conferences, and contributions will be made to The Polyploidy Portal, a website dedicated to the sharing of information, current research, and educational materials. This project also provides significant educational value through (1) training of a doctoral student and (2) outreach to undergraduate students in proper laboratory techniques and molecular analyses.</AbstractNarration>
