    <AbstractNarration>PI: John Kelly&lt;br/&gt;coPIs: Lena Hileman, Alison Scoville&lt;br/&gt;IOS-0951254 &lt;br/&gt;The Molecular Basis for Epigenetic Inheritance of Trichome Patterning in Mimulus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance our understanding of epigenetic inheritance. Epigenetic inheritance refers to the transmission of environmental effects to offspring, distinctly and in addition to genetic inheritance. There is a critical need to study epigenetic transmission because this phenomenon has been implicated in both agricultural genetics and human disease. Epigenetic markers play a crucial role in the differentiation of stem cells during normal human development, the disruption of development, the propensity to develop obesity or cancer, and the virulence of microbes. In many cases, these markers are induced by environmental factors such as diet, temperature, chemical exposure, and maternal care. The objective of this project is to investigate the epigenetics of a model trait in a model species: trichome number in Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower). Trichomes are leaf hairs that help to defend the plant from natural enemies. They are easily scored and provide a repeatable response to environmental stimulus that is epigenetically transmitted to progeny. Extensive prior work makes this system well suited to the mechanistic study of epigenetic inheritance. In particular, the researchers will determine whether DNA methylation is responsible for epigenetic transmission of trichome patterning. This project represents integrative research that crosses the boundaries of ecology, evolution, development, genomics, and molecular biology. There is also a substantial educational component to the project with a particular focus on the recruitment of Native American students into scientific research</AbstractNarration>
