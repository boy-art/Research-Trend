    <AbstractNarration>This award will fund research conducted at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Lab which will study the exotic state of matter called the quark-gluon plasma, created through collisions of large and highly energetic nuclei. The properties of this matter should be described primarily by the theory called Quantum Chromodynamics as manifestations of the same Strong force that not only holds protons and neutrons together within the atomic nucleus but also smaller particles called quarks and gluons together within the protons and neutrons themselves. But little is known about how the quarks and gluons behave collectively when in the plasma state at high temperatures. Specifically the investigator will study interactions of the plasma with various probes. Very high energy versions of X-rays called direct photons produced in the same collisions can penetrate the plasma and can thus provide important information. Most promisingly, these photons can be compared with quarks produced at similar high energies but which should interact strongly with and mostly be stopped by the medium, in order to deduce major features of these interactions which are currently unknown. Analysis of such phenomena using a number of techniques including especially correlation measurements will be performed by the investigator, with both graduate and undergraduate students in training, on data collected by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to these analysis projects, the investigator's group at Ohio University will support the upgrade of computing, analysis, and data-taking capabilities of PHENIX through software development and leadership of groups and projects of detector development and analysis. The project results in a number of broad benefits to society beyond the important goal of educating and training students: organizations are developed in the state of Ohio and beyond to exchange Heavy Ion knowledge; international collaboration of RHIC and other nuclear/particle physicists is strengthened; finally the project contributes to many general benefits to the development of future computing in the nation.</AbstractNarration>
