    <AbstractNarration>Recent field and laboratory observations have consistently shown that the bulk aerodynamic drag coefficient levels off in the range of winds from 30-35 m/s. Above this threshold there are differences in the observed trend from the limited number of reported observations. Highly repeatable laboratory drag coefficient measurements for wind speeds up to 50 m/s showed no dependence on wind speed. In contrast, aircraft-based observations and sub-surface velocity profiles indicated that the drag coefficient decreased at higher winds. There were large uncertainties inherent in both studies. Potential mechanisms for a decreasing drag coefficient have been proposed; while in contrast there also are proposed mechanisms that would lead to the drag coefficient leveling off for winds greater than 40 m/s. These theoretical models invoke different spray effects on the air-sea momentum transfer as the primary reason for the predicted drag coefficient trends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experimental effort will provide a direct test of the effect of high spray concentrations on the drag coefficient. Controlled volumes of spray will be injected into the air-sea boundary layer in high winds in a series of laboratory experiments. A wide range of spray droplet sizes, concentrations and inflow velocities will be tested. This will enable us to accomplish two primary objectives, the first being to determine the trend of the drag coefficient in very high winds. The second will be to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the observed trend. Sufficient spray will be injected to create a multi-layer flow to test the so-called sandwich model. By varying the inflow velocity and droplet size, surface short-wave suppression effects of enhanced spray and its corresponding effect on the drag coefficient will be evaluated. The along-wind velocity of the incoming spray will be varied to provide a direct comparison with other model predictions. A robust control volume approach will be used in the Air-Sea Interaction Saltwater Tank (ASIST) facility, wherein the water surface slope is used to determine the bulk shear stress. This will allow reliable determination of the drag coefficient, even in extreme conditions (winds up to 54 m/s). The focus will be on the high-wind regime (35-54 m/s) where the observed trend of the drag coefficient in previous lab and field observations with wind speed is not established and the models for the spray effect diverge. The effect (if any) of spray concentration, droplet size, layer thickness and ejection (infusion) velocity on the drag coefficient will be quantified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current lack of improvement in skill in hurricane intensity forecasting demonstrates that there are fundamental weaknesses in understanding of the air-sea heat, moisture and momentum fluxes in extreme winds. This study will help to resolve the question of what effect spray loading has on the air-sea momentum flux. This has important implications for the expected maximum potential intensity of hurricanes. This project will help to constrain the momentum transfer coefficient used in predictive hurricane models, thereby contributing to improved intensity forecasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional impacts of the research will be support of the PhD thesis project of a graduate student who has already made significant advances in understanding of the moist-enthalpy transfer rates in extreme conditions. Community outreach has been a significant ongoing activity at ASIST. The bulk methods employed in this research are conceptually simple to incorporate into presentation materials. These will be made available to the community groups that tour the facility (and the facility web site) to enhance public understanding of the fundamental processes related to hurricane intensification or decay.</AbstractNarration>
