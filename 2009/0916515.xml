    <AbstractNarration>Businesses and other organizations increasingly rely on business&lt;br/&gt;process management, and in particular the management of electronic&lt;br/&gt;workflows underlying business processes. These workflows are often&lt;br/&gt;centered around a database. They are typically very complex and prone&lt;br/&gt;to costly bugs, which leads to a critical need for computer-aided&lt;br/&gt;design and static analysis tools. Such tools would result in enhanced&lt;br/&gt;functionality, as well as increased confidence in the robustness and&lt;br/&gt;correctness of complex business processes. They would potentially&lt;br/&gt;benefit a wide variety of applications ranging from e-commerce to&lt;br/&gt;digital government to healthcare and scientific applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classical software verification techniques applicable to static analysis &lt;br/&gt;include model checking and theorem proving. However, both have serious&lt;br/&gt;limitations: Model checking requires finite-state abstraction, which&lt;br/&gt;results in serious loss of semantics for both the business process and&lt;br/&gt;verified properties. Theorem proving is incomplete and requires expert&lt;br/&gt;user feedback. This project proposes an alternative approach to&lt;br/&gt;static analysis. Instead of applying general-purpose techniques with&lt;br/&gt;only partial guarantees of success, it aims to identify restricted but&lt;br/&gt;sufficiently expressive classes of business processes for which sound&lt;br/&gt;and complete static analysis can be performed in a fully automatic way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the target of verification consists of semantically rich&lt;br/&gt;data-aware workflows, in contrast to the traditional process-centric&lt;br/&gt;workflows. Data awareness is a feature of central importance in&lt;br/&gt;applications such as the above, which has recently led to the&lt;br/&gt;emergence of a new approach to workflow specification in which data is&lt;br/&gt;pre-eminent. This approach, introduced by IBM, focuses on data records,&lt;br/&gt;known as "business artifacts" or simply "artifacts", that correspond&lt;br/&gt;to key business-relevant objects, their life cycles, and the&lt;br/&gt;services (or tasks) that are invoked on the artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;IBM's artifact-centric approach has been demonstrated to yield&lt;br/&gt;substantial improvements to the operations of medium- and large-sized&lt;br/&gt;businesses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the present project is to develop&lt;br/&gt;new tools for the high-level specification and verification of such&lt;br/&gt;data-centric business processes. The project investigates the&lt;br/&gt;trade-offs between the expressiveness of the specification language&lt;br/&gt;and the feasibility of the analysis tasks. It aims to establish&lt;br/&gt;tractability boundaries for static analysis and to develop practical&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and heuristics. Tools are to be developed for carrying out&lt;br/&gt;analysis tasks, that will be integrated with Siena, IBM's prototype&lt;br/&gt;for compiling artifact-centric business process specifications into&lt;br/&gt;workflow support code. The technical problems raised are&lt;br/&gt;intellectually quite challenging, and bring into play techniques from&lt;br/&gt;logic, automata theory, computational complexity, algorithms, and&lt;br/&gt;computer-aided verification. The resulting static analysis tools have&lt;br/&gt;high potential for becoming a transformational technology in the area&lt;br/&gt;of business processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page&lt;br/&gt;http://db.ucsd.edu/artifacts</AbstractNarration>
