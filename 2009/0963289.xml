    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indiana State University is a RUI-eligible institution highly engaged in undergraduate research training. This award will provide funds to the renovation of research laboratory space in the Science Building at Indiana State University in support of their undergraduate and graduate research programs in biology, chemistry, and geology. The 50-year-old Science Building houses the University's programs in the natural sciences, including biology, chemistry, geology, physics, and science education. The project will renovate seven research labs that support graduate and/or undergraduate research in organic chemistry and pharmacology, geochemistry, dendrochronology, paleoceanography, molecular ecology, and evolutionary physiology. Several of the labs present safety concerns by contemporary standards due to poor laboratory layout, lack of sufficient and appropriate storage, inadequate air flow in antiquated fume hoods, and missing safety features, such as eyewashes and showers. Plans for renovating these laboratories include the following: (i) new ceilings, floors, recessed doorways, and repair of walls with some reconfiguration; (ii) new casework, bench tops, and shelving; (iii) installation of fixed laboratory equipment and fume hoods; (iv) installation of ADA-compliant bench space; (v) new electrical services and plumbing; (vi) improved temperature control and exhaust; and (vii) new safety features including eyewashes and showers. The two chemistry labs targeted for renovation include an organic chemistry research lab that will be reconfigured to provide additional organic chemistry research space and space for biochemistry. Geology lab renovations will create two rooms that separately support wood and rock processing activities. The four rooms of the Geochemistry Lab will be reconfigured as three rooms with a new doorway. Lastly one additional room on the first floor will be renovated to be the Paleoceanography Laboratory. There are the two labs targeted for renovation on the second floor: the Molecular Ecology Lab and the Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology Lab. These renovations will support a highly productive faculty and significant undergraduate research programs.</AbstractNarration>
