    <AbstractNarration>Transportation accidents take thousands of lives and injure millions annually. They also cause billions of dollars in property damage. Further improving safety requires tackling on human factors, one of the major factors causing traffic accidents. In this proposal we consider driver factors in the realm of cognitive processing. For this purpose, this MRI project will acquire a high fidelity driver simulator to study driver behaviors (e.g., drowsiness, inattention, cognition) under realistic driving conditions. This high fidelity driver simulator will both serve as a benchmark research platform and testbed of new theories and technologies. It will support a variety of fundamental and applied research on driver cognition, inattention and drowsiness, from which robust physiological or psychology indicators of driver status can be uncovered. Innovative driver assistant applications and clinic tools resulting from these fundamental researches will help to implement effective driver warning strategy for the prevention of accident. The safety and economic benefits will be significant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach to address this conventional safety issue demonstrates the efforts of the proposal team to bring together progress in multiple disciplines to provide a better solution for this critical transportation safety problem. The team has a common vision of embracing driver factors in the realm of cognitive processing and taking an interdisciplinary approach for interventions in the interface between human behavior and the operation of a motor vehicle. In addition to advance research, the PIs will continue their long term commitments in integrating educational and outreach activities with research activities. Through these efforts, the progress of scientific explorations supported by this equipment will be timely disseminated to undergraduate students, graduate students, K-12 students and teachers</AbstractNarration>
