    <AbstractNarration>The Advanced Technology Environmental and Energy Center, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the Partnership for Environmental Technology Education are partnering to build the nation's capacity for educating technicians to work in the energy industry. The Sustainable Energy Education and Training (SEET) project is (1) increasing community college and high school technology instructors' technical knowledge of sustainable energy by hosting annual 10-day professional development workshops about advances in energy technology, technician training requirements, renewable energy, and energy efficiency and conservation for 75 instructors at DOE sites around the country, (2) promoting ongoing learning and teaching of sustainable energy by creating a resource-rich SEET website and a network of educators, and (3) promoting ongoing peer learning and teaching by having SEET participants conduct annual energy-related webinars for educators nationwide and having participants conduct professional development events in their local communities. An external evaluator is measuring the impact of project activities on participating instructors and their students.</AbstractNarration>
