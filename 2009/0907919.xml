    <AbstractNarration>In this project, Dr. Steven J. Desch of Arizona State University will undertake a theoretical study of how young stars are contaminated by ejected material from nearby supernova explosions. Supernova contamination of forming planetary systems has many observable consequences for the elemental abundances of stars. The contamination determines the inventory of short-lived radionuclides such as Aluminum-26 or Iron-60 in young stellar systems, and is a major driver of planetary evolution and the delivery of bioessential volatiles to Earth-like planets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine the effects of supernova contamination, Dr. Desch and his students will numerically model the interaction of supernova ejecta with protoplanetary disks and with fragments of molecular clouds on the verge of collapse. They will also create a computational tool to allow exploration of dust dynamics and thermal evolution in these and other astrophysical flows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research connects research and education by advancing discovery and understanding while at the same time educating undergraduate and graduate students, including one named student from an underrepresented group. The proposed research will create a platform on which to expose a younger generation to a multidisciplinary scientific process. The investigators will incorporate research developments from this proposal into the classroom as part of a recently revamped School of Earth and Space Exploration.</AbstractNarration>
