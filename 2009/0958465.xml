    <AbstractNarration>This proposal supports the acquisition of an Azul Vega 3 compute appliance&lt;br/&gt;for research on developing an open-source general-purpose transactional&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure for high-level managed languages. This appliance is equipped&lt;br/&gt;with hundreds of processor cores, substantial memory, and bandwidth&lt;br/&gt;availability. The cores compute in a flat SMP configuration, simplifying&lt;br/&gt;programmability and management. The appliance has a number of novel&lt;br/&gt;features including hardware support for concurrent garbage collection, and&lt;br/&gt;optimistic lock elision that provide critical building blocks for efficient&lt;br/&gt;transactional memory (TM) support. The project's research agenda is to&lt;br/&gt;explore new approaches to scalable parallel program construction that&lt;br/&gt;exploits underlying hardware primitives that mask or mitigate critical&lt;br/&gt;bottlenecks that have thus far hampered effective scalable software&lt;br/&gt;transactional memory systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use the novel features of the Azul appliance to (i) explore&lt;br/&gt;new language abstractions with special focus on scalability of transactional&lt;br/&gt;applications; (ii) understand how primitive support for garbage collection&lt;br/&gt;and transactions influence algorithm and application development built using&lt;br/&gt;these abstractions; (iii) examine the impact of these mechanisms on&lt;br/&gt;compiler and runtime design; and (iv) develop a large number of benchmarks&lt;br/&gt;and workloads to better understand TM performance characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of a larger NSF-funded effort to catalyze TM research,&lt;br/&gt;which in turn is a key technique to improving software development for&lt;br/&gt;general-purpose parallel computers. Widespread adoption of new scalable&lt;br/&gt;concurrency abstractions such as transactional memory is an essential&lt;br/&gt;component in the technology roadmap of major industry players, and the focus&lt;br/&gt;of much attention in academia.</AbstractNarration>
