    <AbstractNarration>This proposal encompasses the preparation of a variety of cyclic and acyclic compounds from environmentally friendly and readily available starting materials. The Louie's laboratory recently discovered a potentially important intermediate in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Mechanistic analysis of both cycloaddition reactions as well as cross-coupling reactions will be continued. Concurrent to these investigations, reactive M-CO2 intermediates will be synthesized and their reactivity toward other substrates will be explored with the intention of incorporating these reactivity patterns into the repertoire of new catalytic reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Janis Louie of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah. Professor Louie's research efforts revolve around the development of facile transition metal-mediated methods for the formation of cyclic and acyclic compounds. In addition, new methods for utilizing benign starting materials such as carbon dioxide will be evaluated. Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.</AbstractNarration>
