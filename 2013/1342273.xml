    <AbstractNarration>Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Progress within the cardiovascular field towards early diagnosis, increased efficacy in therapy and understanding the underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases have been aided in part by advances in medical imaging technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our objective of this Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering (BRIGE) proposal is to develop high-resolution optical imaging, spectroscopy and image analysis for diagnosis and therapy monitoring of diseases of the heart wall. We will develop an atlas of optical imaging of the human heart muscle, optical catheters and classification algorithms to enable real time tissue classification. We aim to demonstrate that Optical coherence tomogoraphy (OCT) and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) can address unmet needs of intramyocardial imaging by providing cellular-level imaging of the myocardium. The aims of the project are &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) to characterize human myocardium and radiofrequency ablation lesions ex vivo through an OCT correlative histopathology study, &lt;br/&gt;2) to develop an integrated OCT and NIRS catheter, and &lt;br/&gt;3) to develop automated algorithms for tissue classification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance and Importance: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities outlined in this proposal addresses an area that has broad impact to our entire community by developing optical catheters and image analysis for improving the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. There are a large range of diseases and therapies of the heart that can benefit from the information provided by a high-resolution, real time imaging modality. It is our goal to develop tools for imaging the myocardium, which will provide cardiac electrophysiologist and cardiologist a view of the heart wall to aid in disease diagnosis and guide therapy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening Participation Activities: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will participate in broader participation activities through integrating materials developed during the research project into the curriculum current and new optical system courses. In addition, the material will be used within outreach presentations, demonstrations, and laboratory tours to minority high school students in the New York City public school system and African American undergraduates at National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) conferences and chapter meetings to encourage them to pursue a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) discipline during undergraduate and graduate school respectively. Lastly, the PI will mentor minority students within the Columbia University undergraduate chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, in addition to mentoring a diverse laboratory team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has been funded through the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering solicitation, which is part of the Broadening Participation in Engineering Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division.</AbstractNarration>
