    <AbstractNarration>A workshop is proposed to identify and articulate the cyberinfrastructure (CI) needs and&lt;br/&gt;potential applications in the broad scientific domain encompassing sedimentary geology. The&lt;br/&gt;effort is intended to build consensus within the diverse sedimentary geology community (SGC)&lt;br/&gt;with respect to the EarthCube effort. The SGC focuses on the processes that form, shape, and&lt;br/&gt;affect Earth's sedimentary crust, and distribute key resources such as hydrocarbons, coal, and&lt;br/&gt;water. The sedimentary records studied by this community are the archives of Earth's past&lt;br/&gt;surface processes, climates, oceans, and biosphere. The SGC collects a great diversity of&lt;br/&gt;qualitative and quantitative data that characterizes diverse attributes of sedimentary rocks at&lt;br/&gt;spatial scales that span 13-orders of magnitude. Most data is based on physical samples; some is&lt;br/&gt;continuous. Derivative products based on the data are published, but the data itself are typically&lt;br/&gt;not archived or readily available to other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The domain workshop will focus on: 1) defining the current nature of SGC data and workflows,&lt;br/&gt;including the challenges and impediments to sharing and using that data; 2) establish what types&lt;br/&gt;of data, repositories, software, and tools (analytical, modeling, and visualization) would enable&lt;br/&gt;community-based, 'big science' collaborations within the SGC; 3) evaluate the potential&lt;br/&gt;importance of mining legacy data; 4) identify examples of the kind of scientific challenges the&lt;br/&gt;SGC would attack given an ideal CI; and 5) evaluate how EarthCube, if populated with the type&lt;br/&gt;of data and tools articulated in the above bullets, would impact the SGC's teaching. The overall&lt;br/&gt;product of the workshop will be a report to NSF that defines the issues and challenges that must&lt;br/&gt;be met for the integration of the SGC with EarthCube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sedimentary rocks are the most abundant rock type on the surface of the Earth and are rich in&lt;br/&gt;geologic data and history. The intellectual merit of the proposal is that the summary outcomes&lt;br/&gt;will provide SGC guidance on the priorities and use of sedimentary data to the EarthCube&lt;br/&gt;framework of Earth systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader of impacts of the proposed workshop are to integrate SGC with one of the most&lt;br/&gt;important cyberinfrastructure initiatives to NSF integrating information and data across the&lt;br/&gt;geosciences.</AbstractNarration>
