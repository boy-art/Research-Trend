    <AbstractNarration>The Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Schoolyard Book Series was established in 2004 to engage elementary school students and their families in learning about the earth's ecosystems, both locally and internationally, through narratives that reflect the dynamic research being conducted at the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Sites. This project extends the book series in several important ways. First, funding will support publication of three new books, one from each of the Hubbard Brook Forest, Plum Island Ecosystem, and the Jornada Experimental Range projects. Second, existing books will be translated into different languages in order to extend their impacts. Third, electronic versions of the books will be developed along with additional instructional materials. By engaging a Series Editor, the project will ensure direct engagement with the education and trade book markets. Familiarity with content delivery trends and new publishing ideas will keep the Series Editor informed and able to be nimble with developing future books. Taken together, these activities will provide a solid foundation for advancement of the educational and outreach goals of the LTER network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of the project lies primarily in its broader impacts. It will significantly extend the impact of the LTER Schoolyard Book Series by broader sharing of place-based knowledge about ecosystems with elementary school students. The proposed translation of existing books into other languages provides the opportunity to reach a wide diversity of under-served audiences both within the US and around the world. Many local partnerships will be formed to distribute and use these books and to provide professional development to teachers who adopt the books. The series has great potential to help teachers meet Common Core English Language Arts Standards while simultaneously educating students about the natural world and about the profession of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
