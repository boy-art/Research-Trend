    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project focuses on using bio-inspired design--i.e. using nature as an inspiration to design--in order to teach innovation to mechanical engineering students. The research focuses on best practices to teach engineers to draw on nature for inspiration in design. The research will be integrated into the curriculum by establishing a certificate program at Texas A&amp;M University. Students who wish to obtain the certificate take selected electives, at the cost of one additional credit hour in the program. To measure the impact on the project on student learning, both quantitative and qualitative longitudinal assessments are planned throughout students' collegiate experience and certificate activities. This project should better inform what learning approaches successfully address innovation, and test whether bio-inspired design is an effective pedagogy. The project may also make mechanical engineering a more approachable and attractive subject to students who are traditionally under-represented in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
