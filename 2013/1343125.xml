    <AbstractNarration>The 10th Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web Graph (WAW 2013) took place at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA, December 15-16, 2013. The focus of these meetings is to present recent research and to explore directions for future research on areas involving networks relating to the World Wide Web and related complex networks. Topics of interest include algorithmic research, data analysis, the modeling of complex networks, and specific applications to understanding the web graph. This is an annual meeting, which is traditionally co-located with another related conference; in this case WAW 2013 was co-located with the 9th Workshop on Internet &amp; Network Economics (WINE 2013).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the rapidly growing world of Internet infrastructures, the research areas of WAW represent major efforts from the theoretical and practical communities to address the challenging problems that we face today. The WAW series of workshops have established themselves by bringing together researchers in a variety of interrelated areas, as these questions require interdisciplinary efforts. The choice of the plenary speakers and co-location with WINE highlights the important themes of the conference. The speakers, organizers, and conference history combine the experience to plan a successful conference, along with the reputation to attract a strong and diverse group of participants. The proceedings were published in a Lecture Notes in Computer Science volume. Selected papers will also be disseminated in journal form, in a special issue of the journal Internet Mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
