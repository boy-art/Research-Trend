    <AbstractNarration>In this research project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Steven M. George of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and his students aim to grow novel hybrid organic-inorganic films using molecular layer deposition (MLD) techniques and then study the post-processing of these MLD films to form metal oxide/carbon composite films. Prof. George and his students are developing tin alkoxide films (tincones) and iron alkoxide films (ironcones) using in situ FTIR spectroscopy to study the surface chemistry during MLD film growth and the subsequent spectral changes during pyrolysis to form metal oxide/carbon composite films. In other studies they grow the MLD films in a hot-wall viscous flow reactor and then anneal the MLD films under vacuum in a tube furnace to form the composite films with metal oxide and carbon nanodomains. The electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties of these composite films are measured using four-point probe and potentiostat methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is focused on: surface chemistry of film growth; characterization of film growth; thin film processing; and measurement of film properties. The project consists of the development of new hybrid organic-inorganic materials and their post-processing to obtain conducting metal oxide/carbon composites. The resulting new class of nanocomposite films may have a number of important electrochemical applications for energy storage as Li ion battery electrodes or pseudocapacitance supercapacitors. This project is providing laboratory research experience for graduate and undergraduate students with exposure to state-of-the-art experimental methods and instrumentation. The students are gaining expertise in vacuum technology, thin film growth, materials processing, spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical characterization. The students also have the opportunity to present their results at scientific conferences and participate in educational and outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
