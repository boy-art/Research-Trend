    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and implement interactive Web-based games, apps, and corresponding investigative laboratory modules. These labs are created to effectively teach statistical thinking and the process of scientific inquiry to undergraduate students. These materials will consist of one- or two-day activities designed for high school and introductory college courses as well as more complex projects geared toward more advanced courses. The intellectual merit of this proposal is to contribute to the scholarship of statistics education by being among the first to fully utilize technology to develop interactive, inquiry-based, and interdisciplinary materials designed for students with strong quantitative skills and interests. This project will develop a new model of educational material that deepens the statistical knowledge of students by providing realistic research problems that encourage students to follow a complete process of statistical analysis at multiple stages of their academic career. By training students how to properly collect data, determine an appropriate technique for analysis, use technology, perform the analysis, make inferences, interpret and present the results. This project will encourage students early in their studies to experience the role of a research scientist and to understand how the field of statistics helps advance scientific knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this proposal will be the creation of new educational models that could dramatically impact the direction of statistics education. These game-based labs can allow for individualized research questions and just-in-time feedback that students recognize as directly related to the goals within their game. Unlike standard class activities where all students are working to get the same answer, through technology these interactive games easily allow students to choose what factors to evaluate and have input in the research design. Thus students conduct research in which the outcome is not known (even to the course instructor). These labs will include detailed instructor resources and will easily fit into existing high school and undergraduate statistics and science courses. By making students grapple with intriguing real-world problems that demonstrate the intellectual content and broad applicability of statistics as a disciple, these materials encourage students to consider a career in statistics or to incorporate statistical thinking into any career.</AbstractNarration>
