    <AbstractNarration>The vision of creating fully controlled spatial and temporal quantum mechanical electron waves will be realized in the near future. Such coherent electron control offers exciting possibilities for the development of new technologies and the exploration of new physics. The challenge to combine very small (nanometer scale) parts with ultrafast (femto- and atto-second) lasers to control electrons is going to be addressed by the work funded through this grant. The largest enclosed area electron interferometer ever will be built, and electron switches directing signals at extreme rates of about a million GigaHertz will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The impact of having a largest electron interferometer (that still fits in a car) is that new frequency ranges and sensitivities of electromagnetic fields can be tested. The use of a simple low frequency magnetometer is explored together with Honeywell and these devices are applicable for hunting submarines and locating mines. Higher frequencies are used for detecting electromagnetic communications. On the scientific side, the interferometer will be used to help understand one of the largest puzzles of the century, which is the transition between classical and quantum physics. The impact of having ultrafast electron switches is that this may enable a new generation of devices, such as the fastest microscopes, oscilloscopes and signal processors. The educational impact is that training for graduate students will be provided in an area of national need, while previous outreach has already reached an estimated 100,000 high school students. This grant will allow a continuation of these efforts.</AbstractNarration>
