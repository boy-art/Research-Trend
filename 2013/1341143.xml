    <AbstractNarration>Despite numerous hypotheses concerning language evolution, the neurobiological origins of the human capacity to speak remain little understood. Studies suggest that the striatum, a subcortical structure forming complex connections with the cerebral cortex, may be important in the evolution of vocal learning - the capacity to modify vocalizations in response to social experience - which is necessary to acquire speech during development. The striatum also is a key site of expression of FOXP2, a gene that underwent positive selection in modern humans, and, in a mutated form, is responsible for a hereditary disorder affecting language production. To date, however, evidence indicating a role of the striatum in the evolution of speech and language mainly comes from experimental species, such as birds and mice, which are evolutionarily distant from humans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the current project by doctoral student Serena Bianchi (George Washington University), under the guidance of Dr. Chet Sherwood, is to identify neural features of the non-human primate striatum that may have been associated with the evolution of the capacity for vocal learning that characterizes human speech. To this end, this project uses non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, and post-mortem histological and molecular analyses, to examine the striatum of captive chimpanzees for which the use of learned, voluntarily controlled vocalizations produced to attract the attention of the experimenter (attention-getting vocalizations) has been documented. Specific aims include assessing whether the striatum of chimpanzees who produce attention-getting vocalizations differs from chimpanzees that do not exhibit this vocal phenotype in 1) morphology, and pattern of connections with motor and language-related regions of the cerebral cortex; and 2) neuronal plasticity and expression of proteins associated with synaptic functions and FOXP2. Investigating the neurobiology of vocal communication in an animal model evolutionarily close to humans may help identify precursors to speech production within a Darwinian framework of language origins as 'descent with modifications' of existing neural structures in the non-human primate brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this project, dissemination of knowledge about the evolution of the brain and language will be fostered through collaboration with the outreach program of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, and the development of on-line resources and teaching materials. In addition, the histological collection created by this project will be made available to other researchers.</AbstractNarration>
