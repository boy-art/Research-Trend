    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project will create a new salmonella sensor combining two established tools in biodetection: hydrodynamic chromatography and magnetic nanoparticle (MP) conjugation. The proposed sensor will be significantly less expensive and provide faster detection time with equivalent sensitivity compared to current techniques. The project will develop this sensor by exploiting the connection between the MP magnetic orientation, fluid behavior and volume characteristics. Functionally coated MPs will be combined with a salmonella aptamer biomarker in a microfluidic channel. A magnetic profile of the solution will be measured using ultrasensitive giant magnetoresistance sensors. The MP magnetic profile will change in the presence of the biomarker due to modification of the MPs? hydrodynamic volume. The goal of the Phase I program will be to demonstrate this difference in magnetic profiles. Successful completion of the program will result in a prototype sensor for food safety applications in the Phase II effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project could include food safety and medical applications. In the sizeable food processing industry the sensor is a highly efficient contamination monitor leading to dramatic improvements in food safety by preventing distribution of contaminated products. While the initial sensor will be designed for salmonella, the sensor is also extensible to other biomarkers and could be envisioned as a critical point-of-care sensor in the medical industry. The National Science Foundation?s mission will also be carried out by having graduate students and postdoctoral researchers participate in the program, exposing them to industry while developing new knowledge and honing their research skills.</AbstractNarration>
