    <AbstractNarration>The thrust of this 3-year research program is to improve present understanding on two topics of fundamental importance for solar and heliospheric physics, namely: (1) the origin of suprathermal tails in the solar wind that have a common spectral shape in many different circumstances; and, (2) the behavior of the heliospheric magnetic field and the solar wind throughout the solar cycle. By means of theoretical investigations, the project team aims to apply the Pump Acceleration mechanism to explain the spectral properties of suprathermal particles near the Sun. Another aspect of the research includes tests of the basic principles of a theoretical model of the solar-heliospheric magnetic field developed by the PI during the current solar maximum, using both in-situ and spectroscopic observations. The purpose of the research work is to provide a foundation for a predictive model of the solar wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project deals with fundamental properties of space plasmas, thus it has the potential for impact well beyond the discipline of heliospheric physics; e.g., the Pump Acceleration mechanism has been applied to accelerate galactic cosmic rays in the interstellar medium. This project also has the important broader impact that the new concepts being developed are incorporated into the graduate education program at the University of Michigan, so that the next generation is encouraged to consider different ideas, and new ways to advance solar and heliospheric physics. This project is also intended to support a female postdoctoral fellow to continue her development as a space scientist. To summarize, the research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>
