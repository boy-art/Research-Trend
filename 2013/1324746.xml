    <AbstractNarration>This grant is for participation in the conference "Type Theory,&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy Theory and Univalent Foundations", at the Centre de&lt;br/&gt;Recerca Matematica in Barcelona (Spain), September 23-27, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;The grant will enable selected mathematicians affiliated with U.S.&lt;br/&gt;institutions to participate in the conference. The allocation&lt;br/&gt;of funds will favor graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty,&lt;br/&gt;and faculty with no current NSF support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of the conference are the recent connections&lt;br/&gt;discovered between type theory and homotopy theory based on the&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of identity types as path spaces. These&lt;br/&gt;connections provide a new topological intuition that facilitates&lt;br/&gt;working with type theories and allow for new computational tools&lt;br/&gt;for manipulating homotopy-theoretic structures. Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;Voevodsky's Univalent Foundations program provides a solid&lt;br/&gt;logical basis for the practice of identifying isomorphic&lt;br/&gt;structures, common throughout mathematics even if it is not&lt;br/&gt;allowed by standard set-theoretic foundations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of the conference has an unusually wide impact since&lt;br/&gt;it involves several areas: mathematical logic, theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science, homotopy theory and category theory. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the developments offer a new perspective on&lt;br/&gt;computer-assisted formalization of mathematical proofs and&lt;br/&gt;verification of their correctness, which promises to benefit all&lt;br/&gt;mathematical endeavor, and further influence on design of&lt;br/&gt;programming languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web page: http://www.crm.cat/2013/ctype</AbstractNarration>
