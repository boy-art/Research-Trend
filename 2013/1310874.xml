    <AbstractNarration>Modern biology was founded on Charles Darwin?s principle of ?descent with modification?. Closely related species share similarities in size, shape, and form of their body plans. However, in some cases, distantly related species also share similar traits. This exception to Darwin?s rule has puzzled biologists and raises the question: to what extent is evolution repeatable and predictable? This project will address this fundamental question by examining an interesting pattern of repeated evolution in turtles. Some distantly related turtle species feature similar anatomical modifications that allow them to close their shells when attacked by predators. The project will employ leading-edge molecular biology techniques to determine whether this pattern requires similar changes in genes that control embryonic development of bone tissues in these species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turtles are of high cultural and economic importance to societies worldwide. Yet, they are one of the most imperiled animals on the planet. This multidisciplinary project will train underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students to improve knowledge and raise public awareness about turtle diversity and conservation. This knowledge may also contribute to improving human bone health. Research materials will be available to the public through museums and online databases. Results will be disseminated broadly to K-16 and public audiences.</AbstractNarration>
