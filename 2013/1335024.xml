    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop new vibration-based damage detection methods for complex structures and apply them to engineering systems such as the newly developed space frame wind turbine towers, wind turbine blades, stay cables, and periodic cellular materials. A robust model-based method that uses minimum vibration measurements to detect the locations and extent of damage in structures with different types of joints, including bolted, welded, and riveted joints and interference pins, and in tensioned wire ropes, will be developed. New methods will be developed to model various types of joints and tensioned wire ropes. A damage-sensitive vibration shape (VS)-based method will be developed to detect damage in wind turbine blades using a 3D scanning laser vibrometer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monitoring the health of complex structures on a regular basis can provide a sustaining status assessment of structures and avoid their unexpected failure. The model- and VS-based damage detection methods can be used to monitor the health of safety-critical structures such as wind turbine towers and blades, stay cables, and airframes. Various aspects of the research will be adapted for educational purposes to students at all levels, from high school students to Ph.D. students. Some finite element modeling, dynamic testing, and damage detection results will be demonstrated to underserved high school students in a summer educational program to spark their interest in science and engineering. Various symposia on modeling, dynamic testing, and damage detection will be organized to broaden the impact of the research to the scientific community, and to bring together researchers from different scientific societies.</AbstractNarration>
