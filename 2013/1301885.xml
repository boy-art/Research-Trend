    <AbstractNarration>The Colorado Alliance for Minority Participation (CO-AMP) has thus far matriculated four cohorts of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority students through the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program. The first&lt;br/&gt;three cohorts matriculated at Colorado State University (CSU), the lead institution for the CO-AMP&lt;br/&gt;alliance, whereas the fourth BD cohort matriculated at Colorado School of Mines (CSM). The fifth cohort,&lt;br/&gt;if funded, will matriculate at the University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver). As the only urban,&lt;br/&gt;research-intensive institution in the Rocky Mountain States, CU Denver offers a unique training&lt;br/&gt;experience in a wide range of STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;Program Goals: A cohort of 12 BD fellows will be recruited into this program for each of two years using&lt;br/&gt;a wide range of strategies. The Program Coordinator, along with members of the Management Team, will&lt;br/&gt;advertise the BD program using Web-based media, flyers, brochures and direct communication.&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention will be given to 1) current CU Denver STEM undergraduate and Masters students, 2)&lt;br/&gt;other higher education institutions in the CO-AMP alliance, 3) four Native American tribes in Colorado&lt;br/&gt;and the Four Corners region, 4) all LSAMP alliances nationwide, 5) national meetings such as SACNAS&lt;br/&gt;and ABRCMS, and 6) visits to targeted programs and electronic postings to GradSchools.com.&lt;br/&gt;The Program will be administered by a Management Team, which includes individuals who are&lt;br/&gt;nationally recognized for their efforts in diversity and inclusion. The Team will meet regularly with all&lt;br/&gt;BD fellows to assess their overall satisfaction with the program as well as gather feedback for areas of&lt;br/&gt;improvement. Importantly, once per semester, individual one-on-one meetings will be held with each of&lt;br/&gt;the BD fellows to assess their academic progress and career development. These academic progress and&lt;br/&gt;mentoring meetings will continue throughout the entire program of study for all BD fellows.&lt;br/&gt;The program is designed to provide a series of career development courses and workshops to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;their successful completion of the program and preparation for careers in academia and related&lt;br/&gt;professions. Examples of such career development programs include: teaching preparation, ethical&lt;br/&gt;conduct of research, scientific writing, and a broad array of related career development workshops.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, regularly scheduled meetings of the local BD cohort, as well as annual meetings with all BD&lt;br/&gt;fellows in the CO-AMP alliance will build a sense of community and serve as a venue for sharing&lt;br/&gt;experiences and best practices.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: As the only urban, research intensive institution in the Rocky Mountain states, CU&lt;br/&gt;Denver offers a unique training experience in a wide range of STEM disciplines. Although the&lt;br/&gt;Management Team will make the BD cohort aware of all 29 STEM-related PhD training programs, BD&lt;br/&gt;fellows will be encouraged to matriculate into the following STEM programs where the USA job market&lt;br/&gt;is most promising: Mathematics and Statistical Sciences, Engineering and Applied Sciences, Computer&lt;br/&gt;Science and Engineering, Bioengineering, Computational Biosciences and Structural Biology. Through a&lt;br/&gt;well-developed series of career development courses and workshops, coupled with ongoing individual&lt;br/&gt;mentoring, the program will strive for successful completion of the PhD degree for all CU Denver BD&lt;br/&gt;fellows.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Although the percentage of underrepresented minority students continues to increase&lt;br/&gt;at the undergraduate level, matriculation into STEM graduate programs still lags behind. Consequently,&lt;br/&gt;it is critical to develop programs and mechanisms that encourage underrepresented students to&lt;br/&gt;matriculate into STEM graduate training programs as well as the successful completion of their PhD&lt;br/&gt;degree. Towards that end, this program will provide regularly scheduled mentoring and academic&lt;br/&gt;progression meetings with each BD fellow, career development workshops, teacher preparation courses,&lt;br/&gt;local and state-wide community building meetings, and a range of other activities and mentoring&lt;br/&gt;approaches to improve the likelihood of successful completion for their PhD programs. Best practices&lt;br/&gt;will be applied to other campus-wide recruitment initiatives for underrepresented students, as well as&lt;br/&gt;with other partners in the CO-AMP alliance and national LSAMP alliances. Ultimately, the long-term&lt;br/&gt;goal of this and similar programs is to train and prepare a larger number of underrepresented students&lt;br/&gt;for careers in the STEM disciplines, where they will serve as role models for the ongoing matriculation of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented students in STEM graduate programs and professions.</AbstractNarration>
