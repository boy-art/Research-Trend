    <AbstractNarration>Through the STAR Chemistry project the Principle Investigator team at Walsh University seeks to increase the number of economically disadvantaged students who complete a degree in chemistry. A cohort model is used to facilitate the retention of 16 participants. The students participate in activities that strengthen their self-identity as chemists, live and take classes within a learning community, and build relationships with faculty mentors. A unique feature of the project is the innovative chemistry curriculum which integrates the American Chemical Society (ACS) criteria for a certified degree with coursework and internships in order to produce graduates with expertise that fits the workforce needs of the region. In order to attract eligible candidates and broaden participation, a comprehensive recruitment plan that involves interacting with students at high schools, on-campus science workshops, and local and regional science fairs, using student database providers, and hiring a project-specific Admissions Advisor is initiated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The S-STEM scholars take part in a redesigned program of study that addresses the existing gap in skills needed by chemistry graduates and those identified by local industry. The new curriculum includes a Career Seminar Series, a Chemistry Internship, and courses in Materials, Environmental, and Fuels and Energy Chemistry. The academic program is augmented with evidence-based strategies for retention such as a learning community grounded in five essential topics (community building, diversity, integration, active-learning, and reflection/assessment), motivational faculty mentoring, a first year seminar, and optional undergraduate research. Data generated through assessment and evaluation support the rationale that employment-motivated students who are provided with an applied curriculum and co-curricular assistance become self-identified chemists who are retained through graduation. Formative and summative evaluation focuses on whether or not the program objectives of (a) identifying and recruiting a diverse population of academically talented students, (b) increasing chemistry major retention, and (c) preparing students with skill to enter the workforce are met. Assessment of students' progress and preparedness is performed. The students are surveyed about the effectiveness of the project's components. Dissemination of the project results provides a model for using an industry-centered curriculum as a means of retaining STEM students. The project team presents their work through annual meetings of the ACS and the Ohio Academy of Sciences and through publication of evaluation findings in journals such as the Journal of Chemical Education and the Journal of College Science Teaching. Project deliverables include results of summative evaluation and the course materials developed for the new curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
