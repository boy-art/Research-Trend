    <AbstractNarration>The emergence of petascale computing platforms brings unprecedented opportunities for transformational research through simulation. However, future breakthroughs will depend on the availability of high-end simulation software, which will fully utilize these unparalleled resources and provide the long-sought third avenue for scientific progress in key areas of national interest. This award will deliver a set of open source petascale quantum simulation tools in the broad areas of materials design, nano science and nanotechnology. Materials prediction and design are key aspects to the recently created Materials Genome initiative, which seeks to "deploy advanced materials at least twice as fast, at a fraction of the cost." Computational materials design is the critical aspect of that initiative, which relies on computation guiding experiments. The outcomes of the latter will in turn lead to follow-up computation in an iterative feedback loop. Nanoscience, which studies properties of materials and processes on fundamental scale of nanometers, promises development of materials and systems with radically new properties. However, the nanoscale properties are hard to measure and even harder to predict theoretically. Only simulations that can fully account for the complexity and variability at that fundamental scale stand a chance of predicting and utilizing the macroscopic properties that emerge. This truly requires petascale resources and efficient petascale software tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will develop software tools build on the real-space multigrid (RMG) software suite and distribute them to the national user community. The RMG code already scales to 128,000 CPU cores and 18,000 GPU nodes. The award will further enhance RMG through development of new iterative methods with improved convergence, optimization of additional modules for existing and new petascale computing platforms, and creation of ease-to-use interfaces to the main codes. Workshops in RMG usage will be conducted at XSEDE workshops and other meetings of NSF supercomputing centers. RMG will be distributed through a web portal, which will also contain user forums and video tutorials, recorded at live user sessions. A library of representative examples for the main petascale platforms will be maintained. RMG will enable quantum simulations of unprecedented size, enabling studies of the building blocks of functional nano or bio-nano structures, which often involve thousands of atoms and must be described with the requisite fidelity. The development of petascale quantum simulation software and its user community will lead to cross-fertilization of ideas both within and across fields. Students and postdocs trained in this area will have significant opportunities for advancement and making substantial impact on their own.</AbstractNarration>
