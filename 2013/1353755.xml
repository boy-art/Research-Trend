    <AbstractNarration>Through the Developing Excellence in Engineering and Physics (DEEP) Scholars project a team of faculty and administrators at the University of Georgia (UGA) is increasing the number of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn a baccalaureate degree in engineering and/or physics. To this end the project is providing seventeen scholarships to students pursuing degrees in agricultural, biochemical, biological, computer systems and environmental engineering and/or physics. Recognizing the national need to prepare students who have strong backgrounds in both physics and engineering along with the emerging trend in industry to merge the two disciplines, the project team is offering a rigorous, 15-credit hour curriculum for an Interdisciplinary Certificate in Engineering Physics which scholarship students are encouraged to complete. By making possible increased access to these majors, the project is helping to meet regional and national STEM workforce needs. In addition, to broaden participation, students from groups which are under-represented in STEM (women, 1st generation, African American, and Hispanic) are being actively recruited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical features of the project are guided by the following objectives: (a) to provide academic and social support that leads to retention in the major through facilitating learning communities among student cohorts, (b) to engage students in state-of-the art STEM research and design projects by establishing collaborations with STEM faculty, and (c) to create internships and other learning opportunities by leveraging partnerships between UGA and engineering and hi-tech employers in both industry and government. Data generated through assessment and evaluation is expected to support the rationale that high retention of students in STEM fields is achievable through a comprehensive program of academic and social support. Formative project evaluation is examining whether or not each project component contributes to student success, the effectiveness of the management team, and the impact of recruitment strategies. Summative project evaluation focuses on the whether or not the project is meeting its goal to increase the number of well-prepared students majoring and ultimately graduating in the selected fields. Dissemination of the project results is expected to provide a model for implementation of evidence-based practices in STEM recruitment and retention. The project team also plans to present its work at the Institute on STEM Teaching and Learning (a regional meeting hosted by UGA) and through the national Center for the Integration of Teaching and Learning. Project deliverables include results of summative evaluation and the course materials developed for the Interdisciplinary Certificate in Engineering and Physics.</AbstractNarration>
