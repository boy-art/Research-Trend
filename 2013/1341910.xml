    <AbstractNarration>Overview&lt;br/&gt;Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes that are the progenitors of chloroplasts in plants and algae. The objective of this project is to request financial support for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from US institutions to attend the 11th Cyanobacterial Workshop in St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Cyanobacteria provide the blueprint of oxygenic photosynthetic metabolism that supports the rest of the biosphere. Genome sequences of over 100 cyanobacterial strains, isolated from diverse ecological niches, have been determined. This has opened up new opportunities for intellectual interactions between researchers in traditional biological disciplines with those in physics, chemistry, computational sciences and engineering. This workshop will provide an informal forum to foster such interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Cyanobacteria have recently attracted significant interest for carbon-negative production of bioenergy and biomaterials. This workshop will help educate non cyanobacteriologists to understand the life styles of these photosynthetic microbes. This workshop will emphasize the use of synthetic biology approaches, and will thus also help traditional cyanobacteriologists to understand emerging engineering approaches to utilize cyanobacterial biocatalysts. Overall, this workshop will cater to the needs of today's young scientists who are planning to use these photosynthetic organisms during their future career.</AbstractNarration>
