    <AbstractNarration>The US Census Bureau reports that African, Hispanic, and Native Americans comprise some&lt;br/&gt;30% of the US population, however only 16% of the undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics (STEM) degrees and less than 3% of the doctoral STEM degrees produced within the US are&lt;br/&gt;awarded to students from these groups! It is in the nation?s best interest to support innovations that test&lt;br/&gt;strategies to increase the success groups underrepresented in the STEM disciplines, not simply for reasons&lt;br/&gt;of equity or social justice, but because these students are an untapped potential in fulfilling the STEM&lt;br/&gt;workforce needs of today and tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed, ?BD-Cohort 5 ? LA-BRIDGE: Louisiana Broadening Resources for Increasing&lt;br/&gt;Diversity in Graduate Education,? represents a transformative and strategic institutional approach to&lt;br/&gt;build human resource capital at the doctoral level. In this endeavor, Louisiana State University (LSU), a&lt;br/&gt;state-supported Carnegie Research Extensive Institution, nationally designated as both land-grant and seagrant,&lt;br/&gt;will serve as the Bridging Institution. The project features strong inter-institutional collaborations&lt;br/&gt;between colleges and universities throughout the Senior Level Louis Stokes (LS) Louisiana Alliance for&lt;br/&gt;Minority Participation (LAMP); intra-institutional collaborations between the LSU Offices of Academic&lt;br/&gt;Affairs, Strategic Initiatives, and Research and Economic Development as well as the LSU Center for&lt;br/&gt;Academic Success; and international collaborations between LSU and the French Alternative Energies&lt;br/&gt;and Atomic Energy Commission in Grenoble (CEA Grenoble).&lt;br/&gt;The vision of LA-BRIDGE is to create a successful model to increase minority student&lt;br/&gt;persistence and global competitiveness at the doctoral level, an effective model with well-tested&lt;br/&gt;strategies, which can be adopted nationwide. The goals of LA-BRIDGE are a logical extension of the&lt;br/&gt;goals of the LS-LAMP Senior Alliance: (a) to increase the quality and number of minority STEM&lt;br/&gt;students pursuing doctoral degrees at the bridge institution; (b) increase the retention to graduation rate of&lt;br/&gt;minority STEM PhD students; and (c) investigate a national model for increasing the share of minority&lt;br/&gt;STEM PhD holders. The objectives of LAMP-BD are: (1) to provide systemic mentoring that includes&lt;br/&gt;effective faculty-to-student/student-to-student interactions that work collectively to increase the number&lt;br/&gt;of minorities earning PhD degrees in STEM fields; (2) facilitate academic support structures that increase&lt;br/&gt;students? acclimations to the rigors of doctoral study; and (3) expose minorities to international research&lt;br/&gt;experiences that prepare them for long-term scholarly engagement in the global STEM research&lt;br/&gt;enterprise; (4) to promote, guide and support the transition of these PhD degree-holders into the STEM&lt;br/&gt;research workforce with emphasis on the professoriate; and (5) to achieve self-sustainability by&lt;br/&gt;expanding, and institutionalizing the systemic mentoring, and research infrastructure enhancements and&lt;br/&gt;activities across the state.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: LA-BRIDGE will provide strategic and transformative leadership in&lt;br/&gt;designing effective LS-LAMP inter-institutional and multi-national alliances that improve the quality of&lt;br/&gt;STEM education for PhD students. This project will cultivate and test systemic mentoring strategies that&lt;br/&gt;have been designed to increase minority student matriculation and graduation from PhD programs.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the project will explore models to enhance the ability of LSAMP students to be more effective&lt;br/&gt;researchers in a global environment. The scientific basis of the mentoring model and its related activities,&lt;br/&gt;the publication in system mentoring and educational research, lend themselves to the development of best&lt;br/&gt;practices for graduate education and professional development. Further, the research to be conducted by&lt;br/&gt;BD scholars will contribute to scientific and technological innovations spanning the STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: LA-BRIDGE will increase minority student access to STEM PhDs. The salient&lt;br/&gt;project impacts are a) the increase in the number of high quality PhD level researchers from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority communities who will pursue research careers in the STEM academic,&lt;br/&gt;industrial, and governmental enterprise; b) the consequent contribution to and the development of a more&lt;br/&gt;qualified and diversified workforce; c) the wide-spread dissemination of the best practices of system&lt;br/&gt;mentoring for graduate studies and professional development; and d) the significant enhancement of&lt;br/&gt;institutional graduate education and research infrastructure. Further, this project will benefit society by&lt;br/&gt;enhancing the ability of its graduate students to thrive in an international research environment</AbstractNarration>
