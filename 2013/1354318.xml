    <AbstractNarration>DNA sequences that act to determine where, when, and to what degree genes are expressed are called cis-regulatory elements. It is estimated that these elements outnumber genes over 20 to 1 in the human genome, and it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the morphological diversity we see in nature is related to variation in these elements. This is true for both complex and simple traits, for variation within and between populations, and for changes at micro- and macro-evolutionary time scales. Although variation in the traits of organisms often traces to these elements within the genome, they remain poorly understood relative to protein-coding sequences of the genome. This projects seeks to gain a better understanding of how regulatory elements can drive the adaptation of complex traits. Specifically, the research will characterize the cis-regulatory architecture driving adaptive evolution of wing pattern coloration in Heliconius butterflies, an organismal system that has emerged as an important model for understanding the genomic dynamics of adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will address several fundamental questions including: (1) How are regulatory elements structured around genes that control rapidly evolving, highly variable traits? (2) How does regulatory element structure and activity evolve during the adaptive radiation of complex morphologies? (3) To what degree is similarity in morphology controlled by similarity of regulatory elements? This work will also help develop and adapt important new functional genomics techniques to facilitate the broader study of cis-regulatory elements across species. This project will also engage the public through the production of an IMAX documentary film that will incorporate stop action animations of butterfly wing development.</AbstractNarration>
