    <AbstractNarration>In this project, studies of micro-extrusion of pastes through high aspect ratio (HAR) micro-nozzles to fabricate multi-material, multi-layer (M3L) devices will be conducted. The capability for layer-by-layer fabrication with composition variation within each layer will be investigated. To provide unmatched capability for fabricating novel architecture of M3L devices not achievable today, extrusion behavior of various sizes of HAR micro-nozzles starting from millimeters all the way down to 25 micrometers will be studied. Novel three-dimensional (3D) supercapacitors with high energy densities will be used as a model system to investigate the challenges of the M3L technology. As such, extensive efforts will be made to study and establish the proper formulations of the desired pastes that can be micro-extruded using HAR micro-nozzles and have pseudoplastic characteristics to form a large layer with the desired thickness and a uniform composition. The 3D supercapacitors fabricated will be characterized structurally and electro-chemically to demonstrate the unmatched power of the M3L technology in fabricating durable, low cost, high performance devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M3L technology will reduce part count, part handling, part transportation and part storage because only one processing step is needed. Furthermore, the M3L technology will offer new manufacturing capabilities to produce M3L devices with the composition control locally at the micrometer level for the desired functionalities and the dimension control spanning over 5 orders of magnitude for high fabrication rates. It is expected that the M3L technology proposed can compete with conventional manufacturing methods for cost effectiveness, not to mention that the M3L technology can fabricate novel devices with new functionalities, not achievable via today's manufacturing technology. This project will have a substantial impact on manufacturing technology. It can greatly improve productivity, reduce the production cost, and enhance the U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. This project will also provide an excellent education and training opportunity to one graduate student and many undergraduate students in the areas of manufacturing and alternative energy.</AbstractNarration>
