    <AbstractNarration>Some of the most remarkable behaviors, including speech, musical, and athletic performance, depend on the brain's ability to precisely represent and control the timing and order of elementary movements. How the brain accomplishes this feat is largely unknown. This project will identify how the brain encodes the vocal elements and sequences used in learned vocal communication. To accomplish this goal, state of the art high-resolution optical imaging and electrical recording methods will be used to measure neural activity in animals as they engage in vocal learning and communication. This project will determine how populations of interconnected neurons that are necessary to vocal communication encode vocal elements and sequences. Accomplishing this goal is essential to understanding the neural basis of communication and also has other important potential benefits, including the ability to diagnose and ultimately repair brain pathologies that impair perception or movement, and to design machines that emulate these processes. This project will advance our understanding of neural mechanisms that enable the production and perception of complex, sequential behaviors, train professional scientists at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels, and enrich the science curriculum of high school students both locally and nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is that it will shed light into fundamental cellular processes by which the brain encodes complex learned behaviors. This project's goal is to understand how the brain encodes syllables and syllable sequences in birdsong, a complex learned vocal behavior. The study will focus on how syllables are represented by spatiotemporal patterns of activity in populations of sensorimotor neurons important to vocal communication. Resolving this problem is an essential step to understand the neural basis of vocal communication. This project blends leading edge methods, including multiphoton calcium imaging of neuronal population activity and intracellular recordings and genetic manipulations in singing birds, to explore the synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms that encode learned vocalizations. Until now, it has been impractical to interrogate how the brain encodes sensory and motor representations of such complex behaviors with cellular and synaptic resolution.</AbstractNarration>
