    <AbstractNarration>Serious physical design issues are breaking down traditional abstractions&lt;br/&gt;in computer systems and motivating computer architects to turn to&lt;br/&gt;hardware specialization. Hardware specialized for a single task will&lt;br/&gt;almost always be of higher performance and more efficient, in terms of&lt;br/&gt;silicon area and energy consumption, compared to a flexible hardware&lt;br/&gt;implementation that can handle many different tasks. Resolving this&lt;br/&gt;tension between less efficient general architectures and more efficient&lt;br/&gt;specialized architectures, particularly within the context of mainstream&lt;br/&gt;computing platforms, is one of the grand challenges facing the computer&lt;br/&gt;architecture community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on an observation of how software engineers address&lt;br/&gt;analogous challenges in the very applications targeted for&lt;br/&gt;specialization. Software engineers seek to create specialized yet&lt;br/&gt;flexible code, and the ubiquitous approach is to develop carefully&lt;br/&gt;crafted libraries of algorithms and data structures that are polymorphic&lt;br/&gt;over the types of input, output, and stored values. The key idea is to&lt;br/&gt;leverage the effort software engineers have already invested and explore&lt;br/&gt;polymorphic hardware specialization in the form of polymorphic&lt;br/&gt;algorithm-specific units and polymorphic data-structure-specific units&lt;br/&gt;for template-based software libraries. The project is using a vertically&lt;br/&gt;integrated approach to investigate polymorphic hardware specialization&lt;br/&gt;from a variety of perspectives including computer architecture, hardware&lt;br/&gt;synthesis, compiler optimization, and runtime systems. The techniques&lt;br/&gt;developed as part of this project will be an important step towards&lt;br/&gt;addressing the physical design issues, which threaten to disrupt the&lt;br/&gt;long-standing trend towards ever increasing computing performance relied&lt;br/&gt;on by all aspects of modern society.</AbstractNarration>
