    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how enzymes catalyze complex reactions that are linked to dynamic motions in the cell requires insight from many perspectives. The Southeast Enzyme Conference (SEC) (established in 2010) is a forum for investigators in the field of enzymology to initiate scientific discussions and set up valuable collaborations. The major objectives of the conference are: 1) to provide an interactive venue to present, discuss, and debate the latest topics in the field of enzymology; 2) to provide a setting for young investigators to present their research and 3) to enhance diversity by introducing students from underrepresented groups in the sciences to the field of enzymology. The conference has already led to critical contacts between researchers in the Southeast region. The scientific scope of the conference is broad, and encompasses the relationship between enzyme structure and function, the role of dynamics in catalysis, the mechanisms of biological oxidations, the regulation and evolution of novel pathways, and the use of enzymes as biocatalysts. The conference provides a unique forum for young investigators early in their careers to present their research and meet other investigators in the field of enzymology. Increasing student interest at all levels in the field of enzymology is critical to maintain the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The Southeast Enzyme Conference (SEC) was initiated due to a critical mass of enzymologists in the region. The Conference brings researchers together with a similar interest in understanding the mechanistic and structural properties of enzymes. The SEC provides a unique opportunity for scientific exchange and collegial interactions among researchers working at the forefront of all aspects of enzymology. The collegial, informal atmosphere of this one-day event is highly effective in fostering the free exchange of ideas. Establishing collaborations with colleagues, often within driving distance, promotes new research directions for investigators. The speakers for the conference are undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and junior faculty with a very high proportion of speakers and discussion leaders being women and members of underrepresented groups in science. The Southeast has a large number of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Researchers at HBCUs working in the field of enzymology are personally contacted and encouraged to attend the conference with their students. In addition to the oral presentations, there are two poster sessions to increase scientific dialogue and promote collaborations among investigators at all levels. The event allows students, postdocs, and faculty members to interact, and provides important networking opportunities and intellectual development.</AbstractNarration>
