    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEES Fellows: Sustainable Nanosilicon Production through the Electrochemical Reduction&lt;br/&gt;of Diatoms and Integration into Wastewater Remediation and Biofuel Industries&lt;br/&gt;PI: Steven N. Girard, University of Wisconsin Madison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanostructures of abundant and non-toxic silicon can serve a significant role in various renewable&lt;br/&gt;energy technologies, including solar cells, Li-ion batteries, and thermoelectric materials. To realize&lt;br/&gt;the potential of nanosilicon for renewable energy applications, mass quantities must be economically&lt;br/&gt;and sustainably produced. Current silicon production relies on an energy- and material- consuming&lt;br/&gt;carbothermal reduction process, in which the reaction between carbon and sand (silica) at very high&lt;br/&gt;temperatures yields metallurgical silicon and carbon dioxide. Metallurgical silicon is subsequently&lt;br/&gt;dissolved, refined, and recrystallized in multiple energy- and material-consuming steps to generate&lt;br/&gt;nanosilicon for renewable energy applications. For nanosilicon to be used for renewable energy, the&lt;br/&gt;large scale production of silicon must be redesigned from a sustainability perspective. I propose to&lt;br/&gt;develop an altogether new process of direct electrochemical conversion of nanosilica-to-nanosilicon&lt;br/&gt;that will be energy and material efficient, and therefore inexpensive and sustainable. In collaboration&lt;br/&gt;with industrial partner AlgaXperts, we will also analyze the scalability and feasibility of this&lt;br/&gt;approach through the integration into existing wastewater remediation and algae-for-biofuel&lt;br/&gt;industries by essentially recycling the nanostructured diatoms (silica) from these processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.&lt;br/&gt;A novel process of sustainable and direct nanosilicon production through the&lt;br/&gt;electrochemical reduction of nanostructured silica frustules of diatoms will be developed. The&lt;br/&gt;naturally nanostructured silica microshells of diatoms (unicellular algae) are inexpensive and easily&lt;br/&gt;obtained either from mined diatomaceous earth deposits or from diatom algal cultures. Under host&lt;br/&gt;mentor Prof. Song Jin, Department of Chemistry at UW-Madison, the proposed research seeks to&lt;br/&gt;develop electrochemical reduction of nanosilica within novel eutectic salt electrolytes, which will&lt;br/&gt;enable single-step nanosilicon production at very low temperatures, consuming considerably less&lt;br/&gt;energy. If the starting nanomorphologies can be retained following conversion to silicon, this&lt;br/&gt;process will represent the most sustainable means of nanosilicon production to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be immediately useful for a variety of industrial&lt;br/&gt;applications and expose the SEES fellow new chemical techniques. We further propose harvesting&lt;br/&gt;specific diatom genera from industrial-scale algal cultures used for the bioremediation of wastewater&lt;br/&gt;effluent and production of lipids for biofuels. Obtaining specific diatom genera allow control over&lt;br/&gt;the types of nanostructures obtained. In collaboration with partner mentor Jun Yoshitani, President&lt;br/&gt;of AlgaXperts LLC, we will analyze the feasibility of the integration of these approaches at a&lt;br/&gt;Midwestern water treatment facility. Furthermore, this collaborative research will involve chemical&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the wastewater effluent nutrients, selectivity of specific genera in industrial-scale cultures,&lt;br/&gt;and analysis of the associated costs. The SEES fellow will gain a better understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;industrial considerations connected to implementing large-scale sustainability technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational Outreach.&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with Prof. Greg Nemet, Nelson Institute of Environmental&lt;br/&gt;Studies at UW-Madison, and Dr. Andrew Greenberg, Director of REU programs at UW-Madison, a&lt;br/&gt;highly interdisciplinary summer practicum focusing on public policy and sustainability science will&lt;br/&gt;be designed and implemented. Lessons learned in the primary research will be integrated into the&lt;br/&gt;REU summer practicum. In collaboration with Dr. Greenberg, underrepresented minority&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate researchers will be mentored by the SEES fellow in summer research projects related&lt;br/&gt;to the proposed research. The SEES fellow will gain experience in sustainability policy, teaching,&lt;br/&gt;course design, integration of teaching and research, and undergraduate mentoring.</AbstractNarration>
