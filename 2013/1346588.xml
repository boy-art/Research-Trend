    <AbstractNarration>The XLIII International Symposium on Multiparticle Dynamics (ISMD 2013) will be held September 15-20, 2013 at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This symposium will bring together particle and nuclear physicists who share common interests in the study of multiparticle reactions at particle and nuclear physics colliders and will provide a forum for well-established physicists to interact with junior members in the field to work on solving the most complicated aspects of quantum chromodynamics. Participants will discuss recent experimental results, as well as new developments in theory that impact both communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ISDM 2013 represents a good opportunity for students and post-docs to further their training and advance their careers. These activities encourage research across discipline boundaries. The NSF support of this symposium will be used to support minorities, students or postdocs, who would be otherwise unable to cover travel expenses to the symposium, registration and local expenses.</AbstractNarration>
