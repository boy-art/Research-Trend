    <AbstractNarration>The Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) will provide support to the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences for the NSF Post-Doctoral Fellows workshop to be held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO, April 21-23, 2013. The organizers are Linda George and Eve Grunfest, Program Directors at NSF and Chris Davis, Advanced Study Program Director at NCAR. The target audience includes Principal Investigators (PIs) with fellowships awarded through the AGS Fellowship Program (NSF 11-521) as well as current NCAR ASP Postdoctoral Fellows, approximately 35 fellows. The meeting will be held at Center Green and at the MESA lab. The intellectual merit of this workshop is based on its threefold purpose: &lt;br/&gt;1. Familiarize Fellows with NSF - AGS and other programs at NSF and NCAR facilities;&lt;br/&gt;2. Familiarize Fellows with the research of other Fellows in order to promote interdisciplinary research activities; and&lt;br/&gt;3. Provide professional development opportunities, including a workshop on power dynamics in professional workplaces; a panel on career opportunities post post-doc; an introduction to working across disciplinary boundaries with social scientists.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts expected as a result of this workshop are increased awareness among the audience of emerging atmospheric and geospace senior scientists of interdisciplinary research challenges and opportunities, possible career trajectories and workplace power dynamics and an improved understanding of NSF funding opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JOSS is providing logistic support by scheduling meeting spaces, providing webcasting for the meeting with NSF Program Officers in DC, providing transport between hotel and meeting spaces and to NCAR facilities and arranging for travel and fees for invited speakers.</AbstractNarration>
