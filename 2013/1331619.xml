    <AbstractNarration>This travel grant supports US graduate students to attend the Doctoral Consortium to be held in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2013) to be held on April 22-26, 2013. Attendees include graduate students who are working on their dissertations and have been accepted to the consortium. Each student participant is paired with a senior researcher who serves as his/her mentor during the conference. Each participant also presents his/her research at a doctoral Consortium luncheon open to participants and mentors and also presents his/her research in a poster session open to all attendees of the conference. Graduate students play critical roles in conducting innovative and groundbreaking research. The consortium provides talented young researchers the opportunity to discuss their work formally and informally with both their peers and senior researchers. These interactions with others coming from different research labs with different viewpoints typically strengthen the ability of young researchers to communicate the value of their own work and to set their work more clearly in the broader context of the research field as a whole. The successful career of graduate students would be imperative to advance the state of the art in new algorithms and applications related to face, gesture, and body motion, leading to new capabilities in areas such as biometrics, interactive systems, surveillance, and healthcare.</AbstractNarration>
