    <AbstractNarration>Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and other advances in hardware have made it possible to address many security issues, such as ensuring that all loaded software is from authorized sources. As an example, The Windows 8 Secure Boot relies on TPM technology to provide strong guarantees for device integrity, and both Intel and AMD chips include abilities to use external verifiers for code verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although these hardware advances provide extremely useful and powerful security properties, researchers and practitioners have been slow to adopt these technologies. One of the main reasons is the lack of familiarity with the capabilities and properties of these technologies. To address this situation, the Trusted Infrastructure Workshop (TIW 2013) provides training for current graduate students with experience in computer security about these technologies and how they can be leveraged for research and engineering. TIW 2013 offers students lectures by leading researchers from industry, government, and academia that are actively developing and using trusted computing technologies, as well as developing future infrastructure technologies for building secure systems.</AbstractNarration>
