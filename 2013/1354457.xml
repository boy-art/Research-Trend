    <AbstractNarration>Name: Fang Lin&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: IOS-1354457&lt;br/&gt;Proposal title: The role of endoderm in cardiac morphogenesis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During vertebrate heart development, a key conserved step is the migration of two bilateral populations of myocardial precursors towards the embryonic midline, where they merge to form the primitive heart tube- the foundation of heart development. This migration is highly regulated and requires interactions between the migrating myocardial precursors and their microenvironment, which includes the adjacent endoderm. However, the mechanisms enabling endoderm to promote myocardial migration are unclear. The Principal Investigator's lab has identified a signaling pathway that is critical for migration of the endodermal tissue layer and the myocardial precursors. In this project, they will apply their expertise in zebrafish genetics, GPCR signaling, and in vivo imaging, and use established tools to dissect the interactions between the endoderm and myocardial precursors. This study is expected to lead to a clear understanding of how the endoderm regulates myocardial migration, which may be broadly applicable to other species. This contribution will be significant in that it will establish a framework for the interplay between the endoderm and myocardial precursors during vertebrate heart development, and provide insights into the mechanisms whereby tissue interactions influence organ development. The knowledge gained from this study will help us to understand how the heart develops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zebrafish represents not only a valuable research model, but also an excellent teaching tool for students at all levels. The zebrafish embryo is transparent and develops externally, making it possible to observe developmental processes, including heart development, through a simple stereomicroscope. Thus, zebrafish provides a deliverable classroom-based learning opportunity. The PI is passionate about bringing science to the classroom, inspiring new generations, and promoting an awareness of basic biological research among the public. She believes that these efforts have a positive impact on society. The PI will continue to conduct outreach educational projects at local K-12 schools, to provide undergraduates with research experience, and to contribute to graduate and postdoctoral fellowship training.</AbstractNarration>
