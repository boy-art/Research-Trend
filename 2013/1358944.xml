    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor provides fifteen undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in high energy physics at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in activities such as seminars and lectures to learn to understand the nature of international scientific collaborations and the questions and methods of modern physics research. By the end of the program, every student will have given a formal presentation, which will be recorded on video and posted on the CERN website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site, where each summer five high school teachers from across the U.S. are exposed to the world of research at CERN. The teachers will use their experience to motivate their students to better understand the physical world and prepare them to become the future generation of scientists. Teachers also share teaching methods with teachers from other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU and RET site will have a number of broader impacts. The U.S. has a significant stake and financial investment in the CERN research program. Therefore, it is very appropriate that U.S. undergraduate students and high school teachers are involved in research and learning opportunities at CERN. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students and teachers from groups underrepresented in physics to ensure that this valuable international research experience is accessible to a diverse group of future physicists and high school teachers who train future physicists.</AbstractNarration>
