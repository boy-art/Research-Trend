    <AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the 2013 International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2013), which will be held in Dallas, Texas, from December 9-12, 2013. ICDM has established itself as the world's premier research conference in data mining. The total number of ICDM participants in the past has been in excess of 500, with a majority of the participants coming from the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia. The award provides travel scholarships to 16 U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the ICDM conference and participate in the Doctoral Forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICDM provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and systems, and applications, as well as related areas such as data management, machine learning and bioinformatics. The conference proceedings are published by IEEE. The conference seeks to continuously advance the state-of-the-art in data mining. With the growth of the Web, the Internet, and data intensive technologies such as sensor networks and bioinformatics, data mining has become an extremely important area in information technology. Besides the technical program, the conference features workshops, tutorials, panels, data mining contest. Since 2007 the conference has included a data mining contest, and since 2011, it has also included a Ph.D. forum that provides valuable feedback on preliminary research methods and results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strong representation of U.S. researchers, especially graduate students, in ICDM 2013 is critical for maintaining U.S. competitiveness and for nurturing the next generation of young researchers in an increasingly important area. The award also helps broaden the participation of women and members of underrepresented groups in data mining research.</AbstractNarration>
