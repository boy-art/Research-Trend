    <AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project at Tennessee State University will produce mechanical and electrical engineering graduates with knowledge and skills in renewable/alternative energy systems through a selection of undergraduate elective courses and research experiences. The project deploys an effective pedagogy for delivering coursework in renewable/alternative energy systems, develops a laboratory for instruction and research to promote engineering education and research solutions in energy storage devices and fuel production, and enhances faculty expertise through collaboration with university and industry partners in advanced energy systems. Partner institutions include Wayne State University, University of Tennessee, the University of Michigan, Nissan Corporation, Pennsylvania State University and the US Air Force Research Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The establishment of a renewable/alternative energy systems laboratory at Tennessee State University represents the efforts of an alliance of universities, representation from industry, and federal agencies with shared interests in the development in advanced energy systems. This unique partnership informs curriculum development efforts in mechanical and electrical engineering. Over 150 African American students directly benefit from enhanced coursework and undergraduate research experiences. The project provides engineering students with critical skills and knowledge for the automotive industry and federal organizations by addressing workforce demands in the emerging technologies of energy storage devices and bio-fuels.</AbstractNarration>
