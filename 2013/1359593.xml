    <AbstractNarration>Plants are attacked by many kinds of insect pests, and quick detection is key to successful defense. A newly discovered way that plants can detect insect attack - sensing vibrations caused by insect chewing - is likely to be faster and more reliable than other known detection systems. This project has four goals. First, the new detection system will be studied in several kinds of plants and insect pests. Second, rapid screening methods for its action will be developed. Third, the features of the feeding vibration signal that are important to the detection will be characterized. Fourth, the kind of plant receptor likely to be detecting the feeding vibrations will be identified using mechanoreceptor mutants. This knowledge will provide targets for breeders to enhance plant resistance to insect pests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will train students and postdoctoral scholars for careers in science and communication with the public. It will also train teachers to incorporate more science into their classrooms. The world of plant-borne vibrations featured in this proposal is highly appealing to children and the public at large. By providing acoustic ecology kits and training to teachers, additional children will experience the excitement and rewards of science.</AbstractNarration>
