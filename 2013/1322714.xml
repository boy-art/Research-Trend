    <AbstractNarration>Fruit represent a significant portion of human diets and a major constituent of global food security. Fruit are significant contributors of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates and fiber, yet present day fruit and vegetable intake is well below dietary guidelines. Inadequate fruit consumption is due partly to practical production, storage and shelf-life constraints limiting fruit availability at affordable prices. In addition, reduced flavor, appearance and aroma qualities, often attributed to early harvest and incomplete ripening (necessary for produce survival through modern supply chains), decreases consumer interest in fruit and fruit products. A better understanding of the genetic control of ripening and associated nutrient, flavor and quality characteristics, will provide growers, breeders and seed companies with tools for selection of higher quality fruit crops. Recently numerous ripening control processes have been resolved in tomato due to its short life cycle, providing insight into strategies for improving fruit quality while minimizing product loss. The primary objective of this project is to investigate the extent to which findings in tomato hold true for additional fruit crops, thus providing paths toward crop improvement. We have selected melon and banana as research targets due to their global consumption and economic value, and because they represent a range of ripening mechanisms and genetic diversity that will distinguish specific from more general ripening and fruit quality control components. Genes and genetic processes conserved among these species are likely to be common to most other fruit crops and will provide practical selection targets for fruit quality and shelf-life improvement. This project will also provide international exchange of students and postdoctoral fellows between the US and Israel as part of the scientific training and collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
