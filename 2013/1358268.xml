    <AbstractNarration>The main goal of this 3-year SHINE project is to improve present understanding of the heating and acceleration of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) by examining the physics of interplanetary CME (ICME) evolution, especially as it relates to the filament material and its reflection of the energization of the ejecta. In-situ data and new analysis techniques will both be employed to measure the low charge states of heavy ions for the first time, revealing previously undetected ICME core material. The science objectives aimed with this project are highly relevant to topics that are central to the SHINE community. A fundamental part of the research work integrates the expertise of young scientists at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor with the professional training of seasoned researchers. In addition to providing the community with a comprehensive list of in-situ observations of cold ICMEs, this work will also provide a thermal history of the plasma involved. Future models by the community will be constrained and improved by these plasma results. By including researchers at the undergraduate level in several of the data analysis tasks, this work will also act as a tool to educate and give experience to the rising generation. The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comprehensive survey to result from this SHINE project will relate cold ICME material in the heliosphere to the eruption process at the Sun through two main objectives: (i) determine the prevalence of filament material within ICMEs; and, (ii) determine the physical properties of the CME plasma during the eruption process that are responsible for either preserving or obliterating filament material on its way from the corona into the Heliosphere. The Michigan Ionization Code (MIC) will be used to predict charge state evolution in the filament in order to: (i) investigate the formation of higher charge states and the survival of low charge state ions during the eruption process; and, (ii) reconstruct the energetics of erupting filaments, including the temperature, density, and velocity evolution of the plasma from launch to the freeze-in point. Thus, the outcome of this project is expected to be of great value to the solar-heliospheric community, and SHINE in particular.</AbstractNarration>
