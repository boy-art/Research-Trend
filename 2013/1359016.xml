    <AbstractNarration>This grant funds the National Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program (NREUP), administered by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), headquartered in Washington, D.C., and held at various locations throughout the United States. The program is designed to provide undergraduates from underrepresented groups majoring in mathematics or a closely related field with challenging research opportunities and will offer these experiences during the summers of 2014, 2015 and 2016. The length of the experiences can vary from location to location but will be a minimum of six weeks. The program will reach minority students at a critical point in their career, midway through their undergraduate program through an undergraduate faculty member with whom they have a strong connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NREUP will continue its track record of increasing minority students' interest in obtaining advanced degrees in mathematics. NREUP will invite mathematical sciences faculty to host MAA Student Research Programs on their own campuses. The MAA will select the best from competing proposals. NREUP provides key components to encourage students to pursue graduate studies and careers in mathematics: enriching and rewarding mathematical experiences, mentoring by active researchers, and intellectual networking with peers. It also provides an annual full day program to assist the new REU director with management details of the program and the potential REU director with further refinement of his/her concept and proposal writing skills. It also assists attendees in expanding their knowledge of federal and non-federal funding sources and increasing their knowledge of and skills in student mentoring. Moreover, by supporting faculty at a diverse group of institutions to direct summer research experiences, this project supports not only undergraduate students but also the development of a community of skilled faculty mentors who are expected to provide ever-increasing opportunities for undergraduate research. This project is jointly supported by the Workforce and Infrastructure programs within the Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
