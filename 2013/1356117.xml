    <AbstractNarration>This project provides partial funding for US participants in the 30th International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics (ICGTMP) which takes place at Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium on July 14-18,2014. The conference series is a very important meeting point for scientists working at modeling physical phenomena through mathematical and numerical methods based on geometry and symmetry and is the oldest and largest among the conference series devoted to geometry and physics. It has been further broadened and diversified due to the successful applications of geometric and algebraic methods in life and materials sciences. The meeting brings together about 250 international top researchers, often from different backgrounds but with group theoretical or algebraic methods as common ground. Among the topics to be addressed are: groups and representations, quantum mechanics, quantum computation and information theory, symmetries in biosciences, wavelets, geometric mechanics, string theory, quantum gravity, exactly solvable systems, many-body systems and random matrix theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 ICGTMP is the major meeting devoted to this interdisciplinary field, the prime venue for senior researchers to keep up with the latest exciting developments and to present their work to a highly interested audience, and for newcomers to the area to make valuable contacts and learn about the most promising areas for future research. This is one of the very few forums for mathematicians, theoretical physicists, experimental physicists, engineers and biologists to interact on symmetry-related problems of mutual interest. Symmetry is arguably the most important concept that guides science in its exploration of nature. Mathematics enables one to exploit the symmetries inherent in modern physical theories. Physics draws heavily on symmetry ideas to provide structure in these theories, including such newer fields as quantum information theory and quantum computation. Engineering areas such as tomography and signal processing, including wavelets, radar and sonar are intimately bound up with symmetry analysis.</AbstractNarration>
