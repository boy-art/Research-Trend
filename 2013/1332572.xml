    <AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation (NSF) supported Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Targeted Infusion Project at Bowie State University (BSU) lays the foundation for a concentration in the institution's plant science curriculum. Undergraduate students are introduced to interdisciplinary teaching and cross-disciplinary research to meet 21st century global challenges in sustainable energy, environmental and climate change as well as renewable and green energy research. The goals of the project at this minority-serving institution are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Increase student interest, understanding, and research competencies in Plant Sciences through academic and summer faculty and peer-mentored research;&lt;br/&gt;2. Infuse an interdisciplinary approach to Plant Science;&lt;br/&gt;3. Create and implement a laboratory intensive Plant Science course;&lt;br/&gt;4. Enhance the General Biology and Plant Physiology laboratory course curricula by integrating research and introducing new experiments into the curriculum; and,&lt;br/&gt;5. Develop state-of-the-art teaching and research infrastructure in Plant Science laboratories through the acquisition of new research equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration with University of Maryland and other research organizations, acquisition of new research equipment, faculty and student STEM professional development will result in a sustainable plant science program for BSU and the surrounding community. Evaluation and dissemination activities will be shared throughout the institution's STEM community and broader through BSU's website, presentations at STEM research and education conferences and publications in STEM journals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aligns with the College of Arts and Sciences strategy of promoting the engagement of minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines through integrated and diversified experiences.</AbstractNarration>
