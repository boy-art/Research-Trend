    <AbstractNarration>Dissolved organic nitrogen is one of the most important - but perhaps least understood - components of the modern ocean nitrogen cycle. While dissolved organic nitrogen represents a main active reservoir of fixed and seemingly biologically-available nitrogen, at the same time most of ocean's dissolved organic nitrogen pool is also apparently unavailable for use by organisms. Recently, the idea of the "Microbial Carbon Pump" has emerged, providing a renewed focus on microbes as primary agents for the formation of biologically-available dissolved material. However, the role that microbes play in transformation of biologically-available dissolved organic nitrogen is still lacking. In order to fill gaps in this knowledge, researchers from the University of California Santa Cruz will apply a series of new analytical approaches to test the role of microbial source and transformation in formation of the ocean's biologically-available dissolved organic nitrogen pool. Results from this study will address one of the major unknowns of both chemical oceanography and the ocean nitrogen cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will provide oceanographers new tools to test ideas of microbial organic matter sequestration in a world where the oceans are rapidly changing. High school, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral education will be furthered through active participation in lab, field, and data synthesis activities.</AbstractNarration>
