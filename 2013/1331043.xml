    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Wood Based Composites (WBC) located at the Oregon State University (OSU). Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test the hypothesis that the ability of a wood-adhesive bond to resist degradation due to water intrusion is dependent on penetration of the resin into the cell walls of wood. The project proposes to quantitatively measure adhesive penetration in 3D and in multiple scales, and then correlate the results with adhesive bond performance. Multiple spatial scale of analysis is needed to detect moisture-induced deformation of adhesive bonds and interaction of pre-polymer with the cell wall. This effort is a fundamental approach to solving the long-standing problem of durability of wood-based composites and it compliments an ongoing research project sponsored by the I/UCRC for Wood-Based Composites (WBC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will support the development of better wood composite materials and directly assist manufacturers of wood composites and adhesives. The impact of the research will be realized through direct involvement of the industry members of the WBC, technical reports to be distributed to the WBC members, publication in technical journals and conference proceedings to a broader science and technology audience, as well as inclusion in college courses and short courses. Student involvement in research is a point of emphasis for the WBC, and recruitment efforts place high priority on inclusion of women and underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines. If successful, results from the proposed project will remove speculation concerning influence of cell wall penetration on moisture resistance of adhesive bonds in wood and provide guidance for new adhesive formulation to improve moisture resistance or reduce adhesive costs.</AbstractNarration>
