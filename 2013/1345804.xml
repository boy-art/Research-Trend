    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing high-strength and low-density natural fiber composites for structural applications in the construction and automotive industries using a preform compression molding process. The mechanical performance of current natural fiber composites is limited to non-load-bearing components in structures due to poor fiber/matrix interface and short fiber length limited by conventional manufacturing processes. To address this issue, this project will investigate an innovative high-throughput preform compression molding process using an air-laying deposition technique. The technical result of this program will enable the production of a new class of green composites to create sustainable building materials and light weight fuel efficient vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to produce natural fiber composites with adequate mechanical properties for structural applications in the construction and automotive industries for sustainable building materials and energy efficient vehicles. It is expected that high performance and less expensive natural fiber composite will quickly gain a considerable market share in the $20 billion building materials market and $162 million automotive interior panels market. In addition, this new class of sustainable composites will provide multiple broader impacts including 1) significant weight reductions for more fuel-efficient vehicles; 2) improved water- and UV-resistance over conventional materials for green buildings that optimize the indoor environmental quality with lower maintenance costs; 3) stronger building materials and safer vehicle panels due to the high vibration damping and impact resistance of these composites; 4) the use of renewable resources for sustainable materials production to achieve energy and environmental efficiency; and 5) potential Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design (LEED) credits and/or tax rebates to end users.</AbstractNarration>
