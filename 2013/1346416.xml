    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize a fully implantable, integrated, ultra-flexible device for high-bandwidth bidirectional interface with the central nervous system aimed at brain-computer interfacing (BCI) and neurobiology research applications. The device will incorporate the implantable component of the multichannel wireless implantable neural recording and stimulating system (WINeRS developed under NSF funding at Georgia Institute of Technology) with a microfabricated high-density electrode array and planar spiral coils (PSC) in a single flexible substrate. This implantable unit will operate in conjunction with the existing WINeRS external unit, slightly modified for compatibility with the PSCs. Such a device will allow unrestricted movement of animals during recording sessions with no tethering effects, and require no transcutaneous wired connections thus reducing associated risks of infection or irritation. While the initial application will be micro-electrocorticography (?ÝECoG) to support brain activity mapping (BAM) in freely roaming animal models, the technology developed will be crucial for a broad range of wireless neural interface challenges in both the central and peripheral nervous system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is both a wireless recording device for the animal research market and (perhaps more importantly) critical technology for next generation neural interface devices for human applications. By tightly integrating the ultra-flexible electrode array, IC, and coils required for power and bidirectional data telemetry into a single flexible unit, the proposed ?ÝECoG device will represent a significant advancement in tools available for BCI, BAM, and other neurobiology research. The advanced biocompatible packaging technology results in the IC being thinned to the point of flexibility (25?Ým) and fully embedded within the device ¡V the packaging is the device. The high-density connection scheme allows &gt;1000 electrodes to be connected to the IC for high-bandwidth neural interfacing. The technology developed will be directly applicable to a broad range of neural interface devices for the central and peripheral nervous system ¡V key components of brain-machine interfaces (BMI) to restore motor and sensory function to people afflicted with nerve damage from injury, stroke, or neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the devices developed will be of immediate interest to biomedical researchers for animal studies and the technology of future interest to medical device manufacturers for advanced prosthetics.</AbstractNarration>
