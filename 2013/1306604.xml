    <AbstractNarration>This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award to Dr. Abigail Reft is supported by both the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation. During the 24-month fellowship, Dr. Reft will work on a project titled, "Apical structures and the molecular mechanics of nematocyst discharge" under the sponsorship of Dr. Suat Ã–zbek at Heidelberg University in Heidelberg, Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All members of the group Cnidaria (which includes sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish) produce microscopic stinging capsules called nematocysts. Nematocysts consist of a tubule enfolded within a capsule. Upon stimulation, the tubule discharges from the apex of the capsule and exposes spines borne on the tubule. At the apex of the capsule is one of three different structures, each one characteristic of different lineages within Cnidaria. The process by which the apical structure opens and discharge proceeds is known only for one form and little is known about the protein components or construction of any of the forms. This project seeks to understand these biologically important cellular products by documenting the proteins involved in making the apical structure and documenting discharge in nematocysts bearing each apical form. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide insight into the construction and evolution of one of the most complex structures produced by a single cell and will provide information on mechanics of these biological machines. After identifying the components in one of the apical forms, the presence of these components in the other two forms will be evaluated. Furthermore, the impact of different apical structures in the process of discharge will be determined. Through these endeavors, the common development, discharge processes, and "toolkit" of proteins specific to apical structures will be identified, allowing some inference of the ancestral form and discharge in nematocysts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morphological information will be shared on the Morphobank (http://www.morphobank.org/) to enable collaboration with other scientists studying the evolution of morphology. Furthermore, previous collaborations with institutions such as the Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium will be continued to educate the public and disseminate research results.The PI also plans to engage members of the host lab, including mentoring of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides a unique opportunity for a US scientist to collaborate with foreign scientists, and utilize the unique facilities, expertise and experimental conditions available abroad.</AbstractNarration>
