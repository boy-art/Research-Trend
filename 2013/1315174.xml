    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project presents novel approaches to fabricating dry, removable, reusable adhesives on substrates using scalable fiber spinning methodologies. The proposed work differs drastically from other research programs to replicate bio inspired adhesive mechanisms, which are based on the use of aligned carbon nanotubes, photolithography, chemical etching, and time-consuming batch micro/nano molding processes. The new research offers advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle free nanofiber spinning processes, which will replace the more expensive approaches such as micro/nano fabrication process. The research incorporates interdisciplinary mechano-electro-rheology for improving understanding of dry adhesives. Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the spinning process. Introduction of nozzleless electrospinning polymer blending and equal-channel angular pressing will combine processing stages such as solution preparation, spinning and spin-finish in one production line, significantly reducing processing time and costs. Prototype polymer adhesive fabrics will be characterized tested to optimize performance based on customer requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be significant improvements in dry, reusable adhesive products for target markets already identified and studied. Improved adhesive joining for composites in automotive applications would lead to weight reduction by enabling replacement of metal body panels with lighter composites, increasing fuel economy and saving energy. In consumer adhesives, the value proposition for dry adhesives would improve product safety, reduce environmental impact from messy liquids, and improve educational experiences for children. In labels, an easily removable adhesive would eliminate residue glue, in turn simplifying and increasing recyclability of packaging and reducing waste in landfills. In addition, new adhesive products based on nanofiber spinning will lead to new applications in markets not yet explored in biomedical, electronics, robotics, tires and military segments.</AbstractNarration>
