    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to further develop the research team's privacy preserving secure data exchange technology. This technology uses a two-party secure computation mechanism allowing for verifiable private data reconstruction and comparison without the sender revealing the data to the receiver. The technology is designed to assure an individual's privacy by empowering the individual to have full control of their own data with three advantages. First, the data exchange technology does not need a trusted third party to act as a proxy to realize privacy protection. Second, data intended for an exchange is based on reconstruction by the receiver using helper data and does not require the data owner to disclose or share private data over the communication channel. Third, the technology is scalable for use in a distributive computing environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology has the potential to provide a foundation for a number of technical solutions for various applications and markets. There is a need for this type of technology in emergency management and emergency health data management, for example, this technology would allow an emergency medical technician responding to an incident to reconstruct the emergency health data of an individual without that individual having to unlock their smartphone and reveal the emergency data it stores. In addition to facilitating secure emergency health data exchange, this technology could also be used with biometric authentication applications.</AbstractNarration>
