    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The proposed project seeks financial support for support conference organization expenses related to Workshop on Frontiers in Electronics (WOFE-13) to be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico on December 17-20, 2013. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This Workshop on Frontiers in Electronics (WOFE-13) will bring together researchers focused on the frontiers of electronic device and circuit research and development. This workshop will be a special forum to gather some of the most creative minds and leading experts from academia, industry, and government agencies, to review the most recent advances in electronics. The workshop will include a wide range of topics such as nanoelectronics, wide band gap technology, UV photonics, and Terahertz electronics. This meeting offers a special opportunity for the community to share state-of-the-art technological developments, stimulate new ideas, and explore/promote new collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The meeting aims to bring together international researchers from academia, government and industry to assess the current state-of-the-art of electronics and photonics. The meeting will help to advance these fields through sharing of results, methods, inspiring of new ideas, and initiation of new collaborations. WOFE-2013 will pay special attention to attracting students and young faculty with special emphasis to inviting women and members of the under representative minorities. Proceedings of WOFE-13 will appear in the Special Issue of International Journal of High Speed Electronics and Systems and will also be published as a hard cover book.</AbstractNarration>
