    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this REU Site is to engage undergraduate students on a wide range of aspects in robotics research - including mechanical engineering, design, electrical engineering, and computer science - while learning how to build complete systems that are able to deal with all of the complexities and uncertainties of the real world. REU students gain insight into the process of doing research in a university environment, what it takes to be a successful graduate student, working on a multi-disciplinary robotics project in a large research group, and what graduate student life looks like. The skills that students are learning by participating in this REU Site will prepare them for graduate studies and to enter the rapidly-expanding robotics industry, and help the United States maintain its lead as a technological innovator. We are starting to see robots enter our daily lives, and we need students who understand how to put together complete working systems and make them work in the real world. The ability to work as a team, across disciplines, is a vital skill in today's research and work environments, and not only in robotics. This REU Site is teaching students the non-technical skills that will make them attractive hires in any field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU students work alongside with faculty, graduate students, and other undergraduates on cutting-edge problems in robotics, with the goal of getting robots to work robustly in the real world, not just in the laboratory. Student projects are advancing the state of the art in walking robots, human-robot interaction, control of complex mechanical systems, and long-term autonomy. More information about this REU Site can be found at the web site (http://robotics.oregonstate.edu/reu).</AbstractNarration>
