    <AbstractNarration>The genus Buddleja, commonly called the butterfly-bushes, is a group of flowering plants that includes approximately 110 species of shrubs and trees. They exhibit great diversity in the architecture of inflorescences, the structures in which groups of flowers are arranged, which has been hypothesized to be adaptations to different habitats and pollinators. Also, the group has a wide distribution, including areas of Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. Hypotheses concerning the geographic origin and dispersal history of the group and its relationship to past geologic and climatic events have been proposed but remain untested. The PIs will conduct a molecular phylogenetic study of the genus, using DNA sequences from multiple loci to infer evolutionary relationships among species. A novel high-throughput method of gathering genetic data will be developed. The inferred phylogenetic tree will be used in further analyses to test hypotheses about inflorescence architecture evolution and biogeographic history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reproductive architecture, including inflorescence form, is an important component of the success and diversification of flowering plants, and this project will contribute to elucidating patterns in its evolution and adaptive significance. The study of biogeographic history is important for understanding the formation of modern floras and current distributional patterns. Buddleja includes many species of conservation, ethnobotanical, and horticultural interest. Understanding species relationships will help guide future research in this group.</AbstractNarration>
