    <AbstractNarration>The 9th William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day, directed workshop on "Geometry and Groups after Thurston", to be held at the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August 27-31, 2013. The workshop will consist of a two-day minicourse for graduate students and junior researchers, followed by a three day lecture series. This past year has seen the passing of William P. Thurston (1946-2012) whose work and conjectural program infuenced much of the research in the field over the past three decades. Also, recent progress has seen most of Thurston's conjectural program now solved. This year's workshop aims to consider new directions of research and new problems which will direct future research in the spirit of Thurston's original program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate common themes and techniques among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested in these areas. The workshop will bring together leading researchers in geometry and topology with graduates students and junior researchers who have a special interest in problems related to group theory and low-dimensional geometry to investigate questions at the forefront of research in these areas. The confluence of expertise from different areas will result in new collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of the participants.
