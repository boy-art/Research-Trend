    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This program is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers. The goal of the BME-Simulations, Imaging and Modeling (SIM) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) is to provide a quality research experience to students, especially underrepresented minorities, in eastern North Carolina increasing awareness of and application to graduate school. At the end of the program students should have a better understanding of how to conduct research, increased awareness of graduate school, clarification and reinforcement of STEM career path, and greater identification as engineer/scientist. To achieve these program goals we plan to engage participants for longer than the 10 week summer research experience by collaborating with off-site mentors at our targeted institutions. To ensure a broad applicant pool, student recruitment will begin at our targeted institutions: Elizabeth City State University, Fayetteville State University, and North Carolina Central University, historically black institutions, and University of North Carolina-Pembroke, a public institution serving a large Native American population. National recruiting by listserv announcements and website information will supplement the targeted recruiting. Graduates of the program will gain a better understanding of graduate school and be competitive in the graduate school application process increasing diversity in the STEM pipeline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational goals of the REU will be accomplished through a multidisciplinary approach using simulations, imaging, and modeling as a common thread. The popularity of computational research models has increased due to limited use of human subjects and animals. In addition, models can be used to test hypothetical situations or new devices. The introduction of subject specific modeling has allowed for detailed analysis using the subject's own parameters. Generally these parameters can be derived from non-invasive imaging techniques. Through the REU program students will be exposed to cutting edge research utilizing advanced computational models with applications in biomedical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This program is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers. The BME-Simulations, Imaging and Modeling (SIM) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) will provide high quality research experiences to targeted students, specifically underrepresented minorities. Exposing underrepresented minorities to innovative research will increase their awareness about graduate school and ultimately increase the STEM graduate school pipe line. The proposed REU program will also strengthen their STEM career paths and increase student's identities as scientists or engineers. These research opportunities would generally not be available to the targeted student populations without this program. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the faculty mentors, the proposed work will also encourage research collaboration among the faculty mentors and across academic departments on campus. Including off-site mentors in the recruitment process will facilitate collaboration between ECU and the targeted institutions increasing research opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
