    <AbstractNarration>The primary objective of this proposal is to develop collaboration between Dr. Shaopeng Wu of Wuhan University of Technology in Wuhan, China and the PI of this project, Dr. Hao Wang of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, U.S. for innovative developments in the field of infrastructure material and pavement engineering. The focus area is the development of multifunctional asphalt materials with superior mechanical properties and as well as self-sensing potential through the integration of experimental investigation and computational modeling. This collaboration will provide a foundation to advance fundamental understanding and development of high performance and multifunctional infrastructure material using nanotechnology. This will not only have the potential of improving mechanical properties (stiffness, fracture toughness) and durability of infrastructure material, but also change its electro-mechanical properties (i.e. piezoresistivity), and thermal conductivity. This offers an opportunity to tailor and produce a new smart material. Although the research is mainly focused on asphalt materials, the knowledge developed from the proposed collaboration is also applied to other construction materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foreign partner in China has an extensive experimental facility for U.S. students to work as exchange students. The PI will incorporate findings from this project into civil engineering courses and a new graduate course. The proposed collaboration will recruit women undergraduate students into future research activities, in collaboration with The Academy at Rutgers for Girls in Engineering and Technology (TARGET) program.</AbstractNarration>
