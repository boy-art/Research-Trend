    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Alexandru Asandei of the University of Connecticut will develop new methods towards the controlled synthesis of fluorinated (co)polymers with complex architectures. First, convenient reaction conditions for the small scale polymerization of fluorinated monomers will be explored, and novel initiating methods, such radical generation directly from (fluoro)alkyl halides or hypervalent iodides, will be studied. Second, the development of catalyzed iodine degenerative transfer controlled radical polymerization of vinylidene fluoride to obtain "living"-like, narrow molecular weight distribution fluoropolymers will be examined. Third, the utility of the proposed chemistry will be demonstrated via the synthesis of well-defined, fluoromaterials with complex architectures. The broader impacts include advanced training for graduate and undergraduate students, collaborations with high school teachers on the development of a workshop with hands-on experimental work related to polymers and nanotechnology, dissemination via social media of the demonstrations developed in the workshop, and the broad dissemination of research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymers are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life that utilize plastics, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices. Polymers that contain the element, fluorine, (fluoropolymers) are versatile specialty plastics used anywhere from nonstick coatings, pipe liners, and O-rings for rocket engines to materials for fuel cell membranes. This research seeks to advance our knowledge in the synthesis of fluoropolymers and could lead to new types of advanced materials for a wide range of applications.</AbstractNarration>
