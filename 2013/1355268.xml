    <AbstractNarration>Femtocells are capable of providing wireless broadband access coverage in cellular weak zones and indoor environments; they do this by improving link quality and enabling spectral reuse. A femtocell access point (FAP) is a low-power, low-cost, short-range, plug-and-play, cellular base station typically deployed in residential area or small office. Femtocells not only provide better quality of service to indoor users, but also reduce maintenance cost and power consumption of base stations. Consequently, they are attractive to many classes of users. The goal of this project is to develop a technology-disposition plan, addressing value proposition of the wireless capacity improvement technology, the products' customer base and emand, revenue model, partnership strategy and resource requirement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project may impact the nation's wireless industries. All the wireless carriers need technologies that can increase spectrum utilization and reduce interference thereby enabling them to enhance network performance (support more users) without increasing cost. This project is an attempt at meeting this need. In addition to serving wireless carriers, this technology may also have broader impacts on organizations that use wireless networks, such as enterprise, entertainment, healthcare and transportations.</AbstractNarration>
