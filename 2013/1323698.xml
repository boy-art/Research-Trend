    <AbstractNarration>This research will explore the political, economic and cultural resources, processes and consequences of state-sponsored, culturally-oriented post-disaster reconstruction of an ethnic minority. After a devastating earthquake claimed about 10% of the ethnic population in 2008, many villages not only swiftly recovered materially, but were made into heritage tourist destinations with state planning to "restore and develop" their culture. The proposed research will examine both the state's conception of the ethnic minority through its policies and projects, and the range of villagers' response to the reconstruction and negotiation of lives and relationships revealing complexities and problems of this culturally sensitive recovery project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will conduct 10 months of fieldwork. Two more months will be spent interviewing officials and planners in the capital as well as archival research into official reconstruction policies and tourism plans. Physical changes of the villages and statistical data of the reconstruction will be collected and mapped. Participant observation, interviews, and focus group discussions will be conducted to understand how villagers differently perceive and interact with the newly-established living environment and changed lifestyle. Beliefs, rituals, traditional festivals and official events will be documented to show the negotiation and representation of emergent and differential identities. This research is important because it will contribute to the anthropological study of disaster recovery by examining the interplay of state-led planning and the core values of an affected ethnic minority. The knowledge gained will help the research, teaching and awareness of the complex effects of any recovery project that claims to seek justifiable and sustainable community development.</AbstractNarration>
