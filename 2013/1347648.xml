    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will integrate young scientists into a Gordon Research Conference focused on the emerging field of macroecology, which incorporates a synthesis of ecology, evolution and physiology to develop a mechanistic approach to understanding ecological patterns in nature. Students and postdocs will be mentored in an atmosphere where young scientists are comfortable sharing ideas with their peers and with more senior scientists. The increased participation of the future leaders of cross-disciplinary research will improve the scientific discourse at the meeting by bringing fresh ideas and perspectives on this important new synthetic field of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macroecology holds significant potential to increase our scientific understanding of plant and animal responses to climate change, habitat alterations, and other environmental perturbations. This proposal will help support and mentor the next generation of cross-disciplinary scientists by providing them access to a network of scientists with similar interests, providing venues for them to improve their presentation skills, and receive mentoring from leaders in their fields. The program will also target members of under-represented groups in biology, to ensure that these individuals have access to the ideas presented at the Gordon Research Conference.</AbstractNarration>
