    <AbstractNarration>This research program is focused on the discovery of physics beyond the standard model utilizing novel techniques to look for new phenomena in the complicated LHC environment. This research program will expand the scope of dark-matter searches at the LHC by introducing new models of interactions, enabling stronger collaboration between experimentalists and theorists, and by fleshing out theoretical assumptions of the dark-matter models. Model-independent search techniques will then be applied to new, unexplored final states. In addition, novel jet-substructure techniques will be developed at CMS to look for new physics associated with boosted hadronic W's, Z's, and Higgs bosons. This program will develop a better understanding of high transverse momentum identification of b quarks and of jet sub-structure algorithms. This research program also includes contributions to the development of the CMS pixel luminosity telescope, and contributions to the simulation and front-end needs of the CMS hadronic calorimeter upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts include their planned contributions to the existing Rutgers QuarkNet effort and plans for speaking to high school groups.</AbstractNarration>
