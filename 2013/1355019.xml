    <AbstractNarration>During the development of a seedpod, the cellular and molecular interactions that allow productive seed development are extremely complex and dynamic. Within a developing seedpod, cells must interpret and respond to numerous cues that coordinate positional information with gene expression and cellular proliferation to allow the proper development of seeds. Furthermore, this coordination of patterning cues and cellular proliferation underlies many diverse biological processes, from cancerous growth to reproductive development, and thus is of interest to a broad spectrum of biologists. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that coordinate these processes in plants are also of practical importance, and are the basis for improving agricultural production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Dr. Franks and colleagues will investigate the molecular interactions that allow seeds to develop within the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. By understanding these molecular mechanisms Dr. Franks' group seeks to enable future strategies to alter seed number in agricultural or bioenergy crops thus support efforts to supply food and fuel for a growing global population. His efforts focus on defining the gene regulatory hierarchy that controls the development of the specialized tissue that generates the ovules within the seedpod (i.e. the carpel margin meristem). A multidisciplinary integration of genetic, genomic and bioinformatic approaches will be applied to achieve these goals. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel application of cell-sorting technology to the study of the seedpod allowing his group to assay cellular transcriptional states at an unprecedented level of specificity. Additionally, Dr. Franks' group creates and presents hands-on science demonstrations and educational science videos at North Carolina middle schools. By engaging students and teachers at these grade school outreach events, as well as via the training of scientists at varied levels and from diverse backgrounds, Dr. Franks' group works to create a scientifically well-educated community.</AbstractNarration>
