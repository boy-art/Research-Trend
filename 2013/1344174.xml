    <AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is patially funded by PRIME in the Directorate for Education and Human Resourses and REE in the Directorate for Engineering. The overall goal of the project is to create theoretical and assessment models of 21st century competencies as they relate to engineering and computer science. The PIs are conducting research and a domain analysis to establish domains within the context of Engineering Design and Computer Science Principles. The domain analysis and models provide the foundation for developing assessment frameworks in general research, education, engineering, and computer science communities. Developed models will lay the groundwork for the greater research community to develop and test human and automated methods to effectively and efficiently assess a range of competencies through portfolio and assignment analyses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is its potential to advance interdisciplinary evaluation and assessment and inform the field about new methodologies. The research will create a foundation for automated scoring by developing a framework to systematically dissect student work documented within an e-portfolio or computer science work assignment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address broader impacts and benefit society through the development of assessments that are universally designed, thus impacting a broad range of learners. The research will address real gaps in portfolio-based assessment systems that currently lack comprehensive and standardized methods to assess 21st century skills.</AbstractNarration>
