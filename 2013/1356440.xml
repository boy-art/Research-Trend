    <AbstractNarration>This project at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) is providing an enhanced educational experience to economically disadvantaged and academically talented students, with emphasis on those from underrepresented groups and those who are transferring from local community colleges. In support of that goal, the program is awarding annual scholarships to sixteen students who are majoring in mechanical engineering, with an average scholarship amount of $7500. By expanding access to a course of study in this field, the project is helping to increase the overall pool of STEM-educated students ready to meet national workforce needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical basis of this project lies in a formal cooperative relationship UMBC has with local community colleges to increase the number of students transferring to the four-year Mechanical Engineering program. Within its overall enrollment strategy the project is actively recruiting underrepresented minorities and women through a focus on the biomedical specialization within Mechanical Engineering. The S-STEM scholars receive multi-layered faculty mentoring, academic intervention, access to research opportunities, and career advice, and benefit from an institutional support infrastructure designed to increase retention and career success of all undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
