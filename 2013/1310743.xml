    <AbstractNarration>Malaria parasites produce male and female cells within the blood of their vertebrate host (e.g. humans, birds, or lizards) that infect the blood-feeding insects that transmit them. The proportion of male vs. female cells influences the number of new parasites produced following mating, and Sex Ratio Theory predicts the best ratio that will maximize parasite transmission success. The graduate student developed new predictions for the optimal sex ratio based on the parasite?s transmission, which is that proportionally fewer parasites surviving within-insect development should favor sex ratios nearer 1:1. Insects will be infected with multiple strains of a lizard malaria parasite. Parasite numbers and the abundance of different strains will be monitored throughout development using newly-developed techniques in molecular genetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is important for understanding not only the sex ratio of malaria parasites, but also malaria transmission in general. This lizard parasite is of particular interest because it has the fastest known within-insect development. Monitoring proportions of strains may help understand patterns of genetic diversity, which relate to drug resistance and virulence. This project will provide opportunities for undergraduates and younger students to gain research experience, including directly funding one undergraduate field assistant. Data, animations, and research descriptions will be available online (www.uvm.edu/~aneal/homepage.html).</AbstractNarration>
