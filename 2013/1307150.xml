    <AbstractNarration>The research program focuses on precision measurements of quantum-vacuum induced interactions known as the Casimir force using a high-sensitivity torsion balance. Significant emphasis will be placed on accurate quantifications of surface electric effects, thus improving experimental sensitivity to distinguish a specific model to be employed in theoretical calculation of the Casimir force. The research will address a key problem in modern precision measurements in which the presence of surface-induced interactions at metallic interfaces has become one of the biggest sources of systematic errors, as noticed in the trapping and manipulation of single-atom for quantum computing, and in precise gravitational experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). As a historically important scientific tool that has helped verify two of the fundamental forces in nature (i.e. gravitational and Coulomb forces), the torsion balance provides an excellent table-top research platform to investigate the quantum vacuum induced small forces at a predominantly undergraduate institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intrinsic to the project is the integration of the undergraduate education with cutting-edge research. The research program will provide on-campus research opportunities for undergraduate students, enhancing an existing research program in the area of precision force measurements at Seattle University. The students will receive training in research methods for defining and addressing open-ended problems, professional ethics and conduct, and scientific reporting and communications by engaging in leading-edge research projects. The research program will expand faculty-led research opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds and is designed to lay the foundation for a long-term integrated scientific and education program in the physics department at Seattle University.</AbstractNarration>
