    <AbstractNarration>A workshop for recipients of research awards in the Enhancing Access to the Radio Spectrum (EARS) program is being held at the National Science Foundation on October 7 &amp; 8, 2013. An important component of the EARS program is interchange of information among the awardees, and between the awardees and stakeholder communities, such as wireless providers, spectrum regulators, public safety, the defense and national security communities, and others. This project provides travel support to small business and academic awardees under the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program to attend the workshop, and interact with their academic colleagues who are performing research in the same domain.</AbstractNarration>
