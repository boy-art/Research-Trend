    <AbstractNarration>The Workshop on Security and Human Behavior (SHB) was started in 2008 to facilitate a dialogue about behavioral aspects of safety and security that is developing between psychologists and security engineers. Related conferences include the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) which brings together security people and psychologists but is more narrowly focused on the usability of security products and systems. The Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS) has much broader scope but as its name suggests its focus is security and economics. The goal of SHB is to bring in a broader set of social scientists than those involved in SOUPS, WEIS, and similar conferences, with a 50/50 mix between social scientists and computer scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides financial support to cover travel, accommodation and registration for students and social science faculty members, allowing expansion of access to workshop scheduled to be held at University of Southern California's National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE - www.usc.edu/create) on June 3-4 2013. Past workshops have been hosted at MIT, Cambridge, MA (2008 and 2009), Cambridge, UK (2010), CMU, Pittsburgh, PA (2011), and Google HQ, New York (2012). The program committee of this year's workshop consists of (1) Bruce Schneier who is Chief Security Technology Officer of BT, (2) Professor Alessandro Acquisti of Carnegie Melon, and (3) Professor Ross Anderson of Cambridge.</AbstractNarration>
