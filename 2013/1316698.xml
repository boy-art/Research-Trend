    <AbstractNarration>The American Indian Language Development Institute (AILDI) will host a two-day conference to address the current state of indigenous languages in the United States and to particularly question what progress has or has not been made since the passage of the Native American Language Act in 1990 and since the most quoted public statistics citing the rapid loss of these languages published in 1995 by Michael Krauss. The two-day conference will bring together stakeholders and scholars in the field of indigenous languages to discuss the current state of these languages in the United States. AILDI believes that it is time to reassess and to try to determine the following: 1) What was the effect of the Native American Language Act on the state of indigenous languages? 2) Has it brought about positive change? 3) Are there more current statistics on the vitality of these languages? 3) Where are and who are the next generation of speakers of indigenous languages? 4) What is the reality of 'best practices'? Namely, what has been the impact of 'best practices' on the state of indigenous languages? 5) Is there now such a thing as 'best practice' based on what we now know? 6) What has been the effect on training language researchers (both Native and non-Native) working on indigenous languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has not been an assessment of the state of indigenous languages in the US since the Native American Language Act in 1990. Since then many changes have taken place. These changes have certainly impacted the landscape of Native American languages; however, there has been little discussion as to what specific changes have taken place, how these are being realized, how challenges are faced and how solutions are shared. There is a great need for reassessment of the general state of indigenous languages at this point in time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AILDI sees the two-day conference as an opportunity to begin to address this problem. After twenty years, there have been substantial changes in policy, both locally and nationally, which impact the use and teaching of indigenous languages. This two day conference will have sessions addressing the role of language documentation and the impact on revitalization, the use of cutting edge technology for pedagogical and archiving purposes as well as impact of the providing skilled training for language immersion teachers for producing new speakers in communities. In addition, the conference will provide opportunities for participants to engage in discussions both orally and in writing about what they view as significant mile markers in the status of Native American languages as well as the challenges that remain.</AbstractNarration>
