    <AbstractNarration>Land use is a major driver of global change and is intimately connected with ecosystem structure and function, and with human well-being. Natural and managed landscapes are called upon to supply food and fiber, support climate change mitigation and adaptation, alleviate poverty, and support human well-being. Yet, the knowledge base for understanding and promoting sustainable land-use trajectories is highly fragmented and oftentimes isolated from its social context and from the human communities who represent the principle agents of change. This Research Coordination Project will create an interdisciplinary network of scientists, decision makers and other stakeholders to synthesize existing information, and produce science products to understand and advance sustainable land-use trajectories. The major activities will be to: generate a suite of qualitative land-use scenarios co-developed with stakeholders that depict a range of possible future social, economic, and environmental realities for the New England region of the United States; simulate the land-use scenarios as they interact with multiple environmental stressors using existing modeling frameworks; evaluate these scenarios in terms of ecosystem services that are defined together with the stakeholders; and share knowledge with the broader public and decision makers to advance sustainable land-use trajectories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will integrate multiple broader impacts throughout its five-year duration. By including post-docs and students at all levels as participants in the network, this project will contribute to STEM workforce development by offering direct experience in managing collaborative, interdisciplinary research networks. The network will also provide training for scientists of all ranks in techniques of stakeholder engagement, linking science with action, and science communication. This project will sponsor regional workshops for developing stakeholder-defined land use scenarios and for linking these to practical solutions that can be put into action.</AbstractNarration>
