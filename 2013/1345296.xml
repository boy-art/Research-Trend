    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims at demonstration of a revolutionary new thermal interface material (TIM) and innovative technology for TIM dispersion in industrial environments. Efficient thermal management is one of the most important requirements for further progress in semiconductor and communications technologies. Growing densities of dissipated heat require new types of TIMs for heat removal from devices and chip packages. Strong enhancement of the thermal conductivity will be achieved via a novel functionalization of graphene flakes, which act as fillers in the TIM matrix. Graphene has the highest thermal conductivity of any known material. The project will lead to a better understanding of thermal transport in complex composites with graphene fillers and clarify the effect of nanoparticle surface functionalization on thermal coupling between the filler and matrix. The project's intellectual contributions will go beyond thermal management and impact other fields that unitize nanostructures for increased functionality and performance of advanced materials. It is expected that the graphene-enhanced TIMs to be developed will have the thermal conductivity values exceeding those of the commercially available TIMs by an order of magnitude. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project originates from the crucial importance of creating a more efficient TIM with the potential for a revolutionary advancement in thermal management. The proposed graphene-enhanced technology is expected to produce a transformative change in the $500 million TIM market. Better heat removal enabled by functionalized graphene fillers will produce a lasting positive effect on the electronic and automotive industries, communications, photovoltaic energy generation, and aerospace and defense sectors. The proposed technology surpasses the competition by offering much stronger enhancement in thermal conductivity with a corresponding reduction in thermal resistance, and an industrially feasible TIM dispersion process. Finally, the availability of superior, cost-effective TIMs will help to preserve domestic technological leadership in the strategically important areas of information processing and communications.</AbstractNarration>
