    <AbstractNarration>The Togiak Archaeological and Paleoecological Project (TAPP) is a long term study of paleoecology and Yup'ik Eskimo village history, demographics, subsistence, technology, and social change in northern Bristol Bay, Alaska. The project is centered on the Old Togiak archaeological site, where previous investigations in the early 1960s identified stratified house mounds of the Thule phase, dated to the last 1000 years. With excellent preservation of faunal remains, house features, and a wide variety of stone, bone, antler, ivory, and wooden tools, the site offers abundant potential to address research questions associated with village evolution, and subsistence strategies. In the long term, the project will test alternative hypotheses linking climate change and resource access to patterns of village occupation and foraging strategies. The proposal is appropriate to the EAGER funding mechanism because the geophysical investigation will require significant exploration and analysis before a well constrained and defensible protocol can be established for a full research project. In addition, laboratory studies emphasizing extensive radiocarbon dating are needed to construction of an initial paleoecological model, and preliminary evaluation of subsistence behavior over time. This preliminary data and analyses are critical for envisioning the direction of a full research effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is important to other archaeological investigations because it will set out the protocols and create models of complex mound sites and as such provide an economical way for investigating these complex archaeological sites. The research will also provide insights into issues of critical importance concerning the relationship between climate and shifting resource exploitation strategies and the evolution of social complexity. Another issue critical for this project is that the Old Togiak Site, which is a uniquely large mound site in South Western Alaska, is at risk of being destroyed in the next few years by beach erosion, ice damage, and subsistence digging. In addition, the project team will utilize the first year of the project to consult extensively with the Togiak community about the design of the second year's field research. This process will provide a model for Alaska Native community consultation and inclusion in archaeological research.</AbstractNarration>
