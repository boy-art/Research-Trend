    <AbstractNarration>This platform presents a hardware-neutral way of developing sensing and ubiquitous computing applications. It is focused on making sensing application available to a larger community of users and developers. It is centered around 2 core concepts: a layered approach to system design, and a set of simple network APIs and data abstractions. The design and simple programming model make it possible for novice developers to rapidly design and develop new and creative applications. The project focuses on lowering the knowledge and skill required of application developers that wish to integrate sensor information. It does this through a combination of simple data structures and information models, and a layered network-based API that hides unnecessary details from developers, freeing them to focus on specific tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While commodity sensors and software are becoming more readily available every day, the programming interfaces exported by those systems are tightly bound to the sensors the system supports. Researchers believe that this platform presents a positive first step toward sensing systems that are flexible and general-purpose enough to support a wider array of sensors than is possible in competing systems.</AbstractNarration>
