    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Vincent L. Pecoraro of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan will develop new classes of metal complexes known as metallacrowns (containing lanthanides, transition and alkali earth metal ions) with interesting magnetic, luminescent and catalytic properties. The goal of this research is to exploit the characteristics of these metallacrowns to make complexes that will reduce the volume necessary to store information magnetically, that may be used as in vivo and in vitro luminescent agents for the imaging of chemical and biological samples and to prepare new multimetallic catalysts for fine chemicals synthesis. This work has been used for the development of laboratory undergraduate courses and likely will engage both undergraduate and possibly high school student participation. Also, this work is used as an example of creativity in scholarship in an undergraduate course on this subject at the University of Michigan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metallacrowns (MC) are metallamacrocycles that have since garnered considerable attention for their structural versatility and metal-rich topology. Of particular interest is a vast series of 3d-4f heterometallic MCs that contain a transition metal ion and a lanthanide (Ln3+)ion. The main objectives of this proposal are to exploit the potential of this type of MC for applications in 1) molecular recognition and catalysis, 2) optical materials for luminescence and non-linear optics (NLO) and 3) molecular magnetism. Materials produced in this work have great potential to find commercial use. Substrate specific catalytic materials have potential to improve synthetic processes in the chemical industry, while MC research on magnetic materials has the potential to revolutionize data storage and enhance the understanding of magnetic phenomena. Lumiphores based on MCs containing Zn(II) or Ga(III) and Ln3+ ions are particularly promising for near-IR biological imaging and long range fiber optic telecommunications while application as NLO solids are also promising.</AbstractNarration>
