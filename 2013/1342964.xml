    <AbstractNarration>The proposed system is a power harvesting and charging unit that is integrated with textile antennas. The unique aspect of the project is the system integration of wearable textile antennas with signal processing and rectifying circuits to transfer energy into storage medium. The technology provides a means of collecting energy from air sent by base stations through radio-frequency and then storing the energy in a battery that can charge devices. Through the I-Corps program the research team aims to investigate the technology readiness for more widespread use. The prototype will be optimized and tested for various applications. It is anticipated that the findings of this proposed will provide novel textile antenna and rectifying antenna (rectenna) designs, as well as guidelines for better engineering and tailoring the system to achieve desired properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to enhance and provide enabling technology for future wearable systems for various applications such as smart wearable devices, biomedical health monitoring and situational awareness systems, by proposing a new generation of wearable rectennas. There are a number of mobile and wearable medical sensors and devices that monitor biomedical signals and send alerts to patients or care-givers, these devices could be recharged wirelessly using this technology. The technology could be integrated into a wearable device or "smart watch" that could be used in-conjunction with smart-phones and tablets. There are defense applications where this technology could be integrated into military uniforms to aid in communications.</AbstractNarration>
