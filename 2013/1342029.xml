    <AbstractNarration>1342029&lt;br/&gt;PI: Walker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop being supported is the 87th ACS Colloid and Surface Science Symposium at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), June 24-26, 2013. Funding partially cover costs associated with invited speakers and students attending the Symposium. This Symposium is perhaps the most important and extensive annual conference in the areas of colloid and interfacial sciences. The final program has 364 abstract submissions, accounting for 280 oral presentations and 84 poster presentations. The summer symposium at UCR will provide a forum for communicating fundamentally new insights into colloidal and surface science with particular emphasis on advances in environmental, biological, medical, and material applications. Due to its broad scope, this meeting attracts participants from diverse disciplines (e.g. Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Materials Science, and Physics, among many others) and nearly all major US academic institutions and many leading international institutions. The diversity of the participants and the talks is further represented by contributions from theoretical, computational, and experimental groups and the participation of scientists and engineers from all sectors including industry, government, and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from the NSF are being used to partially support the participation of not only premier researchers and leaders, but also a diverse pool of U.S. undergraduate and graduate students who are the future leaders in these disciplines. This Symposium is the most important annual event for the colloid science and engineering community in the US ? innovators who use fundamental principles to drive innovative solutions in medicine, defense, and environmental preservation and restoration, among many other fields. The event brings together acknowledged leaders in the field with up-and-coming scientists and engineers in an environment where new ideas can be shared and explored.</AbstractNarration>
