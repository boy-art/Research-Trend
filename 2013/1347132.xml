    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the structure and mechanism of atmospheric rivers (ARs) in the northeast Pacific and their impacts on U.S. weather simulated by global climate models, and understand the physical processes responsible for the systematic errors in the simulations. An analysis of satellite observations and reanalysis products including computation of composite sea surface temperature, air-sea fluxes and moisture budget associated with ARs will be undertaken. An examination of the impact of low frequency variability such as El Nino Southern Oscillation and Madden Julian Oscillation on ARs will also be investigated. An intercomparison of global climate model simulation, including the evaluation of AR simulations and the impact of the double Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) problem on precipitation along the U.S. West Coast through AR activity will be performed. The research will include conducting atmospheric coupled model experiments with prescribed sea surface temperatures (SST), which include the erroneous SST field associated with the double (ITCZ) problem. Finally upper ocean processes associated with ARs that could influence SST and air-sea fluxes of moisture using ocean coupled modeling experiments will be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will shed insights into ARs that are an important mode of providing precipitation to the western US. Enhanced understanding of ARs thus has important societal impacts and benefits.</AbstractNarration>
