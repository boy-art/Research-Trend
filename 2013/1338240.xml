    <AbstractNarration>This project will support travel by approximately 11-12 students at U.S. institutions to attend the 11th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services (MobiSys 2013). MobiSys, sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE, will be held June 25th-28th, 2013 in Taipei, Taiwan. Priority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this conference, but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. MobiSys is the premier conference in the field of mobile computing and system integration. It offers a variety of technical activities including keynote and contributed presentations, a poster session, demonstrations, three workshops, and a PhD Forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project furthers both research and education, by enabling graduate students conducting research in the field to attend high-caliber technical presentations, be exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students from around the world. The impact to the students' careers from attending MobiSys 2013 is expected to be substantial.</AbstractNarration>
