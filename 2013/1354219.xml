    <AbstractNarration>The vast majority of plants on earth harbor fungal endophytes within their healthy leaves. These endophytes enhance plant physiology and defense against pathogens, and shape the productivity of crops and wild plants. It was recently discovered that endophytes harbor their own endosymbionts -- endosymbiotic bacteria that live within fungal tissues (endohyphal bacteria). Fungal traits such as stress tolerance and cellulose degradation are enhanced by bacterial symbionts, suggesting an important, yet previously unknown, role in structuring beneficial relationships between fungi and their host plants. Broader impacts will directly reach high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and the public via a rotating display in the University of Arizona Mycological Herbarium, an extensive series of workshops for students at a large, urban, Hispanic-serving school, field experiences and laboratory internships for high school students, training for high school teachers, development of curriculum to achieve State of Arizona science standards, integration of project material into undergraduate courses at the University of Arizona, and mentoring junior researchers at multiple life stages. More broadly, the work will contribute to a new understanding of the factors shaping one of the most important, but least-studied, symbioses in which plants engage,thereby contributing to human health and sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the hypothesis that phenotypic variation in endophytic fungi, and the outcomes of their associations with plants, reflect a major role of endohyphal bacteria. Using tractable model systems, the specificity and lability of these associations and their outcomes will be tested. Transcriptomics will be used to identify how bacteria and fungi communicate, and to determine which pathways are upregulated in these dynamic symbioses. Overall, examining the diversity, plasticity, specificity, and gene expression associated with phenotypic effects of bacteria on fungi in the lab, in experimental plants, and across an environmental gradient will clarify the ecological importance of this tripartite symbiosis.</AbstractNarration>
