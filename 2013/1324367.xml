    <AbstractNarration>SES- 1324367&lt;br/&gt;Craig Jenkins&lt;br/&gt;Andrew Martin&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study examines the organization of online activism in a contemporary context. This addresses a key gap in current literature, which treats online activism in isolation from other mobilization processes. Our key hypotheses are: 1) Online activism is embedded in existing social networks and hence reflects the networks and social commitments online activists have developed in other contexts, 2) framing reflects these networks and commitments which shape the resonance of groups' strategic communications, and 3) groups that gear their messaging and tactics around these preexisting networks are more effective at mobilizing broader public support for public initiatives. This study uses regulatory initiatives in Ohio as its primary testbed for these arguments by: a) conducting surveys of online and offline activists; b) analyzing framing in the Twitter messages associated with these efforts; c) examining the network structure of these communications and their links to mobilization efforts of the rival groups; and d) linking the above dynamics to the public opinion and the outcomes of the initiatives. The investigators also compare this Ohio Twitter network to parallel initiatives in Wisconsin to confirm the similarity to this other online activity. This addresses several major gaps in existing studies of online activism and communications: How do the broader community networks influence the content and diffusion of Twitter communications? Do online and offline network ties equally or interactively facilitate activism at both the community and individual levels? How do online and offline communications affect public opinion and initiative outcomes? The answers to these questions will strengthen our understanding of how online activism fits in the broader context of contemporary activism as well as generate new text analysis tools for studying communications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The major impact of this study will be to inform the interdisciplinary study of the growth, organization and impact of online communications in the arena of activism. This study will enable understanding of how online communication content and network interacts with, and are embedded in, offline communications and networks to shape mobilization. The project will also generate new textual analysis tools for social scientists studying online communications. Additionally, the project provides training for graduate students who are directly involved in the research.</AbstractNarration>
