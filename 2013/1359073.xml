    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;A multiscale approach to biomechanical research will help students understand fundamental biological processes in health, injury and disease. The overall research goal of this REU program is to investigate the mechanical properties of structures ranging from subcellular components such as cytoskeleton structures to the quantification of tissues properties and whole body analysis. Students will participate in studies that utilize a variety of experimental and computational approaches to quantify and translate the mechanical properties of structures. The intended impact is to show students how biomechanics is a current multidisciplinary research theme which crosses many spatial scales: intracellular and extracellular matrices; and tissue, organ, and multi-organ systems. The educational component of this program is centered on the link between biology and mechanics in the sense that it discusses the tissue-inherent biological changes triggered by physical stimuli. Students will develop scientific skills, be exposed to new and exciting avenues of research, and have the opportunity to make informed decisions and gain presentation and writing experience. This program is sponsored by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers of the National Science Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Biomechanical engineering is defined as the application of mechanical engineering to biological systems such as the human body. A multiscale approach to biomechanical research will help students understand fundamental biological processes in health, injury and disease. Knowledge gained from biomechanical studies can be translated to help protect against, diagnosis and treating human injury and disease. The objectives of this program are to educate undergraduate students in biomechanical engineering and introduce them to cutting edge research areas in the subject. The young researchers will be fully integrated into the participating research groups and will experience hands-on lab research, group meetings, and close collaboration with the other members of the group and related research groups which builds confidence and independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate engineering students will be recruited from across the U.S and students from underrepresented groups will be highly sought. The intended impact is to show students how biomechanics is a current multidisciplinary research theme which crosses many spatial scales: ranging from examining processes inside cells to investigating effects on the human body as a whole. Students will be exposed to how multiscale biomechanical research can translate into novel devices for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human injury and disease.</AbstractNarration>
