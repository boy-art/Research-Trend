    <AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin-Madison is acquiring a modern Electron Microprobe (EMP) to replace a worn 21-year-old instrument. It is the only EMP in Wisconsin and is heavily used by many NSF-funded researchers. No other technique matches the versatility or accuracy for in situ chemical analysis of major to trace elements at the micron-scale. It is non-destructive, permitting chemical data to be correlated with other forms of analysis. A modern EMP will also have new capabilities including enhanced imaging and a more intense LaB6 source that will permit sub-micron analysis. The new capabilities and enhanced reliability of a modern EMP are required by over 116 currently funded federal (74 NSF) grants, valued at $18M in Geoscience (64 federal grants, 47 NSF), &gt;$30M in Materials Science (30 federal grants, 14 NSF) and $19M (22 federal grants, 13 NSF) in other departments (Chemistry, Physics, Limnology, Soils, Pharmacy). Projects supported by NSF-EAR include many studies of deep-crustal processes: petrogenesis of magmatic systems, causes of explosive volcanic eruptions, conditions of granulite and of eclogite facies metamorphism, the genesis of economic deposits of metals and fossil fuels, tectonics of major shear zones, Hadean zircons, and meteoritics. Studies of near surface processes include: astrobiology, paleoclimatology (biogenic carbonates and foraminifera, speleothems), diagenesis and basin evolution, cementation in shallow fault zones, and nano-minerals. In Materials Science, projects include synthesis of new materials and advanced processing methods for materials for new electronic, magnetic and optical devices, renewable energy materials/processes, and high temperature structures. The capabilities of the UW-Madison EMP complement and are essential to the operation of WiscSIMS, an NSF-supported National Facility at UW-Madison for in situ analysis of stable isotope geochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability of the EMP Lab at UW-Madison to build on its 47-year record of education, service and research in the public interest will be enhanced by acquisition of a modern electron microprobe. PI and Lab Director Dr. John Fournelle has for over 20 years contributed to advancing the science of electron microprobe analysis. The research that will be facilitated by a modern EMP will address many problems of societal concern, including: paleoclimate, development of natural resources (oil, gas, water, metals, strategic elements), volcanic hazards, environmental remediation, and development of new materials with desirable properties such as electronics, refractories, and ceramics. Research conducted on our current instrument has resulted in &gt; 650 publications. Learning to use the electron microprobe and to evaluate data is a key component to the educational development and maturing of students. Over the past 20 years, more than 200 graduate students in Geoscience and other STEM disciplines critical to our national economic competitiveness, including 66 women (49 in Geoscience) have used our EMP Lab for research. Geoscience faculty from smaller Wisconsin colleges bring their undergraduates to the Madison lab for their first experience running a microbeam analytical instrument.</AbstractNarration>
