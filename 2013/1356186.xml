    <AbstractNarration>Through this project Briar Cliff University is providing scholarship awards to entering freshmen majoring in Biology, Environmental Science, Chemistry, and Biochemistry with demonstrated high motivation, academic talent, and financial need. In partnership with Sioux City high schools and the Iowa Governor's STEM Advisory Council, Briar Cliff is recruiting its "STEM Pathways Scholars" primarily from the State of Iowa and the Tri-State Region including areas of Nebraska and South Dakota. By enabling increased access to high quality STEM education, the project is enlarging the pool of well-prepared undergraduate students who can help meet pressing regional, if not also national, workforce development needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical features of this project include the use of evidence-based practices and creative strategies in addressing Briar Cliff students' identified needs for greater peer support, academic engagement, and career development. Scholars benefit from a rigorous, supported program of study that includes: a first-year STEM Living Learning Community (LLC); an advising trio, comprised of a peer mentor, faculty mentor, and retention specialist; peer-led academic coaching in gateway courses; inquiry-based research embedded in first- and second-year labs; service-learning experiences in environmental preservation and prairie restoration; field experiences; a careers in STEM speaker series, networking events, professional mentors, and optional internships; and attendance and presentation at regional science meetings. The evaluation of the project utilizes a mixed methods approach and matched comparison cohorts to examine the effectiveness of "STEM Pathways Scholars" strategies, including the project's particular emphasis on experiential learning. Findings are being disseminated among Briar Cliff's partners in STEM and higher education institutions throughout Iowa and the Midwest through shared impact reports, presentations at regional science meetings, and publications.</AbstractNarration>
