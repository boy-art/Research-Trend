    <AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses NSF?s call for universities to nurture students and/or faculty who are engaged in projects having the potential to be transitioned into the marketplace. I-Corps Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Akron (UA) is developing a new I-Corps Site, entitled the UA Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurial Preparation Grant (UA TIE Prep Grant), that will build upon their existing expertise, while filling a gap that is critical in the commercialization and translation of university-based research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the UA TIE Prep Grant will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. stimulate the translation of fundamental university-based research into commercially viable technologies prepared to progress into the National Science Foundation?s I-Corps Teams program, SBIR, or other avenues toward commercialization;&lt;br/&gt;2. encourage faculty, students, and community-based industry personnel to collaborate around early stage university technologies, and;&lt;br/&gt;3. enhance the entrepreneurship potential of faculty, students, and community-based industry partners through hands-on training and experiential learning in innovation and entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UA TIE Prep Grant Program has the potential to greatly improve commercialization outcomes for UA technologies which will influence the regional economy and serve as a national model for entrepreneurship.</AbstractNarration>
