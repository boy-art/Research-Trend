    <AbstractNarration>Hypersaline environments are conditions where salt concentrations are five to ten times higher than seawater, such as those found in the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Only certain interesting microscopic organisms, from all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya), and their viruses can live under this extreme condition. These organisms are known as halophiles. The conference, which is multidisciplinary, international, and focused on microbes, has been holding triennial meetings since 1978. Its mission is to explore all aspects of biology in salt-enriched environments and to draw on expertise from numerous disciplines in order to catalyze advances in understanding life in hypersaline habitats. The objective of this award is to provide support for young US researchers, especial graduate students and postdoctoral scientists, to attend and participate in this unique international scientific gathering. A special effort will be made to recruit members of underrepresented groups in science.</AbstractNarration>
