    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Tea Visnjic of University of California at Berkeley to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Tongji University in Shanghai, China. The project title is "Earthquake Response of Tall Buildings Equipped with Seismic Damper Devices." The host scientists are Prof. Xilin Lu and Prof. Ying Zhou.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to assess the dynamic response of tall reinforced concrete frame-type buildings equipped with seismic dampers. Damper devices help mitigate earthquake-induced movement of buildings, which can potentially lead to smaller damage. Tall reinforced concrete frames are particularly vulnerable to high post-earthquake reparation costs and prolonged disruption of occupancy due to repairs. The use of damper devices in these buildings may be able to significantly improve seismic performance, but such applications have been limited partly due to limited understanding of the effects of supplemental damping in seismic applications to tall concrete frames. Because tall reinforced concrete frame buildings are commonly constructed in both China and the seismically active parts of the United States, an improved understanding of supplemental damping effects on seismic behavior of such systems is beneficial to design practices in both countries. The planned study quantifies the effects of damper application on structural response of these buildings and identifies damper systems that most effectively achieve improvements in earthquake performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the proposed collaboration between researchers from the two universities with established records of intellectual contribution to seismic hazard reduction is motivated by the value in exchanging diverse ideas, complementing research and invaluable experience from past earthquakes. The study opens the door for future partnerships between the two institutions and contributes to global advancement in efforts to protect human life and economic well-being from natural disasters.</AbstractNarration>
