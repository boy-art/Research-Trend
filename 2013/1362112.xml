    <AbstractNarration>Michigan State University (MSU) proposes to join the existing Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) as a university site. This addition will expand the research portfolio of CITeR as well as bring new affiliates whose partnership will be instrumental in furthering the frontiers of identification technology. This extended collaboration framework will broaden CITeRs leadership role in transitioning biometric research into practice while influencing socio-legal policies emerging from the use of this technology. Biometrics is the science of automatically recognizing individuals based on their physical, behavioral and physiological attributes such as fingerprints, iris, voice, and gait. As a discipline, biometrics relies on several fields including engineering, statistics, mathematics, biology, physics, jurisprudence, and computational sociology. As a technology, biometrics has applications in cyber-security, law enforcement, surveillance, forensics, multimedia, mobile devices, and healthcare. While the field has significantly matured over the past two decades, several fundamental problems are yet to be addressed. A concerted research, education, and industry-engagement model is needed to effectively leverage and deploy biometric solutions for the benefit of society at large. MSU I/UCRC site proposes to include faculty and affiliates in the areas of cyber security, mobile computing, genomics and big data. The goal of the planning meeting will be to formulate a research roadmap for engaging the research expertise of MSU faculty in furthering the societal and technological impact of CITeR while simultaneously addressing the needs of the affiliates. MSUs expertise in DNA processing, forensic analysis, cloud computing, deep learning and data mining will be used to design next generation identification systems focusing on rapid DNA identification, forensic data analysis, cloud-based biometrics, genomics, and large-scale biometric analytics. Data security and privacy will be an integral component of this research agenda and will benefit affiliates in the field of identity management, healthcare, access control, personalization, forensics, computer security, national security, and genomic analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active involvement of graduate and undergraduate researchers will ensure the development of a strong biometric workforce consisting of future leaders, visionaries, researchers, professionals, and technicians. Collaboration with experts from other fields such as forensics, bioinformatics, health science and cybersecurity will expand the domain-of-influence of biometrics whilst creating novel opportunities for inter-disciplinary research and education. The site directors will connect with existing programs in MSU such as ADAPP (Advancing Diversity through the Alignment of Policies and Practices) and MSU WIC (Women in Computing) in order to promote the involvement of underrepresented groups in STEM research and education. The research conducted in CITeR will be showcased to middle school and high school students through community activities such as MSU Science, Engineering and Technology Day; MSU College of Engineering Design Day; and MSU CSE Research Open House.</AbstractNarration>
