    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project is to create a general methodology for developing and using parametric human finite element models that can represent a wide range of attributes of people that are important to automobile safety, such as size, shape, age, and tissue characteristics. When designing cars for safety, these models can be used for population-based simulations to predict reductions in injuries. We are linking a statistical human body geometry model based on medical image, body scan, and sitting posture data with a baseline human finite element model through an automated mesh morphing algorithm. The resulted parametric human models are being validated against cadaver tests and used in a feasibility study to optimize a restraint system for a selected General Motors vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this work will address the specific challenges posed by the changing demographics observed in the US population, such as the increased prevalence of obese and older people, and also will lead to development of tools and methods that are useful for many other engineering designs interacting with humans, such as medical devices, aircraft, blast protection system, sports gear, and heavy-duty equipment. The concept of developing injury assessment tools for population-based simulations will lead to safety designs that provide better protection for millions of individuals who are elderly, obese or in other special conditions, which will provide extremely high societal benefits. The project will also include a wide range of educational and outreach activities, including hiring undergraduate students through UM's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, create summer intern positions at UM for undergraduate students and intern positions at GM for PhD students. The project activities entail collaborative research between the university and General Motors, which will significantly broaden the scientific and technical knowledge of all the students involved.</AbstractNarration>
