    <AbstractNarration>Through the Elm STEMs project, the College of Our Lady of the Elms (Elms College) is expanding enrollment in its biology, chemistry, mathematics or computer information technology programs through new career-building, experiential opportunities in STEM. The goal of this S-STEM project is to support qualified students with financial need, provide them with the tools for success, and connect them with the regional technology industry in New England. The project is awarding scholarships to a total of 21 S-STEM scholar students (10 first-year and 11 transfer students). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to: 1) increase enrollment of first-year and transfer students in STEM, 2) increase retention of these scholars and support them through graduation, 3) provide opportunities for experiential learning (research or internships), and 4) increase the number of scholars continuing to graduate studies or finding employment in their field. This project builds upon a strong existing student-support infrastructure as well as implements programs newly created for the Elm STEMS program to provide evidence-based support for the S-STEM scholars: a special section of the First Year Seminar taught by STEM faculty provides cohort building and peer mentoring for S-STEM scholars; a new Scientific and Technical Communications course for juniors and transfer students develops critical skills and bring transfer students into the cohort; and the STEM Career Series and the STEM on the Road field trip program provides opportunities for career exploration. To ensure academic success, Elms is implementing student supports that include scheduled tutoring and enhanced proactive faculty advisement. A cohort experience is promoted based on common participation in a first year seminar, a junior year workshop, and a STEM-based service learning project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elms College's recruitment strategy targets high-achieving students from local high schools and community colleges, many of which have large underrepresented minority and first-generation populations. To increase awareness in high school students and community college students of the wide range of STEM career opportunities in the region, Elms is implementing outreach and career education, including recruitment events that include theme-based engaging hands-on activities (such as forensics, lab-based biotechnology, and field-based environmental assessment) and networking opportunities with local industry. Additional partnerships with local high school teachers and community college faculty and counselors are being developed to support these outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
