    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this research is to improve our understanding of how current warning systems work and provide an opportunity to make improvements. Many weather events affect the United States each year and some of them lead to loss of life, injuries, and damaged property. These problems call for better warning systems. Such warnings systems are difficult to create since so many different people, processes, and resources are involved in detecting, predicting, and communicating the risks. Understanding how these warning systems work is important if we want to know how to make them better. This research will look at the differences between warning systems in different regions of the US. The study will include in-depth qualitative interviews with warning system members in three different areas. The interviews will address tasks and activities associated with the warning system, communication within and between organizations involved, roles and responsibilities, and the use of resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will not only improve our understanding of how the current warning systems work, but it will present an opportunity to explore the storm spotter network and their modern role in the warning system. In addition, it will provide the basic information we need in order to improve warning organizations and improve severe weather communications.</AbstractNarration>
