    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project entitled ?High Efficiency Robocasting for Ceramic Product Application? is intended to improve a unique additive manufacturing process called robocasting for the large-scale production of next-generation ceramic catalyst supports useful to automotive and clean-energy-generation industries. In particular, large advanced ceramic catalyst supports could be an enabling technology for the efficient conversion of natural gas into clean fuels. Currently, robocasting can be used to fabricate advanced catalyst supports with intricate geometries however; the technology has been limited to relatively small components because of problems associated with cracking after fabrication. This project will combine advanced ceramic processing methods with microwave-assisted drying and sintering technology to competitively manufacture industrial-sized ceramic catalyst supports with improved performance. Research will be completed to reduce limitations due to cracking, reduce energy consumption, and improve automation with the result being a new market for an advanced technology that will be cost competitive throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project has implications for:&lt;br/&gt;1) the scientific understanding of optimized catalyst supports for clean-energy applications to help meet demands for tighter environmental controls on automotive and plant emissions;&lt;br/&gt;2) the utilization of microwave technology for energy savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in industrial manufacturing;&lt;br/&gt;3) the creation of manufacturing and STEM-related jobs on US soil; and&lt;br/&gt;4) the advancement of additive manufacturing technology to keep the US a step ahead of foreign competition.</AbstractNarration>
