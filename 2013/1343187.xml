    <AbstractNarration>CBET-134187&lt;br/&gt;PI: Faghri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Li-air batteries are promising alternatives to current Li-ion batteries due to the high specific energy of lithium metal (12 kWh kg-1) and the infinite oxygen for the cathode available from the ambient. However, even if the specific energy achieved in practice is much lower than the theoretical value (less than 10% of its theoretical value), the specific energy of Li-air batteries achieved in laboratory studies is at least 2-5 times higher than that of Li-ion batteries. Thus, developing the science and the technology to achieve values closer to the maximum achievable is an important objective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The low values achieved for the specific energy of a Li-air battery is partly related to the low mass transfer coefficient of the porous cathode electrode. In the proposed effort, an innovative and active Li-air battery is proposed that has a much higher specific energy and power. The innovation lies in the development of an inter-digitated micro channel system adjacent to the cathode through which electrolyte and oxygen mixture is circulated. The hypothesis is that the specific energy and power of Li-air batteries is enhanced because the convection of electrolyte in the porous electrode can increase the mass flux of oxygen and lithium ion in the electrode. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, an improved thermal management system with the circulation of electrolyte, within and outside the battery electrode is proposed enabling the battery system to operate under extreme environmental conditions &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The newly proposed battery is expected to have a specific energy as high as 600 Wh kg-1, and a specific power as high as 25 W kg-1. &lt;br/&gt;Thus, the project will lead to Li-air batteries with enhanced specific energy and power. The application domains include automotive, energy-storage, aerospace and others.</AbstractNarration>
