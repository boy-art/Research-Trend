    <AbstractNarration>Oklahoma State University (OSU) proposes to support twelve (12) LSAMP scholars, who have completed baccalaureate STEM degrees, as they pursue and complete Ph.D. programs in STEM disciplines. Following two years of initial funding by the NSF LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program, OSU will ensure Fellows continue to receive sufficient financial and academic support to complete terminal degrees within five years. OSU will provide extensive academic support specific to this group. This proposal accords with NSF?s goal to increase the number of LSAMP students successfully completing terminal degrees in STEM fields and gives particular attention to the recruitment and support of underrepresented groups. The State of Oklahoma has one of the largest Native American populations in the U.S. and is home to 39 federally recognized tribal nation headquarters. Additionally, the Hispanic population in Oklahoma is rapidly increasing. OSU not only has the largest Native American student enrollment in the United States, but also serves a wide of range of traditional underrepresented student populations. Alliance institutions rank in the top ten for degrees awarded to Native American students. The long term goal of this Bridge to the Doctorate program is to increase the number of underrepresented students who successfully complete doctoral degrees in STEM fields. STEM options at OSU include doctoral granting degrees in Agricultural Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Environmental Sciences, Life Sciences, Mathematics and related fields, and Physics/Astronomical Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The program objectives are to recruit 12 LSAMP scholars in a range of STEM fields; to support students academically and professionally, ensuring they build the connections and skills needed to excel; and to ensure financial support for the fellows in all years of their doctoral programs. Program activities in support of these objectives include, but are not limited to: (1) Mentoring and networking programs across STEM departments; (2) Links to other NSF-funded programs (i.e., Graduate Research Fellowship Program); (3) Student development workshops and counseling; and (4) Enhanced recruitment strategies, newsletters, and community outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impacts will address the underrepresentation of minorities and women at the graduate level in STEM fields. OSU expects to increase recruitment and retention of the Fellows in faculty positions as well as in government, business, and other STEM career areas. By addressing the specific needs of unique populations, this program will provide an important national model for wider applications in promoting the success of Native Americans ? one of the least represented groups in professional STEM careers today, as well as providing copious support for African Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, veterans, and first generation students. The BD program will continue to build on established relationships with educators, administrators, tribal members, and other minority leaders. This program has the potential to exert a transformative impact by diversifying the scientific workforce of the United States and by ensuring that the widest possible range of underrepresented students assumes positions of leadership in STEM fields across the United States. OSU has already shown accomplishment in these areas. Ninety-two percent of current and past Fellows are on track or have completed at least one graduate degree in the STEM disciplines and are moving forward.</AbstractNarration>
