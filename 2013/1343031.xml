    <AbstractNarration>This effort seeks to develop a better understanding of how the high-to-mid latitude ionosphere is coupled to both the underlying middle atmosphere and to solar and geomagnetic drivers. Goals of the project are: (1) To specify solar, magnetospheric, and geomagnetic drivers during a recent period of low to moderate solar activity and to investigate how the wintertime high and mid-latitude ionosphere responds to these drivers; (2) To specify spatio-temporal variations in middle atmospheric drivers, including polar vortex disturbances and planetary waves throughout the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere over the life cycle of sudden stratospheric warmings; (3) To investigate how the combination of forcing from above (goal 1) and forcing from below (goal 2) controls the high to mid-latitude ionosphere during the periods of sudden stratospheric warmings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main objective of the project is to understand the impact of lower atmospheric forcing on the high and mid-latitude ionosphere under conditions when wave fluxes from the lower atmosphere are at the maximum, and solar and magnetospheric fluxes are at the minimum. High-amplitude stratospheric planetary waves that lead to minor and major stratospheric warmings will be investigated, and their impact on the middle and high-latitude ionosphere examined. The focus on large dynamical events with strong vertical coupling holds a promise of discovering new sources and mechanisms of quiet-time ionospheric variability. These goals will be achieved through collaborative analysis of NASA MERRA reanalysis data, MLS and TIMED SABER satellite data, incoherent scatter radars data, and WACCM-X/TIMEGCM modeling efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will foster a partnership between MIT and the University of Colorado, and also between disciplines. Undergraduate students will participate in the research at both institutions. The MIT Haystack Observatory REU program aims to attract minority students through integration with the Puerto Rican university system.</AbstractNarration>
