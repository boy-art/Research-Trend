    <AbstractNarration>This project funds an October 8, 2013 joint workshop between the Open Networking Foundation (ONF), GENI, and US Ignite communities. The goal of the workshop is to jointly explore the interaction of emerging uses of Software Defined Networking (SDN) in the US Ignite and GENI communities and SDN standardization roadmaps and feature sets. As a result, SDN is likely to become a more powerful tool for GENI network research experimentation, US Ignite pre-commercial applications, and commercial uses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication between the communities will facilitate development of SDN standards and applications. Additionally, this project supports the involvement of 20 students in the workshop. US Ignite will seek two types of student participants: 1) students who are familiar with OpenFlow and working in Computer Science systems and networking and GENI or US Ignite projects; and 2) students who have been participating in US Ignite, Mozilla-Ignite, and GENI projects and can share information on application patterns of SDN use. Output of the workshop will be shared with the larger community via a workshop report posted to the US Ignite web site as well as other web pages, wikis and communication mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>
