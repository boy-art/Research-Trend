    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop a robust fabrication process for manufacturing micro-structures that will be used to measure the thermoelectric properties of polysilicon nanowires and subsequently to generate guidelines for optimizing the thermoelectric figure of merit in polysilicon nanowires. The effect of size, deposition parameters, and doping type/concentration on the figure of merit will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is in filling the existing knowledge gap about thermoelectric properties of polysilicon nanowires. Such nanowires have an immediate application in developing high-performance IR sensors. Despite earlier reports on enhanced thermoelectric properties of silicon nanowires, there has been no report of practical thermoelectric devices that function based on such superior properties. This is mainly due to the complex process of growth and transfer of silicon nanowires, which hinders the batch-fabrication of such devices. The results of this research can potentially transform this status since polysilicon nanowires can be fabricated through conventional microfabrication processes and nanoscale lithography. This creates a unique opportunity for production of novel thermoelectric devices that take advantage of enhanced properties of nanowires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is envisioned in enabling low-cost and high-performance IR detectors with widespread usage in military, civilian, and medical diagnostic applications, where cost effective solutions with adequate performance do not exist. The funds received for the proposed research activities will also allow the PI to recruit and train local talents with priority given to underrepresented minorities and also will produce material for graduate level courses on micro/nano-systems.</AbstractNarration>
