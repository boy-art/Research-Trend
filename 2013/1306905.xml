    <AbstractNarration>The present grant is devoted to the study of interactions among a few atoms and possible ways one can achieve quantum control in the regime of ultracold temperatures relevant for quantum gases. Few-atom systems pose some of the greatest challenges facing theorists in atomic physics because of the extremely nonperturbative nature of the interactions. The goal of the proposal is to develop the theoretical tools and explore the basic capabilities and implications of new types of resonances. The investigation will center on controlling the complex multichannel collision dynamics with electromagnetic or static external fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A specific aim of the present project is to explore the viability of using a laser field to change the interactions among three or four atoms. The work could potentially have unprecedented impact with far-reaching scientific and technological ramifications. The ability to change atomic behaviors and interactions will have key impact in the quantum control of chemical reaction dynamics. A deep understanding of the ultracold atom interactions will find applications in atomic clocks, quantum information science and for the exploration of many novel phases of matter. The work has an important educational impact as it provides training to graduate and undergraduate students in forefront computational and theoretical research techniques.</AbstractNarration>
