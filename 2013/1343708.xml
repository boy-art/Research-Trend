    <AbstractNarration>This NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Multifunctional Nanostructures for Integrated Electrical, Chemical, Mechanical and Geological Applications: A Multidisciplinary Laboratory Education Program", at Mississippi State University (MSU), under the direction of Dr. Priscilla Hill, will be a collaborative effort between the Colleges of Engineering and Arts &amp; Sciences. This exciting new educational approach builds upon the research collaborations of faculty in nanoparticle synthesis/characterization, nanowire fabrication/device development, nano-electromagnetics, geo-nanomaterials, and nanomechanics; and builds on a recently developed nanotechnology certificate program. This recently developed certificate program consists of lecture classes with little simulation or laboratory experience. The proposed laboratory education program will address these deficiencies by (a) developing a new laboratory course to accompany a recently developed nanotechnology-intensive lecture course, (b) developing simulation modules for four courses including two core courses and two nanotechnology-intensive courses, and (c) developing laboratory modules for six courses including two nanotechnology-intensive courses. The proposed program has strong support across two colleges and five departments and would be easily accessible for any MSU student enrolled in science or engineering (~5000 students). Professional audio/video documentation of the nanotechnology modules will help to recruit students into the program while fostering outreach through existing university mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will be excited about nanotechnology via professional audio/video materials, course content, laboratory experiments and projects and simulation projects. Outreach to K-12 students will be performed through the NanoClub. There will be active recruitment of students from underrepresented groups for this program. In addition, significant impact is anticipated with university/industry collaborations including technology commercialization and development of spin-off businesses. By equipping students with stronger interdisciplinary background in nanotechnology, this NUE will further promote MSU technology commercialization, helping to create new local employment opportunities and opportunities for student co-op/training.</AbstractNarration>
