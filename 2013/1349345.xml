    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Florida to curate, digitize, and consolidate specimens and data housed at the McGuire Center of Lepidoptera and Biodiversity at the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH). The McGuire Center houses one of the world's largest collections of butterflies and moths, including numerous scientifically important specimens. Although professional collectors developed much of the collection, many specimens came from amateur scientists and have not been properly curated or integrated into the collection. The results of this project will increase the accessibility of specimen data, making them available via the Internet to be utilized by a wide audience of scientists, educators and students. Undertaking and completing this project represents an important first step in reorganizing specimens and digitizing much of the data representing Florida's native butterflies and related organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several outreach and educational activities using the collection's charismatic holdings will be developed and will include minorities and groups underrepresented in STEM programs. Existing programs at the FLMNH, such as the Summer Junior Volunteer Program, will be leveraged and will include programs for enthusiast groups, elementary school groups, and high school students. Additionally, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will be trained in research and curatorial techniques using collections digitized in this project.
