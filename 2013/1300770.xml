    <AbstractNarration>M. Scott Shell of the University of California Santa Barbara is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop broad-based multiscale algorithms for systematic coarse-graining. The project is cofunded by the Interfacial Processes and Thermodynamics program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET). Major advances in theoretical ideas and numerical techniques are essential to enabling quantitative modeling of many large length and time scale problems. This work leverages a new theoretical concept called the relative entropy that quantifies the information lost during coarse-graining and that provides a general statistical mechanical approach to multiscale problems. This PI is using this framework to create robust algorithms that offer new coarse-graining paradigms, including the ability to address high-complexity many-parameter models, multi-body interactions, transferability, and design of CG architectures. These algorithms are being implemented into a freely-available, community-developed coarse-graining package. Dr. Shell is also using this new generation of techniques to model and understand the early structures, thermodynamics, and molecular mechanisms governing the self-assembly of the diphenylalanine peptide into hollow nanotubes. The project is being closely integrated with several educational activities targeting a range of students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic-resolution simulations of biological molecules, materials, and many other systems offer major insights into their behavior and useful predictions of their properties. However, such approaches are severely limited by computational expense to the smallest and simplest of systems. To extend modeling to more complicated cases, it has long been customary to pursue coarse-grained models that remove a fraction of atomic detail while greatly reducing the computational demands. This strategy can be successful if one can identify, historically by trial-and-error or rational insight, the "right" way to coarse-grain. Dr. Shell has introduced a new approach that automates this process in a physically insightful way, by quantifying and minimizing the information loss due to coarse-graining. His group is developing powerful new and general algorithms that produce optimized and accurate coarse-grained models, enabling a new level of sophistication in simulating complex systems. In particular, he is using these approaches to understand a recently discovered designer peptide that self-assembles into hollow nanotubes with a fast-growing list of applications in nanomaterials and energy.</AbstractNarration>
