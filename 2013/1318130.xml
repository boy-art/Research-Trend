    <AbstractNarration>The the 2013 installment of the biennial conference series Topology, Algebras, and Categories in Logic (TACL 2013) will take place at Vanderbilt University from July 28th to August 1st, 2013. The conference will be held in conjunction with the 28th annual Shanks Lecture Series. The 2013 Shanks Lecturer will be the Fields Medalist Vladimir Voevodsky (Institute for Advanced Studies), who will deliver two lectures on his work on univalent foundations of mathematics. The conference proper will be preceded by a four-day summer school. The scientific program of the combined events will include -- in addition to the Shanks Lectures -- invited lectures, training tutorials and contributed talks (standard and featured/selected).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is of interdisciplinary nature and brings together a number of areas contributing to the study of logic, via semantic and syntactic methods. TACL allows for interaction between methodologies from different areas of mathematics (including Topology, Algebra and Category Theory) and the formation of hybrid approaches (for example, Algebraic Proof Theory). At the same time, via the study of classical&lt;br/&gt;and non-classical logics, the conference allows the investigation of the applicability of logic to diverse disciplines ranging from classical algebra, to constructive mathematics and analysis, topology, geometry, theoretical computer science, mathematical linguistics and philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combined event will be publicized widely. Due to the high quality of the planed scientific program, upwards of 120 mathematicians, logicians and computer scientists are expected to participate. This proposal supports attendance by principal speakers and other participants, particularly targeting those without other sources of support, early career researchers, women, disabled persons and minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about the combined events can be found at the conference website:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~tacl2013/</AbstractNarration>
