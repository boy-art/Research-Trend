    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Montana (UM), led by Professors Aaron M. Thomas and Earle R. Adams. The Department of Chemistry at the University of Montana is the center of a summer REU program, which is built around environmental chemistry with a primary objective of recruiting Native American students in the physical sciences and providing them with a relevant research experience. From prior REU programs at the UM campus, it is known that environmental issues often create interest among science students. This program is designed to include a writing experience, an industrial overview of a green industry, and personalized, well-focused research experiences that will broaden their depth of understanding in a STEM field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following components are in place for the success of this program: 1.) a director for Indigenous Research and STEM Education (IRSE), who provides a leadership role to build relationships and recruit Native American students in the STEM fields; 2.) focused research projects under the broader theme of environmental chemistry which is a specialty of UM chemistry faculty and of high interest among students at the tribal colleges in Montana and Idaho; and 3.) in collaboration with the Journalism Department and a present NSF program on campus, a Science Communicator will train students in writing techniques and media platforms that effectively reach Native audiences.</AbstractNarration>
