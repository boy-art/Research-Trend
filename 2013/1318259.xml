    <AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project from Colorado State University will develop a state-of-the-art system integrating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions modeling, energy modeling, and life cycle assessment (LCA) for the built environment. This new Carbon Footprint Metric (CFM) system will mesh seamlessly with existing design and construction management tools that are widely used by architects, engineers and builders. The system will provide dynamic, real-time, 'on the-fly' carbon footprint measurements, all the way from the building concept stage through to construction and building completion and operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research begin with the opportunity to help reduce the environmental footprint of buildings and the built environment, which currently produce about 50% of total U.S. GHG emissions. A key element to changing behavior on the part of both building professionals and consumers are better environmental impact measurements. The availability of easily used yet rigorous and standardized tools for quantifying GHG metrics can dramatically change architectural and construction best practices. Once validated for each class of building, the CFM system will permit architects and construction practitioners to evaluate and alter building design in order to reduce energy use and GHG emissions over the life cycle of the building. Moreover, constructors can better evaluate construction methods and materials and building managers can exploit improved efficiencies to reduce GHGs. This will help the competitiveness and performance of the many small businesses that are among the pioneers in the "green" building industry. The system could further serve as a platform for urban planners and environmental managers to evaluate and plan improvements in a given built environment which encompasses many buildings and building types. The research and product development also have the potential to help transform the education and training of the next generation of architects, engineers, and product designers, who will be called upon to help build a more sustainable urban environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are Colorado State University, with participants from four Colleges (Agricultural Sciences, Health and Human Sciences, Engineering, and Natural Sciences), along with three small business partners: 1) Living Homes (Santa Monica, CA) that has as its mission the design and creation of homes and communities which set a standard for the positive impact on soil, water, energy and health; 2) The Neenan Company (Fort Collins, CO) that has as its mission the design and building of highly sustainable commercial buildings, schools, and hospitals; and 3) Nemetschek Vectorworks (Columbia, MD) that has as its mission the production of versatile, intuitive, and affordable Building Information Modeling (BIM) software for professional design solutions to the architecture, engineering, and construction industries. Other partner: The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is a non-business partner that has as its mission research and development of alternative clean energy technology. Supporting institutions, which are leaders in advancing a more sustainable built environment, include the following: the American Institute of Architects, the U.S. Green Building Council, the National Institute for Building Science, Architecture 2030, and the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI).</AbstractNarration>
