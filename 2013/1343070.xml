    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: An NSF Workshop on novel photonic-magnetic devices is to be organized. It will be held in Nara, Japan during September 20-23, 2013. The Workshop will bring together leading American and Japanese scientists and engineers who are at the frontiers of photonic-magnetic device research and development. Leading experts from the US and Japan will present the state of the art in the field of doped magnetic semiconductors and their application in photonics and spintronics. The specific goal of the Workshop is to identify critical open questions facing these fields and on establishing international collaborations to jointly work on their solutions. Workshop topics include: dilute magnetic semiconductors; rare earth and transition metal doping of semiconductors; theoretical modeling of ion incorporation and RT-ferromagnetism; characterization of magneto-optical properties; and potential photonic-magnetic device demonstration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This workshop will provide a forum for leading experts from the US and Japan to present recent breakthroughs concerning doped magnetic semiconductors and potential applications in photonics and spintronics. The cross-pollination of scientific ideas will impact science and society in both the US and the Japan. Junior researchers and doctoral students from the US will receive travel support to present their research areas. This meeting will enhance graduate student education and career development of young scientists by facilitating interactions with international experts from diverse areas of materials science, electric engineering, optical science, and solid state physics. A summary report will be made available via the Workshop website to the research community and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is designated as a Global Venture Fund Award and is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
