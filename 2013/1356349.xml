    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Materials Research Society (MRS) provides partial funding for the 2013 Fall MRS Meeting Symposium titled "Integration of Biomaterials with Organic Electronics." This Symposium will be an integrated forum for a discussion of the most recent advances in Biomaterials, Electronic Materials and their engineering applications, and aims to integrate all three areas through interactions. In addition, this symposium will consist of oral and poster presentations with a focus on synergistic integration of biomaterials and organic materials with neural engineering and cellular phenomena to address unmet needs. The invited speakers are widely recognized as leaders in their fields and will deliver focused lectures with broad scientific appeal. Special attention will be devoted to the development of a diverse program including the participation of under-represented groups, international participation, and broad interdisciplinarity. The partial funding of this Symposium by this award will support the participation of undergraduate and graduate students at this MRS meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific broader impact of this symposium will be to inform investigators at all levels about the unmet needs and emerging opportunities in the areas of research at the interface between non-conventional electronics and biomedical applications. The symposium provides a forum in which materials researchers including students working in the areas of biomaterials and organic electronic materials will report on recent advances in the field. The funds requested from NSF will support the attendance of both undergraduate and graduate students, who will make oral and poster presentations at the Symposium, and will be interacting with leaders in their fields during the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
