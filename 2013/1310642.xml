    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Implantable medical devices touch virtually every major function in the human body. Cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, neural recording and stimulation devices, cochlear and retinal implants, etc. Wireless telemetry for these devices is necessary to monitor battery level and device health, upload reprogramming for device function, and download data for patient monitoring. Antennas are inevitably one of the largest if not the largest component of the telemetry communication system and are generally mounted on or in the implanted battery pack, usually in a body cavity. This limited real estate significantly constrains the performance of implantable antennas and results in substantial power loss in the body. Lost power means lost transmit distance and lost battery life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will fundamentally change the design of implantable antennas by tattooing (nearly invisible) conductive nanoparticles in the skin and adjacent fat layer at the body surface, coupling passively to the implant. The antenna will be able to use as much surface area as needed, and dramatically reduce the transmission lost in the body tissues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fundamental, transformative shift in antenna design for implantable medical devices, enabling the next generation of tiny wireless sensors and devices in the body. This work will evaluate the fundamental options and tradeoffs in implantable antenna design including losses in the antenna (resistive losses), coupled feed system (near field body losses), and antenna radiator (body losses). Both SAR and MedRadio regulations will be taken into account. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the direct benefits to improved medical care, this project includes a substantial educational outreach/dissemination component for undergrad/K12 retention and recruitment and general public interest. In addition to traditional scientific dissemination, video tutorials, lab tours, interviews with the research team, etc. will be produced and disseminated broadly following methods currently in use by the PI. Engaging public outreach will leverage this compelling bio-themed NSF research project (having likely appeal to a diverse audience) for use as a recruitment and retention tool in undergraduate programs and high school science/math programs, or just for general interest. This will help students see that their math/science/engineering programs can be used for fascinating science that can make a difference in the world, and will help show the fun and excitement of research and invention.</AbstractNarration>
