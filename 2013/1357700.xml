    <AbstractNarration>The Conference on Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (CEME) holds a series of annual conferences on research issues in economic theory and statistical methods for the analysis of economic data. The purpose is to stimulate discussion and research in these areas, and to investigate the application of cutting edge mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to economic research questions. The conferences focus on six topics, three in statistical methods and three in economic theory. Each topic conference meets once each year. The conferences are broadly interdisciplinary, including researchers from mathematics, operations research, and computer science. They also facilitate communication between academic scholars and government economists, since the statistical methods covered are important for macroeconomic policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference topics include Bayesian Econometrics, Forecasting, Microeconometrics, Time Series Analysis, Decentralization, and Mathematical Economics/General Equilibrium. There is a special series of econometrics sessions aimed at young scholars. Conference locations include universities around the United States.</AbstractNarration>
