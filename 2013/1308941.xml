    <AbstractNarration>DNA replication is a process that occurs in all cells of all organisms to create new cells with the same DNA composition. DNA re-replication, however, creates numerous copies of the DNA within single cells instead of creating numerous new cells. This process occurs in many types of organisms but there is little knowledge of the potential ecological or evolutionary benefits of re-replicating DNA for the organism. This project will provide a whole-genome perspective of the effects of DNA re-replication on gene regulation and will relate those expression differences to plants under the stress of herbivory, ultimately determining if DNA re-replication provides beneficial gene regulatory effects to aid the plants? regrowth, survival, and enhanced seed production following damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genetic effects of DNA re-replication may be important for organisms in combating a wide range of environmental stresses, and this study will provide the genetic underpinning of the adaptive potential of DNA re-replication generally. Investigating under-researched mechanisms influencing plant regrowth following damage is particularly important with the increased production of repeatedly-harvested biofuel and resprouting crops. This project will provide opportunities for undergraduates to gain experience in cutting-edge gene expression techniques and serve as material for discussion in K-12 classrooms via Skype and online web forums.</AbstractNarration>
