    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Daniel M. Neumark of the University of California - Berkeley and his graduate student colleagues are investigating the dynamics of excess electrons with isolated anion clusters and in liquid jets. The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Neumark and his group is to develop a better understanding of the ways in which electrons interact with molecules in condensed phases. The results of this research will help develop a better understanding of the ways in which free electrons can attach to and react with DNA nucleobases, a first step in a biologically important radiochemical process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES) methods will be used to study the dynamics of excess electrons interacting with isolated molecules and in condensed phases. TRPES will be used to: (1) study the relaxation dynamics of electronically excited electrons in liquid jets of water and methanol; these experiments will help to link previous TRPES studies of cluster anions to previous transient absorption measurement of bulk solvated electrons; (2) study the dynamics of low-energy electron attachment to isolated uracil and thymine molecules as well as clusters of these molecules with water; and (3) investigate the interaction of electrons with nucleic acid constituents in a liquid jet. The ultimate aim of these experiments is to develop a better understanding of the ways in which low-energy electrons interact with solvent and react with nucleic acids. This work will help to illuminate some important biological radiochemistry. Students working with Prof. Neumark receive training in modern physical chemistry methods. Recent students have gone on to careers in high-tech industries, academia, and the U. S. Government.</AbstractNarration>
