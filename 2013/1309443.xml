    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for conference support for approximately 43 undergraduate students (out of a total of 133) attending the fall meeting of the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society, in Newport Beach, CA (October 24-27, 2012). It is the 15th annual Conference Experience for Undergraduates (CEU). The CEU is a natural venue for students who have had an undergraduate research experience to present the results of their work and interact with other students as well as faculty and senior researchers. CEU has been immensely successful in fostering this interaction, which helps students to have a broad introduction and exposure to research across nuclear physics, and to enable senior researchers to get to know some of the junior future leaders.</AbstractNarration>
