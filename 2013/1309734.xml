    <AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;An approach to implement novel quantum photonics devices is to exploit the three-dimensional quantum confinement of electron and holes in an epitaxial semiconductor quantum dot. Such artificial atoms confine spins, interact efficiently with light, and can be integrated with functional structures such as optical microcavities to dictate the electronic states and photonic density of states. In this project the combination of quantum confinement and heterostructure functionality will create an ultra-tunable nano-lab, useful for investigating single and multiple particle physics and spin-cavity quantum electrodynamics. In the last decade, remarkable progress in this domain has been made with quantum dots interacting with visible light. Nonetheless, microcavities working at telecom wavelengths exhibit much higher performances enabling the use of spin-driven light-matter interactions to build integrated quantum photonics devices. Through this award a graduate student will be supported and trained in advanced techniques of nanoscience and solid state physics. The expertise acquired by the student through this project will provide excellent training for either a career in academia or in an advanced technology sector of the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The realization of semiconductor devices that harness quantum mechanics for their core operation has provided the foundation for a number of extraordinary advances in physics and technology. Attempts to apply quantum optics, the quantum theory of light, to manmade ultrapure semiconductor crystals have recently attracted considerable attention. The main motivation is to exploit nanoscience and mature semiconductor technology to integrate optoelectronic devices exhibiting quantum-enhanced performance at telecom wavelengths. This award initiates research that will integrate quantum dots, designer artificial atoms, with nanophotonics structures such as microcavities on a single crystal. This project will lead to new insights into materials science, solid-state physics, and spin-driven light-matter interaction as well as explore optoelectronic devices leveraging the unique features of quantum mechanics. A graduate student will be supported through this award and trained in advanced techniques of nanoscience and condensed matter physics. The expertise acquired by the student through this project will provide excellent training for either a career in academia or in an advanced technology sector of the economy.</AbstractNarration>
