    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project represents a major advance in battery research, combining the use of large, comprehensive battery datasets with advanced data science techniques and cloud-based software architectures to bring an unprecedented level of analytical capability to the problem of modeling battery performance. Past efforts at developing&amp;#8232;battery performance models have relied upon manufacturers? performance data and limited single-discharge studies. This innovation applies contemporary data science techniques to the analysis of a&amp;#8232;large, normalized set of battery data including raw time-series data and aggregated per-cycle&amp;#8232;performance from many battery cycling tests, as well as "lab notebook" data including cell&amp;#8232;composition, dimensions, test methods, and observations. The result will be the first commercially-available tool for conducting comprehensive, multi-parameter empirical studies of battery performance.&amp;#8232;This unique, data-driven analytical capability will suggest new and promising research paths&amp;#8232;distilled from relationships hidden in the data, and will help to predict battery performance&amp;#8232;and lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is manifested in its potential to dramatically increase the pace of product innovation&amp;#8232;and improvement in the battery sector. Organizations developing new batteries and those integrating batteries into their products will perform more targeted and effective battery tests, and&amp;#8232;will gain deeper insights from the data more quickly. Furthermore, our predictive analytics&amp;#8232;module will become more effective as the total volume of battery performance data stored in&amp;#8232;the system increases, further accelerating the pace of development. As this innovation is&amp;#8232;applicable to the entire spectrum of battery chemistries and designs, its successful implementation and commercialization will result in improvements in performance and reliability of batteries&amp;#8232;and battery-powered devices across a wide range of applications; from smartphones and tablets, to medical devices, to electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage. Broad adoption of&amp;#8232;this software will accelerate the development and deployment of energy storage and alternative energy technologies, promoting economic growth, energy independence, and environmental benefits. Market research suggests a total addressable market of up to $600M per year for this battery&amp;#8232;data platform with advance predictive analytics.</AbstractNarration>
