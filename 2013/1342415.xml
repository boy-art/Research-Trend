    <AbstractNarration>Technical Description of the Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BRIGE project explores new approaches to sensor-based surveillance in application to the prevention of age-related falls. Due to aging, all adults experience varying degrees of functional decline. This results in increased risk of falling in their daily activities. Importantly, risks of specific falls change dynamically during human interaction with the environment. Sensor data have been used for detection of falls shortly before impact. Despite wide use of sensor-based surveillance for tracking targets, tracking risks or hazards with sensors is an open problem. This research will examine how measurements from multiple sensors can be used to dynamically track the risks of falls in aging adults. By combining methods from statistical estimation and optimization, a new class of data association models will be created to represent the correspondence of sensor measurements to the fall related hazards and false alarms. False alarms are safe conditions that resemble the situations with an exposure to falling. A simulation of age-related falls on younger adults will be used to quantify risks of falls in accordance with sensor data. Finally, the combined datasets will be used to test and validate the new models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Description of the Project's Significance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is to inform the development of the next-generation assistive mobility technology. Successful completion of this project will lead to developed and validated models to be used in smart, sensor-based devices that can help prevent costly and dangerous falls. This research has potential to prevent fall-related injuries, disability, and death in elderly and other vulnerable populations, thus extending the period of functional independence in older adults, reducing the need for caregivers, and alleviating the economic burden on society. Despite nationwide efforts to reduce falls, many elderly live in constant fear of falling in their home or public places. This BRIGE award provides funding to potentially enable new assistive mobility devices that will transform the way adults experience aging. This project overlaps with NSF strategic goal of innovating for society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities to Broaden the Participation of Underrepresented Groups in Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broadening participation activities integrated into this research project will build pathways to success in engineering careers for community college, undergraduate, and graduate students from historically underrepresented groups, including Hispanics, women, and first generation students. The PI will engage these students in experiential learning and research activities that will promote their interest in interdisciplinary engineering research, in particular in application to safe, patient-centered wellness and health. The students will be provided opportunities for structured professional development that will become a foundation for their long-term success. Specific plans are in place for enhancement of activities through the New Mexico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, the National Graduate Education for Minorities consortium, the Society of Women Engineers and other on-campus organizations. This project will help create a strong foundation for integration of effective diversity and broadening participation activities into research, education, and innovation endeavors throughout the PI's career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has been funded through the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering solicitation, which is part of the Broadening Participation in Engineering Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is also funded through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), which is part of the Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>
