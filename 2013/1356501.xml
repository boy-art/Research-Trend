    <AbstractNarration>This project at Bay Path College is having a significant impact on the size of the pool of qualified workers who are capable of pursuing careers in science in the Western New England Region. One of the goals of the project is to increase the retention and baccalaureate degree attainment of women, including minority and first-generation college students, who will graduate well-prepared to pursue careers or graduate programs in the life sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is providing scholarships to 40 students based on financial need and academic eligibility. Group tutoring offered through the grant augments tutoring already offered on campus. This project is providing opportunities for student research, mentoring, co-curricular activities, and STEM career exploration and development. The project is improving retention in the first two years, increasing participation in research, increasing degree attainment, and preparing graduates for work in the life sciences after graduation.</AbstractNarration>
