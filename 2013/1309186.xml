    <AbstractNarration>The 28th Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications will be hosted, July 23-26, 2013, at Nipissing University, North Bay, Ontario, Canada. The conference will have five parallel Special Sessions in Asymmetric Topology, Set-theoretic Topology, Geometric Topology, Continuum Theory and Dynamical systems, and New Trends in Topology. The special sessions proposed cover the classical scientific focus of the conference as well as established and emerging research interests of the various groups of topologists in North America. In addition to plenary talks connected to these research areas, and usually to more than one area, there will be two workshops: (1) Coarse Topology, with an emphasis on connections to geometric group theory, dimension theory, and geometric topology, and (2) Homogeneous Compact Spaces, one of the most important classes of spaces, for instance, containing the class of compact topological groups. Each workshop will consist of a series of lectures intended to enable participants to begin research in these areas. Although the workshops will be tied to General Topology and Geometric Topology, each will focus on new theory and techniques, will have broad appeal to attendees in other sessions, and will feature connections to areas both inside and outside topology. The conference proceedings will be published in the fully refereed journal Topology Proceedings (http://topology.auburn.edu/tp/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two major conference series on Topology in North America: the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference and the Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications. The summer conference brings together mathematicians who have research interests in general topology, set-theoretic topology, topological algebras, topological groups, functional analysis, geometric topology, topological dynamics, and continuum theory as well as applied areas such as computer science and computational topology/geometry, and other areas where topology has applications and connections. The scheduled workshops, one on Coarse Topology and the other on Homogeneous Compact Spaces, will acquaint younger researchers, including recent PhDs and graduate students, with active research areas in topology and its applications. Major speakers with international reputations have been selected who are active in these research areas and others. Students and junior researchers, whose focus has necessarily often been narrow, will be exposed to research techniques and results that draw from multiple sources. NSF support will enable at least 12 US-based students and junior researchers to attend the conference and expand their research horizons. &lt;br/&gt;http://topology.nipissingu.ca/summertop2013/&lt;br/&gt;http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/13-14/topology/index.html</AbstractNarration>
