    <AbstractNarration>The 2013 Archaea: Ecology, Metabolism, and Molecular Biology Gordon Research Conference (GRC) will be held on July 28-August 2, 2013 in Lucca (Barga), Italy. Archaea, one of three major evolutionary lineages of life, are a diverse and fascinating group of microbes with deep roots overlapping those of eukarya. The objectives of this conference are to communicate and discuss ideas at the frontiers of science and technology in archaeal research. The meeting will expand on a number of emerging topics, highlighting new paradigms in archaeal physiology and metabolism, protein structure and function, systems biology and genomics, transcription and small RNAs, the ecology and diversity of the archaea, translation and post-transcriptional regulation, replication, repair and recombination, archaeal viruses and cellular defense, the archaeal cell envelope and the central role of archaea in understanding the evolution of early life and eukaryotes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A diverse and gender-balanced slate of speakers and discussion leaders have been recruited for the conference. A key goal is to encourage participation by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty from small colleges (including community colleges). Special efforts will be made to support students from underrepresented groups or students from laboratories with limited resources. Students and postdoctoral fellows will present and discuss their research in four poster sessions. In addition, at the beginning of each session two students selected from submitted abstracts will give a short talk to present their research findings. Thus young scientists will be given the opportunity to exchange ideas and make contacts in the formal and informal environment provided by the GRC and will be exposed to cutting-edge archaeal research.</AbstractNarration>
