    <AbstractNarration>With this New award, the Chemical Synthesis Program supports Professor Erin T. Pelkey of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in a study of the synthesis of cyclic molecules with nitrogen in their rings. Since these structures are ubiquitous in compounds of biomedical significance, the development of new selective and efficient methods for their synthesis is an important goal. These methods will expand the repertory of tools available to synthetic chemists seeking to develop new routesto wide range of biologically important natural products, drugs, and related compounds of medicinal interest. The research will involve extensive collaboration with undergraduate research students, including those from historically under-represented groups, and will provide these young scientists with valuable training in organic synthetic techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate convergent routes to 3,4-diarylpyrrolinones from tetramic acid precursors. In particular, the project will investigate the convergent stepwise attachment of aromatic and heteroaromatic groups to C-3 and C-4 positions of tetramic acid by a variety of cross-coupling reactions. Subsequent intramolecular aryl-aryl couplings leading to dibenzo[e,g]isoindol-1-ones will be studied. These investigations, which will take advantage of the ready availability of tetramic acids, will focus on maximizing convergent synthetic methodology.</AbstractNarration>
