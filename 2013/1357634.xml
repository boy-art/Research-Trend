    <AbstractNarration>Robotic grippers used in industriall environments, in research projects, or by individuals in unstructured environments tend to be bulky, expensive, limited in use, or dependent on external drive components. This project will exploit innovative and novel techniques to research and develop a self-contained robotic gripper that can handle various object shapes and be attached to virtually any robotic arm. The proposed modification and transformation of the robotic gripper advances the use of robotics for individuals with disabilities to become more independent and perform various activities of daily living (ADL).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effective transformation of the proposed technology will provide a great opportunity for researchers, manufacturers and end-users to achieve a high level of robotic arm usability when performing ADL and unstructured tasks.The PI and his team are involved in many outreach activities to enhance educational and hands-on robotics applications and in under-represnted and minority groups by allowing students to manipulate objects with the gripper. The findings from this project will be disseminated broadly to attarct researchers in the area of robotics.</AbstractNarration>
