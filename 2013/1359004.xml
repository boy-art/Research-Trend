    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;There is a critical need for the creation of a strong workforce of world-class scientists, engineers, and educators with competencies in interdisciplinary nanotechnology. Researchers at Northwestern University (NU) have made substantial contributions to this field and the university has gained a reputation for its rigorous nanotechnology research programs. The REU Site in Nanoscale Science and Engineering at NU will actively engage undergraduate students from institutions across the country in research projects that enable them to make substantive contributions in a field that holds vast promise for the future. The inherent interdisciplinarity of nanoscale science and engineering make it an ideal field of study for undergraduates from various engineering and science backgrounds. Additionally, advances in nanotechnology have the potential to significantly impact fields as diverse as medicine, energy, the environment, and security, which makes this program particularly attractive to a diverse group of students. This REU Site will benefit from an extensive pool of over 190 potential faculty mentors working in nanoscale science and engineering, and representing 28 different departments from mechanical engineering to medicine. Over the past ten years, they have successfully developed research projects for and mentored over 330 undergraduates in summer research programs, leading to 131 publications with undergraduate co-authors. This REU Site in Nanoscale Science and Engineering at Northwestern University (EEC-1359004) is made possible through the generous support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) of the National Science Foundation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site in Nanoscale Science and Engineering at Northwestern University (NU) provides undergraduate students from institutions across the country with hands-on, interdisciplinary research experiences and access to world-class instrumentation. During the nine-week summer program, each participant conducts a nanoscale science and/or engineering research project under the guidance of a faculty advisor, and graduate student or postdoctoral mentor. The inherent interdisciplinarity of nanoscale science and engineering make it an ideal field of study for undergraduates from diverse engineering and science backgrounds. In addition to research, the program includes a public speaking workshop, writing workshops, an ethics seminar, and field trip to Argonne National Laboratory. Participants are required to present their final project results at a formal Closing Symposium, and final papers are submitted for potential publication in a peer-reviewed journal, Nanoscape: The Journal of Undergraduate Research in Nanotechnology and other professional publications. This REU Site provides training in skills needed not only to conduct first-class research, but to effectively disseminate research results.</AbstractNarration>
