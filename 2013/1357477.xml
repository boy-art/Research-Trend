    <AbstractNarration>Arizona State University doctoral candidate, Angie Abdelmonem, under the guidance of Dr. James Eder, will investigate how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and grassroots social movements engage international human rights discourses in democratization efforts. The research takes place in Cairo, Egypt, which despite being an important focal point for recent democratization social movements, there is very little credible formal scientific exploration of unfolding processes on the ground. The researcher's unique training and ongoing work in the area allow for a feasible research project, which through participant observation with three Egyptian NGOs and social movements, interviews with activists, volunteers and local citizens, and surveys among neighborhood residents, will underscore the strategies employed, as well as successes and challenges faced, by civil society entities in making the public sphere safe for participation by socially marginalized individuals. There is a critical need to understand these dynamics in the current context of political upheaval and democratic transition in Egypt, where the participation of historically marginal groups in the public sphere is actively being contested and defined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study builds on the growing literature on NGOs and human rights in anthropology and is significant in providing a unique understanding of the politics of transnationally inspired social change. By emphasizing the voices and lived experiences of local NGO workers and residents, it will reveal complexities around citizen action in constructing new ideas of civil social participation in public and an increasingly globalizing society. This project will further allow scientists to understand how NGOs and other actors assess and reconfigure democratization efforts. Understanding how NGO discourses and programming are increasing access to the public sphere and improving daily realities is fundamental to finding solutions toward the creation of sustainable democracy. The project also contributes to the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
