    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans, LA will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014-16. Training will focus on research fields including genetics, microbiology, biochemistry, neurosciences, physiology, and pharmacology. Sample projects include: the study of proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle, and signal transduction; the regulation of transcription factors through phosphorylation; and the analysis of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) signaling in interneuronal rearrangements. The program will provide students with one-on-one mentoring on hypothesis development, experimental design, research methods, and scientific presentation skills. Students will learn how research is conducted and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Interactive workshops will include topics such as resume writing for graduate school applications, responsible conduct in research, and discussions of career pathways with faculty members from the LSUHSC Basic Sciences Departments and Centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be selected for participation based on academic record, research interest, and plans for a career in scientific research. Students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities and from schools with limited research opportunities are encouraged to apply. The program is targeting undergraduates from diverse social and educational backgrounds, especially from the New Orleans area. REU program alumni will be recruited to volunteer at partnering K-12 New Orleans schools during the academic year where they will explain biology and genetics to science classes and serve as role models to younger generations of potential scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment of the program is by qualitative and quantitative participant surveys, mentor evaluations, and by the BIO/REU common assessment tool. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/genetics/reu.aspx or by contacting the PI (Dr. Fern Tsien at fmille@lsuhsc.edu).</AbstractNarration>
