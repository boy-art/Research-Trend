    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Abby Schadock-Hewitt of Clemson University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The project title is "Modeling of a Unique Shaped-Fiber Stationary Phase for the Large-Scale Purification of Antibodies." The host scientists are Dr. Simone Dimartino and Dr. Conan Fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project involves characterization and modeling of a novel recombinant protein A- modified affinity chromatography stationary phase for the capture and recovery of immunoglobulin G (IgG). IgG is necessary for antibody-based therapeutics, a rapidly growing field that requires high quantities of highly pure antibody to be separated from complex fermentation broths in an efficient, fast, cost effective way. This work focuses on capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers modified with protein A (the affinity capture ligand for IgG), which show excellent potential, at the analytical scale, in overcoming the drawbacks of costly commercially available resins. Modeling of protein A-modified C-CP fibers is essential to determine if their advantageous properties hold at a preparative, industry suitable, scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this project encourages incorporation of engineering ideas and perspectives toward the analytical scale implementation of C-CP fiber columns. The Fellow will be able to bring this engineering perspective to other chemist colleagues by giving a presentation of the knowledge gained. Successful completion of the proposed work will open up many opportunities for future modification and modeling studies; taking the discovery steps into the practical realm. This will promote development of other novel C-CP fiber modifications and allow for the continued collaboration with the host researchers, possibly opening up new collaborations, and resulting in conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. The fibers current educational applications applied at Clemson will grow from the information gained, allowing for added applications.</AbstractNarration>
