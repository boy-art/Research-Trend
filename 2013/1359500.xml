    <AbstractNarration>This summer REU-Site program in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Chapman University (Orange, CA) will annually provide 10 students selected exclusively from 2-year community colleges with the opportunity to engage in research projects related to earth and environmental issues from the regional to global scale. Through the program, they will provide an under-served student population with hands-on, interdisciplinary research experiences and enhance the recruitment and retention of under-represented students into STEM fields. They will partner with multiple local community colleges that serve ethnically diverse communities and lack scientific research facilities. Faculty mentors include biologists, chemists, and geoscientists with active undergraduate research labs at Chapman. Through participation in cutting-edge research with faculty mentors working at the forefront of their respective disciplines, students will engage in complex scientific studies on topics including the sources, transport, and transformation pathways of pollutants, environmental impacts on intertidal organisms, and carbon sequestration in wetlands. In addition to research, students will participate in group activities including pre-experience training workshops, seminars with local speakers on environmental careers/issues, weekly group meetings/presentations within their research groups, university life and academic success workshops, a research poster presentation session, and a post-experience evaluation assessment.</AbstractNarration>
