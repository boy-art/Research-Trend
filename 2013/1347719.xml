    <AbstractNarration>This Widening Implementation &amp; Demonstration of Evidence-Based Reforms (WIDER) planning grant provides faculty at the University of West Georgia's College of Science and Mathematics (COSM) with increased support in the use of evidence-based teaching and learning practices. A Core Learning Team (CLT) comprised of at least ten faculty members from six departments (Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geosciences, Mathematics, and Physics)is participating in professional development activities designed to increase their ability to develop and implement effective evidence-based teaching practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aligning with best practices in facilitating institutional change, this program (Wider Implementation of STEM Educational Reforms, WISER) Practices] is focusing on changing the knowledge and attitudes of STEM faculty and university administrators with the goal of institutionalizing practices that will increase student success. Additionally, a rigorous evaluation of the program is providing both quantitative and qualitative data that will advance knowledge and contribute to the growing literature on evidence-based teaching and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: As COSM faculty increasingly value and engage in best practices in STEM learning, and as the University of West Georgia shows a commitment to rewarding these faculty, the institution expects to see significant increases in student learning, STEM majors, and retention in STEM courses. As a result, the University will be better able to meet the demands for graduates in STEM fields who can contribute to the economic growth of the state of Georgia and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
