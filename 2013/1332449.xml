    <AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project will form a partnership between physics programs at South Carolina State University (SCSU) and Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College (OCtech) that will strengthen both programs and serve as a model of best practices for developing collaborations. This partnership will be accomplished through shared resources and a variety of activities that include curriculum revision, infusing cyberlearning into the coursework and faculty training in current pedagogical methods. Efforts include an improved approach to recruitment and retention that focuses on the first year, both for freshmen entering college and for transfer students transitioning from OCtech to SCSU. Partner institutions will use a variety of means to strengthen the academic and social support for majors such as bringing first year students in contact with seniors through hands-on research experiences. Activities and products include institutionalization of five new courses, such as the LabVIEW course at OCtech and the Research Methods class at SCSU; development of renewable energy lab exercises; and online modules created for the physics courses that will lead to the use of flip instruction at both institutions. Finally, the introduction of iLabs will enable the development of the first physics hybrid course, mixing lab exercises that are online with others that are taught face-to-face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The growing need for STEM graduates in this country is well documented as is the underrepresentation of minorities in STEM disciplines, particularly in the field of physics. This project will address these issues by strengthening the physics program at SCSU through a partnership with OCtech to improve recruitment and retention. Lessons learned from the adoption of products, practices and techniques such as on-line tutorials, iLabs and Invention Instruction, will serve as a model for teaching physics at other HBCUs. Attainment of the project goal, to form a successful physics partnership between two institutions, will serve as a model of best practices for STEM collaborations at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
