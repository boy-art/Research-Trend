    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for two special sessions on "Emerging Areas in Polymer Science and Engineering" at the fall 2013 meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). The program is focused on tunable and responsive polymers, nanoparticles and surfactants, functional gels, smart/reconfigurable polymer networks, interfacial interactions, polymer batteries and capacitors, and transport through structured polymeric matrices. The talks cover an array of polymer research topics, with the overall theme being the use of nanoscale engineering and advanced materials chemistry to manipulate materials structure, properties, and function of polymer systems. The combination of the talks in each session will highlight recent theoretical, simulation, and experimental&lt;br/&gt;advances in polymer science and engineering in areas related to energy storage and generation, drug delivery, nanoscale templating, coatings, nanocomposites, and biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The speakers represent a broadly diverse group of leaders in the polymer field at different career stages. These focused sessions will cater to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty, and industrial professionals in a variety of areas related to polymer science and engineering. Furthermore, these sessions will showcase the breadth of emerging polymer-related activities in the chemical engineering community.</AbstractNarration>
