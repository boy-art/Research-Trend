    <AbstractNarration>1321776 (Jacobs). The Water Science and Technology Board of the National Research Council (NRC) is undertaking a study that will analyze the risks, costs, and benefits of on-site water reuse of stormwater and graywater and approaches needed for its safe use. The NRC study will be carried out by a committee of approximately 12 volunteer experts. The committee will hold approximately four meetings to receive briefings, gather information, deliberate critical issues, and write its report. Parts of most meetings of the committee will be held in open session with non-governmental organizations, relevant federal, state, and local agencies, other experts, and other interested parties in order to engage a broad group of individuals from the water management and policy community. The on-site reuse of stormwater captured through rainwater collection systems or graywater (wastewater generated from showers, washbasin, and laundry) can significantly reduce overall domestic water needs. On-site graywater and stormwater reuse systems can also produce benefits to the environment, such as reduced stormwater runoff or reduced energy use associated with water delivery and treatment. However, there are concerns and a significant shortage of scientific information about the associated life-cycle costs, energy savings, and potential risks to human health that accompany various applications. Additionally, there are concerns about the effects of extensive graywater reuse on the environment and on existing wastewater infrastructure. The study will analyze the risks, costs, and benefits of onsite water reuse of stormwater and graywater and approaches needed for its safe use, thereby providing important guidance to state and local governments and federal agencies on this topic. The committee?s report should produce a comprehensive reference of value to federal and state public health, natural resource, and environmental agencies; U.S. Congress; science community?academic and agency; environmental nongovernmental organizations; water managers; individuals? and entrepreneurs and consultants. Parts of most meetings of the committee will be held in open session with non-governmental organizations, relevant federal, state, and local agencies, other experts, and other interested parties in order to engage a broad group of individuals from the water management and policy.</AbstractNarration>
