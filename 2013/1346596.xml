    <AbstractNarration>This proposal was submitted for an EAGER grant; it seeks funding for a US-Turkey Collaborative research initiative. The application entitled, "Advanced Energy-Efficient Smart Buildings: Solar Energy Conversion by Next-Generation Construction NanoMaterials," was submitted by Touradj Solouki from Baylor University. This EAGER request will support a collaborative approach to enable NOx abatement using hybrid, nanomaterial-based photocatalysts, optimized for ambient conditions, without the incorporation of expensive platinum group metals. It is anticipated these new photocatalysts could be mixed with conventional construction materials to improve air quality in and around buildings. The work leverages the complementary skills and high resolution spectroscopic/spectrometric capabilities of the US and Turkish investigators and their individual facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is expected to produce cost-effective smart building materials that will use solar energy to clean the air and help to minimize air pollution. Moreover, research in this area will offer interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and scholars that will be involved in high-quality and meaningful research experiences, develop their expertise, and broaden their knowledge through shared and open-access facilities. Successful implementation of the research design will foster innovative research and serve as a model for future international collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
