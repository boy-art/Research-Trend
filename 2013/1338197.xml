    <AbstractNarration>CBET - 1338197&lt;br/&gt;PI: Todd McDevitt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stem cell engineering is a rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field that integrates principles of stem cell biology with the physical sciences and engineering to advance regenerative cell therapies and in vitro diagnostic platforms to commercially viable and scalable technologies that will significantly impact the biomedical sciences and society at large. While stem cell research is on the verge of broadly impacting many elements of the medical field regenerative medicine, drug discovery and development, cell-based diagnostics and cancer the bioprocess engineering that will be required to manufacture sufficient quantities of functional stem cells for these diagnostic and therapeutic applications is at an early stage of development. The current state of the field of stem cell research offers a unique opportunity for scientists and engineers, working together, to contribute significantly to the generation of robust, reproducible and scalable methods for phenotypic characterization, propagation, differentiation and bioprocessing of stem cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the unique challenges posed by stem cell research could be addressed by applying innovative technological advances occurring in adjacent disciplines for similar purposes, but different applications. Presentations during the workshop will include talks on fundamental basics of stem cell biology, scaleable culture techniques, bioanalytical characterization, manufacturing practices and enabling technologies. This program provides a unique opportunity for trainees and researchers to learn about common and quantitative methods for stem cell isolation, characterization, propagation and differentiation in a scalable manner to efficiently produce sufficient numbers of stem cells and derivatives in accessible formats in order to yield a spectrum of novel therapeutic and diagnostic applications of stem cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed workshop is the stimulation of creative, original, and potentially transformative new ideas and concepts and the identification of future directions in regenerative medicine manufacturing, thus generating a broader impact to the fields of stem cell biology, engineering, manufacturing and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The discussions at this workshop will advance our understanding of the underlying scientific and technological issues and challenges in further developing regenerative medicine biomanufacturing, and facilitate interdisciplinary interactions that may lead to new global collaborations and initiatives. By having female and minority participants attend the workshop, it will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups. This workshop will also stimulate translational research and innovation, facilitate the integration of education and research, and inspire and help train the young future leaders of stem cell engineering and manufacturing.
