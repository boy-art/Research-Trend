    <AbstractNarration>In this award, co-funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Energy for Sustainability Program of the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems of the Engineering Directorate, Professor Eric Stuve of the University of Washington and his graduate student researchers are working to develop a better understanding of the chemical reactions that take place at the electrode surfaces in lithium-oxygen batteries, a technologically-promising, new kind of battery. They are investigating the elementary chemical processes that are taking place in model systems using surface science techniques. In doing these experiments, Prof. Stuve and his group are striving to provide researchers with chemical insights that will allow for improved battery performance. Graduate students working on this project will receive training in chemistry and engineering, and Prof. Stuve will continue his efforts at educating the wider public about energy-related research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Stuve and his research group are conducting a series of experiments on model electrode materials, mimicking the electrode materials in lithium-oxygen batteries. Among the areas being studied are: (1) the study of the growth and morphology of LiOx on the electrode surface; (2) the investigation of the chemical stability of the solvent, including reactions that consume Li and the passivation of the electrode surface; and (3) the exploration of the reaction mechanism and reversibility of oxygen uptake/production. The systems will be studied using a number of sensitive surface science techniques, including Field Emission Microscopy (FEM), Field Ionization Microscopy (FIM), Pulsed Filed Desorption Mass Spectrometry (PFDMS) and Ramped Field Desorption (RFD). Students working on this project will receive training that will prepare them for research positions in academia, national Laboratories or industry.</AbstractNarration>
