    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on the deformation behavior of swollen polymer gels under different conditions as a function of their microstructure. The outcome of large-strain deformation of a swollen gel depends on many factors such as molecular architecture, elastic modulus, viscoelasticity and poroelasticity, and length scales relevant to the process. Specific technical goals include: (a) To establish a relationship between molecular architecture, macroscopic mechanical properties, and large-strain deformation behavior of swollen polymer gels. (b) To develop new measurement platforms for characterizing these gels during large-strain deformation processes. (c) To implement a computational framework for describing the deformation process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine the similarities and differences in deformation behavior, a variety of gels formed through covalent, ionic, and physical bonding and consisting of both synthetic and biological polymers, will be considered. This work aims to provide: (a) enhanced insights into gel structure formation at the molecular level, (b) improved understanding of gel deformation as a function of polymer architecture and gel structure, (c) advancement and development of measurement platforms necessary to characterize these materials, (d) a novel computational framework to describe an experimental observation and to predict an outcome for real-life applications, and (e) unifying principles based on this knowledge to design new gels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to achieve fundamental understanding of the deformation behavior of polymeric gels, and will also be relevant to any soft materials. Polymer gels are used in many applications ranging from bioimplants to tissue scaffolds to oil recovery to drug delivery. Accordingly, this CAREER project will impact the materials/polymer-science, chemical engineering, and biomedical disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is also designed to have an impact on the education and future careers of middle/high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The educational and outreach component of this program focuses on three segments: (a) incorporation and further development of course modules on polymer science and soft polymeric materials, (b) involvement of undergraduate students in results-driven research activities, and (c) inspiring middle and high school students to pursue education in STEM majors through laboratory demonstrations and participations in small research projects. To encourage the participation of a broader population in scientific research, the PI plans to recruit graduate students, undergraduate students, and high/middle-school participants from diverse populations, including women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
