    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Patricia Yang of Georgia Institute of Technology to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Lab of Marine Resources Management in National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The project title is "Aero-Hydrodynamics of Flying Fish." The host scientist is Dr. Shui-Kai Chang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying fish perform specialized kinematics and fin morphing in order to rapidly transition from swimming underwater to gliding in air. The project is to elucidate the novel mechanisms used by flying fish to propel themselves efficiently and stably in both air and water. A series of experimental fluid dynamic studies are being conducted on larval flying fish raised in the laboratory. This study provides original data on kinematics, morphology, and surface wetting properties of the body and appendages that facilitate propulsion on both sides of the air-water interface. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow's work will be disseminated through publication in journals and Popular Mechanics and other widely read magazines. The Fellow will organize a conservation group for flying fish to increase understanding of both the fluid mechanics involved in locomotion, and the effect of human behavior on sustainability of flying fish in the wild.</AbstractNarration>
