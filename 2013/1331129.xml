    <AbstractNarration>The special program on the Geometry of Outer space will be hosted by the Aix Marseille Universite. It will include a summer school and introductory workshop June 24-29, 2013 and a research program July 1-28, 2013. The summer school will include four lecture series, as well as several research talks. The research program will include a minimum of five weekly seminars, as well as discussion groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One can often better understand an abstract group by viewing it as the group of distance-preserving functions of a geometric object, such as the group of symmetries of a crystal. We will focus on two particular examples. We will focus on how the geometry of a surface's Teichmuller space has been used to study its mapping class group. And, in analogy, we will explore using the Outer space for a free group to study its outer automorphism group. To do this we will bring together many of the world's experts in both Teichmuller theory and in outer automorphism groups of free groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More details can be seen at http://www.latp.univ-mrs.fr/~catherine.pfaff/GOS.html</AbstractNarration>
