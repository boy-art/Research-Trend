    <AbstractNarration>Upon award of a proposal, the Abstract is available in the Award Search application and via FastLane.&lt;br/&gt;This project is establishing a permanent digital forensics program at Western New Mexico University (WNMU) in collaboration with Auburn University. It is providing a statewide digital forensics resource that currently does not exist in New Mexico. WNMU?s unique combined mission of regional community college as well as regional university provides unique opportunities to explore program integration with New Mexico 2-year law enforcement programs. Deliverables from this project include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Establish an 18-hour minor in digital forensics as part of the WNMU undergraduate and graduate Criminal Justice programs.&lt;br/&gt;2. Establish an 18-hour graduate certificate program in digital forensics as part of the WNMU Criminal Justice program.&lt;br/&gt;3. Establish an advanced digital forensics training program for New Mexico law enforcement.&lt;br/&gt;4. Conduct Regional workshops for diverse audiences drawn from New Mexico state and local law enforcement agencies as well as students from other campuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual challenge for this project is to determine how a small university in a remote corner of a large state can develop, deliver and sustain a technically challenging digital forensics program across a large state. The project is assessing courses learning outcomes as well as elements such as the practicality of course contents, the way the contents is delivered, the lab environment and setup, the effectiveness of projects and assignments, lab assistance quality and inclusion/exclusion suggestions for course contents and projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first of its kind program in New Mexico enjoys broad support from the state government. This ensures a broad impact across the state. This program could serve as a model for other underserved states, particularly large, rural states.</AbstractNarration>
