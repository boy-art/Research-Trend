    <AbstractNarration>Symbioses between eukaryotic hosts and bacterial consortia are fundamentally important to human health and ecosystem function. Gathering large amounts of DNA sequence data has become relatively easy and thus, models of host/microbiome function are accumulating. Critically, most models lack experimental tests. Working in a system that involves one eukaryotic host paired with a single bacterial symbiont the investigators will test models of symbiotic function to identify fundamental design principles in symbiosis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will exploit a very productive collaboration to further examine the nature of nutrient transport and regulation in insects; specifically, the investigators will exploit the model aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and its symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, to fully characterize the substrate and feedback regulation of transporters between the aphid and bacterium. The first objective targets testing whole genome based models of symbiotic function and regulation. The research team will transiently express transporters of sap-feeding insects in oocytes of the South African clawed frog to test genome sequence based models of symbiotic function and host/symbiont regulation. Because aphids are both a significant crop pest and excellent models for the study of symbiosis any work that increases understanding of basic aphid biology increases our ability to develop ecologically safe methods of pest control and may facilitate development of the aphid as a model for understanding the process of bacterial infection. Functional characterization of transporters in the pea aphid and related insects will facilitate comparative work in other insect systems thus benefitting the annotation of transporters in all arthropod genomes. The second objective targets bringing NSF-funded basic research into the lives of Americans through the production of six broadcast quality films about aphids, the science of symbiosis and life as a scientist. The films will be supported by development of curricular resources that target early childhood and middle school children. Finally, this project supports the research program of a mid-career female scientist.</AbstractNarration>
