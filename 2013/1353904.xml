    <AbstractNarration>This award is being made to the University of Memphis by the Instrumentation Development for Biological Research program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several areas of biological and biomedical research critically depend on 3D imaging for accurate analysis of subcellular structures within thick cellular samples. This research project will create a new imaging system design based on integrated computational and optical techniques to overcome the depth limitations of high-resolution 3D microscope imaging. The collaborative nature of the research is a model for cooperation between basic scientists and engineers. Outreach activities associated with this project will provide opportunities for local undergraduate students and community college instructors to participate in this research, connect with biological researchers and the international microscopy community, and gain skills in modern microscopy techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a computational optical system for three-dimensional (3D) microscopy imaging. The research involves integrated structured illumination optics, phase modulated imaging optics, digital signal processing, and analysis/synthesis techniques to achieve results not obtainable from traditional imaging standards. A novel partially coherent illumination configuration will be designed and tested and an imaging system uniquely capable of insensitivity to sample-induced aberration will be engineered. Digital processing algorithms that result in high-resolution, low-noise 3D images at depths of up to 100 micrometers within a thick sample will be developed. The broader impacts of this work include enabling of new capabilities developed to address currently inaccessible biological questions as well as potential societal benefits from implementation of a model for interdisciplinary education that encourages young scientists and engineers to engage each other in the drive toward innovation and discovery. Dissemination plans include a) a 3-day workshop/training session for potential users and industry partners, and b) online plans and instructions to build the system and the right to non-profit institutions to use it for research.</AbstractNarration>
