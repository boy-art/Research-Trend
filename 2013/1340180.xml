    <AbstractNarration>Models and Algorithms for Genome Evolution (MAGE) is an international meeting addressing the interdisciplinary area of genome evolution. MAGE is also celebrating the 50-year career of David Sankoff, a pioneer in computational genomics and biology. The community of computational evolutionary biologists is composed of mathematicians, computer scientists, statisticians, physicists and biologists, all willing to contribute to a better knowledge of the history of life on earth. The plurality of backgrounds yields a plurality of approaches, theoretical and empirical. The organizers represent a diverse international set of researchers at different stages of their careers. While the core of senior and early-career researchers have been invited and accepted, these funds will enable up to 20 students and postdocs to participate in the conference. In addition to the presentations and daily poster sessions, the meeting will also provide input to a book to be published by Springer in its series Computational Biology.</AbstractNarration>
