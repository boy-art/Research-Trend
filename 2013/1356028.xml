    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this S-STEM project is to guide high-achieving STEM students in becoming academically and civically-engaged scientists (ACES). The underlying premise of this proposal is that as the US increases the number of STEM professionals in order to excel in innovation, it is equally important that those STEM professionals see their chosen vocations as giving them a responsibility to serve their community, nation, and world as citizens. The ACES program will support a diverse cohort of 10-11 STEM students who will be awarded scholarships each year. As freshmen, scholars live in a residential cluster, enroll in common courses together, and explore what it means to be civically-minded scholars. As seniors, scholars complete an individualized honors research project with a faculty member. Each ACES cohort completes community engagement projects every year that allow them to apply their STEM knowledge and their leadership skills. They will also participate in mentoring programs and career development opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific measurable objectives of this project are to: (1) recruit diverse students to STEM fields, (2) retain 85% of scholarship recipients in a STEM field, (3) increase civic mindedness and engagement among participants, and (4) achieve a STEM placement for 90% of the program graduates. The ACES program will enable scholars to develop professional relationships with their peers and community partners, and articulate what it means to be a civically-engaged scientist to a variety of audiences. As a result of this program, ACES students will be able to actively engage with community issues by applying their scientific body of knowledge and skills. Assessment and evaluation of the ACES program will contain both formative and summative components using both direct and indirect evidence-based measures.</AbstractNarration>
