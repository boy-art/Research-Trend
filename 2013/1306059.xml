    <AbstractNarration>Integrating behavior, engineering and mathematics: Applying modern network theory to social transmission of parasites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaps in the understanding of parasite transmission and social networks exist due to 1) lack of experimentation 2) difficulty obtaining accurate measures of social interactions and 3) analytical challenges associated with robust statistical comparisons of networks. This research involves describing social networks in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) using digital transceiver devices to characterize fine-scale social interactions among individuals belonging to independent subpopulations. Parasites will be experimentally removed from half the individuals per network and sampled later to measure recolonization of directly transmitted parasites relative to social network properties calculated based on digitally recorded contact rates between members of the tagged populations. A second experiment will manipulate the network rather than the parasites, through alteration of host ventral plumage color, a trait known to affect physiology and social behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is growing recognition of the importance of individual-level heterogeneity in host behavior in the context of parasite transmission, and this experimental approach is a powerful way to understand relative contributions of social network measure on parasite transmission as well as understanding how features of morphology and physiology influence position in social networks. Motivated by career goals in undergraduate research and education, the inclusion of University of Colorado-Boulder undergraduate students in this research is a high priority, especially participation by students typically underrepresented in the field. The research will enhance the University's infrastructure by establishing collaboration between the Applied Math and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology departments. Outreach associated with this project includes working with citizen scientists through the Swallow Surveillance program.</AbstractNarration>
