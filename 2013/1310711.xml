    <AbstractNarration>This action is funding Ben Vander Jagt of The Ohio State University to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. The project title is "Estimating Snow Depth Remotely Using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle." The host scientist is Dr. Arko Lucieer, Senior Lecturer in Remote Sensing and GIS at the University of Tasmania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Fellowship is working on accurately estimating spatially continuous snow depth fields, using a combined Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and photographic based approach on-board an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). By measuring a geographic area once before the onset of the snow season and once again during the snow season, the Fellow can effectively determine both the amount and distribution of the snow contained within that area. It is the first time that a study of such nature has been performed, and is an excellent example of the novel scientific research that can be achieved using UAVs. Additionally, because a large percentage of the world's population depends on snow as a source of freshwater, being able to accurately measure and quantify snow accumulation is an important objective that has both scientific and civil merit. By providing resource managers with better information to facilitate effective water management, conflict between individuals as well as governmental organizations can be mitigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this Fellowship also provides an exciting opportunity to promote earth science and engineering within the general population, specifically secondary educational institutions. The Fellow plans to demonstrate the scientific capabilities of UAVs to local high schools in order to captivate and encourage students to pursue opportunities in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). The Fellow will make all data collected during the study freely available to the public, as well as any scientific publications which are authored as a result of the Fellowship. Lastly, attending the host country supplies the Fellow with a rich introduction to the science policy and legislation associated with the scientific and commercial use of UAVs, and provides an excellent cultural and scientific learning environment for conducting advanced research.</AbstractNarration>
