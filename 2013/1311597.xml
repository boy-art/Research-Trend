    <AbstractNarration>The evolutionary success of a species is greatly influenced by its interactions with other species sharing its environment. One of the best examples of evolutionary patterns strongly influenced by interspecific interactions is the relationship between hosts and their parasites. Studies examining host-parasite interactions have found that similar evolutionary histories are most often shared between highly host-specific parasites and their hosts, while generalist parasites evolve almost independently from their hosts. This raises an important question: What factors drive patterns of coevolution between hosts and their parasites? Using the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, and its ectoparasites on the California Channel Islands as a model system, this study will investigate how differences between parasites affect their evolution on and with their hosts. The study will also examine how the availability of alternative hosts on different islands affects the relationship between deer mice and their parasites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a novel system in which to study host-parasite interactions. Comparing the coevolution of parasites and their hosts on the Channel Islands will help tease apart the basic factors influencing evolution in host-parasite systems, which will be important for the study of both wildlife conservation and the ecology of diseases. Additionally, this work will provide valuable population genetic information for Channel Islands deer mice, a species of special concern in California, and it will provide field research training opportunities for a local undergraduate.</AbstractNarration>
