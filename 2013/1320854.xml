    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to develop new algorithmic techniques for the&lt;br/&gt;design of and routing in data networks. Classical network optimization&lt;br/&gt;problems address transportation networks that carry physical&lt;br/&gt;commodities. Data networks are fundamentally different --- data can be&lt;br/&gt;modified, compressed, and replicated at little cost. Incorporating&lt;br/&gt;this flexibility in altering traffic into network optimization&lt;br/&gt;problems can bring about a considerable improvement in the capacities&lt;br/&gt;of communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to revisit classical network optimization problems&lt;br/&gt;within a new model where the cost of carrying data is non-linear and&lt;br/&gt;depends on its compressibility. It aims to provide theoretical&lt;br/&gt;underpinnings for new WAN optimization approaches proposed in the&lt;br/&gt;networking literature, including, for example, traffic redundancy&lt;br/&gt;elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI considers a model where links in the network can compress data and&lt;br/&gt;remove duplicate packets. For example, if two traffic streams contain&lt;br/&gt;identical data and use overlapping routes, edges carrying both streams&lt;br/&gt;need only transmit the common packets once; these can then be&lt;br/&gt;replicated at routers where the streams diverge. Accordingly, the load&lt;br/&gt;on an edge is a submodular function of the traffic streams that use&lt;br/&gt;the edge. Unlike previous work on network optimization with non-linear&lt;br/&gt;costs, in this model, the cost of routing depends on the identities of&lt;br/&gt;the traffic streams involved, and not just on the total traffic&lt;br/&gt;volume. Most of the problems considered are computationally&lt;br/&gt;intractable and the PI aims to develop approximation algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several graduate and undergraduate courses will benefit from this project.</AbstractNarration>
