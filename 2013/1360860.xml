    <AbstractNarration>The proposed new site of the I/UCRC for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) at Auburn University intends to expand CAFS efforts by providing additional and specialized expertise and research in areas specifically within the forest entomology and forest pathology research and the management of forest pests in the southern US forest ecosystems. The Auburn University associated CAFS projects will augment and complement current CAFS projects in the broad areas of insect and disease management, through silviculture, disease and insect resistance and invasive species research in forest plantations throughout the southern US. Auburn University specifically proposes a number of collaborative projects on developing disease and insect management and genotype screening programs for enhancing southern US conifer planting stock survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Auburn University CAFS site has the potential to increase the breadth and reach of broader center impacts. These key impacts include: increased competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners, improved knowledge of members with respect to insect and disease pests that affect stand productivity and enhanced technology transfer between Center scientists and industrial members, expanded scientific knowledge through peer reviewed publications and presentations, expanded training of graduate students with unique interdisciplinary skill sets, recruitment of graduate students from underrepresented groups, and undergraduate involvement that may promote more graduate enrollment.</AbstractNarration>
