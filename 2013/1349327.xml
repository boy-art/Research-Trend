    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to the Virginia Institute of Marine Science Nunnally Ichthyology Collection to safeguard this rare resource and preserve it for current and future scientific research. Among the specimens targeted is a large and important collection of larval fishes derived from collections made worldwide. This larval fish collection was collected as part of oceanographic studies and represent time series over broad geographic ranges. Thus, the collection of larval fishes lends itself to studying, for example, the effect of the physical environment or anthropogenic-induced environmental changes on larval fish communities over time and across a range of habitats. This project has three main goals: 1) improve storage of specimens to ensure long-term preservation; 2) identify specimens and increase their utility for research and teaching; and 3) catalog specimens and link associated environmental data and images in a publicly accessed digital database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proper storage, identification, and digitization of these samples will secure them and increase their value. The researchers will organize workshops to introduce students, collection managers, and other professionals to the study, identification, and care of larval fish specimens. These workshops will offer intensive training and will be led by prominent larval fish experts. This award will also contribute to graduate student training, serving as the foundation of a student?s research and training in curatorial best practices. The results of this project will be communicated to the general public through seminars, displays, social media outlets, and tours organized by the collections staff.
