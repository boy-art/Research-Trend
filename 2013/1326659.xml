    <AbstractNarration>Co-management has been recognized as important in successfully governing common pool resources, including coastal fisheries. Fishery co-management, where fishermen collectively manage the fishery as a group, is garnering much attention, for example the the New England groundfish fishery's sector allocation scheme. One of the key characteristics of fishery co-management is the self-imposed rules and practices by the group that aims to achieve certain management goals. This researach focuses on one such practice, a pooling system, in which harvesters share catch and/or profits among members of the group. In Japan case studies have shown that pooling systems work well, but there is one problem: theoretically, pooling system cannot be effective due to the incentive to free-ride on other members' fishing effort. This study looks at how two mechanisms -- social capital and effort coordination -- may overcome the free-riding problem. Social capital refers to attributes such as trust, reciprocity and cooperation in human relationships. Effort coordination includes fishing ground rotation and joint marketing. This research empirically examines the inter-relationships of these mechanisms through surveys and experiments in at least twenty Japanese fishing communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a deeper understanding of how one management tool, namely pooling systems, may be applicable for regulators and stakeholders in US fisheries and other similar common pool resources. This new knowledge helps US fisheries to achieve both conservation of resources and economic efficiency of resource use especially in fisheries that are not able to employ effective regulations or an individual catch-share system. Furthermore, the results may show how these management tools can be applicable in developing countries as well as advanced industrial democracies. Eventually, this new knowledge will benefit society by contributing to both a better economy and a healthier environment.</AbstractNarration>
