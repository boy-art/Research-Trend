    <AbstractNarration>Investigating the impact of climatic stress on root chemistry using spectroscopic techniques&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant roots contribute a majority of the carbon sequestered in terrestrial ecosystems. The stability of this sequestered carbon is governed by the overall molecular identity of the litter matrix. Projected increases in temperature and frequent droughts by the turn of this century may impose severe moisture stress in plants, altering the plant metabolic pathways resulting in unique metabolite profiles and biopolymer chemistry of the roots. This unprecedented change in the structural chemistry and composition (quality) of root biopolymers would further alter their microbial symbiotic associations. The change in root biopolymer chemistry and microbial associations would, in turn, alter the stability and turnover of root carbon in soil. Advanced spectroscopic techniques and chemometric analyses are promising tools to capture the climatic stress induced qualitative changes in root chemistry and further help to predict root litter decomposition under future climates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include attaining proficiency in advanced spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analyses and computational techniques. The project integrates physical science techniques with biology to develop an interdisciplinary research program. The fellow will actively recruit and mentor high school and undergraduate students through the proposed research. Additionally, the fellow will give guest lectures and present research in national and international conferences and disseminate findings of the research through publications in peer-reviewed journals and to the non-scientific community through popular science magazines.</AbstractNarration>
