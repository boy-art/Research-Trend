    <AbstractNarration>This S-STEM scholarship project at the University of Vermont (UVM) addresses the significant shortage of computer scientists, both in Vermont and at the national level. The project is increasing the number and diversity of well-educated, skilled employees in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project improves educational opportunities for UVM computer science students by providing scholarships to students with a demonstrated financial need. The project improves UVM's ability to develop leaders in the field of computer science by raising awareness through outreach efforts and recruiting individuals who do not traditionally select computer science as a major. Female award recipients are assigned dedicated female faculty mentors and advisors and participate in a female subsection of the department-sponsored student organization, CS Crew, to create a strong female cohort and increase retention and recruitment of female students, both scholarship recipients and others. The project builds on several recent initiatives at UVM, including the highly successful STEM-Connect internship program in the UVM College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences. STEM-Connect provides internship placement services and career placement services to computer science scholarship award recipients as they near graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be evaluated using the Taskstream Electronic Assessment program. Enrollment trends, student progress, outcomes of work-based learning opportunities, and career placement rates will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the program. Finally the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) will be administered in each year of the program to measure student satisfaction and learning gains. The results of the NSSE survey will be used to compare the effectiveness of this program with other institutions and students at UVM who are not part of the program.</AbstractNarration>
