    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will leverage the advances we&lt;br/&gt;made in fabricating flexible polymer surfaces that shed water at low tilt angles while remaining&lt;br/&gt;superhydrophobic after abrasion. In Phase I we developed a model which correlated surface&lt;br/&gt;morphology with mechanical robustness. In Phase II we will apply this model to the&lt;br/&gt;development of a processes compatible with high speed, large-scale fabrication techniques.&lt;br/&gt;The roofing industry seeks material that is self-cleaning, anti-fouling and is highly resistant to&lt;br/&gt;weather events over time. A durable, superhydrophobic polymeric roof membrane will meet&lt;br/&gt;this market need. Commercial success depends on (1) qualifying production speeds up to 100&lt;br/&gt;feet/min, (2) proving compliance to current product requirements and (3) showing value-add.&lt;br/&gt;Phase II studies will elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to the stability of the surfaces&lt;br/&gt;when exposed to UV light, allowing us to improve weatherability. Having demonstrated the&lt;br/&gt;self-cleaning properties of our polymer surfaces in Phase I, we will focus on anti-fouling&lt;br/&gt;properties in Phase II (i.e. low bacterial adhesion and reduced algae growth.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project will be twofold. Foremost, a direct impact will&lt;br/&gt;be revenue and job growth in the US manufacturing sector. Secondarily, the technology will&lt;br/&gt;support federal policy goals on energy and the environment. Approximately $40 billion is spent&lt;br/&gt;annually in the US to air condition buildings. DOE funded studies show that in warm climates,&lt;br/&gt;substituting a cool roof for a conventional roof can reduce carbon emissions which drive&lt;br/&gt;climate change. Cool roofs also relieve strain on the electrical grid by reducing peak power&lt;br/&gt;demand. Widespread use of cool roofs can improve air quality, hence human health, by&lt;br/&gt;slowing the formation of smog. Superhydrophobic polymer membranes fabricated using&lt;br/&gt;technology developed in this proposal will help keep roofs clean and better able to reflect heat.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, coating of outdoor infrastructure equipment, such as wind turbine blades and offshore&lt;br/&gt;energy exploration platforms, will enable the safe operation of such facilities during icing&lt;br/&gt;conditions due to the ability of the superhydrophobic surface to prevent ice accretion. Field&lt;br/&gt;tests are underway. Food handling equipment will benefit from reduced adhesion of bacteria &lt;br/&gt;to surfaces, thus improving food safety.</AbstractNarration>
