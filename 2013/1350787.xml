    <AbstractNarration>This project, carried out by the University of Notre Dame, seeks to contribute to statistics education by developing improved methods for computerized adaptive testing. These methods use modern versions of item response theory, going beyond older versions that are commonly used in adaptive tests. Hence, the project has the potential to lead to tests that more successfully measure student knowledge and provide diagnostic feedback, as computerized testing increasing comes into wide use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a CAREER award, supporting not only research but educational outreach and professional development by a Notre Dame faculty member, Dr. Ying Cheng. The educational outreach includes providing summer research fellowships to high school and college students, and offering a workshop to high school statistics teachers. The test items and computerized testing/feedback programs developed in this project will be made available to students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves the participation of several hundred students, taking Advanced Placement (AP) statistics classes in high school or introductory statistics in college, as well as about 30 AP statistics high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work helps the Education and Human Resources directorate, and the Division of Research on Learning, pursue the mission of supporting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education research. In particular, this project focuses on improving STEM learning, including assessment of learning and use of technology in STEM learning environments such as schools.</AbstractNarration>
