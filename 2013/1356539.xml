    <AbstractNarration>This project improves retention and graduate rates in STEM fields at Boise State University. A goal of a six-year graduation rate of seventy percent has been established. To achieve this, the project recruits academically excellent and diverse recipients, establishes cohorts, and offers 13-15 scholarships and other academic programming annually to civil engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, materials science, and mechanical engineering undergraduates. The project provides scholarships and support for at least two years, and smaller transitional scholarships for up to two additional years. Outcomes are monitored throughout the course of the project. Funding and cohort participation enables students receiving scholarships both to graduate more quickly and in greater numbers. Boise State University serves the third-largest metropolitan area in the American Northwest and has a particular responsibility in supporting workforce and economic development. This project helps to meet demands created by both increasing enrollments as well as regional economic development. The project helps to increase the number of students that continue education after high school and complete four-year college degrees. This S-STEM project provides a critical component needed to improve college completion rates and increase the state and regional STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given Federal and regional imperatives to increase STEM graduates, there is merit in promoting educational and research programs that are successful in retaining and graduating students in STEM fields. This project offers detailed assessment, recruitment, and retention data to help establish effective practices in STEM retention. Such data are particularly beneficial in offering insight on serving groups currently underrepresented in STEM disciplines including Hispanics, first generation college students, and non-traditional students who often must balance studies with substantive family responsibilities. The project utilizes experienced, multidisciplinary personnel to help advise students and carryout the project plan. Particular areas of expertise include student selection, coordination, assessment and career placement. Furthermore, the identification and dissemination of the project's effective practices offers information useful to other institutions seeking to increase graduation rates and retention in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
