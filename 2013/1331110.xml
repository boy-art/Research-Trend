    <AbstractNarration>Project Overview &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests support for a two-day conference to bring philosophers of race into conversation with biomedical researchers. Within the last 20 years, there have been substantial developments in the use of race as a biomedical category as well as in the philosophy of race, but there have been few meaningful exchanges between scholars in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference agenda is designed to promote effective, fruitful discussions. It will create a structure for potentially transformative discussions between highly qualified and well-situated key actors in each field. It will do so by implementing a novel strategy for promoting interaction; particular positions are to be assigned to invited guests who are then to argue for or against particular points of view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will promote interdisciplinarity and will involve participants with very substantial racial and ethnic diversity. In addition, the PI will videotape the conference proceedings, and she will post them on a web site. An edited collection will also be published consisting of workshop proceedings. These materials will be of broad interest well outside of the disciplines involved in the conference including members of the general public.</AbstractNarration>
