    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Roo Vandegrift of the University of Oregon's Institute of Ecology and Evolution to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "Dispersal Ecology of a Common Family of Leaf-Inhabiting Fungi (Xylariaceae)." The host scientist is Dr. Yu-Ming Ju.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of xylariaceous fungi as endophytes remains unclear, as do many aspects of their lifecycle, such as their means of dispersal. It has been proposed that these may be linked: xylariaceous fungi could utilize the endophytic life stage as a means to "forage" for an appropriate substrate, persisting longer in the environment as an infected leaf than they could as a naked spore. This theory has never been adequately tested. This project looks for evidence of dispersal limitation in xylariaceous endophytes to test the hypothesis that the endophytic life stage of Xylariaceae serves as a means of dispersal within the family. Dr. Yu-Ming Ju has helped create a history of collaboration between East and West centered around the study of this group of fungi. This is worth preserving in new generations of mycologists and ecologists. Scientific collaboration across geography and culture is one of the factors that continually pushes forward our quest for knowledge. The importance of understanding biological diversity cannot be understated. We are in the midst of a mass extinction event, and in many cases species are lost whose significance is unknown. Understanding the ecology of this group of fungus is crucial in a world with a rapidly changing climate, accelerating tropical deforestation, and increasing trans-continental trade in plants which may be harboring cryptic fungal partners. Understanding the roles and relationships of fungal endophytes may allow us to ameliorate some of the species loss due to climate change and deforestation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, in addition to this utility for conservation efforts, this project may also provide valuable information to foresters attempting to control pathogens in timber lands.</AbstractNarration>
