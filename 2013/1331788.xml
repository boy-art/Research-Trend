    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate techniques to power cellular network base stations from renewable sources (wind turbines and photovoltaic modules) in order to address cellular networks' carbon footprint and resiliency concerns. To better manage operation and increase resiliency, base stations are clustered in small groups in a microgrid configuration. In this configuration, cellular traffic management is integrated with the operation of local renewable electric power generators and energy storage, forming a single power and communication sustainable smart infrastructure system. Consequently, this project will develop an integrated management system by (a) researching algorithms that use next-day weather forecasts to predict the short-term available renewable energy; (b) studying algorithms to predict the cellular traffic-dependent power consumption; and (c) investigating algorithms that will integrate the information from (a) and (b) to shape the traffic at base stations to maximize operation powered from renewable sources while also maintaining communication quality within limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes from this project will help overcome barriers challenging the use of renewable energy and will increase the resiliency of cellular networks to allow continued operation under extreme events. Also, the outcomes from this project will be of value in other applications, such as demand-response and sustainable operation of data centers and other networks. This project will also implement a course, to be co-taught by the investigators through virtual meetings, that integrates technology in computing, communications and power systems to address the scarcity of graduating professionals with an understanding of the smart grid as a system integrating power, computational and communications notions.</AbstractNarration>
