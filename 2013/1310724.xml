    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Renata Cumbee of the University of Georgia to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the College of Material Sciences and Optoelectronic Technology at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China. The project title is "Highly-Charged Ion Collisions with Atoms: Applications to X-ray Emission in the Solar System." The host scientist is Prof. Yizhi Qu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To improve the quality of current x-ray models in astrophysics, this project uses explicit quantum-mechanical cross section calculations produced by Prof. Qu's group for the collisional process of charge exchange for important solar wind ions and velocities colliding with heliospheric neutral atoms which enables detailed spectral modeling needed to exploit current X-ray observations. The project performs the calculations for the important collision systems of important solar wind ions Ne9+ and Mg11+ colliding with neutral H. The calculations are performed over the relevant collision energies, 10 eV/u to 50 keV/u, and include state selective cross sections to all important n, l, S-resolved states. In particular, this work focuses on the resulting nonequilibrium distributions created in the quantum-resolved n, l, S states. This project will have a direct impact on advancing our understanding of atomic collisions and the solar wind interaction with the heliosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, when the EAPSI fellowship is complete, the Fellow will have the opportunity to train other graduate students in her field of research and through seminars, she will be able to recruit students to apply to this fellowship in future years.</AbstractNarration>
