    <AbstractNarration>The frequency of extreme weather events is predicted to increase due to global climate change. Hurricane Sandy devastated New York City (NYC) with high winds, rain, and storm surge. The human and economic toll of this storm was record-breaking but the ecological toll is unknown. Arthropods, such as insects and spiders, are the most abundant and diverse animals in cities. They perform many important services, such as decomposing human refuse, but they can also be pests of buildings and plants. The goal of this work is to understand how Hurricane Sandy changed arthropod communities in New York City and how these changes affect the services or disservices they provide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban arthropod communities consist of native and exotic species. They exist in stressful habitats, such as road medians, but also in less stressful habitats such as parks. Ecological theories predict that exotic species should become more abundant and native species less abundant after big disturbances like Hurricane Sandy. Other theories predict that animals living in stressful habitats should be more resilient to disturbances than animals living in less stressful habitats. Perhaps changes in insect species that occur in an area after a hurricane will upset food webs and reduce the beneficial services they provide. Likewise, disturbances may allow populations of some pest species to explode because they are no longer kept in check by predators. This research work will reveal what actually happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is important for understanding how plants and animals in urban environments will respond to increased human populations and to potentially more and stronger hurricanes associated with climate change. The work will be conducted in in public areas, where the investigators will regularly interact with the citizens of NYC and explain to them what they are doing. They will also create a dedicated website and provide public presentations to increase public understanding of urban ecology, global change, and related topics.</AbstractNarration>
