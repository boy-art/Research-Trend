    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to create a design process for offshore wind generation systems. The design process will explore a variety of advanced technologies for the electric machinery as well as the power conversion and electrical connection to shore power. The approach for this research project is to apply optimal design to a notional offshore wind farm considering a myriad of promising new technologies so as to achieve high performance, low weight and scalability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal comes about from development of novel approaches to design highly efficient, compact and reliable offshore wind power generation systems. The main components of the system should be designed carefully and optimally. The goal of this proposal is to overcome the challenges regarding the design of megawatt level generators, power converters and transmission system and finally grid integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offshore wind power production has taken root in Europe and is planned for future implementation in the U.S. This specific form of energy production looks promising in terms of the amount of wind energy that can be harvested, the economic impact of "green" jobs, and the strength in diversifying the U.S. energy portfolio. The proposed research would further knowledge of existing and potential technologies of offshore wind generation and assist quicker adoption of these technologies. The principal investigator will flow down scientific findings from this research directly into courses she is teaching in renewable energy which, due to the long-term social component, tend to attract minorities and females students.</AbstractNarration>
