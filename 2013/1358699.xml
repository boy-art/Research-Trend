    <AbstractNarration>The long-term future of reef ecosystems depends on the continued persistence of corals as essential habitat builders. Environmental threats facing coral reefs globally include chronic and acute thermal stress (which can result in ?coral bleaching" as a result of the expulsion of their symbiotic algae), increasing CO2, and nutrient pollution. This project will assess the independent and interactive effects of these stressors using a new molecular based technique showing that coral bleaching susceptibility depends on the symbiont:host (S:H) cell ratio in coral tissues. Corals with higher ratios (more symbionts) are predicted to be more susceptible to thermal stress, suggesting that abiotic factors that affect symbiont densities can directly influence thermal tolerance. This new metric of symbiont density is of physiological relevance and has already revealed patterns that differ from currently used metrics, thus providing new insights into the dynamics of these symbioses. This project will also continue the development and application of these methods to further our understanding of the ecology of coral-algal symbioses, while helping to elucidate the responses of these critical ecosystem engineers to complex changes in their environment. The proposed activities will help us understand how tradeoffs in the regulation of symbiotic partners respond to the environment and relate to the differential susceptibility of corals to environmental stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of molecular assays to quantify symbiont abundance represents a technical resource that will help advance the field of coral ecology. This project will train a postdoctoral researcher and several students (graduate and undergraduate), helps expand a new state-of-the-science running seawater laboratory, establishes a new coral nursery as an educational resource, and will be incorporated into ongoing activities in K-12 outreach and involvement with mass media for broader public outreach.</AbstractNarration>
