    <AbstractNarration>This research will explore transportation difficulties among women on probation and parole. Theory about what works in reducing re-offense rates indicates that offenders must be carefully screened to identify their needs so they can be referred to programming that is appropriately matched to them in terms of intensity (e.g., intensive programming for high-risk offenders) and type (e.g., substance abuse treatment for substance abusers). However, to date, correctional practitioners have not had an instrument to assess transportation deprivation. Therefore, the project will create a measurement instrument for transportation deprivation, discover strategies women use to overcome deprivation, and determine, to what extent lack of transportation is related to re-offending. The project will analyze survey data, in-depth interview information, and official records. Survey data will discover women's levels of transportation access and will be used to generate a measurement instrument. In-depth interview information will be collected from a subsample of women to explain strategies women use to overcome low levels of transportation access. Official records will reveal whether, as a result of transportation deprivation, women violate supervision rules or are re-arrested or re-convicted within 12 months after parole or probation supervision begins. Results are expected to lead to better criminal justice practitioner assessment of clients' transportation needs and inform needs for additional services (e.g., bus tokens, telephone reporting). Findings are relevant to non-offender groups who share some of the same needs as women offenders, such as low-income or multiply disadvantaged individuals, who must access goods and services, search for jobs, care for others or attend to physical and mental health needs.</AbstractNarration>
