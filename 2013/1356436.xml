    <AbstractNarration>As a means to increase the number of students who complete associate's degrees in STEM disciplines and either transfer into baccalaureate programs or go directly into the STEM workforce, the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) will provide student support through the Community of Math and Computer Inspired Scholars (MCIS) program. Leveraging existing partnerships with employers of STEM graduates, the Baltimore County Public Schools and four-year institutions, the MCIS program will create effective pathways from high school through employment, upon successful completion of a degree in a STEM field. As individuals from underrepresented minority groups comprise nearly half of the student population at CCBC, the MCIS program will contribute to enhancing diversity in the STEM professional workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a technical standpoint, the MCIS program will provide 25 scholarships each semester to students who demonstrate financial need, possess high academic potential and are enrolled full-time in the STEM disciplines of Engineering, Engineering Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Information Technology and Network Technology. In addition to the financial support through the S-STEM scholarships, students in the MCIS program will receive a personal faculty mentor to provide academic and professional advising, opportunities to network with STEM professionals, supplemental instruction, and special courses in spatial skills development. Through the use of institutional research data and student surveys, outcomes to be measured include the impact of the project on the enrollment, academic performance, retention and graduation of students from the MCIS program, student perceptions of STEM, employment secured by program graduates and successful transfers to four-year institutions.</AbstractNarration>
