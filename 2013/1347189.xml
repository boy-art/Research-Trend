    <AbstractNarration>The recently introduced Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)&lt;br/&gt;technique for InfiniBand and High Speed Ethernet provides native I/O&lt;br/&gt;virtualization capabilities and enables us to provision the internal&lt;br/&gt;PCI bus interface between multiple Virtual Machines (VMs). However,&lt;br/&gt;achieving near native throughput for HPC applications that use both&lt;br/&gt;point-to-point and collective operations on virtualized multi-core&lt;br/&gt;systems with SR-IOV presents a new set of challenges for the designers&lt;br/&gt;of high performance middleware, such as MPI. In order to solve this&lt;br/&gt;problem, this project aims to address the following set of challenges:&lt;br/&gt;1) How to redesign MPI communication library to achieve efficient&lt;br/&gt;locality-aware communication and facilitate fair resource sharing on&lt;br/&gt;modern virtualized high performance clusters, with SR-IOV? 2) Can&lt;br/&gt;communication libraries be designed to deliver the best communication&lt;br/&gt;performance across different VM subscription policies and network&lt;br/&gt;communication modes? 3) What are the the challenges involved in&lt;br/&gt;designing support for advanced features such as, live migration,&lt;br/&gt;Quality of Service, and I/O storage virtualization? and 4) What kind&lt;br/&gt;of benefits, in terms of performance and scalability, can be achieved&lt;br/&gt;by the proposed approach for HPC applications? A synergistic and&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive research plan is proposed to address the above&lt;br/&gt;challenges for HPC Virtualization on clusters with SR-IOV and study&lt;br/&gt;its impact for a set of HPC applications.</AbstractNarration>
