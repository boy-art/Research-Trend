    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the synergistic combination of low heat rejection (LHR) and low temperature combustion (LTC) to fill the technological gap between existing commercially available internal combustion engines and the clean high-efficiency advanced combustion engine. The translated LHR/LTC technology has the following unique feature: low heat rejection from a low temperature combustion engine that results in more favorable thermodynamics compared to either conventional or ordinary low temperature combustion engines. This provides exemplary efficiency, engine-out exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides and fixed carbon, and suitable exhaust temperatures for favorable operation of exhaust emission control systems when compared to the leading competing internal combustion engine. The project accomplishes its objectives by performing a proof-of-concept that experimentally and computationally realizes LHR concepts with LTC in a compression ignition engine resulting in a prototype LHR/LTC combustion mode operating in a light-duty automotive diesel engine. The partnership engages General Motors, which engineers and manufacturers the prototype-intended light-duty automotive engine. GM provides guidance in the global automotive market space such as operating constraints, cost limitations, and technology integration with a marketable product in order to translate LHR/LTC combustion along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be nearly $40million in the next 10 years (based on new diesel vehicle registrations in the United States demonstrating on average $256/year in fuel cost savings at $4.00/gallon fuel cost), which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this automotive market space. The societal impact, long term, will be improved vehicle fuel economy with reduced emission of criteria pollutants (e.g., nitrogen oxides), thereby reducing vehicle carbon footprint. Additionally, this effort will augment the investigators? efforts to increase female and underrepresented students in STEM disciplines and improve undergraduate student course instruction in thermodynamics by leveraging resources used for summer STEM camps and course redesign activities. Finally, scholarly articles and conference presentations will be disseminated to ensure scientific and technological pathway discoveries are made known.</AbstractNarration>
