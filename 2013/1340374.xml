    <AbstractNarration>Folding and unfolding materials to create structures with novel shape and functionality has been recognized as a promising design concept for engineering systems at and across a broad range of length scales. This workshop will bring together a diverse group of international experts to discuss and explore challenges and opportunities in the emerging field of origami design. The workshop will be held on May 14, 2013, in Orlando, Florida, directly subsequent to the 10th World Congress on Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (WCSMO-10). WCSMO-10 is considered the primary conference series in topology optimization, an approach that is particularly promising for origami design. In addition to internationally renowned leaders in computational design and topology optimization, researchers of current NSF EFRI ODISSEI projects will be invited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the workshop will be on the fundamental principles of origami design. The main goals are to (a) identify the intrinsic challenges of designing structures that fold and unfold at various and across length scales, and (b) explore opportunities for design optimization, in particular topology optimization, to systematically design (unfolding) structures. The workshop will result in a comprehensive understanding of the current capabilities of topology optimization for origami design and the new challenges origami design poses for the design optimization community. The workshop will educate materials, device, and structural design researchers on systematic approaches to origami design, and it will pose novel, exciting problems to the topology optimization community. The workshop will bring together both senior researchers and their graduate students from around the globe, thus planting the seed for new domestic and international collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
