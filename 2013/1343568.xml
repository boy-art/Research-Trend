    <AbstractNarration>This NUE in Engineering Program, entitled "Development of Nanotechnology Minor Focused on Nano Biomedicine and Sustainable Energy", at the University of Cincinnati (UC), under the direction of Dr. Donglu Shi, has as its primary objective the development of a curriculum for a new Nanotechnology Minor degree in the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS). &lt;br/&gt;A sequence of new advanced courses in nano science and technology will be developed to significantly enhance undergraduate engineering education for both traditional and high-tech industries, particularly in biomedical and energy areas. The sequence will include three new courses to be developed: &lt;br/&gt;1. Fundamentals of Nanomaterials; 2. Nanoscience in Biomedicine; and, 3. Nano Devices in Energy Technologies. Along with these courses, three existing courses developed as part of two previous NUE programs will be incorporated in the sequence, which are well stablished and currently offered at UC:20-ENFD 3009,Environmental Aspects of Nanotechnology, (NUE: Integration of Nanoscale Devices and Environmental Aspects of Nanotechnology into Undergraduate Engineering and Science Curricula, NSF award 0939320); 20-ENFD-3008, Introduction to Nanoscale Science and Technology; 20-ENFD-3010L, Experimental Nanoscale Science and Technology, (NUE: Integration of Nanoscale Science and Engineering into undergraduate Curricula, NSF award 0532495). These six courses cover a wide range of critical topics in nano science and technology and compose the proposed curriculum for the Nanotechnology Minor degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project includes developing one of the few Nanotechnology Minor engineering programs in the nation; addressing the national needs in nano-technology education; establishing sustainable collaborations between universities and industry in education and research; facilitating sharing of resources and ideas among interested groups to leverage&lt;br/&gt;technical outcomes in this area; developing a course with advanced energy technology labs as a model for other energy programs in the nation; increasing the number of science and engineering graduates and retaining them in the energy industry; making the experimental modules available to all universities participating in the outreach program; and disseminating our results through publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at national and local meetings. The outreach efforts within the Cincinnati school district will increase the UC enrollment in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
