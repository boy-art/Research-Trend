    <AbstractNarration>Growing renewable generation capacity is leading to unprecedented variability and uncertainty in power system operations, and calls for more flexibility through balancing capacity, market products, and operating procedures. This effort seeks to develop a comprehensive framework and supporting theory to increase power system flexibility by developing the next generation of modeling and control strategies for electricity loads and storage. The major anticipated innovations are (1) new classes of models to characterize renewable generation and electricity demand at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales, (2) new tools to mathematically aggregate electricity loads and storage, (3) control formulations for load and storage that can be executed in real time and used for planning purposes and (4) pricing mechanisms that recognize the unique capabilities of controllable loads and storage and support payments that are equitable with conventional generators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort also aims to broaden awareness of tools to transform power system operations by engaging high school, vocational and university students via problem based learning and interdisciplinary curricula. The outreach efforts will directly address underrepresentation of ethnic groups and women in science and engineering via mentoring and introducing students to emerging energy systems concepts. The major intended outcomes of the proposed research are (1) to reduce transmission capacity needs, (2) to eliminate the need to build dispatchable generation capacity to manage variability and uncertainty from renewable sources and (3) to improve the efficiency of the supply side by reducing the need for combustion-based generation to operate at part load to provide reserves.</AbstractNarration>
