    <AbstractNarration>This award is being used to convene an inaugural workshop to explore the many dimensions of ethics education for the geosciences (GeoEthics). A major goal of this workshop is to begin to develop a community of scholars interested in this topic and to develop the foundations of a GeoEthics curriculum. This workshop will be on the scale of the On the Cutting Edge "emerging theme" workshops, which are designed to be catalytic events to bring together innovators and early adopters to: a) survey, aggregate, organize and disseminate the instructional resources that are currently available, and b) develop work plans for next steps in recruiting and developing additional resources that are needed. The 3.5-day workshop will be held in the summer of 2014 at Montana State University, with ~35 participants from the geoscience research and education communities, as well as the STEM ethics education community. The Science Education Resource Center (SERC) at Carleton College is providing on-line support for the workshop and related content. This workshop is viewed as the first step in developing a more significant program - and related resources - for teaching GeoEthics across the geoscience curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
