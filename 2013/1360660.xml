    <AbstractNarration>HOV Alvin has undergone a major overhaul and upgrade, and has been out of service since December, 2010. The upgrades include: a larger personnel sphere with two additional viewports, which will be capable of diving to 6500m water depth; improved lighting and imaging capability; improved command and control systems; and, an increased science payload capacity. The vehicle is undergoing reinstatement of certification by the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). Following certification, it will be important for the science community to understand what the changes to the vehicle mean in terms of science support capability, especially bottom time, integration with external sensors and equipment, speed over ground, agility of manipulators, video quality, etc.&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a Science Verification Cruise. A team of experience Alvin users will validate the present capabilities of the vehicle in a 10-12 dive program, after which a report will be made available to future Alvin users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planned dive assessments include:&lt;br/&gt;* Direct observations of the deep ocean and seafloor to depths of up to 4500 m;&lt;br/&gt;* HD still and video imaging/documentation of observations;&lt;br/&gt;* Systematic mapping/surveys of seabed and overlying water column (with appropriate sensors);&lt;br/&gt;* Collection of materials and biomass at the seafloor and in the overlying water column (with appropriate samplers);&lt;br/&gt;* Placement/recovery of instruments and landers at the seafloor;&lt;br/&gt;* Efficient Transit time that is scientifically useful between work sites;&lt;br/&gt;* Systematic exploration of regions/habitats/organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Targets dives include: San Diego Trough; Del Mar Methane Seep; OMZ bottom; La Jolla Canyon; Santa Monica Fossil seep; Santa Monica Mounds North; and, Putative hydrothermal venting (Palos Verdes). Personnel transfers are planned during the cruise in order to accommodate as many diverse participants as possible.</AbstractNarration>
