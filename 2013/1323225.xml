    <AbstractNarration>The project expands on a TUES 1 supported project, Authentic Research Experiences in Microbiology (AREM), a classroom laboratory approach, which showed that students involved in a research-based microbiology laboratory course (compared to those in a traditional laboratory course) are less likely to fail the course, show increased confidence in interpreting data, a greater appreciation for scientific research, and are more likely to advance to graduate/professional training. AREM has been institutionalized at Brooklyn College and over 400 students have participated. With this next phase of AREM, faculty from ten 4-yr colleges and four 2-yr colleges of CUNY have committed to introducing similar projects into their introductory biology laboratory courses. The original project engaged undergraduates in studying the urban microbial community. Basic protocols for determining the types of bacteria present in a swab sample from an urban site such as a subway station have been established. Procedures for analysis, including PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, have been established. Funds support faculty training workshops (including technical support for new faculty and inter-campus communication), protocol development and data display. Bioinformatics training is being facilitated by Brad Goodner through the MGAN program, with potential follow-up using Genome Solver, facilitated by Anne Rosenwald; this strategy leverages existing resources. A postdoctoral associate with experience in genomics and bioinformatics is working with students and faculty, developing their understandings of the advantages and limitations of the processes used and helping to insure: rigor in gathering and preparing samples and high-quality analysis of the data generated. An assessment plan has been developed by outside evaluators to measure the efficacy of the research experiences as a way to improve critical thinking and problem solving skills is included in the proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: While there is wide spread agreement on the importance of engaging undergraduates in research, it is not easy to identify projects that can be utilized with large numbers of students. With TUES-I support, the PI has demonstrated that genomic/metagenomic investigation of the urban microbiome is a research project that can be used successfully. By recruiting his colleagues at other CUNY campuses to join in, the PI is in position to transform the biology major system-wide to one that incorporates research thinking. Similar course adoptions could follow nation-wide, analogous to the successful dissemination of the HHMI sponsored and supported Hatfull Phage Hunters project and others of this type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The City University of New York System has a high percentage of students from groups currrently underrepresented in the STEM workforce that would benefit from participation in this program. The PIs are actively engaged in dissemination through participation in ASMCUE, CUR, CUREnet, Genome Solver and GCAT-SEEK. A STEM Support Network is also planned to include faculty and students to share research and exchange ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>
