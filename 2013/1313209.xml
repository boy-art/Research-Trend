    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Academy of Engineering undertakes a consensus study of the status, role, and needs of engineering technology education in the United States. The three goals of the study include an analysis of (1) the 'production' and employment of engineering technicians; (2) employer perceptions regarding engineering technicians that includes the knowledge and skills technicians bring to the workplace; and (3) a description of engineering technology education programs with respect to curriculum, faculty development, partnerships with engineering programs and industry, and outreach to K-12 schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a consensus study, the study committee, appointed by the President of the National Academy of Engineering to assure appropriate expertise and balance, reviews the literature and existing databases, collects some new data via surveys, and synthesizes its findings. Their report undergoes careful peer review. The final peer reviewed report is widely disseminated among the industrial and educational stakeholders and policy makers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings and recommendations of the study raise awareness of engineering technology among educators, policy makers, and funders and promote productive discussion and action among those stakeholders on the steps needed to more effectively and strategically support the education and hiring of individuals with engineering technology skills.</AbstractNarration>
