    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to formulate an effective damage identification approach for complex and large structural systems that are used in buildings and bridge structures. The need for an approach that can reliably and efficiently detect structural damage without extensive manual inspections to monitor the health of civil infrastructure is urgent. The existing methods have focused on the utilization of easily measured but less damage sensitive linear structural acceleration responses but they are not yet adequately reliable for damage identification. This project will focus on the utilization of more damage sensitive and directly measurable dynamic strain responses to develop an approach for reliable damage identification. The study involves a synthesis of strain and acceleration sensor data within a new system identification concept to solve an important problem of national and international interest. The project will also develop methodologies to identify optimal locations of sensors that provide the best data to achieve the most effective damage identification objectives. The methodology will maximize a suitable norm of the Fisher information matrix through the utilization of highly sensitive strain measurements at selected locations to achieve the lowest Cramer-Rao bound often used in the information theory. For the validation of new damage identification schemes, the simulated and laboratory response data obtained for realistic models of buildings and bridges will be used. The main feature of this strain measurement-based health monitoring approach will be its robustness to the measurement errors, analytical efficiency and accuracy for direct implementation on the critical components of civil infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide a solution of a challenging problem for effective damage identification of complex and large structural systems used in modern buildings and bridges. The project will enhance the nation's educational and research infrastructure by advanced training of students. It will provide a much needed technology for efficient and economical interrogation and health monitoring of civil structures. The project results will be made available to practitioners and researchers through technical presentations in professional meetings and conferences, dedicated Internet sites, publication in peer reviewed technical journals, and classroom teaching.</AbstractNarration>
