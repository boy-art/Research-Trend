    <AbstractNarration>DMR-1337567&lt;br/&gt;Stephen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program at NSF supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art magnetometer for education, research training, and the exploration of a host of novel materials. The magnetometer utilizes a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) for magnetic flux detection providing extremely high resolution and a critical characterization tool in the study a broad array of magnetic phenomena in complex materials. Researchers ate Boston College and numerous, regional, external users all engage in substantial materials synthesis and discovery efforts that will, along with their educational activities, tremendously benefit from the acquisition of the magnetometer. In particular, the instrument will support the exploration of the next generation of materials in fields ranging from complex oxides, to catalyst development, to energy harvesting materials, to high temperature superconductors---all of which hold the promise of pushing the frontiers of modern materials discovery. Additionally, the instrument will support undergraduate involvement in leading edge research as well as serve as a tool for stimulating interest in science for underrepresented high school interns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SQUID magnetometer acquired through this award will have an immediate impact in its operation as a user facility to support both research and materials exploration at Boston College and in regional research programs. Fostering this discovery and development of novel materials has both near term and long-term societal significance where advances in materials historically underlie a significant fraction of technological advances. Additionally, the ability to operate this instrument without the loss of liquid helium renders it a high-throughput, low-cost, facility that stands to dramatically amplify its long-term regional scientific output. The ease of access and low-cost operation of the instrument will enable the training of the next generation of research scientists at undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels and provide a critical resource for the discovery of the next generation of functional materials.</AbstractNarration>
