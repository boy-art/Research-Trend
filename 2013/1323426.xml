    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate student learning of physics concepts and topics that are critical to undergraduate physics and engineering programs in thermodynamics and electronics (including electric circuits). The populations under investigation include post-introductory students enrolled in both physics and engineering courses covering similar topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is: (1) systematically analyzing both the content in these parallel courses and content overlap across disciplines; (2) conducting in-depth investigations of student understanding across the disciplines, both before and after relevant instruction. The work draws extensively upon existing conceptual questions from both physics education research (PER) and engineering education research (EER) and is developing new questions informed by the project's ongoing findings; and (3) drawing upon research results to guide the modification and testing of existing instructional materials as well as the development of new materials for use across disciplines. The aim is to compile research-based and research-validated materials well suited for cross-disciplinary use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit : This project expands the interdisciplinary research on conceptual understanding of two topics central to engineering and physics education and for which there is a growing body of literature in PER. Furthermore, this project extends and enhances the in-depth exploration of the learning of physics concepts and ideas by students beyond the introductory level, building upon existing research bases in PER and EER and thereby enhancing the connections between the two education research fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teaching strategies, instructional sequences, and learning tools emphasized in each discipline are in many ways discipline-specific; however, the basic content is similar. Thus, through the comparative work, the project is studying the relationship between learning outcomes and the discipline-specific nature of instruction. The findings can be valuable for all disciplines engaged in thermodynamics and electronics education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is interdisciplinary and has the potential to improve the teaching and learning of both physics and engineering broadly. The careful documentation of differences in the instructional approaches employed, and measured differences in learning outcomes, can serve as a valuable resource for instructors, textbook authors, curriculum developers, education researchers, and governing bodies in both disciplines. This work serves to cross-fertilize discipline-specific and institution-specific efforts to improve student learning and strengthen degree programs. These efforts may also contribute to the development of a more coherent educational experience for undergraduates. The modified instructional materials arising from this work do not require the wholesale adoption of entirely new curricula or pedagogies. They may be flexibly integrated into courses in both disciplines, thereby supporting incremental course transformations and minimizing the barriers to instructional improvements through the adoption of research-validated materials. Finally, this research at the interface between disciplines may also strengthen both education research communities and increase the overall impact of such research on STEM instruction.</AbstractNarration>
