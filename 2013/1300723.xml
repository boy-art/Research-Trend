    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Richard Saykally of the University of California - Berkeley and his graduate research students are investigating structure and dynamics of small clusters of water as well as water clusters containing other atmospherically-abundant molecules (nitrogen, oxygen, and small hydrocarbons). Specifically, Prof. Saykally and his group will probe water clusters produced in the laboratory with modern THz light sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Saykally and his group is to develop a better quantitative understanding of the complex interactions in water. Results of this work could have profound impacts in biology and environmental science. In addition, Prof. Saykally will help to train a new generation of scientists skilled in cutting-edge research. Prof. Saykally and his colleagues are also involved in scientific outreach, including the Math, Science and Engineering Resource Support (MASERS) program, which brings hands-on science activities and science professionals into middle schools in the San Francisco Bay area.</AbstractNarration>
