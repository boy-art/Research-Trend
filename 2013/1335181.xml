    <AbstractNarration>This project will pursue research in understanding interaction between light metal building frame and hard masonry wall through energy absorbing and robust connections under seismic and wind loading. Analytical research will be pursued for initial development of connections. Experimental research will be conducted in the laboratory for viable connections that are configured to transfer wind loads as well as absorb energy to enhance seismic performance. The goal is to develop connections in masonry walls that will work with the metal frame to enhance resistance of the system under multiple hazards. An industrial advisory group will assist in selecting connections for their practicality in construction. The light frame metal buildings are widely used for industrial and commercial buildings; improving resiliency of these buildings will reduce economic losses in hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be accomplished through a series of research tasks that include analytical modeling, experimental testing, development of a design methodology, and evaluation of system performance in multiple hazards. The first task will be to determine connection demands between stiff and flexible elements for seismic and wind events through analytical modeling. The second task will quantify the requisite strength, energy dissipation and connection deformation demands required to achieve enhanced performance. The third task will be design, analysis and comparative evaluation of energy dissipation and robustness of connections through nonlinear finite element analysis. Experimental testing of connections with high performance potential while being economical and constructible will follow. The final task will be assessment of building system for energy absorption capacity and robustness under wind and seismic loading. The education and outreach components include high school students attending Engineering Day, college students mentoring high school students and targeted outreach to professional practice.</AbstractNarration>
