    <AbstractNarration>This project includes organization of the 2013 Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Principal Investigators (PI) meeting. This will be the latest in a series of annual meetings held for CPS program grantees, at which they are able to present research results and collectively identify future research directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber-physical systems use computations and communication deeply embedded in, and interacting with, physical processes to add new capabilities to physical systems. These cyber-physical systems range from the very small to the very large, and can increasingly be found in a wide variety of technologies we use in our daily lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this annual CPS PI meeting is to discuss the latest developments in the field and to help develop ideas for future research. The attendees of this workshop will hear general plenary talks by leaders in the field, then participate in breakout sessions to discuss more specialized aspects. The meeting will feature broad, diverse participation comprising the CPS PI community.</AbstractNarration>
