    <AbstractNarration>This project catalyzes institutional efforts to broaden and enhance the use of evidence-based teaching and learner-centered practices in STEM courses throughout the University of Maine (UMaine). The intellectual merit of this project derives from the collaborative work of a diverse group of STEM education stakeholders including faculty, undergraduates, graduate students, university administrators, and pre- and in-service teachers. Specifically, these collaborators work together to: (1) systematically observe and document the nature of UMaine STEM instruction; (2) establish a program in which faculty members observe each other, discuss observation results, and collaborate on improving instruction in their courses; (3) use observation data to guide the development of a series of university-wide professional development workshops that explicitly target the instructional needs of the faculty; and (4) create a novel program in which experienced undergraduates partner with faculty to implement innovative instructional practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from this project are expected to substantively enhance the research base on institutional change in STEM courses. In particular, a model, university-wide observation program is measuring the extent to which STEM instruction is learner-centered before, during, and after targeted efforts to transform instruction at UMaine. In addition, an in-depth analysis of the impact of the project's faculty peer-observation program on instructional practices is adding to a growing body of work on the use of peer observations for professional development. Finally, project personnel are investigating whether a novel program that pairs undergraduates with faculty leads to the sustained implementation of learner-centered strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implications for university-level professional development arising from this project lay the groundwork for other institutions across the country to develop and implement similar programs to catalyze institutional change. The deliverables developed over the course of this project include: (1) training materials and a model program that can be used to facilitate the systematic collection of data on the prevalence of learner-centered instruction in STEM courses, (2) an analysis of how groups of faculty performing peer observations can promote instructional change, (3) an investigation of a novel model program in which undergraduates partner with faculty to promote effective peer discussion, and (4) a set of multimedia resources expressly designed to help undergraduates prepare for and benefit the most from learner-centered instruction.</AbstractNarration>
