    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Over $100 billion is spent on infrastructure maintenance in America each year. Despite this spending, groups such as the American Society of Civil Engineers rate US infrastructure to be on the D+ level, and the Department of Homeland Security considers "ageing infrastructure" to pose as much of a threat to the nation as terrorism or pandemic. New materials and new technologies, with improved durability and longer service lives, are needed to address this growing infrastructure crisis. The REU site hosted at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and supported by the National Science Foundation's Division of Engineering Education and Centers will focus on developing such materials and technologies. The performance of a variety of conventional and experimental infrastructure materials exposed to deterioration mechanisms will be investigated. Materials of interest include alternative cements, novel asphalt systems, and bio-inspired materials for structural applications; deterioration mechanisms include electrochemical corrosion, frost damage, and fatigue due to mechanical loading. The objective of this research is to identify the fundamental material properties that lead to improved durability in infrastructure materials, ensuring that current and future infrastructure needs can be sustainably supported. An interdisciplinary approach, blending materials science and civil engineering methodologies, will ensure that the fundamental scientific and technical issues are investigated in a holistic, multiscalar manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The nation's infrastructure, including buildings, transportation systems, energy facilities, and other public services, is in a critical state of disrepair. Infrastructure materials with improved durability and longer service lives would lead directly to less frequent maintenance carried out at lower cost; improved safety for the average user and for maintenance personnel; and a reduction in the environmental impact of the built environment through reduced consumption of energy and material resources. The goal of this research is to identify the fundamental scientific principles on which such materials can be developed, ensuring that current and future infrastructure needs can be sustainably met. The results of this research will be applicable in the US as well as globally. A recruitment plan designed specifically for this REU site, based on interpersonal relationships with local institutions, will ensure the participation of a high percentage of students from under-represented groups that would otherwise have limited opportunities for undergraduate research. Programmatic assessment by an experienced third-party evaluator will lead to the continuous improvement of the research program, as well as wide-spread dissemination of the results. Finally, two educators participating in the site will be supported in the development of lesson plans, so that the research conducted can be used to inspire and encourage high school students for years to come.</AbstractNarration>
