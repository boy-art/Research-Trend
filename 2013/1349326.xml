    <AbstractNarration>This project proposes to secure and digitize a collection of fossils at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science (DMNS), accommodating their use as part of the strong suite research and outreach activities at that institution. The fossil vertebrate collection will continue to enhance DMNS exhibits, visitor programming, and educational outreach activities. This project will utilize the Museum's large volunteer program, which unites the public with museum collections to assist with project-related tasks. The collections and their importance will be highlighted in a series of 'Scientists in Action' satellite broadcasts directly from the Museum, connecting scientists with grades 4-12 students. Additionally, underrepresented high school students interested in science careers will work on collections-based research projects through the Museum's successful 'Teen Science Scholars Program', contributing to their success in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science (DMNS) is the largest public natural history museum in the Rocky Mountain region. The Museum houses a rapidly expanding fossil vertebrate collection spanning more than 330 million years of evolution in the Rocky Mountain region and beyond. Over the past 20 years, the collection has experienced the greatest period of growth in its history, with acquisitions outpacing the institution's ability to store, curate, and digitize fossils. Coupled with the completion of a new state-of-the-art collections facility, this project provides support for the digitization of over 56,000 significant vertebrate fossils, increasing accessibility and facilitating research and education. Additional information about the Museum's scientific and outreach missions, as they relate to this project, is publicly available at: www.dmns.org/science/collections/.</AbstractNarration>
