    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the international conference Number Theory at Illinois hosted by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on June 5-7, 2014. The conference will bring together distinguished number theorists to report on current research trends and recent advances in the field, particularly in the areas of analytic, algebraic, and combinatorial number theory, all of which have seen spectacular recent breakthroughs. It will provide an opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to learn about the latest research in these areas, to interact with leading experts in the field, and to gain exposure for their own research through contributed talks. The conference is expected to attract around 150 participants. It will feature about 20 invited speakers representing a broad spectrum of areas in number theory, as well as contributed talks. The proceedings of the conference will be published in a special volume of the International Journal of Number Theory. The grant funds will support the participation of approximately 30 graduate students, recent PhDs, and other research-active faculty without external support, and approximately 9 invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is a central field of mathematics, one that is rich in history, but also serves as the theoretical foundation for important modern day applications such as data encryption and compression. The conference serves as a forum to disseminate recent advances in this field and to exchange ideas and engage in collaborative discussions, thus promoting further advances in this field. The conference will showcase number theory as a lively, attractive, and important area of mathematics to a broad and diverse group of participants, thus helping draw more people into this field. Special efforts are made to encourage participation of graduate students, recent PhDs, and younger researchers who do not have their own support, including women and under-represented minorities. To further encourage and facilitate participation by graduate students and young researchers, a graduate student number theory conference will be held on the University of Illinois campus on the two days preceding the Number Theory at Illinois meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: www.math.illinois.edu/nt2014</AbstractNarration>
