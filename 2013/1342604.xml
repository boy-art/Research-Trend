    <AbstractNarration>Adaptive radiation occurs when one species of organism diversifies into several species that occupy distinct ecological niches. The process is a common generator of biodiversity, yet the genetic changes underlying it have not been documented. Parasites, one of the most diverse groups of organisms on earth, are thought to adaptively radiate as they switch to new species of hosts. This process will be studied using birds and feather lice, which are host specific parasites that spend all of their time on the host's body. Lice will be transferred in controlled experiments between normal and novel species of captive hosts. Evolutionary changes in genomes of the lice will be documented as they undergo adaptive radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work may have implications for basic research, as well as human and animal health. Genomic data will be deposited in public databases. One postdoctoral associate, two Ph.D. students, and several undergraduate students will be trained. Two educational modules demonstrating adaptation by natural selection will be developed for K-12 students: "cryptic critters" (K-6) and "hunker down" (7-12). These modules are cost effective and easy to implement. Their effectiveness will be assessed with assistance from the University of Utah Center for Science and Math Education.</AbstractNarration>
