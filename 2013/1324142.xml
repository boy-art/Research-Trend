    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for an AGU Chapman Conference on post-wildfire runoff and erosion to be held in Estes Park, Colorado in August, 2013. The conference will bring together a multidisciplinary group of researchers, students through senior scientists, working in post-wildfire and erosion response as well as fire-behavior, meso-scale meteorology, soil science, hydrology, geomorphology, and modeling. The conference will have five sessions: post-wildfire response domains; precipitation; infiltration; runoff; soil and sediment erosion and transport. Outcomes from the conference include a pre-conference review paper of current priority research issues facing the post-wildfire community; an AGU monograph of invited and submitted papers; and journal publications on proposed solutions for priority research issues of each topic session. The conference will have strong participation from students and early career researchers.</AbstractNarration>
