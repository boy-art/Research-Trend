    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to hierarchically design bio-composite materials that have outstanding mechanical properties through the paradox of ?strength? from ?weakness? inspired by how natural bone is made. The researchers will therefore seek a more fundamental understanding of these natural materials? intricate hierarchical structures, scale-bridging mechanics, and material components through this award. This will be accomplished through the following research activities: (i) developing an atom-based continuum modeling tool that enables concurrent multiscale modeling and simulation of materials from atomic building blocks to macroscopic systems; (ii) determining a systematic understanding of mechanical behaviors at the interface between proteins and minerals in the collagen fibrils; (iii) establishing the multiscale structure-property relations in bone materials through the concurrent atomistic/continuum investigation of fibril arrays and the osteons structures. By establishing the precise relation between the structural hierarchy and the mechanical properties, and based on the design strategies extracted from bone materials, this research will establish guidelines for bottom-up hierarchal design of engineered bio-composite materials to have high strength, high stiffness and high toughness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will advance the understanding of bio-inspired composites and provide transformative ideas to achieve the goal of synthesizing bio-inspired materials by design, thereby addressing current limitation of synthetic composites. It will also bring new concepts to the fields of materials science, mechanical engineering, and mechanics of materials at various length scales. The results will provide a unique opportunity to establish a multidisciplinary learning and training program that transcends the traditional boundaries between academic disciplines and offers undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, an integrated approach of team research and career development. Moreover, the results will be integrated to improve and enrich existing engineering courses at University of Georgia.</AbstractNarration>
