    <AbstractNarration>The proposal requests Phase II funding for the North Carolina State University (NCSU) and Georgia Tech (GT) to remain as active sites in the Center for Silicon Solar Consortium (SiSoC). NCSU is the lead institution while GIT is a "Partner" site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center's goal is to help reestablish a global leadership role for the US Silicon PV industry by having government together with the solar-electric power industry jointly stimulate high quality university level research and education, while developing an expanded and skilled workforce. The NCSU research center will emphasize materials characterization leading to a fundamental understanding of impact of defects/impurities/mechanical behavior of solar cell materials emphasizing the development of advanced characterization tools to accommodate the various needs of both single- and multi-crystalline Si wafers, thin films and nanoscale PV science and technology. The GT research will focus on reducing the cost of PV generated electricity and designing and fabricating high efficiency solar cells. Their demonstrated expertise in developing low-cost materials and rapid thermal processes for next generation silicon solar cells will provide training and enriching the educational experience of PV knowledgeable students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SiSoC will actively develop a skilled workforce, while meeting the rapidly growing demand for clean energy with an emphasis on minimal environmental impact on our planet. This will be enabled by having other government agencies, together with the solar-electric power industry jointly stimulating high quality university level research and education. The specific scientific results will be widely disseminated through semi-annual SiSoC review meetings, conference presentations, and publications. The research activity will also be amplified through student internships at industry member locations. The PIs plan to hire undergraduates as lab assistance under NSFs REU Program to create an excellent outreach opportunity for underrepresented minorities/women to participate in PV materials research.</AbstractNarration>
