    <AbstractNarration>Abstract IOS 1311393 DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Assessment of Signals in Communication Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication is a cornerstone of animal behavior, mediating disparate interactions such as among predators and prey, parents and offspring, siblings, social groups, and prospective mates, to name a few. Sometimes multiple receivers are able to detect the same set of communication signals, and in these cases communication can be described as occurring within "networks." A major open question in animal behavior is whether signals used in communication networks are interpreted or assessed any differently than in single sender/ single receiver interactions. To address this question, the research team will investigate how signal receivers make direct comparisons among multiple signals. Research will be conducted on a songbird species, the Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina), and will aim to answer two questions; (i) how do females assess prospective mates when sampling multiple males that vary in preferred signal properties? and (ii) how do networks of males respond to territorial intrusions when threat levels as signalled in song varies? This project encompasses both lab and field components, by testing female preferences in an operant paradigm in the lab, and by using playback and a microphone array to test a network response to territorial intrusion in the field. Results from this project will address the hypothesis that relative signal strength can influence both mating decisions and territorial interactions, and could therefore ultimately affect the strength and/or direction of sexual selection. This project presents opportunities to train undergraduate researchers and also generate data suitable for senior theses. Furthermore, the Co-PI organizes a science outreach activity, the "Science Café," (www.oebsciencecafe.org) and findings will be presented by the co-PI to the community at a Café event in 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All data created as a result of this project will be stored in replicate on hard drives subject to regular back-ups, and will be accessible to other researchers via request.</AbstractNarration>
