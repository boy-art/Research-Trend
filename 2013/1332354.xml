    <AbstractNarration>Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) have been considered as alternate for the next generation of displays and illumination devices, which has received great attentions from academia and industries. The proposed project converges at the interface of synthetic organic chemistry, materials science and engineering, semiconductor physics and device engineering to further develop OLEDs. In order to achieve the maximum device efficiency (i.e. converting all of injected electron to photons), it will require emissive materials to harvest all of electron-generated exactions. The knowledge research gain from this project will help to understand the fundamental mechanisms governing the radiative decay process of organic excitons including the emission efficiency and the shape of the emission spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new classes of metal-assisted delay fluorescence materials in this project will significantly contribute to continuing efforts towards developing a cost-effective displays and solid state lighting. The existing phosphorescent emitters require the utilization of heavy metal ions like Iridium, which could be potentially expensive due to their low natural abundance on the earth. On the other hand, metal-assisted delay fluorescence materials could potentially utilize all of electro-generated excitons and rely on more naturally abundant metal elements. Such technology will provide more cost-effective alternative emissive materials for organic displays and solid state lighting.</AbstractNarration>
