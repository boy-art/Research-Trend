    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kit Bowen of Johns Hopkins University and his graduate and undergraduate student researchers are conducting experiments to measure the strength of electron binding to neutral molecules. The results from these experiments are important to other areas of chemistry, including mass spectrometry, enzymology and the chemistry of radiation damage. Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will receive excellent training in experimental physical chemistry. Prof. Bowen also opens his laboratory to urban middle and high school students, exposing these students to state-of-the-art laboratory science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Bowen and his research group are conducting a large number of experiments on atoms and molecules, using laser-based photoelectron spectroscopy. Among the projects being carried out are: (1) the study of electron induced proton transfer; (2) the investigation of diffuse electron states in molecules and clusters including dipole-bound anions and double Rydberg anions; (3) the measurement of the electron affinities of nucleobases. Over the course of these measurements, Prof. Bowen and his students will further develop new experimental tools and methods in cutting-edge gas-phase experimental chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
