    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop metasurfaces for manipulating the phase and wavefront of light with near-unity efficiency for realizing ultra-compact optical elements such as lenses, waveplates, and beam formers. The approach is to use arrays of nanoscale dielectric resonators to form metasurfaces with low absorption loss. High efficiency will be achieved by overlapping electric and magnetic resonances, allowing full control over the amplitude and phase of the transmitted light. This freedom will be employed to realize optical elements as well as metasurfaces for controlling the polarization of light.&lt;br/&gt;This research will result in a better fundamental understanding of how electric and magnetic resonances can be independently manipulated in single high index resonators, yielding new insights into metasurface and low-loss optical antenna design. The role of coupling between resonators will also be determined, allowing a more accurate representation of the desired phase profile and better device performance. Lastly, this research will result in a better understanding of how to manipulate and harness anisotropy in dielectric antennae. &lt;br/&gt;This research will lead to a new class of ultra-compact optical elements which can improve the performance and integration of a wide range of devices such as visible and infrared cameras, polarimetric imagers, and spatial light modulators as well as be an enabling technology for applications such as free-space telecommunications and optical manipulation. The research will have a strong educational and outreach component focused on providing awareness, exposure, and excitement of science to students from all backgrounds and educational levels.</AbstractNarration>
