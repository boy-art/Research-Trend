    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR project's innovation is an interactive widget that takes the knowledge of textbooks, the technology of tablet computers, and the expertise of educators and combines them together with interactive technology. The information gathered may be from in-class work, homework, tests, readings or assessments and are placed in easy-to-read graphs that can be stored and retrieved on command. The information collected can be used to help educators in the classroom, allowing them to customize learning for the classroom as well as individualized student work. School districts can use this information to see where they need to focus their concerns based on their student populations and states can compare themselves against each other so we can see our deficits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/ commercial impact of this innovation reaches out to teachers, students, parents, as well as districts, states and the nation as a whole. Potentially, all schools from pre-school through college and beyond may benefit from this innovation. Publishers of textbooks would be potential subscribers. The technology could be sold to as operating systems and computer formats both domestically and internationally.</AbstractNarration>
