    <AbstractNarration>The research of the planned I/UCRC for Atomically Thin Multifunctional Coatings aims to focus on fundamental understanding of synthesis, integration, properties, processing and scale-up of novel 2D material systems of application importance. The proposed Industry-University partnership plans to build on a foundation of scientific innovation in 2D materials at Penn State and Rice University in such materials as graphene, MoS2, WS2, hBN, and WSxSe1-x. The planned research activities of the center are student-centric, and will include: performing transformational and applied research, developing intellectual property, low cost nano-manufacturing, doing internships at the industry, and undertaking technology transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned I/UCRC will closely coordinate joint activities to involve underrepresented students at all levels of education; for example, through the new Penn State - Millennium Scholars Program, supporting research summer stays at both universities. Undergraduate students will be provided opportunities to take part in ongoing interdisciplinary research in the center. In order to encourage young people to pursue science-technology research, the center will jointly conduct activities such as the Upward Bound Math and Science (UBMS) and leverage ongoing PSU/Rice MRSEC REU and RET programs. The center also intends to generate strategies to remediate current technology drawbacks and spur local and regional economic growth through Penn State's Innovation Park and The Rice Alliance for Technology and Entrepreneurship.</AbstractNarration>
