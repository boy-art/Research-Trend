    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to develop a low-cost silicon-based microsystem technology for real-time monitoring of concentration and size distribution of airborne micro/nano-particles as well as limited composition analysis on such. The envisioned outcome is a new microsystem technology for highly integrated particulate monitoring systems. Such microsystems can be the size of a pen or even smaller and are implemented by assembling a number of batch fabricated silicon components within a small package. The system can sample the surrounding air, separate airborne particles based on their size, measure the individual and/or cumulative mass of particles in each size range, and finally provide information on the water and organic content of the collected particulate matter in each size range. Particle size segregation is performed using micro-orifice cascade impactors while arrays of micro/nanoscale resonating mass balances perform the real time mass measurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon successful development and commercialization, this technology could revolutionize the airborne particulate monitoring industry by enabling real time monitoring of nanoscale airborne particles down to a few nanometers size range using low cost, light weight instruments. Potential applications can be divided into three main categories: 1. Controlled environment/cleanroom monitoring for pharmaceutical and semiconductor industry; 2. Industrial hygiene and particulate exposure monitoring in mines, construction sites, and nanomaterial processing plants; 3. Environmental research and air pollution monitoring. For example, every worker in a cleanroom facility or high particulate processing plant could carry one of the envisioned monitoring instruments for better quality control or health hazard management. Monitoring of air pollution in large metropolitan areas is another area that could be highly impacted by this technology.</AbstractNarration>
