    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Chemistry at the University of Saint Francis (USF) is implementing an S-STEM project entitled Roger Bacon Scholars (RB Scholars). Two cohorts of nine students each are supported for up to four years as they complete undergraduate degrees in biology, chemistry, science and entrepreneurship, environmental science or mathematics. The RB Scholars program strengthens links between the university and employers from various sectors - industry, government and non-profit institutions. All of the program's activities are designed to support efforts in northeast Indiana to focus on STEM-based employment for future economic strength. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical features of the project's implementation rely on several support mechanisms to foster student success. These include peer and professional tutoring, mentoring by faculty members and industry partners, networking with alumni for internships and career advice, and graduate school and career counseling by faculty members and the university's Career Services Office. RB Scholars also have the opportunity to engage in individual and cohort experiences, and as a part of a senior-level capstone course, they develop project-based learning (PBL) activities for K-12 students building upon the knowledge gained through those experiences. The capstone project also promotes communication, collaboration, critical thinking and creativity while providing outreach to future science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors. Through these K-12 PBL projects, RB Scholars influence the next generation of STEM students.</AbstractNarration>
