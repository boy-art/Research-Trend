    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Timothy M. Korter of Syracuse University and his graduate student and colleagues are investigating analytical spectroscopic methods for investigating crystalline polymorphs of molecular solids. The production of crystalline polymorphs in pharmaceutical formulations is increasingly important, yet the methods for analyzing these differing crystalline forms are still in their infancy. Progress in this area could yield to improved formulations in the pharmaceutical industry. The young scientists working on this project will receive training in modern methods in experimental and computational chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Korter and his group will combine computational chemistry approaches as well as state-of-the-art Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to probe the vibrations of molecules in crystals. The fundamental aim of this work is to develop an improved understanding in the subtle ways that complex molecules interact in the solid phase, with the goal of developing a better understanding of existence and underlying processes that give rise to crystalline polymorphism.</AbstractNarration>
