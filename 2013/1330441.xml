    <AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;Peroxisomes and mitochondria are ubiquitous, multifunctional, and highly dynamic organelles that mediate a variety of metabolic functions in eukaryotes. In plants, these organelles together with chloroplasts are essential to energy production and metabolism. The abundance and morphology of mitochondria and peroxisomes are highly regulated to adapt to the need of a plant. Among components of the organelle division machineries, the Arabidopsis dynamin-related proteins DRP3A and DRP3B are key mediators for the fission of both mitochondria and peroxisomes. This project further investigates the molecular mechanisms that control organelle dynamics, focusing on the post-translational regulation of the function of DRP3 by protein phosphorylation and by a phospholipid, cardiolipin, whose function is largely unknown in plants. This research addresses a fundamental question in eukaryotic biology in a quantitative manner, using in vivo and in vitro approaches and combining genetic, cell biological and biochemical strategies. Knowledge will be integrated from single proteins and lipids to sub-cellular machineries and plant development. Given the essential roles of peroxisomes and mitochondria in plant development and energy metabolism, this study will have agricultural and economical relevance, as knowledge gained may provide molecular basis for developing strategies for rational engineering of plant metabolism, bioenergy production, and defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;Personnel on the project will participate in training undergraduate and high school students in summer research, outreaching to local schools, and providing educational opportunities to the scientific and broader communities through lectures. The PI will remain active in including women and individuals from underrepresented groups in the project.</AbstractNarration>
