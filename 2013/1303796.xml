    <AbstractNarration>The Alfred Renyi Institute of Mathematics, together with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Eotvos Lorand University and the Janos Bolyai Mathematical Society are organizing a conference in the summer of 2013 to celebrate the 100th birthday of Paul Erdos, one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century. The conference will be held July 1-5, 2013, in Budapest, Hungary, in the historical building of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. There will be only invited talks by outstanding mathematicians who will create a scientic program with intellectual merit on a par with Erdos's incredible research achievements. Invited speakers who have accepted our invitation include several winners of the Fields Medal, Wolf Prize, Nevanlinna Prize, and other major prizes. One of our underlying goals, in addition to honoring Paul Erdos, is to bring together these exceptional researchers and study the relationships between their work and Erdos's work. We are confident that the meeting will inspire new insights and further collaborations from these "mathematical giants". There is no doubt that Erdos's work will continue to be the source of beautiful developments in mathematics and in other fields.</AbstractNarration>
