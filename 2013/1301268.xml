    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to investigate both the manufacturing process and properties of polymer-nanoporous metal bilayers. Nanoporous (NP) metals are a unique class of materials that are characterized by very high surface-to-volume ratios and possess such desirable properties of metals as high electrical conductivity and strength. The abundance of free surfaces is thought to give rise to many of the unusual properties of NP metals, including the ability to actuate in response to various external stimuli. These materials have shown great promise in many applications, including small-scale sensors and actuators. In this work, polymer-NP metal bilayers will be manufactured through nano-scale self-assembly processes with the ultimate goal of obtaining compliant, responsive, and functional three dimensional heterostructures. Heterostructures are structures made of different materials to obtain new properties. Specifically, this work will explore how mismatched strains affect the self-assembly of NP metals on polymer substrates, as well as the overall morphology of the structure. The response and fatigue behavior of the self-assembled heterostructures under different stimuli will be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research can lead to fundamental advances in understanding of the role of interfacial mismatching of strains and how they can be tuned to manufacture functional 3D macro-, micro-, or nano-scale objects with nano-size features. Both the manufacturing technology and the specific structures considered in this proposal may potentially impact a wide variety of technological areas. For example 3D structures responsive to different external stimuli can be used as sensors, actuators, switches, vesicles for delivery and filtrating applications, etc. Integration of research, teaching, and outreach programs across multiple disciplines including polymer science, nanotechnology, and manufacturing will impact the education and training of a diverse student body at graduate, undergraduate, and high-school levels.</AbstractNarration>
