    <AbstractNarration>A team of faculty and administrators at St. Edwards University is increasing the number of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn baccalaureate degrees in the bioinformatics, environmental and forensic chemistry, computer science, and mathematics. The Rewarding Achievement in Mathematics and Science (RAMS) project is providing 14 scholarships to students who are being retained as STEM majors through participating in a close-knit community of learners. This student cohort is developing academically and socially through an array of support mechanisms, including: (a) a first year seminar, (b) supplemental instruction and peer-led team learning, (c) a science living and learning community, (d) the Science Speakers Series, (e) summer research, and (f) internships with local industrial partners. The PI team is recruiting from a diverse pool of students in which 35% of their STEM majors are Hispanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is generating a broad impact in two ways. First, data generated through assessment and evaluation is supporting the rationale that high retention of students in STEM fields can be achieved through a comprehensive program of student development that emphasizes community-building. Formative and summative evaluation is focusing on assessment of the project's ability to recruit, retain, and graduate students. Secondly, dissemination of the project results is providing a model for retaining students in the STEM fields by integrating them into a close-knit community of learners. The project team is presenting their work throughout their many regional and national consortia including the New American Colleges and Universities, the Texas Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and the Catholic Colleges and Universities of Texas.</AbstractNarration>
