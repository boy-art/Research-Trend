    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 13-38118 Collaborative Proposal #: 13-37866&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Makedon, Fillia S PI(s): Betke, Margrit&lt;br/&gt;Athitsos, Vassilis; Gatchel, Robert J; Huang, Heng; Romero-Ortega, Mario I&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Texas-Arlington INstitution: Boston Univeristy &lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI/Dev :Collab Dev. of iRehab, an Intelligent Closed-loop Instrument for Adaptive Rehabilitation&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, developing of an instrument referred to as iRehab, aims to enable personalized rehabilitation therapy for individuals suffering from brain injury, motor disabilities, cognitive impairments, and/or psychosocial symptoms. The instrument, a modular rehabilitation device, in its simplest form consists of a computer, a camera, and adaptive software for assessment and training of cognitive functions. In its final, most complex form, the instrument will integrate data from a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic-arm with gimbals and torque sensing, a Kinect sensor, multiple cameras, an eye-tracking device, a touch screen, a microphone, and an fNIRS brain imaging sensor. &lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be developed in two phases. In the first phase, the investigators develop a Barrett robot arm. In the second phase, the instrument will extend to a Kinect sensor, multiple cameras, an eye-tracking device, and related low-cost components, along with the assessment software for assessing motor function and cognitive, emotional, and personality functioning. &lt;br/&gt;iRehab consists integrates multidisciplinary methodologies and sensors to assess and assist the cognitive and physical rehabilitation of persons affected by various impairments. This work highly interdisciplinary work follows a cyber-physical approach. It provides new research opportunities across the fields of human-centered computing, computer vision, assistive technology, robotics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. This work advances research in human brain activity mapping, personalized medicine, and big data.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed instrument exhibits potential for large broader impact as it directly contributes to future healthcare and human wellbeing improving accessibility to affordable rehabilitation for a broad range of patients. The instrument is likely to accelerate the recovery of a large spectrum of injuries and diseases including those causing motor, neurological, and cognitive disorders. An education plan includes course development, internships, workshops and tutorials, and an on-line resource center. In addition to many educational impacts, impact will be felt on the fundamental research in the areas addressed.</AbstractNarration>
