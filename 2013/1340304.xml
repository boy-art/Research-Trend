    <AbstractNarration>The proposed work is an empirical investigation to explore the effectiveness of the Self-&lt;br/&gt;Determination Theory (SDT) in the context of undergraduate engineering education. It is&lt;br/&gt;hypothesized that there is a disconnect between the principles outlined in SDT and the actual&lt;br/&gt;classroom environment, thus creating a barrier to intrinsic motivation needed for student learning.&lt;br/&gt;Accordingly, the primary objectives will be to (i) assess the Faculty knowledge of SDT; (ii) develop&lt;br/&gt;a measurement framework to assess the classroom environment as it relates to SDT; and (iii)&lt;br/&gt;determine the association among Faculty knowledge of SDT, student motivation, learning&lt;br/&gt;environment, and student learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design and measurement framework are developed through a meaningful collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between the researchers from Engineering, Psychology, and Education. This takes advantage of&lt;br/&gt;current standards and techniques employed in the field of Social-Cognitive Psychology. The&lt;br/&gt;research questions answered through this project are valuable in developing reform strategies for&lt;br/&gt;engineering education, and can also serve as a future model for other STEM disciplines. The&lt;br/&gt;broader objectives of the project support the NSF?s strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by&lt;br/&gt;preparing a better engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Also the NSF goal of&lt;br/&gt;innovating for society is achieved by producing research-based results that may be useful in&lt;br/&gt;informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
