    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the Kalamazoo Scholars Program is to improve the success of students who are traditionally-underrepresented in STEM and to increase the diversity of the scientific workforce. The program builds on Kalamazoo College's success in attracting and retaining students in the natural sciences and mathematics and seeks to increase the likelihood that first-generation and underrepresented minority students with financial need will pursue careers and advanced degrees in STEM. To achieve these objectives, Kalamazoo College will award scholarships and provide academic and professional development support to two cohorts of 12-13 students majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, physics, or engineering. Students in the program will have academic experiences common to all Kalamazoo students: broad training in the liberal arts, international engagement, in-depth study in an academic major, and a capstone research experience. In addition, Kalamazoo Scholars will engage in research-based practices shown to increase the persistence and success of students in STEM, beginning with a pre-orientation program, a "Science in the World" first-year seminar cluster, and peer mentoring, and continuing with weekly mentoring lunches with faculty, STEM leadership activities, early research experiences, internships and other career and professional development activities. The leadership experiences embedded in the program will also influence other STEM students on campus and younger students, often underrepresented minorities, in the community.</AbstractNarration>
