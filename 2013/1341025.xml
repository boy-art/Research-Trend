    <AbstractNarration>Advanced modern scholarly and scientific research increasingly requires the use of a high-performance networks and related services. Building such a utility service across a legacy campus network encounters significant challenges difficulties due to inadequate existing components, complex security provisions, poor reliability, high latency, and lack of ease-of-use. In response to this burgeoning need, the Campus Advanced Research Network Environment (CARNE) project is creating a scalable, incrementally deployable scienceDMZ-based infrastructure for an unencumbered high-performance network with low-latency paths and software defined networking for flexibility. The perimeter of the network has appropriate security and access control policies and performance and monitoring facilities. Contributions from this research are transformative and include the design of an infrastructure for: ease of use; zero packet loss; testing and measurement of security and performance using Bro - a locally enhanced intrusion detections system - and PerfSONAR; separating science from security policy and control; and improving agility and flexibility while reducing network management overhead. Monitoring of the infrastructure will allow traces, statistics, and analysis that document the use of the network by a large clientele of scholars and scientists.  The broader impact of the proposed high-bandwidth infrastructure is in providing a road map to enhance scholarly research and education throughout universities. Better connectivity will enhance advanced discovery classes as well as promote teaching and learning. Universities can leverage this infrastructure in their active outreach to many schools, community colleges, and surrounding communities.  CARNE will reach out to vulnerable populations, which will benefit socio-economically by having direct access to research deliverables developed at the University of Illinois.</AbstractNarration>
