    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Stephen R. Leone of the University of California - Berkeley and his graduate student researchers are investigating the fundamental processes that govern chemical reactivity, namely how electrons in molecules move, and how the movement of these electrons influences the movement of the heavier nuclei. In doing these experiments, Prof. Leone and his group are developing new tools and methods for conducting these studies, based upon attosecond lasers. Graduate students working on this project will receive training in experimental physical chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Leone and his research group are conducting experiments on atoms and molecules, using attosecond laser-based methods. Among the projects being carried out are: (1) the study of attosecond dynamics of strong-field ionization in atoms; (2) the investigation of coherences in doubly-charged ions and a study of the phases of electronic coherences; (3) the exploration of alignment in sequential and nonsequential double ionization of atoms; (4) the detection of electron reconfiguration of the ion core during tunnel ionization; (5) the study of spin-orbit state superposition in methyl bromide; (6) an investigation of charge migration in the strong-field ionization of a series of 1-bromo, n-iodo alkanes (where n is the length of the alkane); and (7) the study of the dissociation of bromine in mixed electronic states. Over the course of these measurements, Prof. Leone and his students will further develop new experimental tools and methods in attosecond chemical dynamics, a domain in which the US has lagged until recently.</AbstractNarration>
