    <AbstractNarration>The ability to monitor gas molecules in a patients breath would open up significant opportunities to improve the treatment and management of a variety of diseases. The focus of this EAGER proposal is to design a wireless, peptide-immobilized diamond film-based electronic sensor on SiO2 and to demonstrate the feasibility by sensing of acetic acid. Various gas molecules have been identified as disease biomarkers, such as acetone for diabetes, acetic acid for asthma, ammonia for real-time clinical status of patients during haemodialysis. Diamond has a wide electrochemical potential window, a low and stable background current, long-term response stability, biocompatibility, great fouling resistance, and chemical inertness; it is an ideal material for electronic sensors. Peptide bioreceptors are of particular interest for use with electronic sensors, since they are robust biorecognition molecules with broad chemical diversity. The PI will first fabricate the wireless diamond sensor by integrating a diamond electrode with wireless telemetry on SiO2. Then, the PI will synthesize and immobilize an acetic acid-diamond bifunctional peptide onto the diamond. The PI has recently identified a diamond-binding peptide, and an acetic acid binding peptide has been reported in literature. PI proposes to investigate and exploit the sensing behavior of the device as it monitors acetic acid molecules, collect the impedance signal for the wireless detection of acetic acid, and use the slope of impedance vs. time graph for continuous monitoring of different concentrations of acetic acid. The goal is to investigate the sensitivity and selectivity of the device, as well as the sensing response time and saturation time. The success of this proposal will lead to the development of a variety of wireless, flexible, diamond-based biomimetic nanosensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This work will fill critical gaps in understanding interactions between the gas molecules and the peptide-functionalized diamond electronics. It will also enhance fundamental knowledge of diamond-based bioelectronics. The objective of this project is to create a transformative approach to enable continuous, real-time, and selective monitoring of trace amounts of gas molecules. The proposed research will advance healthcare monitoring options, thereby improving the treatment and management of a variety of diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, and asthma. The work will deepen the understanding of wireless diamond bioelectronics and provide a prototype demonstration for the further development of a variety of wireless, flexible diamond-based biomimetic nanosensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide significant opportunities to improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases through the development of enabling technology for continuous, sensitive, and selective monitoring of gases. The success of this EAGER proposal will venture into emerging research concepts regarding the creation of a variety of wireless, flexible diamond biomimetic nanosensors. The proposed research will promote the participation of high school students, undergraduate, and graduate students, specifically targeting women and underrepresented groups through ongoing activities.</AbstractNarration>
