    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This project will address several fundamental questions relevant to how the quantum electronic behavior of electrons in isolated atoms are modified in the presence of other atoms, and to what extent that behavior can be controlled and manipulated using lasers and electric fields. The experiments will utilize ultra-cold gases of atoms with one highly-excited "Rydberg" electron. Such atoms are useful because: they are particularly sensitive to neighboring atoms; the motion of electrons within them is sufficiently slow that it can be probed with very brief laser pulses; and the relative positions of the atoms themselves can be strongly influenced by the forces between atoms. One experiment will attempt to induce electronic motion in one atom and establish conditions where that motion can be spontaneously transferred to an electron in a neighboring atom. Another will explore the conditions in which a group of excited atoms act as a single quantum mechanical unit, emitting radiation collectively rather than individually. Further work will utilize lasers to induce transient repulsive interactions between pairs of atoms, preventing hard collisions between them, and possibly creating ordered atomic arrays that mimic condensed matter systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Results from the project have the potential to impact fundamental science in several active research areas outside of atomic physics, including condensed matter physics, quantum information, and quantum control. Beyond these scientific connections and associated applications, the greatest near-term societal benefit of the project will be the education of the participating graduate and undergraduate students. Students involved in the project will gain valuable experience with state-of-the-art laser equipment and techniques as well as training in scientific ethics and methodology. They will develop written and oral presentation skills, and travel to conferences where they will present and defend their results as well as establish professional contacts. They will participate in group meetings and develop group problem solving skills in the laboratory. Moreover, their interactions with chemistry and engineering students, postdocs, and faculty in a shared multi-disciplinary laser laboratory will provide opportunities to learn about laboratory techniques used in other disciplines, as well differences in scientific cultures, language and terminology. These young women and men are the next generation of scientists and engineers. Their experiences with the project will enable them to contribute to laser, photonics, and other industries; develop new technologies for national defense and security applications; and/or educate another generation of scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
