    <AbstractNarration>Rapid development of large-scale data collection technology has&lt;br/&gt;ignited research into high-dimensional machine learning. For&lt;br/&gt;instance, the problem of designing recommender systems, such as those&lt;br/&gt;used by Amazon, Netflix and other on-line companies, involves&lt;br/&gt;analyzing large matrices that describe users' behavior in past&lt;br/&gt;situations. In sociology, researchers are interested in fitting&lt;br/&gt;networks to large-scale data sets, involving hundreds or thousands of&lt;br/&gt;individuals. In medical imaging, the goal is to reconstruct&lt;br/&gt;complicated phenomena (e.g., brain images; videos of a beating heart)&lt;br/&gt;based on on a minimal number of incomplete and possibly corrupted&lt;br/&gt;measurements. Motivated by such applications, the goal of this&lt;br/&gt;research is to develop and analyze models and algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;extracting relevant structure from such high-dimensional data sets in&lt;br/&gt;a robust and scalable fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research leverages tools from convex optimization, signal&lt;br/&gt;processing, and robust statistics. It consists of three main thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Model restrictiveness: Successful methods for high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;data exploit low-dimensional structure; however, many real-world&lt;br/&gt;problems fall outside the scope of existing models. This proposal&lt;br/&gt;significantly extends the basic set-up by allowing for multiple&lt;br/&gt;structures, leading to computationally efficient algorithms while&lt;br/&gt;eliminating negative effects of model mismatch. (2) Non-ideal data:&lt;br/&gt;Missing data are prevalent in real-world problems, and can cause major&lt;br/&gt;breakdowns in standard algorithms for high-dimensional data. The&lt;br/&gt;second thrust devises relaxations and greedy approaches for these&lt;br/&gt;non-convex problems. (3) Arbitrary Outliers: Gross errors can arise&lt;br/&gt;for various reasons, including fault-prone sensors and manipulative&lt;br/&gt;agents. The third thrust proposes efficient and randomized algorithms&lt;br/&gt;to address arbitrary outliers.</AbstractNarration>
