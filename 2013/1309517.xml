    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop "optical wings" that allow the controlled transport of objects through space and liquids using radiation pressure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit combines optical and aerodynamic design principles to achieve rotationally stable flight. The transformative idea is that by controlling shape and optical properties, efficient and stable optical wings can be made into practical devices for use in air, water, and outer space. The proposed research holds the potential to find all-optical means of navigating large solar sails for future space travel, with the promise of lighter weight sail-crafts compared to those requiring mechanical controls. Smaller earth-bound optical wings may be used to transport tissues in a buoyant liquid environment, or to scuttle micro-machines across a horizontal surface in air. As the Wright brothers discovered, mastering rotational stability is the paramount concern for controlling flight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are (1) advanced warning times for solar storms, (2) low-cost high-speed space missions, (3) microscopic transport techniques for use in biological and materials science, (4) opto-mechanical sensors for use in bio-medicine or chemical detection. Students, ranging from the graduate to the high school level, will participate in this research and thereby develop practical hands-on experiences in the laboratory as well as computer, technical writing, and scientific presentation skills. These efforts provide a path and a vision for younger students to strive for high goals in an encouraging environment, as well as opportunities for advanced students to develop experimental and analytical multidisciplinary skills in optics, micro-fabrication, and aerodynamics.</AbstractNarration>
