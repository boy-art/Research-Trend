    <AbstractNarration>Fort Valley State University (FVSU) will address the undersupply of professionals trained in renewable energy and efficiency through the National Science Foundation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU-UP) Undergraduate Program's 36-month Targeted Infusion Project. FVSU, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU), through this project will address regional and global issues in the biofuel industry through its curriculum development and revision to incorporate multidisciplinary courses in bioenergy, e. g., policy development, biotechnology, bioeconomy, fuel conversion in providing students and faculty cutting edge research opportunities and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professional development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 100 students will participate in the research and educational courses during the three-year duration of the project. Collaborations with Iowa State University's Department of Biosystems Engineering, the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, Delaware State University?s Center for Integrated Biological and Environmental Research and the South Dakota State University College of Agriculture and Biological Sciences, among other prominent research institutions, provides broad opportunities for this minority-serving institution (MSI) to offer cutting-edge research opportunities to project participants. The impact from the project's implementation uniquely addresses the regional needs contributing to the enhancement of rural economic development and green industry in the South and the nation in addition to contributing to a diverse STEM workforce in the bioenergy sciences.</AbstractNarration>
