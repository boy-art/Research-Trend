    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Massachusetts, Boston, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014-2016. Students will conduct intensive research in genetics, cell biology, evolution, and ecology with the overall theme of integrative and evolutionary biology. Research projects span biological problems at various scales from molecular to population-level. Modern tools of genomics and informatics are used to investigate biological problems dealing with cell signaling, control of cellular organization, microbial ecology, genome organization, evolution in the deep seas, and ecosystem function. Students are paired with Biology Department faculty based on mutual scientific interests. The research experiences are complemented by enrichment activities that promote a sense of community, enhance communication skills, and address broader issues concerning the practice of science. These include weekly workshops focusing on the ethical conduct of research, scientific communication, and preparation for graduate school. Educational field trips including to the Nantucket Island Field Station are planned. Students are selected based on their ability to gain from the experience, motivation, research potential, and maturity. Students from underrepresented groups and students from primarily undergraduate institutions are especially encouraged to apply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. By providing a full-immersion research experience, close mentoring, and a supportive scientific community, the program helps prepare students for advanced study in biology and increase the diversity of the research workforce. The program will be assessed with the BIO REU common assessment tool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.
