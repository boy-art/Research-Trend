    <AbstractNarration>Over the last 20 years, the technology and methods of adaptive optics have revolutionized observational astronomy at optical and infrared wavelengths by delivering dramatically sharper images, images corrected to some degree for the blurring effects of the earth's atmosphere. These sharper images enable a range of new science, and enhance the efficiency of many kinds of observations. Traditionally, the beneficial effects of adaptive optics are achieved only over a somewhat limited field of view on the sky. This project will extend that range and deliver much larger adaptively corrected fields of view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new approach to adaptive optics is called ground-layer adaptive optics (GLAO). It builds on recent measurements showing that wavefront phase variances on Mauna Kea are correlated over fields of at least half a degree. The approach is to correct for the wavefront aberrations that arise close to the ground. Site survey data indicate that GLAO can be extended to fields potentially 1 square degree in extent, or more than 3 orders of magnitude larger than those of a classical adaptive optics system. The scientific impact of much larger adaptively corrected fields coupled with high angular resolution will enabling dramatically more sensitive and efficient wide-field survey-style projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These developments will produce experience and techniques that will influence the design of GLAO systems for future facility-class systems, including those that will be used on the next generation of 30-meter telescopes. The project will be a training ground for students, and will undoubtedly inspire the public with exquisite images. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>
