    <AbstractNarration>This project consists of a study of differential and difference equations and their generalizations through the lens of model theory in the sense of mathematical logic, attacks on difficult problems in arithmetic dynamics using multiple model theoretic ideas, and a fundamental investigation into decidability in geometry and arithmetic. In their many applications, differential and difference equations describe the evolution and dynamics of complex systems. Various methods, computational and analytic, for example, are commonly employed to understand and solve these equations. With this project, ideas from algebra and logic, especially related to the principles of definability and tameness of structure, will be used to understand differential and difference equations. This basic research should have consequences in mathematics and the sciences broadly due to the importance of differential and difference equations in the applications of mathematics to the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concretely, with regards to differential equations, this project will extend the fundamental model theoretic results about differential fields to the class of D-fields in a more expansive sense. Secondly, the project involves a study of the fine structure of definability and dependence in D-fields. In particular, the project will extend the Zilber trichotomy (or, at least, results of a similar flavor) to infinite dimensional types, and, thus, specializing to classical theories, to underdetermined difference-differential, partial differential, and Hasse differential equations. Moreover, a goal of the project is an explicit characterization the induced structure on sets with trivial forking geometry. Thirdly, the project will develop a theory of specializations of D-rings through a model theory of valued D-fields. Fourthly, the project includes a development of general D-Galois theories based on multiple model theoretic perspectives. Finally in connection to D-fields, the project includes an ambitious application of the theory of D-fields which may have transformative consequences; that is, to realize Borger's F-1-geometry as the study of finite dimensional definable sets relative to a certain theory of D-rings. With regards to diophantine geometry, the project will address Zhang's dense orbit conjecture and the dynamical Mordell-Lang through the model theory of difference fields and methods from o-minimality. The project includes a program establish the decidability of complicated fragments of the theory of C(t), the field of rational functions over the complex numbers.</AbstractNarration>
