    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Joel Rosenthal of the University of Delaware will develop new catalyst platforms for the activation and interconversion of small molecule species. Processes that have energy consequences will be targeted. This research will focus on the synthesis and study of new tetrapyrrole complexes with unusual photophysical and multielectron redox properties. These systems will be thoroughly examined by a combination of X-ray crystallography, voltammetry and several types of electronic spectroscopy. Electrochemical and chemical reduction methods will be used to probe the ability of the tetrapyrrole complexes to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction and the conversion of carbon dioxide to chemical fuels. This CAREER award also supports outreach to improve the accessibility of inorganic chemistry and energy science to high school students via summer research internships at the University of Delaware. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the development of inexpensive catalysts that can promote renewable energy conversion and production of fuels from carbon dioxide. Additionally, the project will provide mentorship, education and training of a new generation of individuals in order to prepare them for the scientific and societal challenges of the 21st century. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the development of new inorganic platforms that can drive chemical transformations that are important for energy storage and conversion. To meet this challenge, new metal complexes that are less expensive and easier to obtain than conventional ones will be prepared, characterized and studied. This research will also demonstrate the ability of these inexpensive molecular platforms to promote the challenging bond making and breaking processes that are required in chemical conversions involving small molecules. Some specific goals include developing catalysts for the conversion of carbon dioxide into fuels.</AbstractNarration>
