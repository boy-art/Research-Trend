    <AbstractNarration>RAPID: Stratigraphic architecture and sedimentology of the early Cambrian Maotianshan Shale&lt;br/&gt;Michael Hofmann, University of Montana&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1338441&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by NSF's Section of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;PI will travel to and conduct field research in the Yunnan Province, China, to document and sample a newly discovered exposure of the Maotianshan Shale interval in the Jianshan quarry. This project is urgent, because the exposure will be removed in April 2013 when mining resumes. This laterally continuous outcrop exposes the entire Maotianshan Shale interval over several hundred meters, making it a unique study site to address many of the sedimentologic and stratigraphic uncertainties associated with the Maotianshan Shale deposition and fossil preservation. In addition to salvaging the fossil fauna, PIs plan to systematically describe the overall stratigraphy of the Maotinashan Shale and to document the detailed rock fabrics and sedimentology. In particular they will focus on the fossil bearing layers in order to test the hypothesis that mesopycnal flows in a stratified marginal marine basin contributed to the exceptional preservation of the Changjiang Fauna. Working with Chinese colleagues and their students, the university of Montana graduate student will experience synergistic, interdisciplinary research and international collaboration in geology.</AbstractNarration>
