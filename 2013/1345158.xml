    <AbstractNarration>The 9th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies&lt;br/&gt;(CoNEXT) will take place from December 9th to 12th in Santa Barbara, CA. CoNEXT is a highly selective (&lt;20%), high-quality conference sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM). The conference is a major forum for presentation and discussion of novel networking protocols and technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests funds to partially support the travel of 20 US-based graduate students. The support amount will be $1,000 or the actual documented amount of expenses, whichever is less. Each student will need to cover expenses in excess of the fixed amount from other funds. If students spend less than the $1,000 limit the surplus funds will be used to support students from under-represented institutions. Preference in the award of the travel grants will be given to students who have their work accepted to the CoNEXT student workshop which will take place the first day of the conference. Other criteria will include evidence of a serious interest in networking, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. The PI will especially encourage women and under-represented groups to participate.</AbstractNarration>
