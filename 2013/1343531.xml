    <AbstractNarration>This award supports student participation in XII International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) School/Workshop on Instrumentation in Elementary Particle Physics to be held at the Universidad de Los Andes (UNIANDES), Bogota, Colombia, from November 25 through December 6, 2013. The XII ICFA School/Workshop is one of the regular series of schools held approximately every two years in countries outside of the highly industrialized parts of the world, which are Western Europe, the United States, Canada, and Japan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICFA Schools provide an outstanding opportunity for young research students at the graduate level to learn the latest in state of the art techniques in instrumentation and to meet and develop contacts and links with their peers in an international setting that benefits all geographic regions. Members of the ICFA Instrumentation Panel serve as the international advisors for all ICFA Schools/Workshops, ensuring that the quality of the scientific program meets very high standards as evidenced by the success of the previous workshops in this series. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICFA schools are broader impacts in action. U.S. physicists working in the field of high energy physics find themselves working in an international setting wherever they are based. Working side by side in the laboratory exercises with students from all over the world gives U.S. students international experience at an early stage in their careers. These early peer contacts are invaluable in developing future scientific collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The XII ICFA School is supported by the Elementary Particle Physics Program with co-funding from the ISE Global Venture Fund of the Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>
