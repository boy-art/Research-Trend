    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Francisco Zaera of the University of California, Riverside is investigating the molecular processes by which hydrocarbons are converted from one compound to another on the surface of a metal, also termed catalysis. The catalysis of hydrocarbon conversion reactions is central to many industrial processes, including oil refining, fine chemical synthesis, and food processing. One of the major challenges in catalysis is to achieve high selectivity for one product over all other potential products, which would avoid wasting feedstocks and would minimize the production of polluting byproducts. It has been shown that, in some catalysis on metal surfaces, selectivity may be controlled through variations in the atomic level structure of the surface, and this control offers new avenues for the design of highly desirable industrial processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Professor Zaera focuses on testing specific examples where hydrocarbon conversion may be controlled by using metal nanoparticles with specific shapes. Three complementary experimental approaches are being used: a high-flux molecular beam to obtain accurate kinetic parameters for model metal samples with different structures under controlled environments, an operando arrangement for the in-situ characterization of corresponding adsorbed species by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and a reactor for the kinetic and IR characterization of more realistic catalysts made out of metal nanoparticles with specific shapes dispersed on high-surface-area supports. This project involves the training of graduate students, with an emphasis in recruiting students from groups underrepresented in science research fields by taking advantage of the several international outreach activities. The broader impacts of this project also include the potential development of cleaner catalytic processes for energy and other applications.</AbstractNarration>
