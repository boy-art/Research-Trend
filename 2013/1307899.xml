    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Measurements and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry supports Prof. Darryl Bornhop of Vanderbilt University to enhance understanding and extend application of backscattering interferometry (BSI) to investigate molecular interactions that are difficult to study by other methods. Dr. Bornhop's group is further demonstrating that BSI can be used for quantifying the influence of immobilization and structural modifications on molecular interaction binding affinity, and for studying interactions and chemical reactions in complex milieu. The research seeks to expand on defining the BSI signal generation mechanism, aiming to quantify the roles of changes in conformation and hydration resulting from a molecular interaction. The potential to define interaction mechanism of action by incorporating BSI signal directionality will also be investigated. Efforts on BSI performance optimization are planned to aid in translation of the technology to the broader scientific community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By enabling the study of molecular interactions in solution at physiological or biochemically relevant concentrations, and with nanoliter sample volumes, this work will allow investigation of a wide array of biological and chemical problems previously considered intractable. Broad societal impact may result, including enabling of sub-micron scale synthesis, the study of binding in complex samples, expedited drug discovery, and more efficient biomarker validation. Graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the interdisciplinary Bornhop group will participate in the research, results of which will be disseminated via the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science as well as by conventional means.</AbstractNarration>
