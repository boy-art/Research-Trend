    <AbstractNarration>This project is a comparative analysis of labor relations across varying levels of consent. The study examines relations between domestic workers and their employers in two sites to understand the effects of culture and social structure on employee-employer labor patterns and interactions, legal status, and understandings of legal rights. Analysis is based on in-depth interviews with domestic contract workers, employers, and representatives of government, nongovernmental organizations, and recruitment agencies. Broader impacts of the project include improved understanding of comparative labor relations and the intersection between labor vulnerability and human trafficking, as well as graduate student research training.</AbstractNarration>
