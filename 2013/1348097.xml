    <AbstractNarration>1348097&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Innovative, Integrative, Informative (ISBI) is a forum that has traditionally focused on the computational and modeling aspects of biomedical imaging. The website is at http://www.biomedicalimaging.org/2014/. It emphasizes methodologies that have the potential to be applicable to multiple imaging modalities and to imaging at different scales. Topics include physical, biological and statistical modeling of biological and anatomical structures, image formation and reconstruction, computational and statistical image analysis, visualization, and image quality assessment. The meeting aims to facilitate cross-fertilization of methodologies between different imaging modalities and scales, with applications ranging from the nano, molecular and cellular levels through small-animal imaging to macroscopic and whole-body clinical systems. Whereas many medical imaging meetings focus on particular modalities, ISBI includes a diversity of novel engineering and computational methodologies applied to biological and anatomical imaging modalities, either emerging or well established. Applications of interest include molecular pathology, drug discovery and delivery, molecular imaging, functional brain mapping, computational neuroanatomy, cardiovascular imaging, and cancer imaging. A principal goal of ISBI is to connect advanced methodologies with important biomedical applications, from microscopic to macroscopic scales. ISBI 2014, to be held April 28-May 2 2014, in Beijing, China, will be the 11th in a series of meetings cosponsored by two IEEE societies: the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) and the Signal Processing Society (SPS). The inaugural ISBI meeting was held in July 2002. The success of the previous ISBI meetings bodes well for the future of ISBI. The success of ISBI and its impact on the field, and indeed the future of the field itself, relies on training young investigators to work with state-of-the-art sophisticated computational or modeling tools and on informing the researcher community of the latest progress in biomedical imaging protocols and modalities. In addition, the inherently interdisciplinary nature of the biomedical imaging field means that no single professional organization has the majority of potential participants as its members. In this context, the tutorials series, covering very diverse topics and offered on the first day of the symposium, is an important component, which has been very popular in previous ISBI meetings. This project will fund to support the participation and attendance at the symposium by US-based students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging provides a forum where top-notch students interact with leaders in the field and engage in intellectual discussions with other superlative students in a wide array of bioengineering and related disciplines. Students are able to view presentations on topics related to their own fields of academic study and participate in didactic interaction. Without the support of this NSF proposal, many students would be less likely to attend the conference, thus missing an introduction to the world of knowledge available at such professional meetings. In addition, this assembly provides a forum for recognizing the talents of women and minorities in the field of computer science and bioengineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging promotes not only education within the computer science and engineering disciplines, but also fosters the next generation engineers and computer scientists by providing a unique opportunity for students to meet and network with the leading computational biologists, bioinformaticians, and scientists in the world. It also provides US students an opportunity to participate in grand challenges and learn about the state of art computational methods for solving complex problems present challenges in image analysis, and hypothesis generation from big data. For the first time, ISBI-14 is enjoying a rapid growth in grand challenges and data papers, and this process will be an extraordinary exposure for US students.</AbstractNarration>
