    <AbstractNarration>This research program will develop atomistic and microstructural models of the structure-property-processing relationships in actinide metals and alloys (U, Pu alloys). The project focuses its attention on metallic actinide alloys that are relevant to nuclear forensics. Metallic forms are the final forms of the actinide before use in a weapon. By developing these microstructure and atomistic models, we aim to understand how the microstructure evolves under processing such as casting and rolling for the alloys. This understanding provides the forensic scientist a capability to trace the provenance of such special nuclear materials should they be interdicted in the alloy form. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will train graduate students and involve undergraduates in research experiences through Georgia Tech Summer Undergraduate Research Experience and broaden participation of under-represented groups, for example, by recruiting students from minority serving institutions. It will by establish collaborations with researchers in INL and PNNL where graduate students will interact directly with researchers. Significant faculty involvement, participation by underrepresented minorities, and active learning distinguish the education and outreach component of this project. The outreach program is especially important in the case of a topic where the general public is not conversant with the science such as actinide chemistry and metallurgy. This program will educate a new generation of undergraduate and graduate students on actinide chemistry and metallurgy and provide resources to K-12 students to become interested and conversant in the actinide sciences while enhancing national security by providing a means to improve nuclear forensics science.</AbstractNarration>
