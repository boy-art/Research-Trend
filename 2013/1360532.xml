    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for the conference "Contemporary Combinatorics 2014", which will be held at the University of Memphis during March 27-29, 2014. The aim of this conference is to bring together a group of outstanding mathematicians who work on topics loosely related to combinatorics, probability and combinatorial number theory so that they can present their latest research results, and also interact with other conference participants, including young researchers and even high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is an area of mathematics that studies discrete structures. It has applications to computer science, chemistry, and many areas of engineering. The conference aims to promote interaction between senior and junior researchers, to allow for the dissemination of recent research results, and to publicize the importance of combinatorics in the general public.</AbstractNarration>
