    <AbstractNarration>This project will build upon prior research to improve upon a natural polymer-based scaffold technology for implant applications. Researchers have developed a mechanically competent bioactive biodegradable fixation device using cellulose, which is a polymer of natural origin. This polymer class has a long medical history as dialysis membrane, wound care system and pharmaceutical excipient. The research team previously evaluated cellulose-based scaffold systems for bone regeneration applications and has determined the biocompatibility, mechanical competence and osteoenic properties of cellulose scaffold system applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional metallic fixation devices such as plates and screws have several limitations and eventually may require additional surgery for removal. The biodegradable fixation devices developed through this project are designed to degrade completely, eliminating the need for a removal operation. This material platform is potentially stronger, more biocompatible and may meet the versatile needs in biological science and biomedical engineering. These products may also find applications to deliver bioactive molecules, antibiotics and pain medications to treat various aliments within the musculoskeletal system.</AbstractNarration>
