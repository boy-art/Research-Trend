    <AbstractNarration>Researchers have developed two point-of-use water treatment technologies that can be used alone, or in combination. These ceramic based water purifiers can be produced using local labor and materials in the developing world. The research team has demonstrated social acceptance and technological efficacy in a Guatemalan community as well as demonstrating human health benefits of the technology for an HIVpositive human cohort in South Africa. Building on the originally developed technology, the team has developed an additional point-of-use technology that is roughly 3-5 times less expensive than the original technology. The team has also developed particular expertise in the use of silver nanotechnology as applied to the media used to create the original technology and has developed an different, silver-ceramic point-of-use technology that will be about 3-5 times less expensive than the original technology. Researchers have developed a technique of applying silver to ceramic porous media that does not require pre-synthesized silver nanoparticles. This new technique has the potential to significantly reduce filter production costs compared to current methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team proposes to further specialize in creation of the two types of ceramic point-of-use water purification technologies. The team is taking steps to create infrastructure for production of these technologies in the U.S. as well as in South Africa. The ceramic filters have a potential market in the U.S. for households using well-water, as well as with disaster-relief agencies and the U.S. Department of Defense for use in conflict areas where purified water may not be readily accessible.</AbstractNarration>
