    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is for a one day workshop including researchers from multiple research disciplines (e.g. education, communication, psychology) and key stakeholders from the giant screen film industry to develop key research questions, priorities, and strategies related to giant screen cinema characteristics that impact STEM learning. The workshop would be held preceding the October, 2013 meeting of ASTC in Albuquerque, NM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been little research performed on the unique components of STEM giant screen films related to the role of immersion, presence, and effect on cognition. This workshop would begin with an online forum where invited participants would develop a list of questions, organize prior research, and identify relevant readings. During the workshop day at ASTC, participants would engage in roundtable exercises to develop the research program strategies (methods, collaborative communities, etc.) for the prioritized questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop outcomes include development of future research proposals and collaborative communities that will address the questions related to the impact of giant screen films and the role of immersion and presence on learning.</AbstractNarration>
