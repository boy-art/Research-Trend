    <AbstractNarration>Technical description of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project addresses certain basic aspects of the electroweak and&lt;br/&gt; strong interactions reflected in the properties of mesons and&lt;br/&gt; nucleons (particles found inside atomic nuclei) and their&lt;br/&gt; interactions at low energies. The strong and weak interactions are&lt;br/&gt; responsible for the structure of matter at the smallest known&lt;br/&gt; scale, a femtometer (size of the hydrogen atom nucleus) or less.&lt;br/&gt; The research is motivated by the fact that the present&lt;br/&gt; comprehensive theory -- the Standard Model (SM) -- is known to be&lt;br/&gt; incomplete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The rare "pi(e2)" decay of the pi-meson (pion) into an electron and&lt;br/&gt; a neutrino, occurring once in about 10,000 ordinary pion decays,&lt;br/&gt; provides a theoretically extraordinarily clean window to certain&lt;br/&gt; possible extensions of the SM, at a very large mass scale not&lt;br/&gt; directly accessible at any existing or planned accelerators. The&lt;br/&gt; PEN experiment, with measurements carried out at the Paul Scherrer&lt;br/&gt; Institute (PSI), Switzerland, by an international collaboration of&lt;br/&gt; 7 institutions led by the University of Virginia (UVa) group, aims&lt;br/&gt; to improve the current pi(e2) branching ratio result by about an&lt;br/&gt; order of magnitude. The data analysis is planned to be largely&lt;br/&gt; completed during the current 3-year award period. Plans for a&lt;br/&gt; possible follow-up measurement will be evaluated at that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A new project of precise measurement of neutron beta decay&lt;br/&gt; parameters has been initiated at the Spallation Neutron Source&lt;br/&gt; (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Lab, TN. The first phase, Nab,&lt;br/&gt; will focus on a precise measurement of the electron-neutrino&lt;br/&gt; correlation parameter "a" and Fierz interference term, "b." Nab&lt;br/&gt; should contribute (along with improved neutron lifetime&lt;br/&gt; measurements) to a final resolution of a longstanding problem in&lt;br/&gt; the determination of the ratio of axial and vector nucleon form&lt;br/&gt; factors, G_A/G_V, and a nuclear model independent determination of&lt;br/&gt; the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa u-d quark mixing. Through their&lt;br/&gt; precision, these experiments will explore interesting possible&lt;br/&gt; extensions to the SM. It is planned that during the current 3-year&lt;br/&gt; award period, Nab apparatus will be constructed and initially&lt;br/&gt; tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As the work on PEN concludes, the group will tranisition to the&lt;br/&gt; Muon g-2 experiment (E989) at Fermilab. The UVa group has&lt;br/&gt; contributed to the detector design through Monte Carlo simulations,&lt;br/&gt; is leading the Calorimeter Bias Voltage (CBV) project, and plans to&lt;br/&gt; play a significant role in the data analysis. The CBV system is&lt;br/&gt; planned to be completed during the 3-year award period, with&lt;br/&gt; instrument installation to follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Broader significance and impact of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Common to PEN, Nab and Muon g-2, the three main experiments in this&lt;br/&gt; research project, is the search for signals of new physics, not&lt;br/&gt; included in the Standard Model of particles and fields. Each uses&lt;br/&gt; its unique sensitivities to probe a hitherto unexplored region of&lt;br/&gt; fundamental physics, and in doing so contributes to the overall&lt;br/&gt; advancement of understanding of our universe at the most basic&lt;br/&gt; level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In addition to the basic science impact, there is the impact on&lt;br/&gt; education of young scientists: a number of undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt; graduate students have gained, and will continue to gain state of&lt;br/&gt; the art training in research. Seven PhD and one MS degrees were&lt;br/&gt; earned on this project during the past decade at UVa alone; a dozen&lt;br/&gt; or more undergraduate students got extensive hands-on research&lt;br/&gt; training, and have gone on to engaging careers. Several of these&lt;br/&gt; students have been members of underrepresented groups in science&lt;br/&gt; (women and minorities).</AbstractNarration>
