    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Joseph Byrnes of the University of Oregon to conduct a research project in Geoscience during the summer of 2013 at the Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo in Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo. The project title is "Using Recordings of Distant Earthquakes to Measure the Thickness of Tectonic Plates." The host scientist is Professor Hitoshi Kawakatsu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has recently been shown that a sharp discontinuity in seismic velocity exists at the bottom of tectonic plates in the ocean. This discontinuity is postulated to distinguish the rigid plate (the 'Lithosphere') from the underlying convective mantle (the 'Asthenosphere'). The reason the discontinuity exists is poorly understood. This project aims to measure the depth of the discontinuity with plate age using ocean bottom seismometers located on the Juan De Fuca Plate, just off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. Since the discontinuity is sharp, P and S waves from distant events convert into one another when passing through the plate. The difference in arrival time, due to the lower velocity of S waves, between the direct and converted phases gives the depth to the discontinuity. Using this technique, the evolution of this enigmatic boundary can be established. Several competing theories have been put forward to explain why this discontinuity exists. The simplest hypothesis is that the plate thickness grows as the square root of its age, as predicted by models of a plate growing by conductive cooling. The most likely alternative is that the discontinuity has constant depth and is independent of age, which would likely represented a plate defined by the removal of water from the mantle when the plate is created, forming a rigid body that defines the tectonic plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow hopes to establish relationships that produce scientific results beyond the summer. The research done during the funding period will lay the groundwork for future collaboration between researchers in the U.S. and Japan.</AbstractNarration>
