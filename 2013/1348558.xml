    <AbstractNarration>With the advent of the world wide web and the resulting technologies such as social media, smart phones and sensor networks, the amount of data being collected has increased tremendously in recent years. Managing, storing, processing, analyzing and disseminating such massive amounts of data gives raise to many security and privacy challenges. To address these security and privacy challenges of managing and analyzing big data, an NSF Workshop on Big Data Security and Privacy has been proposed. Specifically, the workshop explores research topics including: policy management for big data; security and privacy for big data management and analytics; secure infrastructures and secure storage for big data; securing and analyzing massive networks; and big data analytics for security problems. The workshop participants are expected to be from academia, industry and government labs, consisting of interdisciplinary researchers in the fields of higher performance computing, systems, data management and analytics, cyber security, network science and policy and social sciences. They will come together and determine the strategic direction for big data security and privacy. Since research in big data security and privacy is of growing importance, this workshop is expected to have very high broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>
