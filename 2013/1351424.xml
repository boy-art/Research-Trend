    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate how the unique electronic properties of graphene impacts the nature of photo-induced carrier injection, transport and recombination at heterojunctions of graphene with a range of semiconductors and nanomaterials; and to potentially harness these mechanisms for various advanced optoelectronic applications. The approach will be to study photo-absorption, photocurrent, and photoluminescence spectroscopy at junctions of graphene with materials such as silicon, zinc oxide, molybdenum disulphide, and bismuth selenide at different photon energies, doping levels, and gate voltages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Photo-induced carriers injected across a heterojunction into graphene demonstrate a number of unusual and intellectually stimulating properties. A comprehensive investigation of these carrier dynamics will lead to rich new physical insights related to the nature of injection/recombination across atomically thin interfaces, and its interplay with ultrafast mobility and constrained density of states in graphene. A variety of junctions will be investigated, and the engineering knowledge thus acquired will be utilized to develop a range of exceptionally sensitive photo-switching, photo-harvesting, photometry, imaging, and spectrometric applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research and education program can potentially result in transformative changes in imaging, detection, analysis, communication and energy-harvesting technologies. It will create exceptionally skilled graduate and undergraduate students qualified to pursue both academic and industrial careers in some of the most topically impactful research areas. Local high-school students and teachers will be exposed to world-class, research-based, learning-enhanced and career-catalyzing education. Traditionally under-represented communities will be proactively integrated into a stimulating environment of research and education in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
