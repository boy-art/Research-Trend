    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a novel Multivariate Optical Element (MOE) technology platform for fluorescence biomarker applications with superior spectroscopic discrimination performance as compared to traditional bandpass filter techniques. Life science assays utilizing fluorescence for discrimination employ a non-trivial compensation strategy for detecting more than one biomarker at a time using optical bandpass filters. The MOE platform combines the data collection and processing steps of a traditional multivariate chemical analysis into a single step via an all-optical computing technology with little to no moving parts as well as exhibits a multiplexing advantage as compared to optical bandpass filters. This optical regression can offer real-time measurements with relatively high signal-to-noise ratio that realize the advantages of multiplexed detection and pattern recognition in a simple optical instrument. The objectives of this research are two-fold: design and fabrication of a compressed detection MOE filter set for detecting multiple fluorescent biomarkers simultaneously with strong spectroscopic interference as well as comparing the detection performance of the MOE sensor with traditional optical bandpass filter methodologies. It is anticipated that the sensitivity and specificity of an MOE detection mechanism will be superior to bandpass filter detection of fluorescent biomarkers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be a novel technology that will provide an optical detection platform for fluorescence biomarker applications with superior spectroscopic discrimination performance as compared to current bandpass filter techniques. The success of a commercial fluorescent diagnostic assay is dependent on the selection of a fluorescent biomarker; due to the broad nature of fluorescence biomarker emission profiles, only a small number of fluorescence biomarkers may be discriminated from each other as a function of excitation source. The specificity advantage of MOE-based sensors will allow fluorescent biomarkers that were once incapable of discrimination from one another via optical bandpass filters to be employed in a common assay panel. As more discrete biomarkers may be detected simultaneously, more specific diagnostic assay panels may be constructed. A simplified MOE-based sensor may ultimately reduce the requirement for highly trained operators as well as move certain life science applications like disease prognostication from the laboratory to the point of care.</AbstractNarration>
