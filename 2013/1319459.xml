    <AbstractNarration>Model checking is a technique for verifying the correctness of computer &lt;br/&gt;systems. Different implementations are in wide industrial usage today. &lt;br/&gt;There are still, however, many large gaps in our understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;algorithmic issues involved in model checking, and the technology is still &lt;br/&gt;greatly challenged by industrial designs. For example, in hardware-design &lt;br/&gt;verification, it is rarely possible to apply existing tools to complete units &lt;br/&gt;with clear functionality. This project is pushing the frontier of this &lt;br/&gt;technology with the goal of scaling its applicability to functional system &lt;br/&gt;units by developing novel scalable algorithms for model checking. The &lt;br/&gt;result will be increased reliability of computer systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the mathematical approach to design &lt;br/&gt;verification that uses automata theory as a unifying paradigm for design &lt;br/&gt;specification and verification. The automata-theoretic approach separates the &lt;br/&gt;logical and the combinatorial aspects of reasoning about systems. The translation &lt;br/&gt;of specifications to automata handles the logic and shifts all the combinatorial &lt;br/&gt;difficulties to questions about automata, yielding clean and asymptotically optimal &lt;br/&gt;algorithms. While the fundamental theory is well understood, there are &lt;br/&gt;still many challenging gaps and improved algorithms can enhance the &lt;br/&gt;scalability of this approach significantly. This project investigates ways of improving &lt;br/&gt;automata-theoretic algorithms so they are more suitable for model checking &lt;br/&gt;at scale.</AbstractNarration>
