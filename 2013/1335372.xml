    <AbstractNarration>Joint use and development of facilities with international partners is desirable for all parties. This award is to support researcher participation on a joint workshop between airborne scientist from the U.S. and Germany. The award will provide support for up to nine university scientists to attend an international workshop to foster collaboration between scientist that utilize the U.S. High performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) and that might potentially utilize the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO). In addition to the university participants, the U.S. contingent will include relevant staff from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). There will be similar participants from the German research community. The goals of this workshop are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Educate each group about planned and on-going research programs.&lt;br/&gt;2. Exchange information as to the procedures of each country for developing field projects and explore ways that each country&lt;br/&gt; might be involve the partner country's research.&lt;br/&gt;3. For common instrumentation, explore ways to develop common formats, calibration procedures, mission flight planning tools and&lt;br/&gt; data management procedures in order to develop common data products. &lt;br/&gt;4. Discuss unique research instrumentation on the two platforms and discuss opportunities for sharing existing instrumentation and&lt;br/&gt; developing new instrumentation that cans be shared across the two aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;5. Discuss developing joint research campaigns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful outcomes from this workshop will include joint use/development of instrumentation and the potential for joint scientific projects.</AbstractNarration>
