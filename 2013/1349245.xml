    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of this CAREER proposal is to develop surface acoustic wave devices along with the associated chemical and biological sensors to study the bio-mechanical properties of cells and its relationship to disease. Acoustic waves applied at the cellular level can be used to elucidate biophysical properties of cells and reveal diagnostic as well as therapeutic signatures with accuracy and sensitivity that are not possible to attain in current technologies. The research objective of this CAREER proposal is to test this hypothesis in three steps: 1.Design, develop and characterize a monolithic cell biology lab-on-a-chip (LOC) integrated with novel magnetic cell capture and surface acoustic wave (SAW) transducers, 2.Study and evaluate the efficacy of SAWs for non-invasive, contactless sonoporation and transfection studies on tumor cells and identify the unique acoustic signature of each cell type for disease diagnostics, therapeutics as well as drug screening tests, 3.Carry out systematic studies of cell biomechanical properties as a function of disease type and state on a CMOS Acoustic LOC with integrated microfluidics and on chip electronics.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Quantitatively understanding the mechanical properties of cells and their relationship to the cells health may provide a method to elegantly differentiate between cells without using chemical sensing techniques that may require alteration of their biochemical state. These studies can transform the current state of medicine and potentially enable the in-situ capture and destruction of circulating tumor cells hence obliterating the metastasis phenomenon. In addition, this project will produce novel resources in sharing knowledge and collaboration of researchers in the fields of electrical, biomedical engineering, molecular biology, biochemistry and cancer pathology. In particular, new knowledge and science will be disseminated in cancer diagnosis and therapy, cellular mechanotransduction, mechanobiology, microfabrication, acoustic wave devices and integrated electronics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Proposed multidisciplinary project is expected to transform the engineering and life sciences education at University of Miami (UM) and integrate educational activities and cutting-edge research. The PI envisions a transformational effect on the training of next generation engineers and scientists in the discipline transcending fields of bionanotechnology, MEMS and VLSI. With over 25% of the students being of Hispanic descent, UM is proud to be ranked 1st among universities serving Hispanics in the United States. In addition, College of Engineering is ranked 15th in the nation for the percentage of women who were awarded a B.S. in engineering. This remarkable diversity is reflected in the student members of the PI's research group.</AbstractNarration>
