    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposed infrastructure is to enable research towards the creation of the first buildingwide, pervasive, life-long learning, multi-robot intelligence that is situated within an existing building. This buildingwide intelligence (BWI) infrastructure will be comprised of multiple robot appendages, as well as a suite of static sensors and interactive displays. The ultimate goal of the facilitated research is to enable BWI to interact naturally with all of the buildings users, both learning about the patterns and preferences of its long-term inhabitants, and aiding first-time visitors. In addition, it will be robust to continual changes to the capabilities and availability of its component robots and other sensing and actuation resources; and it will consist of readily available components and open source software for ease of replication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important broader impact of this proposal will be the development and dissemination of a new, open infrastructure suitable for cutting-edge research across the department and university, including reusable components suitable for installation in buildings everywhere. The concept of BWI will also provide impacts on education, including a new curriculum for a project-based course, serving as a platform for graduate and undergraduate research (including as a part of UTs novel Freshman Research Initiative), as well as a very public facade, which will enable public demonstrations at outreach events targeting underrepresented groups such as women in CS and Hispanics.</AbstractNarration>
