    <AbstractNarration>Facial expressions play a significant role in our daily communication. However, few accurate, robust and portable expression detection and analysis systems currently exist. The project team has developed a system for real-time tracking and analyzing of the facial features of humans in video. The system, composed of software and a single camera can automatically analyze facial expressions, detect eye blinks and track the head orientation of a human target under varying conditions of illumination. With facial expression analysis, the barrier of machine detection of human emotion, which has existed since the invention of the earliest machines, could finally be lifted. This possibility allows the research team to explore not only the social innovations, such as expression based rating of media or sentiment of a social interaction, but the connection of human and machine through non-verbal, indirect communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recognition of human facial expressions through an automated system has extensive applications, such as; emotional reaction measurement, development of a facially controlled human-computer interface and a multitude of opportunities by releasing an individually configured input mapped facially controlled software interface to the public. Some of the possibilities of facial expression analysis could include enhanced search results based on the users approval, automatic word definition triggered by a "confused" expression and general and/or specific sentiment after the review of textual or video content. Through the fatigue detection capabilities of our software, the transportation industry can be made safer by the development of systems that can detect the alertness of pilots, drivers and vehicle operators at large and pair them with devices to alert them to their fatigued state.</AbstractNarration>
