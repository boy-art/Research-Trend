    <AbstractNarration>The Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, 66 million years ago, marks the last great extinction event in Earth's history. Among the most notable casualties were the ammonites, shelled cephalopods related to squids and octopus. Having worked on this group for more than 30 years, Dr. Landman will synthesize data on cephalopod diversity and abundance at the end of the Cretaceous just prior to their extinction. He will compare these data to similar data on nautilids, a closely related group of externally shelled cephalopods that survived the extinction event and live in today?s oceans. This research will develop a global picture of the "health" of the ammonites and nautilids at a critical time in Earth history and investigate hypotheses on why the ammonites went extinct while the nautilids did not. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The processes of evolution, including extinction, have led to the diverse biosphere we see today. Investigating why some lineages go extinct while others survive will help us prepare for the threats to modern-day biodiversity. Extinction is a concept that captures the interest of the public. The American Museum of Natural History, which receives over five million visitors a year, including 500,000 children on field trips, is well positioned to educate the public. The principal investigator will collaborate with educational professionals to feature the results of this synthesis through the Museum's award-winning Science Bulletin program. He will introduce high school teachers to the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event and the associated extinctions, and the teachers will, in turn, include this topic in their Earth History classes.</AbstractNarration>
