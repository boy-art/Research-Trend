    <AbstractNarration>To what extent is human cognition (e.g., visual perception, memory, and categorization) augmented by language? Does language only allow us to communicate with more flexibility or does language transform cognition, allowing humans to represent and manipulate information in novel ways? A series of studies previously conducted by this investigator has shown that language has pervasive and surprising effects on a range of abilities, such as learning new categories, using knowledge about familiar categories, visual memory, and even perception: Hearing a word can literally change what one sees. The proposed studies build on this earlier work by exploring the design features of language that make it an especially useful tool for constructing and manipulating mental representations. The studies use a variety of behavioral paradigms together with noninvasive brain stimulation to explore the behavioral and neural processes involved in the interaction of language, learning new categories, and retrieving information about familiar concepts and categories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies are critical not only for understanding the broad issue of language-augmented cognition, but also for the potential to understand applied issues related to linguistic and cognitive development. Hearing less language in early childhood leads not only to negative outcomes in using language to communicate, but appears to extend more broadly to other cognitive abilities. By understanding the mechanisms by which language augments cognition, we will better understand the broad consequences of language disorders, which may inform the development of effective interventions. The work will also enhance infrastructure for research and education by implementing and disseminating tools for efficient and cost-effective data collection over the web using crowd-sourcing services, which allow for generalizability to broader populations and will allow undergraduates to more easily conduct original research projects.</AbstractNarration>
