    <AbstractNarration>Gut microbes and the evolution of mutualism and diet in lycaenid butterflies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lycaenid butterflies engage in specialized associations with ants, and while the majority of these ant-lycaenid interactions are considered mutualistic, many are parasitic in which caterpillars feed on ant regurgitations, ant-tended insects, or directly on ant brood. Despite the incredible diversity of diets, life histories, and interspecific associations among lycaenid butterflies, the evolution of diet and resulting transitions from mutualism to parasitism within this group are not well understood. This research investigates the taxonomic, functional and evolutionary dimensions of the gut bacterial associations of lycaenid butterflies in order to explore the possibility that gut microbes are implicated in the evolution of parasitic lifestyles and carnivorous diets in this group. This is the first study of the role of symbiotic gut microbes in determining their hosts' associations with free-living organisms, including evolutionary shifts from mutualism to parasitism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the guidance of Dr. Naomi Pierce at Harvard University and Dr. Martin Kaltenpoth at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, this project addresses several training goals. Specific aims include the Fellow receiving training in functional genomics methods, developing strong teaching skills, and gaining experience applying genomics techniques to ecological and evolutionary questions. Additionally, the Fellow will remain active in outreach activities aimed at increasing opportunities and advancement of underrepresented students in the greater Boston area and beyond. This research will provide novel insights into the biology of insect-microbe associations, with potential applications to human health, conservation, and pest management.</AbstractNarration>
