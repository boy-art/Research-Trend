    <AbstractNarration>Platinum group elements derived from automobile catalytic converters have increased in roadside soil, plants, and air. However, little is known about the mechanism of platinum group elements toxicity and its impact on living organisms. With National Science Foundation support, Texas Southern University will initiate a research program that integrates systems biology, genomics, proteomics, and bio-informatics approaches to develop computer models capable of characterizing stress responses in eukaryotic cells as well as understand how environmental toxicants impact bacterial members of the gut microbiota. The project will employ a multidisciplinary team to educate graduate, undergraduate, and rising high school students, expand and strengthen the existing Ph.D. program in Environmental Toxicology, facilitate the professional development of junior faculty, and enhance the institution's research infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will contribute to the current knowledge of environmental exposure to patinum group elements and vanadium and associated biomolecular effects and potential health risks. An array of new technologies and innovative approaches in molecular biology, nanotechnology, and computer modeling will be employed to assess exposure to patinum group elements and vanadium, and study environmental stress responses in eukaryotic cells and gut microbiota. The proposed research will (1) assess the exposure to platinum group elements and vanadium in nano-size atmospheric particulate matter and associated health risk, (2) examine the effect of platinum group elements and vanadium on transcription factors, MAP kinases and pro-inflammatory cytokines in human lung epithelial cells and use computer models to predict the pathways and characterize various responses to platinum group elements in eukaryotic cells, and (3) characterize platinum group elements and vanadium exposure to representative prokaryotic members of the gut microbiota and develop a microbial biosensor for human disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The results of this investigation will be employed to develop predictive computer models for biomolecular pathways involved and advanced potential risk prediction tools that can help environmental quality managers make informed decisions in developing more efficient management strategies. In addition, by examining common affected pathways in microbes and eukaryotic cells, simple biological biosensors may be developed for the assessment of the effects of these pollutants on humans. The project combines education and research efforts to prepare high-caliber doctoral scientists in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics related fields by strengthening and expanding the existing Ph.D. program in Environmental Toxicology. By training African-American and other minority undergraduate and graduate students in emerging areas of environmental biology, biomaterials science, bio-engineering, and synthetic biology, the institution will continue to increase the numbers of well-prepared minority professionals engaged in research, teaching, and management, and develop the STEM workforce. Project activities will strengthen the institution's research infrastructure and promote innovative partnerships within scientific communities, enhance basic biology research, technology development/transfers and commercialization.</AbstractNarration>
