    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing a new context for teaching introductory computing courses (CS1) using generative art and creative computation, focusing on multi-institutional adoption and diverse partnerships with high schools. This is a (re)-design and large-scale adoption effort of the CS1 course materials developed in a previous TUES-I project, supported by NSF DUE-0942626 and NSF DUE-0942628 (collaborative: Bryn Mawr College and Southern Methodist University). Two lead high school partners, James Martin High School (public, Dallas TX) and Sidwell Friends School (private, Washington, DC), are participating in the project by testing, adopting, and leading in the dissemination and adoption efforts among high schools nationally. An exemplar course is being developed that aligns with both CS AP A and CS Principles advanced placement initiatives. The project is working toward having the course adopted and formally assessed at a dozen participating colleges, universities and high schools nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates several facets of research and development: rethinking of introductory computing curricula and updating CS1 with contemporary, diverse examples of computing in a modern context; integrated components; context-driven text and teaching materials; formal assessment tools for evaluation; and community building in the educational domain. Evaluation is being done to assess potential improvement in student recruitment, retention and interest in computing as a result of a broader adoption of this new context, particularly of women and non-STEM or undecided majors, and of the viability of this model for the ongoing redesign of the AP CS course.</AbstractNarration>
