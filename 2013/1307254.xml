    <AbstractNarration>Professor Todd D. Krauss of the University of Rochester is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to understand the fundamental mechanism behind the chemical synthesis of cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dots (QDs) and to characterize the relationship between QD surface chemistry and photophysical properties using state-of-the-art spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. It is expected that the relationship between surface chemistry, surface trapped charge, and photoluminescence properties for individual CdSe QDs will be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite over three decades of research, the fundamental chemical mechanism governing the synthesis of semiconductor QDs remains unknown. As a result of this research, rational procedures for the synthesis of QDs may be developed that are fundamentally scalable by several orders of magnitude to industrial scales, and that take place under much lower temperatures compatible with current chemical manufacturing. Large-scale synthesis of semiconductor QDs, especially those with bright and stable photoluminescence, may find broad use in biology, quantum optics, and optoelectronics. The proposed research also provides for the education and training of the next generation of physical chemists, inclusive of women and underrepresented minorities. Students supported by this project will organize and direct outreach and educational efforts in the local community through the Adopt-a-School program with the Rochester city school district, and participate in select "NanoDays" events at the Rochester Museum and Science Center.</AbstractNarration>
