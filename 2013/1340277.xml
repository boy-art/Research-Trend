    <AbstractNarration>This technology is based on research findings that an enzyme treatment can prevent biofilm formation and re-sensitize multidrug resistant pathogens (including both gram-negative and positive bacteria) to antibiotic treatment. Both in vitro and animal model experiments have been successfully completed and demonstrated the efficacy of this technology. The enzyme can potentially be used to alone or as an adjuvant to improve the efficacy of existing and approved antibiotics to eradicate multidrug resistance infections, which in many cases are considered to be non-treatable diseases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biofilm-related infections and the occurrence of multidrug resistance is a serious worldwide public health problem. In the US alone, roughly 2 million people acquire bacterial infections in the hospital which leads to 99,000 deaths annually. The initial target application is the topical application for wound infections and surgical site infections. Combinatorial the enzyme and antibiotic treatment could improve and the way flesh wounds and bacterial infections are treated in the clinic. The technology can also be applied to nosocomial pneumonia, bacteremia and sepsis, Infections in cystic fibrosis, catheter-associated bacteriuria, etc. especially when the last line of antibiotics is not effective.</AbstractNarration>
