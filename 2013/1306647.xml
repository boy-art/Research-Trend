    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for an experimental research program to study quantum matter in a table-top setting using the precise tools of atomic physics. Collections of atoms will be cooled to about one-billionth of room temperature and confined in electromagnetic traps in order to isolate its quantum properties. Studies of interactions between atoms at the few-particle and many-particle level will be carried out using mixtures of lithium and ytterbium atoms. These studies will probe the fundamental yet complex three-body problem, which abounds at all length scales from atomic binding to celestial mechanics. Additionally, experiments with atoms trapped in optical lattice geometries will be carried out, shedding light on condensed matter phenomena such as phase transitions and pattern formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concurrent with the research component, related education and outreach will be actively performed. Graduate and undergraduate students will gain valuable research experience in the course of the project, preparing them to join the work force in academics and industry as the next generation of scientists and engineers. The research program will also be leveraged to encompass outreach activity. This will involve periodic lectures and lab tours for local community college, middle and high school students, as well as summer research internships through the NSF-Research Experience for Undergraduates program.</AbstractNarration>
