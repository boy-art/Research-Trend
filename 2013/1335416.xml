    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to introduce a new flow capturing framework, "Evasive Flow Capturing Problem" (EFCP), and develop mathematical solution techniques for optimizing locations of facilities that targeted drivers wish to avoid. The flow capturing problem consists of locating facilities in order to maximize the number of users who should encounter at least one of these facilities along their predetermined travel paths. Existing models for solving this problem commonly assume that if a facility is located along (or relatively close to) a predetermined path, the transportation flow along this path is considered captured. However, this assumption is untenable when locating facilities that drivers try to avoid, such as facilities used to intercept violators, toll evaders, intruders or hazardous cargoes. The project's methods will be applied in realistic case studies for optimally locating truck weight enforcement facilities as well as security and safety checkpoints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research is expected to improve current practices of transportation agencies in locating weight-enforcing facilities, which often consist of simply prioritizing the most damaged roads. The methods for locating weight-enforcing facilities could speed up decision making processes of public agencies and provide solutions that greatly reduce 1) road maintenance costs, 2) environmental damage and 3) accident costs due to overweight commercial vehicles. The methods for optimal location of security and safety checkpoints could considerably improve homeland security and the risks of transporting hazardous materials. The computer implementations of the proposed work (e.g. codes for the solution techniques and input data) will be made available online for future extensions and will be used in graduate optimization courses that serve women and under-represented minorities. The developed methods and results will also be disseminated through technical conferences, journal papers, and presentations to transportation agencies.</AbstractNarration>
