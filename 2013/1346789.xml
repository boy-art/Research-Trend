    <AbstractNarration>Prior work has shown that the unobtrusive, continuous monitoring of individuals with in-home sensors provides useful embedded health assessment, i.e., the continuous assessment of health changes based on each person's individual activity patterns and baseline health conditions, and can improve health outcomes. Especially for older adults, identifying and assessing problems early provides a window of opportunity for interventions to alleviate problems before they become catastrophic and require hospital or nursing home care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project augments monitoring of individuals with a new interactive exercise coaching interface that will connect a remote physical therapist to senior clients in the home. GENI-enabled networking will be incorporated to support real-time interaction via high-definition video. The proposed project will meet the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;* Develop an integrated, interactive interface for displaying in-home gait history and coaching remote users on proper exercise form.&lt;br/&gt;* Extend the integrated system to support GENI-slice overlay network channels.&lt;br/&gt;* Deploy the integrated monitoring and coaching system in senior independent living homes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will impact technology, healthcare, policy, quality of life for seniors, and peace of mind for their families. The technology impacts include significant contributions to GENI-enabled networking and interactive interfaces for seniors. Results will further embedded health assessment and offer new ways to detect health problems before they become catastrophic. The project results will be disseminated both through traditional academic publications and by outreach to the general public via the US Ignite conferences and the university?s Engineering Week Open House in which hundreds of K-12 students tour the college. Additionally, the project will recruit undergraduate students, especially women and under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
