    <AbstractNarration>This effort will organize an NSF CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop to introduce junior faculty to the NSF CAREER program, and help them prepare their CAREER proposal. The NSF CAREER program serves a critical role in the National Science Foundation's efforts to identify, foster and support the nation's most promising junior faculty in both research and education. Junior professors who are just starting their careers often have limited experience with grant writing and evaluation. They also have little or no interaction with the program directors at NSF. During this workshop, young faculty members will have the opportunity to improve their skills in proposal writing, as well as interact with NSF program directors from different divisions (IIS, CNS, and CCF) as well as recent NSF CAREER awardees. The major components of the workshop include presentations on proposal writing, experience sharing, mock panels, and proposal clinic. A limited number of travel support will be made available for HBCU/MEI faculty to attend this workshop. This 1-day event is tentatively scheduled to be held on March 15, 2013 at Temple University Center City campus, located opposite to Philadelphia City Hall in downtown Philadelphia.</AbstractNarration>
