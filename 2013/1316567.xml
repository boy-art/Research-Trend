    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Chase W. Nelson of the University of South Carolina-Columbia to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the Genomics Research Center of Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "The Genetic Basis of Gene Expression Divergence between Rice and Maize: Uncovering the Evolutionary Origin of C4 Photosynthesis." The host scientist is Dr. Wen-Hsiung Li.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project undertakes a bioinformatics analysis of genomic and transcriptomic next-generation sequencing data from rice (Oryza sativa, a model C3 photosynthesizing plant) and maize (Zea mays, a model C4 plant). Previous work in the Li lab has revealed important gene expression differences between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of maize. These results are being expanded through an evolutionary analysis of the genetic basis of gene expression divergence between maize and rice leaves at early developmental stages. The analysis examines developmental transcription factor (TF) genes to determine whether gene expression differences mainly result from cis or trans effects. Results address the hypothesis that TF genes exhibiting differential expression between these species play important roles in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, an important issue in plant physiology. By facilitating international collaboration, this research will allow the tailoring of new computational techniques to the various methods used in data generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow's project will achieve several unique broader impacts. The cultural and scientific experiences gained in Taipei will contribute to his role as the BioInvestigations Lab Coordinator at the EdVenture Children's Museum in Columbia, SC where his duties include informal science education and training staff in basic molecular biology techniques. Results will be presented at both Academia Sinica and the University of South Carolina, and also submitted for publication in a plant physiology journal.</AbstractNarration>
