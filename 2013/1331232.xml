    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and Graph Theory. The series consists of three mini-conferences on Combinatorics and Graph Theory in Atlanta where Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Georgia State University are located. Three mini-conferences will be scheduled in November, February, and April, respectively. Each conference will feature one distinguished researcher with two one-hour lectures, four one-hour lectures by distinguished researchers mainly from the southeast region, and four thirty-minute talks by junior researchers and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a continuation of the ongoing Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and Graph Theory started in 2010. The featured lectures and other invited talks have covered a variety of topics in graph theory and combinatorics. The speaker pool not only has a good gender balance but also consists of a nice blend of senior, well-known researchers and young rising stars. The series has become a major event for combinatorics community in the southeast region and beyond, providing opportunities to strengthen collaborations among researchers and institutes within the southeast region of the United States.</AbstractNarration>
