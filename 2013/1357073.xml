    <AbstractNarration>Justine Williams, under the supervision of Dr. Dorothy Holland of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will investigate the conditions under which systems of agroecological farming can flourish. Although an increasing number of government and non-governmental organizations are recognizing the urgency of promoting environmentally sustainable agriculture, local farmers continue to face many challenges in farming this way, not the least of which includes the forces of the global economy. Through ethnographic investigation and mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis, this research examines the interaction of cultural, political and economic forces in shaping the realities of farming and the perspectives of farmers. Through in-depth interviews, fixed answer surveys, and 12 months of participant participation, the researcher will explore how agricultural organizations in one site attempt to promote social and individual commitments to agroecology through the creation of communities, collective learning experiences and public recognition of success. The project seeks to answer the questions: What kinds of farmers are most likely to develop enduring commitments to sustainable agriculture? What actions can agricultural organizations take to increase this number? And finally, how can agricultural organizations create "sustainable farmer" identities? The research will use the diverse set of farmers, and three prominent agriculture organizations that interact with them, as a case study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings a social theory and cultural perspective to bear on a research field that is often dominated by economic studies. In taking advantage of the researcher's academic and agricultural contacts, it provides unique international insight into questions of global importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project sets the stage for international learning opportunities for the researcher's future undergraduate and graduate students. The researcher will also draw on her previous experience in public communications to disperse and clearly explain findings to a wider body of people outside of academia including agricultural organizations, policy makers and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
