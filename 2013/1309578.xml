    <AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will experimentally investigate electronic properties of GaAs-based semiconductor nanostructures which are driven out of their equilibrium state by microwave radiation or dc electric fields. In particular, electrical resistance of such a device can oscillate drastically with the applied magnetic field and even vanish under certain conditions. By exploring similarities and differences between microwave- and dc field-induced effects, the project will develop a method to obtain detailed information on the correlation properties of the disorder potential, which will have a direct impact on other fields, such as high-mobility MBE growth. The educational component of this project rests on the development of research-based educational resources and direct involvement of students at all levels and from a variety of backgrounds in cutting-edge research to ready them for careers in nanotechnology industry, government, and academe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Understanding electronic properties of semiconductor quantum devices becomes increasingly important as miniaturization of modern integrated circuits approaches a point where quantum effects come into play. This project will experimentally investigate electronic properties of semiconductor nanostructures, which are driven out of their equilibrium state by microwave radiation or dc electric fields. In particular, electrical resistance of such a device can oscillate drastically with the applied magnetic field and even vanish under certain conditions. By exploring similarities and differences between microwave- and dc field-induced effects, the project will develop a method to obtain detailed information on the amount and type of impurities in the device, which will have a direct impact on other fields, such as epitaxial growth of high-purity semiconductor nanostructures. The educational component of this project rests on the development of research-based educational resources and direct involvement of students at all levels and from a variety of backgrounds in cutting-edge research to ready them for careers in nanotechnology industry, government, and academe.</AbstractNarration>
