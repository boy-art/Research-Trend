    <AbstractNarration>The technical goal of this project is to develop and refine the micro-fluidic 3D IC cooling technology. While 3D integration offers significant potential for improving the performance, energy efficiency and functionality of electronic systems, the problem of heat removal is significantly exacerbated. Conventional air cooling alone would be incapable of addressing the future 3D IC heat removal requirements. In this project, the PIs are investigating use of aggressive micro-fluidic cooling technology for cooling 3D ICs. The team comprises researchers from University of Maryland and Georgia Institute of Technology. The Georgia Tech team would bring forth significant expertise in fabrication and modeling of 3D ICs with interlayer micro-fluidic cooling. The Maryland team will bring forth expertise in VLSI design methodologies. The primary focus of this proposal is: development of techniques and tools for co-design of micro-fluidic embedded cooling and electrical aspects of 3D ICs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal would directly support several PhD students in different disciplines. Because of the cross disciplinary nature of this proposal, these students would need to learn diverse set of topics pertaining to fluidics, chip design and thermal management. Undergraduates will also be involved through various programs at Georgia Tech and Maryland. The outcomes of this research will be published in respectable venues in both electrical/computer engineering and mechanical engineering. The tools, models and experimental data will also be made available on the web. The PIs plan to organize tutorials at various conferences and educational forums. Special emphasis will be givenon minority involvement via collaboration with local HBCUs.</AbstractNarration>
