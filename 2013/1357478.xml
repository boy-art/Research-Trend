    <AbstractNarration>This award funds a graduate student mentoring program that is part of the Economics Pipeline Program, which works to broaden participation in the economics profession. The mentoring program helps students from under represented groups navigate a number of critical stages in their development as scientists as they go from the early stages of graduate study through completing dissertation research and starting their first post-doctoral position. Students meet regularly with their program mentors at a variety of professional conferences around the country. An annual workshop brings all participants together for research presentations; this workshop is held in conjunction with a summer program aimed at undergraduate students who are interested in careers in social and economic science. The graduate students therefore both benefit from working with their own mentors and are able to serve as mentors in turn to younger students.</AbstractNarration>
