    <AbstractNarration>This Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Radford University is providing scholarships and support services to academically-talented students majoring in science, technology, and mathematics who demonstrate financial need. The project recruits students with a broad range of backgrounds from both high schools and community colleges, and effectively educates and supports them to succeed as future STEM researchers, teachers, and leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radford University's Preparing the Next Generation of Leaders in Science, Technology and Mathematics' (RU-NextGen's) primary aims are to provide students with scholarships, focused activities, and strong support mechanisms to acquire skills that will help them succeed academically; procure science, technology, engineering, or mathematics-related internships or research opportunities during their college years; and ultimately transition into future careers in STEM. RU-NextGen's Emerging Leaders in Science, Technology and Mathematics [Elites] program serves as an umbrella of activities with focus areas of research, communication, and career development. Examples of Elites activities include participation in summer research, active engagement in classes undergirded by signing honors or leadership contracts, peer mentoring and participation in career development, and networking events. The Elites program also includes strong support mechanisms such as individual intrusive pro-active mentoring, peer mentoring, and cohort-building social and academic activities.</AbstractNarration>
