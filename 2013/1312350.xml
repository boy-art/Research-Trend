    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive catalog of nearby young stellar objects fully accessible to the astronomical community. At present, data regarding the approximately 10,000 - 30,000 young stellar objects within ~800pc of the Sun are scattered throughout various archives and the published literature. These include stars in young clusters, associations, and molecular clouds, with photometric/spectroscopic data in one or more of the following wavelengths: x-ray, optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and sub-millimeter/millimeter. In addition, derived quantities such as stellar parameters, angular momentum indicators, activity measures, circumstellar disk diagnostics, etc. are also available through various resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide targeted and flexible access to basic data products, as well as higher level data products that are relevant to young stars through a relational database populated with data from all known or suspected members of the population. The database will also have broad educational value useful to a wide spectrum of users from teachers in the classroom to experienced scientific researchers.</AbstractNarration>
