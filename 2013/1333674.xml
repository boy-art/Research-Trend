    <AbstractNarration>Formal modeling and verification technology has made&lt;br/&gt;significant advances in the last two decades. Techniques like model&lt;br/&gt;checking and theorem proving are now used in both the hardware and&lt;br/&gt;software industries. Formal techniques are also increasingly being&lt;br/&gt;used in scientific modeling, as for example in systems biology and in&lt;br/&gt;the engineering of complex cyber-physical systems. The biggest&lt;br/&gt;challenge facing this technology is the lack of trained users and&lt;br/&gt;developers of this technology. &lt;br/&gt;To address this gap, we started the Summer School in Formal Techniques. &lt;br/&gt;Two such schools have been organized, during the summers of 2011 and 2012, &lt;br/&gt;at Menlo College in Atherton, California. These schools attracted around 80&lt;br/&gt;participants with a diverse range of interests and backgrounds. The&lt;br/&gt;lectures were supported by hands-on laboratories. Both schools have&lt;br/&gt;been received enthusiastically by the participants. The 2013&lt;br/&gt;Summer School on Formal Techniques continues the work of developing a&lt;br/&gt;well-knit community of researchers who are interested in learning&lt;br/&gt;cutting-edge techniques in formal modeling and verification.&lt;br/&gt;Attendees at the school have the opportunity to present their own&lt;br/&gt;research ideas and to interact closely with both the lecturers and&lt;br/&gt;other students.</AbstractNarration>
