    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is to support the Electronic Devices, Materials and Systems for the Sustainable Future Conference to be held at KAUST, Saudi Arabia in the Winter of 2014. This conference is focused on the topical issue of advanced materials and devices for sustainable systems. The purpose of the conference is to assemble the global scientific community to a common platform to steer discussion towards scientific and engineering research progress and opportunities focusing on sustainable technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This Conference will bring together leading researchers from around the world to discuss scientific and engineering research progress and opportunities focusing on sustainable future technology. Both fundamental and applied research will be discussed in the areas of electronic devices, materials and systems for: Energy efficiency (energy harvesting, energy storage, energy efficient utility); Energy management (monitoring energy consumption, optimizing energy usage management); and, Optimization of electronic resources towards a sustainable habitat involving environment, food and water quality (quality monitoring using electronic sensors, wide deployment of sensors and their network management).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This Conference offers a special opportunity for the research community to share state-of-the-art technological developments, to stimulate new ideas, and to explore/promote new collaborations. Global participants will present progress on advanced materials and systems, and participate in discussions that aim to identify strategies to maximize technical and societal impact. The technical outcome/proceedings of the conference will be submitted to IEEE for publication as a review article.</AbstractNarration>
