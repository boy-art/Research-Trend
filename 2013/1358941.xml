    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research and the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Texas A&amp;M University, located in College Station, TX, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014-2018. This project is supported by both the Directorates for Biological Sciences (Division of Biological Infrastructure) and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (Division of Chemistry). The Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Texas A&amp;M offers an energetic atmosphere to perform research in diverse areas of biochemistry, including, but not limited to, genomics, proteomics, enzymology, structural biology, mechanisms of gene expression, membrane structure and function, and developmental/cell biology. Recruiting efforts will focus on students who have completed their junior or sophomore year and who attend institutions that do not offer doctoral degrees. Although not limited to this geographical area, special recruiting efforts will be made to attract students from universities and colleges in Texas and surrounding states in the mid-South region. Partner institutions that enroll substantial numbers of students who are underrepresented in STEM fields will help recruit students to this program. Participants will evaluate the program at the end of their summer experience and in subsequent years, using the online BIO REU common assessment tool and a program-specific questionnaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant broader impacts will result from the summer research program. Participants will receive training from faculty advisors who direct nationally funded research programs. Weekly meetings will provide training in responsible conduct in research, critical analysis of research literature, development of hypothesis-driven research and instruction in presentation skills. At the conclusion of the program students will present their research accomplishments in both written and oral reports. Participants will leave with an appreciation of the effort and satisfaction involved in biochemical research, and prepared to pursue graduate training and careers in this area. A majority of previous participants have enrolled in graduate school or obtained research positions in academia or industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after participating in this program and must respond to an automatic email sent by the NSF reporting system.

Kunkel at g-kunkel@tamu.edu) or co-PI (Dr. Mary Bryk at bryk@tamu.edu).</AbstractNarration>
