    <AbstractNarration>The Teaching Channel is hosting two day workshop/colloquium at Northwestern University focused on the use of video and on line learning in support of the College and CAREER Readiness Standards. The three research questions are: 1) How can these tools increase discussion, inquiry and reporting of teacher progress on the standards through data sharing and writing? (2) What research tools can be deployed to determine the efficacy of these tools and their potential for scale? and (3) How can video and on line professional development tools best support teachers in a time of increasing accountability and change? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the workshop include research briefs and a summary paper. These will be posted on the Teaching Channel resource cite.</AbstractNarration>
