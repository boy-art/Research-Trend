    <AbstractNarration>Objective: &gt; The objective of this program is to develop new nonlinear and active artificial impedance surfaces. This represents a new research area with the potential to significantly expand the capabilities of artificial media, and overcome the limitations of current passive impedance surfaces. This program will involve all aspects of research, from conceptual development and simulations to fabrication and measurements. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &gt; The intellectual merit is that the development of active and nonlinear surfaces will expand human knowledge to include nonlinear surface wave effects, as well as superluminal propagation of surface waves through the use of active electronics embedded in periodic structures. This proposal is transformative in that these structures will demonstrate unique new phenomena at a size and frequency scale that is amenable to direct probing of the electric field to enable full examination of the underlying physics. In the future, these concepts can also be extended to other regimes such as optical surfaces that include active or nonlinear materials. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &gt; The broader impacts are that this program will involve new outreach efforts to historically underrepresented groups, as well as K-12 students to motivate them to pursue higher education in engineering. This outreach effort will be through coordination with the UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Excellence, and Advancement) Center. The PI will pledge to work with the center to identify potential grad students from historically underrepresented groups, and to identify opportunities to promote the excitement of this research to K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
