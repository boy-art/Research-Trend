    <AbstractNarration>The Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) at the University of Hawai'i is awarded a grant to upgrade its communication and data storage capacity to take advantage of a 10 Gigabit fiber optic cable line that is being provided by Hawaiian Telecom to Coconut Island from the Oahu main line. The HIMB research community generates large amounts of highly heterogeneous data stemming from diverse experimental sources, such as DNA sequencing data, confocal microscopy image analysis, and environmental data sensors on the surrounding coral reefs. The high magnitude and diversity of the data collected and used by researchers at HIMB impacts the island?s data network, the storage and computational capacity, and requires a modular and timely approach to data management with robust underlying infrastructure that can efficiently handle it. Thus, HIMB has designed a complete upgrade of its cyber infrastructure. These improvements will take place in two phases: Phase I involves the upgrade of the entire HIMB Network, including the replacement of the central networking and data storage equipment, as well as the deployment of a single centralized HIMB wireless access network throughout the island. Phase II will provide a secure data storage facility and set of user-friendly, web-based data transfer and analysis software. A description of the research facility and its faculty is available at http://www.hawaii.edu/HIMB. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new HIMB portal system will significantly enhance the ability of HIMB researchers to collaborate and share data with other researchers at UH and across institutions, as well as work with resource managers and NGOs to extend the availability and utility of their research findings. HIMB will be able to extend access to HIMB data resources to faculty at UH Manoa main campus and Community Colleges for use in their courses and research. For example, with improved cyberinfrastructure, we can offer opportunities for college students to remotely operate the confocal microscope to view images of live marine organisms. HIMB is a partner in the NSF Pacific Climate Education Partnership teacher Institute and COSEE Island Earth. This partnership will be delivering teacher summer institutes on climate change science to middle school teachers in Hawaii, American Samoa, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau or the Mariana Islands. The greater bandwidth of the new HIMB system will enhance these teacher institutes by making available real time data exploration.</AbstractNarration>
