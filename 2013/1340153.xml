    <AbstractNarration>This project plans to develop and explore potential value of selenium nucleic acids in 3D structure studies and drug discovery of the longer nucleic acids and their protein complexes, especially drug target characterization. Nucleic acids and their protein complexes have been recognized as important drugs targets in cancer treatments. DNAs are frequent targets of many small-molecule drugs with anticancer activities. High-resolution structures of DNAs and their ligand complexes are critical in drug design, discovery, and mechanism study. X-ray crystallography is one of the most direct and powerful tools for structure determination of these macromolecules and complexes. Moreover, crystallography is one of the best strategies to provide structure information of these macromolecules with high resolutions. The research team is developing novel selenium strategies to increase structure resolutions of nucleic acids and their complexes with ligands (including proteins and small molecules) for drug target study and drug development. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and commercialize the SeNA strategies for determining high-resolution crystal structures of nucleic acids and their complexes with small molecule drugs (or potential drugs) and protein complexes for disease study (such as cancer research) and drug development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Se-nucleic acid research will provide insights into nucleic acid chemistry and biochemistry, and the structural and functional properties, which are of great interest to scientific community as well as to the general public. Se-nucleic acids may lead to novel materials and applications. Furthermore, this proposed project will allow the widespread access to these valuable new materials. These potential discoveries could encourage their widespread use and allow broader access to these unique materials for function and structure studies.</AbstractNarration>
