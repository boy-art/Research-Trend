    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore ultracompact graphene optical modulators for future on-chip optical communications. The approach is to systematically explore the unique electro-optic properties of graphene, and to greatly enhance the interaction of graphene with light based on novel waveguides and platforms. In particular, graphene in a waveguide can be tuned with anomalous optical properties with a suitable gate voltage, which will be employed to develop the proposed modulators.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;This project will systematically explore novel graphene-sandwiched optical waveguides based on the unique properties of graphene. This proposed research will be one of the first experimental attempts to demonstrate optical modulators at nanoscale, and one of the first systematic explorations of graphene for all-optic modulation. The research results may revolutionize nanophotonic technology and on-chip optical interconnects, and will contribute the fundamental theory and techniques for newly developed Graphene Optoelectronics and Graphene and 2D Semiconductor Physics.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;Graphene is a topic that is of great interest to the general public. The outreach activity, "From Graphite to Graphene", will help STEM education by introducing K-12 students to the science and fabrication of nanotechnology for a wide range of applications. The students involved in this research will participate in nanotechnology development, and the results developed from the research activities will be incorporated into several college courses. Collaboration with external companies may commercialize valuable products for industrial and military applications. Under-represented students from Women in Engineering and North Star Program will be involved in this project.</AbstractNarration>
