    <AbstractNarration>1346751 &lt;br/&gt;Ukeiley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is being provided to facilitate participant travel to the American Physical Society, Division of Fluid Dynamics, 66th Annual DFD Meeting 2013 in Pittsburg, PA, November 24-26, 2013. This is the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamicists in the world, with 2,500 anticipated attendees. The meeting has been successfully run for over sixty years. The priorities of the travel grant program are to partially fund students, young scientists, and, in general, scientists from under-represented groups. The APS DFD Executive Committee plans to contribute $15,000 and the American Institute for Physics plans to contribute $10,000 to the overall budget for travel awards. This total amount expected is $45,000 to facilitate travel subsidies and registration fee coverage for about 65 participants. The chief intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid dynamics. The broader impact will be to increase participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs. Preference is given: (i) to those presenting talks at the meeting, (ii) to students, (iii) to those who have not received such an award in the past, and (iv) to no more than one applicant from a given research adviser. Since the awards are meant to supplement participant travel funds, not to cover these entirely, the committee takes into account the travel budget entered on the application. Special effort is made to achieve diverse participation from underrepresented groups in engineering, including women and members of minority groups.</AbstractNarration>
