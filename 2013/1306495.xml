    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this catalytic project is to strengthen a U.S.-Swedish collaboration between Principal Investigator Michael Fogle of Auburn University, in Alabama, and Richard Thomas at Stockholm University. Together, they will examine the dynamics of molecular dissociation under well controlled energy states and experimental scattering conditions. Their research plan involves conducting studies at the new double, electrostatic, ion storage ring facility in Stockholm, known as DESIREE (Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring ExperimEnt). The DESIREE facility is a unique ion storage ring that allows simultaneous storage of both cation and anion species, thereby permitting detailed investigations of many processes involving molecular ions. Results from the team?s early studies of dissociation dynamics in this system should contribute to broader understanding of similar processes in more complicated systems, with relevance to atomic and molecular physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration engages a U.S. graduate student and builds upon the PI?s research in electron-driven dissociation dynamics and his Swedish partner?s expertise in dissociation dynamics and interaction-specific rate constant measurements, particularly for astrophysics. By using the new ring facility to explore electron-driven dynamics in ion-ion charge exchange processes, the researchers expect to gain preliminary insights into negative ion chemistry in the upper atmosphere. Subsequent work at the DESIREE facility with its sensitive detectors is expected to help define direction for follow-on projects that can have broader impacts by adding to our basic understanding of change exchange mechanisms related to atmospheric chemistry, a wide array of complex carbon systems and biomolecules, as well as astrophysics. Furthermore, by participating in the initial ion-ion and ion-electron experiments at DESIREE, this timely developmental project should help to reinforce beneficial Europe-U.S. partnerships and open opportunities for future cooperative experiments at world class European facilities such as DESIREE and the Cryogenic Storage Ring, under construction in Germany.</AbstractNarration>
