    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to further develop large range nanopositioning technology. A nanopositioning system is a macro-scale motion system that is capable of nanometer-level precision, and is commonly used in scanning probe microscopy and lithography. Current nanopositioning systems are limited in their motion range to approximately 100 microns per axis, thereby restricting their use in some industrial applications. Research conducted by the project team has helped make large range (&gt;10mm) nanopositioning feasible via innovations and scientific advances in flexure bearings, sensors, actuators, and controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of this project are to further refine this nanopositioning technology to determine product specifications in terms of overall size, motion range, speed, precision and resolution that meet market needs and using this information, develop a detailed CAD design of the technology that leverages the team's on-going research with product-specifications that fit with societal needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A nanopositioning system is a macro-scale motion system comprising a flexure bearing, actuator(s), sensor(s), and feedback controls, and is capable of nanometer-level precision and resolution. It provides the scanning motion between a substrate and a probe in every scanning probe lithography and microscopy technique. Via previous and on-going research, the research team has established the feasibility of large-range (10mm) multi-axis (XY) nanopositioning. This represents a 100 times increase in stroke and 10,000 times increase in the scanning area coverage, compared to current technologies.</AbstractNarration>
