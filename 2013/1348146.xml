    <AbstractNarration>This award will support the participation of an early science career female scholar in the Northern Research Forum, which will be held in Akureyri, Iceland in the Fall 2013. The Northern Research Forum (NRF) holds an Open Assembly every two years. Each assembly focuses on a different theme of relevance to northerners and northern research. This years Assembly theme is Climate Change in Northern Territories: Sharing Experiences and Exploring New Methods, Assessing Socio-Economic Impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main objectives of the NRF is to promote the next generation of Arctic researchers by involving emerging scholars in leadership and by selecting a cohort of early career researchers to present their research projects and findings at the Open Assemblies. The aim is to engage early career researchers in dialogue with senior scientists and other professionals and experts as well as representatives of various stakeholder groups and the public. This proposal will support the involvement of an early science career scholar from the United States: Robin Bronen. She will join more than 20 other Young Researchers from other Arctic nations, offering an opportunity for exchange of ideas and network building. Dr. Bonen's participation will create an opportunity to contribute to the discussion on the impacts of environmental change in the Arctic and raise awareness about the policy challenges related to environmental change, community habitability, and population displacement. Through participation in the Northern Territories conference, the goal is to begin the process of creating an international research team focused on understanding the nexus between environmental change and population displacement in the Arctic.</AbstractNarration>
