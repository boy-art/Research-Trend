    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to evaluate the feasibility of customized next generation nanoscale technology which enables high volume manufacture of integrated circuits, leading to faster computing power and performance. Current progress in reaching next generation performance is limited by significant technical challenges in meeting high volume manufacturing requirements driving up the cost of electronics. These problems have plagued the industry for over 10 years. The research activity here considers alternative approaches in addressing the production rate issues which ultimately reduce cost to chipmakers and reduce energy consumption in the semiconductor industry, thereby providing greener high performance electronics at lower cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project are firstly to accelerate the arrival of next generation computing technology creating faster, smaller more powerful mobile devices and providing evolutionary advances in quality of life for a globally-social electronic community, and secondly to develop electronics which meet the world?s demand at reasonable cost and without substantial adverse impact on the environment, and thirdly to maintain the competitiveness in global supply and accessibility of next generation electronics.</AbstractNarration>
