    <AbstractNarration>Subjects that will be addressed in the conference cover all areas of electric propulsion (EP), such as: Hall Thrusters, Ion Thrusters, Field Emission and Colloid Thrusters, MPD (magneto-plasma dynamic) Thrusters, Pulsed Plasma Thrusters, Resistojets/Arcjets, Other electrothermal, electromagnetic or electrostatic thruster concepts, Innovative or advanced electric propulsion concepts, Cathode and other component and materials technologies, EP propellant feed systems, Power and power processing for EP systems. On any of the above concepts or systems the topics of interest include but are not limited to: Physics, Fundamental studies, Analytical Modeling, Numerical simulations, Laboratory and Space Testing, Diagnostics, Lifetime Characterization, Mission Analysis, Systems Analysis, Development Application, and In-flight experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future of the research field depends upon attracting bright young people. The IEPC has a strong tradition of encouraging and promoting student participation from all over the world. This award will provide partial travel support for PhD students to attend and present the results of their work at the meeting. Student travel award competition will be announced via the conference web site. Applicants will be asked to send their Abstract and letter of support from the research adviser. Applications will be reviewed by the Technical Committee. Preference will be given to women and underrepresented minorities. Scientific and technological advances will be aided by the interaction among students and the US and foreign participants.</AbstractNarration>
