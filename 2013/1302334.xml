    <AbstractNarration>The most significant performance and energy bottlenecks in a computer are&lt;br/&gt;often caused by the storage system, because the gap between storage device&lt;br/&gt;and CPU speeds is greater than in any other part of the machine. Big data&lt;br/&gt;and new storage media only make things worse, because today's systems are&lt;br/&gt;still optimized for legacy workloads and hard disks. The team at Stony&lt;br/&gt;Brook University, Harvard University, and Harvey Mudd College has shown that&lt;br/&gt;large systems are poorly optimized, resulting in waste that increases&lt;br/&gt;computing costs, slows scientific progress, and jeopardizes the nation's&lt;br/&gt;energy independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the team is examining modern workloads running on a variety of&lt;br/&gt;platforms, including individual computers, large compute farms, and a&lt;br/&gt;next-generation infrastructure, such as Stony Brook's Reality Deck, a&lt;br/&gt;massive gigapixel visualization facility. These workloads produce combined&lt;br/&gt;performance and energy traces that are being released to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, the team is applying techniques such as statistical feature&lt;br/&gt;extraction, Hidden Markov Modeling, data-mining, and conditional likelihood&lt;br/&gt;maximization to analyze these data sets and traces. The Reality Deck is&lt;br/&gt;used to visualize the resulting multi-dimensional performance/energy data&lt;br/&gt;sets. The team's analyses reveal fundamental phenomena and principles that&lt;br/&gt;inform future designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third, the findings from the first two efforts are being combined to develop&lt;br/&gt;new storage architectures that best balance performance and energy under&lt;br/&gt;different workloads when used with modern devices, such as solid-state&lt;br/&gt;drives (SSDs), phase-change memories, etc. The designs leverage the team's&lt;br/&gt;work on storage-optimized algorithms, multi-tier storage, and new optimized&lt;br/&gt;data structures.</AbstractNarration>
