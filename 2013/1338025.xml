    <AbstractNarration>This NSF award supports the Fourth Oklahoma Workshop on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), which will take place at Oklahoma State University (OSU), October 26-27, 2013. This workshop will feature several PDEs modeling fluids and geophysical fluids. Among them are the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation, the Boussinesq equations and the 3D Euler equations with special spatial symmetries. There are very exciting new developments on these PDEs in the last few years and significant progress has been made on many fundamental issues concerning these PDEs such as the global (in time) regularity problem. This workshop, inspired by these recent advances, strives to fulfill four major objectives: 1) to broadly disseminate the most recent advances in the focused research field; 2) to give local (Oklahoma and neighboring states) PDE researchers an opportunity to communicate directly with the leading experts and to expose themselves to the forefront research; 3) to provide a convenient platform for our graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, women and minorities to present their research results; and 4) to stimulate interactions and interdisciplinary collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PDEs are fundamental tools in understanding many fluid phenomena ranging from small scale blood flows to large-scale geophysical flows. The PDEs featured by this workshop have played important roles in many practical applications such as in the study of frontogenesis, the formation of sharp fronts between hot and cold air. This workshop aims to bring the state-of-the-art research in the focused research field to a broad audience in a timely fashion and to promote interactions and interdisciplinary collaborations between mathematicians and meteorologists including those in the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma. It is hoped that this workshop will help accelerate the incorporation of the present cutting-edge research into the modeling and simulation of sophisticated weather phenomena such as tornadoes.</AbstractNarration>
