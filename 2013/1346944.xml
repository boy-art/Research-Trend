    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to obtain quantitative data of nanoenergetics-enhanced ignition for lean combustion and to educate students on the combustion, nanoscience, plasmonics, and novel energy-related technology. Novel nanoenergetic materials have various appealing properties for combustion applications. The photothermal effect of nanoenergetics is initiated and controlled by a flash lamp. Localized Surface Plasmonics Resonance (LSPR) effects confine and enhance the optical energy within the nanoenergetic particles. The oxidation reactions of the particles are activated by the local temperature increase and provide additional energy to accelerate the chemical reactions for flame ignition. However many fundamental questions of photothermal ignition of nanoenergetics are still far from being solved. Here advanced in situ and ex situ diagnostic tools will be developed and utilized to gain quantitative understanding of LSPR enhanced active photothermal effects of nanoenergetics for lean combustion ignition, including photothermal ignition delay and photothermal minimum ignition energy of various fuel/nanoenergetics mixtures. The results may significantly increase our understanding of the nanoenergetics as a new fuel additive and/or a solid fuel. Reliable ignition of lean combustion may be achieved, reducing NOx emissions and pollutant formation in combustion systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students from minority and underrepresented groups will be recruited and supported in the project. The graduate student will work towards his Ph.D. degree. The PI will further develop graduate courses to make engineering education reflect the state-of-the-art in engineering practice.</AbstractNarration>
