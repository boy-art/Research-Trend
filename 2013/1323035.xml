    <AbstractNarration>This project is taking advantage of the previously-untapped synergy between extremely rapid microwave-assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) techniques and new pedagogical approaches to develop and evaluate a student-centered instructional approach for the sophomore-level organic laboratory. With the laboratory time gained through the use of MAOS, students now use a laboratory period for experimental design, analysis, debriefing, troubleshooting, and optimization, allowing for inquiry cycles that are both reflective of typical scientific practice and effective in promoting desirable cognitive outcomes. This approach has transformed organic laboratory instruction at Allegheny College, St. Mary's College, and Queensborough Community College, shifting the focus from verification to experimental design and collaborative construction of knowledge. Laboratory modules being developed and refined include an array of content designed for easy adoption and implementation, including student lab companion materials, pre-lab activities, and case studies; reagent and instrument prep sheets; instructor's guides; spectra of relevant compounds; and assessment rubrics. The project team is evaluating student thinking during lab, content learning, and attitudes toward science associated with the new instructional approach via analyses of pre- and post-treatment survey responses, classroom observations, student and faculty interviews, and student laboratory reports.</AbstractNarration>
