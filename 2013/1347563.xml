    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small-Business ERC Collaborative Opportunity transitioning agile broadband&lt;br/&gt;transmitter for integrated access networks to market will address the challenge of achieving high&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth (100+ Gb/s), low power, low cost wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical&lt;br/&gt;communications links of distances up to 2 km for applications such as data centers and&lt;br/&gt;aggregation networks. These links are necessary for next generation data center and&lt;br/&gt;supercomputing applications that are a focus of the CIAN ERC?s research.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will improve the lasers in these systems, which drive much of&lt;br/&gt;the cost, performance, and power requirements for the links, to meet current commercial&lt;br/&gt;specifications. The tunable VCSELs offer a 10X reduction in power and cost over conventional&lt;br/&gt;solutions and enable high bandwidth links within data centers that not economically feasible with&lt;br/&gt;current technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a drastic reduction in the cost&lt;br/&gt;and energy requirements of optical links inside of data centers and supercomputers. Companies&lt;br/&gt;such as Google, Microsoft and other large data-centric companies have been clamoring for this&lt;br/&gt;type of product in the last year to maintain the rate of growth in their data center facilities.&lt;br/&gt;Present WDM laser array solutions using DFB lasers require 10X the power and 10X the cost of&lt;br/&gt;a VCSEL-based approach and are not economically feasible. Present 850-nm VCSEL-based&lt;br/&gt;links, on the other hand, cannot be made into a WDM source without power-hungry TEC coolers&lt;br/&gt;due to their lack of precise, gridded, wavelength control, limiting the overall link speed. Using a&lt;br/&gt;1550 nm tunable VCSEL solves both the problem of gridded wavelength control and allows the&lt;br/&gt;use of low cost single mode fiber and the developed infrastructure for 1550 nm WDM optical&lt;br/&gt;links. The realization of tunable VCSELs in WDM systems will result in a 10X reduction in&lt;br/&gt;both cost and energy requirements in high-speed optical links for data centers, enabling the&lt;br/&gt;further scaling of computational power for next generation data center and supercomputer&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the technological impact, this collaboration program will offer CIAN students&lt;br/&gt;insight and experience with the real world commercial product development process. The&lt;br/&gt;students will be testing and giving feedback into the product development process, enhancing&lt;br/&gt;their educational experience. The enhanced capabilities of the VCSELs will enable new&lt;br/&gt;applications and enhance CIAN in it?s mission of supporting transparency wherever possible&lt;br/&gt;with flexible wavelength conversion and optical switches, and supporting dynamically&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurable heterogeneous traffic in the network.</AbstractNarration>
