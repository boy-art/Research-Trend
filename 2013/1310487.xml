    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to investigate and implement a new paradigm for optical design based on artificial materials determined by design. The approach is to generate infinitely refraction-linear artificial materials (IRAM) that maintain a linear relationship between incident and refracted angles over a large field of view. As a result, they are attractive to enhance performance, simplify design, and reduce form factor in highly non-paraxial and three-dimensional optics. IRAM are also attractive for creating new functionalities in integrated photonics.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit - Classical optical imaging systems consist of a series of refracting surfaces interfacing among homogeneous isotropic materials. Traditional optical design aims at correcting aberrations via multiple surface and material systems that meet a set of performance requirements. Modern lens design can also take advantage of aspheric, graded index, diffractive or holographic lenses to reduce aberrations and overall complexity and size. However, designs are still based on ray tracing optimizations over hundreds of dimensions that typically result in tradeoffs in terms of performance, size, weight, and form factor. The paradigm proposed here provides new degrees of freedom at the material level that enable simpler designs and dramatically simplifies the design process.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - IRAM open up the possibility of exploring novel applications in integrated and free space photonics with vast economic potential. For instance, the approach is attractive for application in light/compact infrared imagers that outperform classical multi-element designs. The project integrates education and outreach, for instance by providing training opportunities for a diverse cadre of young students.</AbstractNarration>
