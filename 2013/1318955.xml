    <AbstractNarration>The digital provenance of a digital object gives a history of its life cycle including its creation, update, and access. It thus provides meta-level information about the sequence of events that lead up to the current version of the object, as well as its chain of custody. Such provenance information can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying the origins of a document, assessing the quality or reliability of data, and detecting undesirable actions such as forgery or unauthorized alteration of data. However, all of these practical uses of provenance information presuppose that the provenance system is secure, i.e. that provenance data is collected, processed, and stored in a manner that ensures its confidentiality and integrity. Without such guarantees, users can get an incorrect impression of document authenticity, potentially with significant real-world consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the design of secure provenance collection systems where the collected meta-data can be relied upon even in light of realistic insider attack models. Security, however, is not sufficient; a practical system must also be efficient even when large amounts of fine-grained provenance data needs to be stored and processed. The project is aimed at addressing both issues through the following three objectives. (1) Techniques for continuously updatable software tamperproofing to ensure the integrity of the system itself. (2) Techniques for robust, continuous marking, collusion-free, text fingerprinting to mitigate document leakage. (3) Techniques for anonymous storage on untrusted storage servers to allow for efficient storage and access of fine-grained provenance data.</AbstractNarration>
