    <AbstractNarration>Non Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;The new compounds developed in this project serve several purposes. They can be further incorporated into electronic and opto-electronic materials that are of interest to the semiconductor industry. Exquisite details about how electrons move around within these molecules will enable scientists to develop better electrochemical catalysts for processes closely related to renewable energy such as hydrogen production and carbon dioxide fixation. In addition, Professor Ren and his students will develop new teaching modules that reflect the heightened interest in sustainable chemistry for Purdue's Science Express program, which delivers laboratory equipment sets to high schools in the rural areas that lack resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Tong Ren and coworkers at Purdue University will explore the synthetic chemistry of cross-conjugated carbon rich organometallics based on the frameworks of [M]-bridge-[M], where [M] is either a diruthenium species supported by N,N'-bidentate ligands, or cyclam complexes of 3d metals such as Cr, Fe and Co, and the bridge is either geminal-hex-3-ene-1,5-diyne (gem-DEE), or its derivatives. Specific aims include (1) the synthesis and characterization of diruthenium-(gem-DEE)-diruthenium type compounds and oligomeric derivatives; (2) the synthesis and characterization of M(cyclam)-(gem-DEE)-M(cyclam) type complexes with M as Cr, Fe or Co; and (3) the elaboration of electronic couplings between metal units across the cross-conjugated bridge. This research project will involve a team of talented graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. Professor Ren and students will also be intimately involved with Purdue's Science Express program.</AbstractNarration>
