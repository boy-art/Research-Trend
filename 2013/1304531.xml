    <AbstractNarration>The Geospatial Technology (GST) Advantage project is preparing GST technicians and GST-enabled graduates for opportunities with southern Illinois businesses, industries and government entities. GST is a growing area of study that provides the skills needed for success in an ever expanding array of occupations. In conjunction with regional employers and educators, the project is: (1) establishing certificate and degree programs in GST while utilizing pilot-testing and evaluating a nationally recognized curriculum based on the Geospatial Technology Competency Model (GTCM) developed by the GeoTech Center; (2) providing GST field internship opportunities for Kaskaskia College students; (3) incorporating GST into STEM classes at the college and regional high schools; (4) conducting outreach events targeting students and teachers as well as leaders of business, industries and communities to share information about geospatial technology including educational opportunities and potential uses; and (5) utilizing a GST Regional Advisory Board to help guide the project, provide assistance and enhance partnerships and career pathways. The curriculum being pilot-tested in the project is furthering the knowledge and understanding of geospatial technology within the GST community as well as in broader fields. This is leading to an educational approach that can be adopted by other institutions nationwide and one that provides pathways for inclusion of GST into STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
