    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the feasibility of translating novel visual tests of cognitive dysfunction to clinical practice. There is a strong need for tests that are both effective enough and efficient enough to be used as screening/monitoring tools. The proposed visual tests are designed to meet this need by uniquely combining advanced techniques from psychometrics &amp; neuroscience. The Phase I plan is to perform real and simulated case-control studies in order to quantify the tradeoff between test effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed innovation is expected to substantially improve test efficiency with no loss or even gain in effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to significantly improve outcomes for individuals with cognitive dysfunction while reducing healthcare costs. Cognitive dysfunction is a hallmark of common behavioral disorders, leading to substantial human suffering and societal costs. The proposed technology platform will enable safe, effective and efficient testing of cognitive dysfunction. Other applications include cognitive training for both clinical and healthy populations, such as athletes, drivers, and baggage screeners. The proposed tests could also help elucidate the causal links between brain abnormalities, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral disruptions.</AbstractNarration>
