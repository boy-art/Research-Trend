    <AbstractNarration>The ``2nd International Workshop on Nonlinear and Modern Mathematical Physics" will take place March 9-11, 2013, at the University of South Florida. The primary goals of this mathematics research conference are to survey recent advances on a wide range of topics of current interest in the field of nonlinear mathematical physics, to promote new collaborations in the research community, and to bring together mathematicians and physicists to understand nonlinear phenomena and solve nonlinear problems. The topics of the main lectures will reflect the major current developments in the areas of solvability and integrability of nonlinear problems in mathematical physics, which include, but are not limited to, integrable and near-integrable equations, physical and engineering applications such as nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates and fluid dynamics, numerical aspects of nonlinear phenomena, and related areas. This conference will bring a unique international forum to the South Florida region, and will be a catalyst for new, cross-disciplinary synergies in this flourishing research area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear phenomena occur everywhere in daily life, but the so-called nonlinear mathematical problems that model such phenomena are very difficult to solve either theoretically or numerically. Two important settings for nonlinear problems are global warming and communication systems. The ``2nd International Workshop on Nonlinear and Modern Mathematical Physics" aims to make progress in the understanding and solution of nonlinear problems by promoting new synergies among researchers in different fields. The workshop will feature multidisciplinary lectures on emerging topics and arising challenges of broad scope, from classical mathematical physics to contemporary mathematical physics. Emphasis will be placed in involving junior faculty and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, women and minorities. The workshop will provide significant opportunities for education and public outreach to a broad audience from various branches of mathematics, physics and engineering sciences.</AbstractNarration>
