    <AbstractNarration>The proposed innovation is for a robust, low-cost positioning and localization system that is suitable for use in non-factory manufacturing environments. The system combines focused-beam sonar sensor information with kinematic/dynamic model estimates of the local platform to provide simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) information. This system is well suited for manufacturing in which GPS is not available, and addresses many of the limitations in current mobile robot positioning systems based on Lidar (Laser Interferometry Detection and Ranging) scanning or vision. Acoustic-based systems are much more robust in non-factory manufacturing environments but are not commonly used in mobile robot positioning systems because of the wide scan field associated with a single sensor. The proposed innovation will provide local processing capability dedicated to each sensor to collect feature information that can then be incorporated into the overall localization strategy. The proposed device will enhance the mechanization platforms that currently exist with basic positioning capability allowing improved performance by the operator and will open up new capabilities for machine control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this technology can have a significant impact on improving the productivity of workers in non-factory manufacturing environments. Historically, this industry has seen little application of technology that has revolutionized many other industries (factory automation, etc.). Field maintenance, fabrication and assembly has not seen the productivity gains of their factory based cousins. Field workers are less productive, subject to more injuries and have shorter careers. This effort will provide innovations to directly address enhanced productivity tools for these workers. Further, it enhances the productivity of many related developments in robotics intelligent machines for these industries. These tools make non-factory manufacturing safer, more productive, require greater skills, and promote the profession of manufacturing in the US.</AbstractNarration>
