    <AbstractNarration>This project will build upon the successful development of models, algorithms, and software for planning and job scheduling systems developed during previous NSF research. The product is designed to allow organizations to schedule their operations in real-time and generate the optimal plan to maximize their operational targets. Through prior research, the project team created new planning and scheduling algorithms, a software prototype, and successful empirical studies using the newly developed methodology of Nested Partitions. After creating and proving this methodology, the team plans to further develop the technology for widespread use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed scheduling and planning tool could enable companies to communicate, collaborate, and integrate their planning and scheduling functionalities to obtain optimal results throughout their enterprise and their entire supply chain. It is expected that coordinated use of these tools could eventually create an integrated cyber-infrastructure for American manufacturing firms and create more efficient supply chains through the use of effective scheduling that will enable these firms to be more competitive and flexible in the global marketplace.</AbstractNarration>
