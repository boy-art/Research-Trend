    <AbstractNarration>The upper atmosphere is defined as the region of Earth's atmosphere that separates the lower atmosphere and the interplanetary environment. Important and complex chemical and dynamical processes take place in this region, particularly in the exosphere, where the terrestrial atmosphere literally merges with interplanetary space. Understanding the processes that govern the coupling, energetics, and dynamics of the upper atmosphere requires observations of its mean state and its response to external forcing. These observations will provide important constraints in developing a complete picture of the space-atmosphere system. Although the terrestrial exosphere is populated by a number of atomic and molecular species, neutral atomic hydrogen is increasingly dominant with altitude and present throughout. The vertical distribution of atomic hydrogen in the upper atmosphere and its vertical transport flux are recognized as important parameters in understanding upper atmospheric chemistry, charge exchange between the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere, and coupling between atmospheric regions. Unfortunately, few direct determinations of these parameters have been achieved. This leaves important questions incompletely answered: What is the distribution of atomic hydrogen in the thermosphere and exosphere? How does that distribution respond to external forcing? Is the upward flux of hydrogen from the mesosphere constant or variable? What are the exospheric particle populations and velocity distributions (satellite, ballistic and escaping components)? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is called INSpIRe, for "Investigate the Near Space Interaction Region." It is a five year career development plan to: (1) integrate two state-of-the-art second generation Fabry-Perot annular summing spectrometers into a remotely operable facility; (2) deploy this instrumentation to a clear-air site, establishing a stable, well-calibrated observing platform; (3) embark on a series of observations specifically designed to contribute to three major areas of geocoronal research, i.e., geocoronal physics, structure/coupling, and variability; (4) establish an adaptable facility capable of contributing to many areas of terrestrial aeronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From integration to implementation, initiative INSpIRe will provide a platform to encourage and educate the next generation of researchers and a venue to apply knowledge gained in the classroom to real-world science and engineering challenges. Initiative INSpIRe will open new avenues for undergraduate participation in research through active learning, encourage undergraduate students to pursue independent research early in their careers, enhance the growing Ph.D. program in Engineering Physics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), and involve the public in the wonder of discovery through open house events, tours, and demonstrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When fully operational, initiative INSpIRe will also be capable of contributing to many areas of optical aeronomy beyond the core scientific focus of this study. The unique capabilities of the Fabry-Perot instruments assembled as part of initiative INSpIRe afford opportunities to extend aeronomical research into the related field of planetary aeronomy, opening new avenues for research and community involvement.</AbstractNarration>
