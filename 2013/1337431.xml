    <AbstractNarration>The global market for a synthetic biology industry is predicted to grow to $10.8 billion by 2016, with the largest share of growth in the chemicals and energy sectors. A preliminary inventory compiled by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars indicates a broad array of products moving towards commercialization over the next five years. Inevitably, some of the applications necessitate the intentional release of synthetically engineered organisms into the environment. There is a need to address the potential risk to the environment and society from large-scale production scenarios using synthetically modified organisms. This project takes advantage of an opportunity to develop, fund, and execute an interdisciplinary research agenda that will enable a broader understanding of the evolutionary and ecological implications of synthetic biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project seeks to bring together the "upstream" scientists that develop synthetic biology applications and the "downstream" scientists who focus on risk assessment. Traditionally, these groups have somewhat diverging perceptions of the technologies and the potential risk they pose. A key aspect of this workshop is to explore funding models for synthetic biology that incorporate direct input from evolutionary and environmental biologists. The hope is that these interactions will lead to the development of environmentally benign organisms capable of producing useful bio products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The expectation is that the project will first, build productive, on-going collaborations between synthetic biology researchers and evolutionary biologists, ecologists, and environmental scientists, to assess the knowledge gaps and uncertainties related to the ecological impacts of synthetic biology. Second, the project will create a research agenda for the ecological implications of synthetic biology based on existing, near-, and long-term applications of engineered organisms and achieve buy-in and support for the research from key stakeholder groups. Ultimately, the proposed activities should help ensure that synthetic biology investments achieve broad societal benefits while mitigating potential environmental risks.</AbstractNarration>
