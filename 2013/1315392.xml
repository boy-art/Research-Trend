    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study the feasibility of developing a novel weed control and moisture conservation (WCMC) mat from recycled diapers for tree protection. Disposable diapers are the most disposed household products in United States and contribute more than 2% to municipal solid waste. The majority of disposed diapers are currently accumulated in landfill fields. By capitalizing on many of the unique features of disposable diapers, the WCMC tree mat product will promote the growth of young trees, protects against drought stress, and allows reforestation/afforestation in arid or semiarid areas, on degraded soils, and on wastelands. It can also reduce water usage and maintenance costs for urban forests. The WCMC product will permit maximum usage of limited water resources by its strong water retention capability and by its suppression of weed growth. Investigations will be carried out on the effectiveness of this product in protecting young trees against drought conditions, the feasibility of using low-cost and environmentally benign manufacturing technologies, and the potential environmental impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be threefold. If successful, it will enable 1) reduction in solid waste accumulation, 2) faster, easier, and cheaper afforestation / reforestation processes; and 3) reduced environmental impacts. The commercial potential of the WCMC products will be global, and will focus on usage in arid/semiarid as well as urban areas. The WCMC products can serve markets including weed barrier, garden mulch, fruit and nuts tree care, and urban forestation and landscaping. The estimated market size is about $1.2-1.9 billion. This product will help trees survive through drought stresses with less water consumption and less after-planting care. It will naturally lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and increased carbon sequestration, and to a reduction in the carbon, nitrogen and water footprints.</AbstractNarration>
