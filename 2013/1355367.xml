    <AbstractNarration>This award enables support for the Workshop on Future Wireless Communication Networks. This workshop will bring together wireless networking experts who will discuss and debate the critical challenges in wireless networking and communication, and articulate a vision for conducting fundamental and inter-disciplinary research in the area. A tangible outcome of the workshop will be a report that will (i) identify major issues affecting future wireless research; (ii) expose the research community to new and exciting inter-disciplinary problems; and (iii) stimulate far-reaching future research initiatives, and collaborations that would help along the evolution of the wireless research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will help influence future research and development in wireless systems. It will fuel inter-disciplinary collaborations between members of various communities (e.g., application communities, security, information theory, etc.). It will enable diverse groups within the community will help shape the future of wireless communications. It will also educate the general public on the importance of wireless research, the challenges, and the enormous potential.</AbstractNarration>
