    <AbstractNarration>The Hope College Nuclear Group is studying neutron-rich unstable nuclei near the drip-line with the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) and Large area multi-Institutional Scintillation Array (LISA) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and is applying a variety of nuclear techniques (e.g. Particle Induced X-Ray Emission, Rutherford BackScattering, Nuclear Reaction Analysis, and Ion Beam Induced Luminescence) to a range of interdisciplinary questions with the Hope Ion Beam Analysis Laboratory (HIBAL). In addition, work to harvest isotopes with medical and stewardship applications is moving from development to production. This award supports two faculty in both of these efforts, each of whom will include undergraduate researchers in all aspects of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students and faculty are investigating unstable neutron-rich nuclei to refine the theoretical understanding of light, neutron-rich nuclei. The group is measuring the excited states of 9He and the ground state of 13Be with the MoNA/LISA/Sweeper system at the NSCL. The interdisciplinary portion of the research involves developing techniques to harvest isotopes of strategic and medical interest at the NSCL and future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) and examining, with HIBAL, metalloprotein stoichiometry, forensic characterization of layered automotive paints, forensic comparison of auto glass fragments, and luminescence studies of feldspars and carbonates. Collaborators include other Hope researchers (characterizing structured nanomaterials) and groups outside Hope College (metal contamination in sediment, river sediment origins, and flame retardants). All of these initiatives are important for the specific science result they yield and for possible far-reaching impact on the analytical techniques used in many areas. The Hope College Nuclear Group has demonstrated its ability to carry out similar research for a number of years, and the new experiments are designed to match our interests and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, this project has a significant impact on a large number of undergraduate researchers. Experience shows that undergraduate research enhances a student's education and better prepares the student for graduate work or for a wide variety of STEM careers in either industry or academia.</AbstractNarration>
