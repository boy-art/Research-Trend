    <AbstractNarration>1315960 (Guy). This symposium will bring together the most innovative practices in design, education and research for current and future reuse and recycling of material resources in the building environment. The primary audience will be researchers, educators, practitioners and advanced university students. The symposium will take place April 11-13, 2013 at The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C. Resources used in the building environment result in large quantities of extraction and processing waste, pollution and energy-use, and in the current paradigm are in turn typically wasted in equally large quantities in the processes of renovation and demolition. This symposium will convene educators and researchers in architecture and engineering programs for presentations, discussions, formation of collaborative networks, and the production of knowledge in the form of a proceeding and a book as a resource for educators, students and researchers. Symposium sessions will be dedicated to pedagogy for resourceful design theory and processes. Under-represented groups will be encouraged to participate via the offer of scholarships based on need and diversity. A sign language interpreter will be provided for all keynote presentations. It is the intent to involve universities from across the USA and internationally in developing partnerships for future research and development of education knowledge infrastructure. The symposium information will be disseminated via a website, an electronic proceeding and a book. The book will be a resource for faculty and students interested in these topics as well as community based or government agencies involved in policies for environmental protection and community development.</AbstractNarration>
