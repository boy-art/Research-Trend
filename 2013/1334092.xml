    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on a major enhancement of gait retraining in stroke patients and improvement of orthotic intervention in the clinical settings. Researchers have developed a wearable and portable smart training orthosis that could be used by patients throughout daily activities, with constant reinforcement of the targeted gait pattern. The trainer targets both the primary and secondary gait deviations. This constant reinforcement of gait retraining in a real-world environment has the potential to provide more effective and faster gait retraining, improving one's ability to ambulate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will investigate the feasibility of providing to hospitals and clinics advanced technology, in order to better facilitate stroke patients' recovery of motor function for better quality of life. A major portion of the project will focus on the understanding of the relevant issues in healthcare with respect to neuro-rehabilitation. As a result of this project, researchers hope to develop a sustainable model for providing the healthcare providers with advanced robotic devices for rehabilitation of patients post-stroke. This in turn could have a broader impact on the quality of life of thousands of stroke victims.</AbstractNarration>
