    <AbstractNarration>Proficiency in technical writing is a highly desirable attribute for engineering graduates, and improvement of communication skills among undergraduate engineering students can help enhance the competitiveness of U.S. technical talent in an increasingly global engineering market. This project responds to the need for improved communication skills in engineering by directly addressing challenges associated with incorporating writing-based instructional techniques in traditional technical classes. More specifically, the goals of this project are to develop, validate, and disseminate high-impact, scalable techniques for integrating writing in existing engineering courses and curricula. The project particularly seeks to address common instructor-level challenges that often preclude the inclusion of writing in engineering coursework. This project is primarily focused on required, large-lecture engineering courses where writing typically does not occur, and where ample opportunities exist to train faculty to implement simple, scalable writing activities, exercises, and related assessments. This study will involve systematic investigation of how such activities can potentially enhance student learning of both writing and course-specific technical skills. The project will also survey faculty and staff at multiple institutions to evaluate current attitudes toward writing in engineering, while identifying the most scalable and sustainable writing interventions from the standpoint of instructors and institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project brings together an interdisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise spanning multiple disciplines and areas of activity, including engineering (civil and electrical/computer), technical communication, active and experiential learning, and engineering education research. The project proposes innovative application of writing interventions that have been proven effective in other contexts, with the goal of transforming core courses in engineering to enhance the technical capabilities and writing skills of participating students. Increased emphasis on writing in engineering education may also broaden participation and increase retention of underrepresented groups (particularly women and linguistic minorities), including by helping to contextualize and make more relevant the technical courses and topics that comprise much of current engineering curricula.</AbstractNarration>
