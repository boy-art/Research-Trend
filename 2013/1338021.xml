    <AbstractNarration>Pinkhassik&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Instrumentation Program supports the acquisition of an advanced Raman instrument for the NanoCenter at Saint Louis University. In recent years, a cluster of investigators formed at Saint Louis University with a strong research focus on nanoscale materials and surface phenomena. The instrument will support multiple research projects requiring regular access to a Raman spectroscopy system. This new instrument will support innovative multidisciplinary projects and will contribute to diverse educational and training activities. The main themes of the planned research are developing and implementing novel methods of synthesis and assembly of micro and nanoscale materials and hybrid structures, creating functional nanodevices, and understanding decoherence in solid state quantum computing devices. Researchers will use Raman Spectroscopy, a nondestructive approach, to study specific designs, geometries, and chemical compositions of structures and devices of interest. The multidisciplinary team of scientists at Saint Louis University is highly qualified to conduct the proposed research activities. The new Raman instrument will enable research leading to technologies beneficial to society, such as selective nanosensors, efficient nanoreactors, and new energetic materials. Understanding the structure of nano-carbon materials and materials for quantum computing will contribute to rapidly evolving areas of fundamental research. This instrument will be an integral part of the interdisciplinary educational curriculum across several departments and colleges at Saint Louis University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;******&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports the acquisition of an advanced Raman spectrometer at Saint Louis University. The instrument will become one of the core instruments of the newly established NanoCenter to support multiple research and education activities of a diverse group of beginning and established scientists. The main research areas supported by this instrument are centered on creation and understanding of nanoscale materials. Research involving this new instrument will span fundamental studies and development of new technologies beneficial to society, such as nanoreactors, nanosensors, and energetic materials. This instrument will be an integral part of the interdisciplinary educational curriculum across several departments and colleges at Saint Louis University. It will contribute to training activities at the NanoCenter and an Interdisciplinary Graduate Science Program. The access to this instrument will contribute to a targeted outreach program designed to increase participation of underrepresented groups in science.</AbstractNarration>
