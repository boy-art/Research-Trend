    <AbstractNarration>People constantly learn from those in their social worlds. Although these teachers are often close to their students (similar to themselves, living nearby, located in the same time period, etc.), they can also be far away: socially distant, spatially distant, and even temporally distant. This research tests the hypothesis that concrete knowledge is more easily learned from nearby teachers, while abstract knowledge is more readily learned from distant teachers. To accomplish this, the PIs will examine the role of proximity on the conceptualization of knowledge and on the effectiveness of different types of learning. The proposed research has practical implications for teaching in a wide variety of contexts; from parents teaching children, to schools looking to foster abstract thinking. A practical and policy implication of this work is that there may be types of knowledge (e.g., abstract concepts) in which students may actually learn better when an instructor is distant (e.g., distance learning or online courses). Overall, the societal benefits of the proposed research will provide clear guidance on future innovations in America's educational system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is based on Construal Level Theory which posits that people's ability to conceptualize objects and events varies by the psychological proximity of this information. The researchers will investigate, in addition to proximity, whether the effectiveness of an instructor will also vary by the types knowledge gained: 1) concrete knowledge (i.e., "volunteering at the animal shelter"); or 2) abstract knowledge (i.e., "caring about the well-being of abandoned cats and dogs"). The researchers will examine the role of proximity (social, spatial, or temporal distance) and the level of abstraction of knowledge gained on two modes of instruction: 1) learning through imitation or modeling; and 2) learning transfer. The results will contribute to a broader understanding of how people learn from those around them and how the effects of psychological distance on social learning depend on the nature of what is learned and how it is learned.</AbstractNarration>
