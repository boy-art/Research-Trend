    <AbstractNarration>PI: Monroe, Charles&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1336387&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Michigan Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;Title: GOALI: Experimentally validated multiscale modeling of Li/O2 cathodes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration project between the University of Michigan (UM) and Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center (Bosch RTC) will focus on development of robust multiscale models of rechargeable Li/air cathodes. A viable Li/air battery would speed efforts to electrify transportation. Conservative projections suggest that Li/air stacks could achieve energy densities near 1 kWh/kg. This allows single-charge driving distances of 400 miles, matching combustion-driven cars. The PIs propose to show what phenomena most impact Li/air cell performance by informing predictive continuum electrochemical models with electronic structure calculations and experimental data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hybrid multi-scale modeling/experimental approach will elucidate discharge/charge mechanisms, voltage response, and performance of rechargeable aprotic Li/air cells. The team combines expertise in continuum modeling, ab initio computation, and experimental electrochemical and structural characterization. The academic/industrial collaboration will support the Energy for Sustainability Program objective to improve the fundamental understanding of advanced energy-storage technologies for transportation, for two primary research objectives: (1) to develop a flexible, experimentally benchmarked multi-scale modeling framework. Simulations will incorporate both experimental measurements and ab initio predictions of material properties into a predictive continuum-scale Li/air cell model with a 3-phase cathode structure; and (2) to use the modeling framework to identify, quantify, and predict performance-limiting phenomena in rechargeable Li/air cells. The mechanistic insight gained will reveal strategies to overcome limitations and accelerate development of viable Li/air batteries for vehicles. Simultaneous theoretical and experimental efforts will parameterize and validate the multi-scale theoretical model, reliant on molecular-scale thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport properties, to simulate the macroscopic response of Li/air cells during discharge or charge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach will improve the field?s limited knowledge about elementary reaction mechanisms in Li/air-battery cathodes, and will correlate atomic-scale bulk and interfacial material properties with cell-level performance metrics such as accessible capacity, rate capability, and efficiency. Building on a current collaboration with Li/air researchers at Bosch RTC, scientific exchanges will be strengthened by student internship experiences at Bosch and visits of Bosch researchers to UM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outreach activities will foster the natural connection between research and pedagogy. Here the chief aim is to establish a collaborative, diverse environment for electrochemical research to achieve four primary educational goals: (1) Integration of research problems into a course module in a graduate Electrochemical Engineering course, webcast simultaneously to reach students seeking technical degrees; (2) Exposure of undergraduates to energy-storage technology by offering undergraduate research opportunities and developing forums outside the classroom for idea exchange; (3) Outreach to support participation by under-represented minorities and women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and (4) Dissemination of research products via peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and biweekly meetings with UM metal/air battery researchers.</AbstractNarration>
