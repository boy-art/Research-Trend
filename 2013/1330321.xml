    <AbstractNarration>While precursors proteins were thought to be transported into plant chloroplasts in an unfolded conformation, recent discoveries indicate that this question is far from settled. The mechanism of protein import into chloroplasts will be probed and the conformation of precursor proteins will be monitored as they are being imported. Fluorescent probes that are sensitive to their local environment will be used to monitor the conformation of substrate proteins as they are captured in the chloroplast import machinery and to determine the size limits of the channels through which import occurs. The upper size limit of the chloroplast import mechanism will be probed using gold particles of fixed sizes.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: A program entitled "Fellowships in Molecular Biology at UC-Davis" will bring two college-bound students from the River City High School in West Sacramento to participate in this project for four weeks during each of the two summers of the funding period. Students will be nominated by their AP biology teachers and will work on projects that can be completed in four weeks. Local high school students will be hosted for their Biotechnology class internship during the spring quarter, and a Young Scholars Program student will have the opportunity to work on this project during the summers.</AbstractNarration>
