    <AbstractNarration>The Eco-DAS (Ecological Dissertations in the Aquatic Sciences) symposia bring together individuals within 1 year of receiving their PhD in the aquatic sciences. Previous symposia were held&amp;#8232;in 2008, 2010 and 2012. To date, this award has supported 107 participants and 10 mentors.&lt;br/&gt;This project will continue the Eco-DAS series with three new symposia to be held in 2014,&amp;#8232; 2016 and 2018. Each symposium will support approximately 35 participants and up to 5 mentors, and will result in publication of a formal proceedings volume. The project will pay &amp;#8232;the direct costs of the symposia (travel, accomodations, food, event coordination), for preparation&amp;#8232; of the symposium proceedings, and for evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The proposed symposia will:&amp;#8232; &lt;br/&gt;1. Foster sustained, cross-disciplinary interactions among top new researchers in ecological oceanography and limnology.&amp;#8232; &lt;br/&gt;2. Help to build a trusted network of colleagues with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and&amp;#8232; expertise.&amp;#8232; &lt;br/&gt;3. Challenge participants to explore new ideas with self-organized author teams of their peers.&amp;#8232; &lt;br/&gt;4. Familiarize new researchers with the diversity of research funding, and introduce them&amp;#8232; to representatives of funding agencies with whom they will interact in future.&amp;#8232; &lt;br/&gt;5. Foster mentor relationships with more established scientists. &amp;#8232;&lt;br/&gt;6. Address the requirements for professional success of new researchers through targeted discussions. &lt;br/&gt;7. Provide valuable feedback to the funding agencies by identifying needs and recommending directions for future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;Formal evaluations indicate that the Eco-DAS symposia significantly increase career confidence of the participants. Eco-DAS dramatically increases participants? access to a network of&amp;#8232;trusted expertise, including their peer group as well as senior and near-peer mentors. This trusted network also enables participants to investigate alternative possibilities for a productive science career. Participants meet NSF program managers and have the opportunity to ask direct questions regarding funding opportunities and the funding process. They engage in discussion of emerging issues in the aquatic sciences, and provide feedback to NSF. Participants receive training in team leadership, and instruction and practical experience with collaboration tools.&lt;br/&gt;For many, this is their first experience with leading or even working in a collaborative team&amp;#8232;of equals. Interdisciplinary collaborations are actively encouraged through the publication &amp;#8232;of a formal proceedings volume for each symposium. The proceedings chapters are not merely tools to encourage collaboration: they are a substantive contribution to science, and benefit &amp;#8232;the participants by disseminating their creative ideas. The three additional symposia are very likely to have a significant positive impact on more than 100 new aquatic scientists.</AbstractNarration>
