    <AbstractNarration>Wesley College (Wesley) is implementing a project entitled "Supporting and Sustaining Achievement in Science &amp; Math" which will provide 136 scholarships to recruit and retain diverse, academically talented, and financially needy students (Cannon Scholars) who can thrive in robust science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs. Targeted majors are biological chemistry, biology, environmental science and mathematics. The objectives are to: (1) increase the number of students choosing the Wesley STEM majors by at least 20%; (2) retain at least 75% of the Cannon Scholars in STEM majors until the senior year; (3) graduate at least 75% of the Cannon Scholars with BS degrees in STEM areas (who will then then continue on to graduate schools in a STEM area or enter the scientific or technical workforce); and (4) upon graduation, at least 60% of Cannon Scholars will enter graduate or professional programs. Anticipated broader impacts include an increased ability to seek out, attract, prepare, and graduate financially needy students, including minorities who are typically underrepresented in STEM fields. Strong undergraduate research and education collaborations have been established with Delaware State University (a Historically Black University), the University of Delaware (the state's flagship institution), and with Delaware's Community College System. Scholar graduates will pursue STEM professional careers, preferably in Delaware, or pursue advanced degrees in their fields. Wesley programs have a record of successful mentoring underrepresented groups; this project will maintain this productive work and continue to shape and benefit students, their careers, and their future impacts on society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cannon Scholar program is truly a collaborative effort between STEM-faculty and administrators. It is designed around the best practice of multi-tiered mentoring and is committed to proven practices that help support and retain students. The proposed program will create a nurturing environment where participating undergraduates can team up to solve problems, develop new knowledge and continuously acquire new skills, thereby increasing success in the early years and increasing the likelihood that these Scholars will graduate. Wesley will offer scholars one-on-one counseling, assessment and review sessions for job readiness, interview skills, and résumé writing. Hence, in addition to financially supporting students, this program aims to help foster a community that equips students with the skills and credentials required to move forward toward a thriving STEM career. The proposed approaches will significantly enhance well-defined institutional retention initiatives and will substantially increase student success and retention for STEM students. The program will be assessed and attainment of its objectives will be evaluated using common rubrics in courses targeting specific learning outcomes, surveys, student data (e.g. demographics, grade point average, etc.). Program outcomes will first be implemented throughout the Wesley's STEM programs and then will be disseminated through journal publications and presentations at national conferences.</AbstractNarration>
