    <AbstractNarration>We are investigating the subsurface structure of fault zones using a variety of seismic phases: surface waves, body waves, fault zone head waves, and fault zone trapped waves. By using a larger portion of the recorded seismic wavefield, we should be able to better resolve the fault zone structures to which the waves are sensitive. We use an adjoint-based tomographic inversion technique that relies on highly accurate, three-dimensional seismic wavefield simulations. The study has the following three components: (1) simulations of synthetic seismograms in realistic, complex 3D fault zone models, including clarifying the allowable ranges of geometrical and material variations that produce the observed characteristics of recorded head and trapped waves; (2) analysis of volumetric sensitivities of various fault zone, body, and surface phases to key fault zone structures at depth; (3) iterative adjoint tomographic inversions for the structures of the San Andreas fault near Parkfield and different sections of the San Jacinto fault zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large damaging earthquakes originate on faults kilometers below Earth's surface. A detailed characterization of the physical setting where earthquakes nucleate and rupture has not yet been achieved. By modeling seismic waves that are particularly sensitive to the structures of fault zones, we can image the subsurface structure of fault zones. The basic difficulty in imaging fault zones stems from their multi-scale and strong variations in structure, which are evident at the surface and within boreholes. By using accurate seismic wave propagation models, the study will provide the most detailed description of fault zone structure afforded by the recorded data. The project focuses on two societally relevant fault zones in southern California.</AbstractNarration>
