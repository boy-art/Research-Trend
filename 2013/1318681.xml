    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Simone Giombi at Princeton University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the key developments in string theory has been the discovery of surprising dualities relating quantum gravitational theories to gauge theories. Professor Giombi's research program is aimed at a broad and thorough study of various aspects of the gauge/gravity duality. This work will deepen our fundamental understanding of the physics underlying the relation between gauge and gravitational theories, and exploit the gauge/gravity duality in order to develop a powerful toolbox for answering non-perturbative questions about strongly coupled gauge theory or the nature of quantum gravity. This project consists of three key areas. The first one is devoted to a deep study of the gravitational theories involving massless higher spin fields and their role in the gauge/gravity duality; the second is to better understand the quantization of string theory in Anti de Sitter (AdS) backgrounds, and the third involves the study of certain supersymmetric subsectors of non-abelian gauge theories where exact results are possible by the method of localization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also expected to have a number of broader impacts. While working on specific research problems, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will receive extensive mentoring and training which will positively contribute to their formation as future independent scientists. The PI intends to develop special classes for graduate students and advanced undergraduates about recent trends in theoretical physics research, and to lecture at schools for students and young researchers held at international institutes. The PI also plans to become active in various outreach programs, such as giving public lectures and communicating recent research advances to non-technical journals.</AbstractNarration>
