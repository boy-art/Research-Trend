    <AbstractNarration>The present award supports the activities of the U.S. National Committee on Technical and Applied Mechanics in 2014. This committee represents the U.S. community of researchers and scientists with interest in mechanics. It thereby represents 15 professional societies. The committee has both international as well as domestic agendas. With this award the committee will fulfills the member country obligations to the International Union for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) through paying membership dues, and sending a U.S. to the Union's General Assembly to represent U.S. interests. Furthermore, this awards supports the domestic efforts of the committee by enabling adminsitrative support as well as the annual meeting of the national committee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the work of the U.S. National Committee on Technical and Applied Mechanics the U.S. research community is represented in general matters of the International Union on Technical and Applied Mechanics, its leadership structure, the organization of the International Congress of Technical and Applied Mechanics, and the organization and award of IUTAM technical symposia, and of IUTAM summer schools. These events serve as important catalysts in research. The committee also facilitates informal international cooperation and discussion on the subject matter of the committee. Domestically, the committee represents and engages with the mechanics community. With this award the annual meeting of the committee is enabled. The committee oversees the organization of the U.S. Congress on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, and has initiated the AMERIMECH symposium series. Ultimately, the work of the committee in its role of leadership internationally and nationally, leads to a contribution to scientific diplomacy in the subject area of technical and applied mechanics.</AbstractNarration>
