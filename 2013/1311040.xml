    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Nicholas Andrew Johnson of the University of Minnesota to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. The project title is "Real-Time Learning in Multiagent Systems for Ad Hoc Robot Teams." The host scientist is Professor Bob Williamson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The capability of heterogeneous robots to work together in order to accomplish a task is greatly improved through the use of real-time learning. Robots must be able to learn efficiently in the presence of other robots that possess differing capabilities. This project develops learning robots that take into account trust, cooperation, risk, and regret in order to allow teams of ad hoc robots to work efficiently and accurately to accomplish a task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, impacts of this project include advancing our understanding of the ability to coordinate teams of robots with heterogeneous capabilities; using the cooperation of the robot teams as a teaching activity for elementary children; and improving the speed, accuracy, and safety of response and limiting human endangerment in emergency situations through the use of robot teams.</AbstractNarration>
