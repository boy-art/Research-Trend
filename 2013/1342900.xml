    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for the participation of student, underrepresented groups and young researchers in the Symposium on GaN and SiC Power Technologies 3 at the 224th Electrochemical Society (ECS) Meeting to be held Oct. 27 - Nov. 1, 2013 in San Francisco, CA.. The Symposium will address research areas related to developing and delivering an Integrated Power Electronics Curriculum from Components to Systems. The program includes invited presentations by active experts in the field as well as regular papers, to enable dissemination of the current ideas and to foster critical discussion on the diverse applications. The speakers will explain how to implement the proposed curricular changes in the current engineering curriculum. Discussions on how to proceed to ensure the adoption of an integrated curriculum in power electronics components, technologies, and systems will provide the opportunity for a better understanding this critical for the nation area. The proposed conference session create a strong awareness about the importance of including the physics and technologies of various components that are needed to design and build modern electrical energy conversion systems based on solid-state power electronics. It will also emphasize the emerging wide bandgap semiconductor power switching devices in university and community college educational curricula.</AbstractNarration>
