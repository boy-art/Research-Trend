    <AbstractNarration>On Election Day, poll workers must operate a complex system composed of people, processes, and technology. Even minor mistakes in the operation of the system can lead to security failures, which could in turn lead to the wrong candidates being selected. However, pollworkers are generally not technically astute, receive minimal training, are not attuned to systems and security issues, and are prone to making security mistakes that endanger elections, especially towards the end of the day due to worker fatigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies how poll workers manage voting technology at the opening and closing of polls on Election Day in an effort to understand the impact poll workers have on voting system security. In particular, it will examine what kinds of common security problems do poll workers encounter in opening/closing the polls; why do these problems seem to occur and their likely causes; and if there are particular points in poll/opening/closing where poll workers are more likely to encounter security issues or make mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project reveals opportunities for deeper investigation of security gaps in poll workers? setting up and shutting down the polls that may be remedied by better design of procedures, job aids, training and content available in the polling place.</AbstractNarration>
