    <AbstractNarration>With this new award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A Program (CSDM-A) and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program (CLP) of the Division of Chemistry support Professor Lauren Webb of the University of Texas at Austin in a project that will investigate new methods for attaching proteins to surfaces under conditions that allow the protein activity to be studied. These studies, which will allow construction of surfaces with functional proteins attached, will have applications in material science and biomedical engineering. This project, which combines biophysics, molecular biology with surface and materials chemistry, will provide multidisciplinary training to students, from undergraduates to post-doctorals, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Webb and her group are conducting a multi-pronged effort with the aim of developing surfaces that mimic stable and functional biological materials capable of both natural and artificial functions. Specific experiments that are being conducted include: (1) the further work on the chemical functionalization of alkane thiol surfaces with peptides, with engineered secondary structure; (2) the binding of more complex protiens to the protein surfaces created in (1); (3) the use of surface functionalization developed in (1) to drive the formation of protein aggregates on the surface; (4) the use of protein-functionalized surfaces to bind functional forms of enzymes to the surface and to measure their activity. Students working with Prof. Webb are obtaining significant experience in analytical, physical and biochemical methods. This interdisciplinary training prepares them for work in the technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
