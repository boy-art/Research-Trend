    <AbstractNarration>Technical Description: The field of plasmonics is a vibrant frontier in photonics which aims at manipulating light-matter interaction well below the diffraction limit by utilizing plasmonic resonances in metals or heavily doped semiconductors. One outstanding challenge relevant to practically all plasmonic applications is the high loss introduced by either absorption or scattering due to grain boundaries and surfaces roughness. Among the commonly used materials, silver (Ag) has the best characteristics and the lowest loss in a wide wavelength range. The objective of this project is to investigate atomically-smooth epitaxial Ag films, as well as nanostructures either fabricated from such films or placed in their close proximity, as a new platform for plasmonic applications. The specific aims include: (i) Characterization of optical constants and measurement of surface plasmon polariton propagation distances in epitaxial Ag films. By minimizing scattering from grain boundaries and surface roughness, how intrinsic processes such as electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering determine the optical properties of metallic films will be examined. (ii) Investigation of exciton-plasmon interaction in hybrid nanostructures, and particularly the quantum dynamics of individual semiconductor emitters near the epitaxial thin films and plasmonic nanostructures fabricated from such films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: This research project is on light-matter interactions at atomically-smooth epitaxial silver films in both the classical and quantum regimes. The research is significant because epitaxial metal films provide many exciting opportunities in fundamental science and applications. Improved understanding of how to shape light-matter interaction using the highest quality metallic films may lead to discoveries of new optoelectronic devices. The project provides extensive training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student. In addition, the PI plans to implement "flipped classroom" for improving instructional effectiveness in large introductory physics courses, and also to establish a bridge program in collaboration with the University of Texas at El Paso to recruit and mentor minority students.</AbstractNarration>
