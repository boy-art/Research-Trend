    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funds for the investigation of a novel, scalable approach to fabricating nanoparticles that takes as its starting point extended fibers of a desired material. The process relies on the same instability that is witnessed every day from a dripping faucet. Surface tension drives the fluid instability, the so-called Plateau-Rayleigh capillary instability, which causes a waning jet of water to break up into droplets. The same basic phenomenon is utilized here to transform extended lengths of intact cylindrical nanowires of the material of choice embedded inside a fiber into necklaces of spherical nanoparticles held isolated from each other. The project will investigate the smallest particle size that could be produced by this process and the materials compatible with such a procedure. A variety of materials will be explored, ranging from soft glasses to biocompatible polymers. In addition, this project will lay the foundations for digitally designing the internal architecture of structured nanoparticles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This methodology will provide a pathway to large-scale production of nanoparticles with sophisticated sub-structure, a task that remains a fundamental technological challenge at the nano-scale. The intellectual merit of this interdisciplinary effort stems from addressing this fundamental challenge by combining heat-induced fiber drawing and fluid dynamics, which initially appear unrelated. The project also provides a new physical implementation for fundamental studies of fluid dynamics at the nano-scale. The broader impact of this project lies in the wide range of applications for these nanostructures. Examples include the controlled-release of drugs from biodegradable polymer particles, to paints and coatings with novel optical properties. In addition, a multi-faceted outreach plan will be carried out, including daylong summer events for Orange County (Florida) schools entitled "Make Your Own Fiber Day", which will bring high school students to the wonders of fiber production.</AbstractNarration>
