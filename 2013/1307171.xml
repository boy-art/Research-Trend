    <AbstractNarration>The field of high-energy particle astrophysics has advanced significantly during the last decade as a result of discoveries made by ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. These instruments have now detected very high-energy gamma-radiation (energies above 100 gigaelectronvolt (GeV)) from classes of objecting ranging from pulsars to blazars and starburst galaxies. Detailed measurements of these sources probe the most energetic phenomena in the Universe. The ground-based observatory VERITAS is an array of four 12-meter imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes located in Arizona. VERITAS has now reached a sensitivity level more than an order of magnitude better than the previous generation of instruments and, as a result of its recently completed upgrade, has now extended its sensitivity range to energies below 100 GeV. VERITAS is producing a wealth of scientific knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles working on VERITAS science and on the scientific projections for the next generation international ground-based gamma-ray observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA.) UCLA has played a major role in the VERITAS construction, in the development of analysis and simulation software for the experiment, and in the production of the scientific results reported to date. With this award the UCLA group will focus on maintaining VERITAS, analyzing data, producing scientific results, and defining science goals for CTA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The UCLA group supports the VERITAS Education and Public Outreach program, which it helped to develop. The program reaches local audiences at the Whipple Observatory Visitor's Center, museum audiences at the Adler Planetarium, and the general public through the VERITAS education web site. UCLA scientists conduct tours at the VERITAS site and help to provide materials for the public. VERITAS and CTA materials will be used for local activities at UCLA involving schools in the Los Angeles area. In addition, researchers at UCLA are involved in education and outreach efforts through public speaking, planetarium shows, and individual student mentorship.</AbstractNarration>
