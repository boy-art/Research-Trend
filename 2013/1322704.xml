    <AbstractNarration>Overview: Heavy metal contamination in ocean sediments linked to anthropogenic inputs often requires remediation efforts and long term monitoring. Such monitoring is time intensive, requiring sampling, sample processing, and analysis. Developing in situ sensors capable of measuring heavy metals in sediments would enable rapid analysis and large spatial observations. Laser induced-breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has the potential to be developed into an in situ sediment sensor for heavy metal analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Highly contaminated sediments exist in harbors and coastal environments due to shipping, poor management of waste, and anthropogenic inputs. Because contaminated sediment is detrimental to fisheries, shell fishing, benthic communities and human health, remediation efforts are underway in many areas including New Bedford, MA. Of key concern are high levels of heavy metals. Measurement of heavy metals in sediments is of interest for identifying areas with elevated levels that should be targeted for remediation and for monitoring levels during and after remediation efforts. Large spatial surveys of heavy metal levels in sediments is time intensive due to the current technologies that exist. Sediments must be collected, processed, and analyzed. Laser induced-breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) can provide rapid, multi-element analysis of samples, is virtually non-destructive, requires no consumables or sample preparation, and can be used in a standoff configuration. Such characteristics are those required for in situ analysis of sediments. In this project, the investigator will conduct laboratory experiments to investigate the potential for using LIBS for in situ sediment analysis. Through the future development of an in situ sensor deployable on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle or Remotely Operated Vehicle, real-time spatial measurements of sediments will be feasible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The investigator aims to increase diversity in ocean sciences by mentoring underrepresented groups and encouraging students to continue to pursue their interests in the field. The investigator will mentor a Summer Minority Undergraduate Fellow in developing his/her own research project related to the LIBS project. The student will gain interdisciplinary experiences in the laboratory and be involved in research day cruises. In an effort to attract and recruit more female students to ocean science, two Saturday outreach events will be developed for female students aged ten to twelve, which will focus on introducing girls to ocean science.</AbstractNarration>
