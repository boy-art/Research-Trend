    <AbstractNarration>The NSF Collaborative grant "Graduate Student Training through Research on Plasma-Based Accelerators", has supported the work of 14 graduate students since September 1, 2009 at seven different institutions. Eight of these students have already graduated and another six are expected to graduate by the close of calendar year 2014. This project supports one of these six students, whose scientific goal is to complete theoretical studies aimed at improving the efficiency of particle acceleration through the use of lasers. Laser acceleration of proton and ion beams from solid targets is a topic of great interest for a variety of applications, including beam therapy of cancer and fast ignition. While this concept offers the promise of compact treatment facilities, the need for mono-energetic beams at controlled energies with modest laser power has been a challenge. The student has demonstrated an approach to controlling the energy of beams with density gradient and laser rise time shaping. The scheme can surpass the scaling of beam energy with the laser power of current schemes. This final work will address the scaling of the potential height with laser intensity.</AbstractNarration>
