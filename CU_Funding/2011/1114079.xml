    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a new type of low-cost solar power module by pairing proven photovoltaic cells with novel concentrating optics that make use of smart "reactive" optical materials. The reactive materials adjust automatically to solar incidence, changing the optical properties of the concentrator in order to track the solar position over time. By embedding this tracking function within the concentrator, rather than using expensive and bulky mechanical trackers, this approach enables high concentration to be achieved in modules with stationary mounting and significantly reduces overall system costs. The objectives of the Phase I research plan are to validate the design of the reactive optics, through both simulation and experimentation, and to build and test functional prototypes of the solar concentrator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is primarily in the field of photovoltaic power, although other applications of the optical system are also likely. The reactive solar concentrator to be developed under this program is predicted to result in solar power module costs as low as $0.40 per peak watt (in direct sunlight), a savings of approximately 50% to 75% compared to current modules. This cost reduction can help spur rapid growth of photovoltaic power usage, which will bring a wide range of economic, environmental, and national security benefits and will accelerate job growth within the solar power industry. The reactive solar concentrator technology may also provide lightweight high-power solar modules that are uniquely suited to demanding off-grid field applications and that can be easily transported and deployed as needed.</AbstractNarration>
