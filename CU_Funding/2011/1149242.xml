    <AbstractNarration>1149242-Bartelt-Hunt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extracellular proteins have recently been implicated in a range of environmental engineering problems including horizontal transmission of prion diseases and the release of insecticidal toxins from transgenic plants. In addition, the increasing use of environmental proteomics necessitates a more complete understanding of the behavior of extracellular proteins in the environment. Despite this, the interactions between proteins and environmentally-relevant surfaces such as soil minerals are still poorly understood as is the influence attachment to soil can have on biologic properties of extracellular proteins. The research objective is to utilize a novel analytical tool to evaluate the interaction of one type of extracellular protein with environmentally-relevant surfaces, as well as to evaluate the subsequent changes in biologic function of the soil-attached protein. The study utilizes the new analytical tool to simultaneously investigate the amount and conformation of protein adsorbed to surfaces. In addition, the PI will perform a series of experiments to evaluate how attachment of proteins to soil can influence their biologic properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information generated in this research will further understanding of the role of the environment in transmission of chronic wasting disease, an emerging animal disease that currently has no effective therapeutic treatments. Results from this study will identify how extracellular proteins interact with soils, and will inform a range of environmental engineering issues including prion disease transmission, transport of extracellular enzymes released from transgenic crops, and the behavior of proteins in soil mineral cycles. Further, the project will provide cooperative learning materials in engineering potentially leading to improved student retention in engineering, and ultimately, a more robust and diverse engineering workforce. The PI will share findings with extension educators in states impacted by prion diseases and with K-12 math and science teachers in the state of Nebraska through the University of Nebraska?s Science and Math Professional Development Summer Technology Institute. The PI will involve undergraduate students in research, and will leverage funding from an existing University of Nebraska program to provide significant undergraduate involvement in the research activities described here.</AbstractNarration>
