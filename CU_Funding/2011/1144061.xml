    <AbstractNarration>Advancement in scientific research and discovery process can be significantly accelerated by mining and analysis of scientific data generated from various sources. In addition to the experimental data produced from simulations and observations, there is another category of scientific data; namely, scientific research and process data, such as the discussions and outcomes of complete and in-progress research projects, in the form of technical reports, research papers, discussion forums, mailing lists, research blogs, etc, and the connections between research activities. This data can be analyzed to discover many important features valuable not only for scientific discovery, but also for making the discovery process more effective, efficient, and productive. Furthermore, discovering?virtual communities? with similar needs, interests, and requirements can suggest potential collaborations, software tools, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops an infrastructure called DiscKNet (Discovering Knowledge from Scientific Research Networks) to mine the enriched scientific research network for emerging trends, new research areas, potential collaborations, etc. It entails constructing a scientific research network based on scientific publications, discussion forums, mailing lists, reportsfrom supercomputing centers, research blogs, conference pages and common interest groups in social media such as Facebook and Twitter, etc. The design, development, and application of data mining techniques on this network lead a scientific discovery process through the identification of high impact tools and techniques, trends and usage patterns in supercomputing center activity, common issues with software tools, and potential fruitful scientific collaboration opportunities. The project provides a platform for scientists, experimentalists, research centers to build new communities. For education it assists professors, educators, researchers to find the right groups for current discussion and future collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
