    <AbstractNarration>The UC-Riverside ADVANCE PAID project proposes to create and implement the FORWARD (Faculty Organization for Women's Advancement, Recognition and Development) program. This program is expected to support the professional advancement of women STEM faculty, with a particular focus on women faculty of color, at the institution and throughout the University of California higher education system. The specific objectives of the program are to: develop a database of faculty data to inform decisions regarding recruitment and retention of women faculty; convene an annual retreat and relevant activities to provide leadership and professional development; and, conduct a series of workshops targeted toward the unique interests of women of color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This project will, ultimately, enhance the nation?s understanding of the intrinsic barriers within higher education that impede the advancement of women faculty in the STEM disciplines. This is particularly relevant for women of color. The anticipated compiling and analysis of relevant faculty data on the recruitment, retention, and professional advancement of women STEM faculty will provide a better understanding of the relationship between institutional policies, practices, and the advancement of women faculty in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;By creating sustainable and far-reaching statewide and national activities intended to support the professional advancement of women faculty in STEM, this project will serve as the foundation for institutional change at UC-R. The impacts of the project are expected to reach far beyond the institution and the state of California. The mechanisms of dissemination of project outcomes include creative and strategic partnerships with national STEM-focused organizations.</AbstractNarration>
