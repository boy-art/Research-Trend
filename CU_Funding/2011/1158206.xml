    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop theory, modeling and simulations of low frequency waves during ionospheric heating. A key focus will be the midlatitude ionosphere, and in particular, the upcoming heating experiments using the Arecibo facility, with coordinated measurements at its conjugate region in Argentina. The heating of the ionospheric plasma by modulated high frequency waves leads to physical processes with a wide range of scales. Ionospheric modification experiments have shown the generation of low frequency waves in the presence of the natural current systems, the electrojets, and recent results show the wave generation even in their absence. &lt;br/&gt; Three simulation codes will be used: the first for simulations of low frequency waves and associated processes in the high-latitude region, with a nearly vertical magnetic field. The second code is designed for a general orientation of the magnetic field and will be used for studies of the mid-latitude region. The third code will have a general magnetic field geometry and will simulate the mid-latitude region and its coupling to the high- and low-latitudes, including the effects on the conjugate region. The simulations will also explore the generation of low frequency waves during heating of the low-latitude ionosphere.&lt;br/&gt; Meso-scale phenomena are critical during ionospheric heating and will be the focus of this research. These efforts will enable the development of a comprehensive ionospheric heating model by elucidating the leading processes that bridge the phenomena at micro- and macro-scales. The heating experiments allow the use of the ionosphere as a natural laboratory for exploring fundamental processes, in particular a variety of plasma phenomena.&lt;br/&gt; This work will lead to a better understanding of ionospheric processes which are relevant to telecommunications and satellite technologies, as well as space weather. A graduate student will be trained in the plasma physics of the ionosphere and large-scale numerical simulations. Undergraduate and high school students, including several from under-represented minority groups, will participate in the project and gain direct experience and encouragement to pursue science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
