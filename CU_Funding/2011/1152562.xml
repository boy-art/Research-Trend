    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes a robotic hand based on a novel&lt;br/&gt;torque-switching mechanism and patented miniature motor controllers. The mechanism actively channels&lt;br/&gt;motor torque along different transmission paths and enables dependant and independent (time-discreet)&lt;br/&gt;control of both finger joints in a robotic hand to perform both power and pinch grasps. There is a growing&lt;br/&gt;need in industry for adaptable and flexible manufacturing capabilities in a dynamic environment. Industry&lt;br/&gt;generally uses single-axis grippers and end-effectors that are modified to pick up specific items in a&lt;br/&gt;highly-controlled environment. This requires exchanging multiple customized and expensive grippers via&lt;br/&gt;tool-changers. This project?s goal is to produce a paradigm shift in the materials-handling industry by&lt;br/&gt;introducing a highly flexible, affordable, and lightweight robotic gripper that can grasp and manipulate&lt;br/&gt;objects of varying size, shape, and stiffness. The Phase-II project objectives are to design and develop a&lt;br/&gt;prototype 3-fingered gripper using a novel torque-switching mechanism, optimized motors, multiple&lt;br/&gt;feedback sensors, and miniature control electronics, and to test and evaluate the prototype gripper in an&lt;br/&gt;industrial setting. This program will result in a compact, lightweight, and affordable robotic hand capable&lt;br/&gt;of grasping and manipulating a large range of objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses the shortcomings of gripper devices&lt;br/&gt;available today which discourage the use of robotic systems, thereby undermining manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;productivity. The proposed solution improves manufacturing competitiveness by enabling easier adoption&lt;br/&gt;of robotic work cells in conventional markets such as light manufacturing and emerging markets such as&lt;br/&gt;the food and beverage industry. The societal impact will be felt in the field of education where robotics is&lt;br/&gt;recognized as a strategic motivator for children and young adults to enter into technical fields. Most&lt;br/&gt;robots are too large and dangerous to bring into a classroom. The proposed robotic hand will be very&lt;br/&gt;portable, safe, and exciting for both educators and students. A significant increase in gripper dexterity will make it an even more attractive motivator in the classroom and other secondary educational programs and&lt;br/&gt;workshops. A potential secondary application for this innovation is a more dexterous and lightweight&lt;br/&gt;hand prosthesis which could have a major societal impact. Finally, the ability to transmit torque through&lt;br/&gt;different paths in a miniature package and allow control of different functions with a single small actuator&lt;br/&gt;enables lightweight yet versatile machines and could have impacts beyond the field of robotics.</AbstractNarration>
