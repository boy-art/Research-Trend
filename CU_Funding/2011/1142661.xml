    <AbstractNarration>The project will support a workshop on the identification of challenges and opportunities for the large scale deployment of the smart grid, to be held in Washington D.C. area in early 2013. This workshop will be organized by Virginia Tech's Advanced Research Institute and Southeast University of China. It will bring together approximately 50 smart grid experts and researchers from both the United States and China. This workshop is designed to create a synergy among workshop participants from the U.S. and China. Specific objectives for the workshop are: (1) To identify challenges of smart grid development in the United States and China, (2) to identify technologies ? both electric power and communication infrastructures ? necessary to support smart grid development and high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, (3) to identify best practices and lessons learned based on the deployment experience in smart grid projects, (4) to identify challenges and research topics that the participants can use as a context to propose new research in this field, and (5) to provide international networking opportunities and potential for future research collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that presentations and discussions at the workshop will lead to a better understanding of research challenges and the identification of R&amp;D opportunities for international research collaboration. This activity will in turn serve as a basis for future academia-industry collaboration and for conducting joint research and/or setting up joint programs on smart grid. It is also expected that this workshop will help build awareness and promote educational and research exchange visits in smart grid related topics. Efforts will be made to recruit women researchers from academia, government and national laboratories, as well as participants from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
