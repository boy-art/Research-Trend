    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funds to organize the 2011 Technical Conference for the Society of Engineering Science (SES). The conference will take place on October 12-14, 2011 at the Norris Center at Northwestern University. The SES conference facilitates the free exchange of information on all aspects of engineering science and provides a forum for discussion, education, and recognition of the talents of the engineering science community. The SES conference promotes the development and strengthening of the interfaces between various disciplines in engineering, sciences, and mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consistent with the SES mission, the 2011 SES Technical Conference will actively seek the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering (e.g., underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities). This will be achieved by (1) targeting historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) around the country, (2) encouraging faculty members to identify promising undergraduate students with an interest in pursuing graduate studies and (3) providing travel assistance to undergraduate and graduate students, particularly those of underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities. The funds requested are for this purpose.</AbstractNarration>
