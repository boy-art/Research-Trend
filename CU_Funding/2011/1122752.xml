    <AbstractNarration>This two-year project is evaluating the efficacy of the Microlab Learning Cycle. The Microlab Learning Cycle is an innovative approach to active learning based on Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). During the learning cycle, students explore a problem with guided discovery. The instructor then introduces the topic in lecture and students apply this knowledge to related problems. Microlabs are 10-15 minute computer-based activities that are completed during lecture. In a logical microlab, students are asked to solve a problem by entering their answers using a graphical input tool and submitting their solutions to an automated grading system. In a programming microlab, students are asked to complete a skeleton program that uses automated grading. The Microlab Learning Cycle is based on using logical microlabs during the exploration phase and programming microlabs during the application phase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formal evaluation methodologies are being used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Microlab Learning Cycle. Faculty participants at several universities, including HBCUs, are initially teaching the target topics using traditional lecture. During the next offering of the course they are using the microlab learning cycle approach. Students are solving similar problems in both terms and an external evaluator is measuring the learning outcomes. Faculty participants and students are being asked to report on their experiences using microlabs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A "cloud-based" approach allows access to the learning materials to anyone with Internet access. The principal investigators are presenting papers and offering workshops to promote active learning using microlabs.</AbstractNarration>
