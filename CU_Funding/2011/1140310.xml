    <AbstractNarration>In order to enhance the security component in undergraduate IT education, this project develops a suite of hands-on IT security labs through comprehensive studies on the principles, knowledge, recent research results, advanced technologies and tools in the fields of computer and network security. The topics of these experiments include vulnerability assessment, network access protection, firewall, intrusion detection and prevention systems, security audit and monitoring, cryptographic systems, certificate service and public-key infrastructure, virtual private networks, password management and system hardening. With a layered and modular design, the experiments can be tailored with minimal modification by instructors for use in different courses and various environments. New technologies and products can be added and obsolete tools can be removed in a "plug-and-play" manner without affecting the teaching objective of an experiment. A cloud-based test-bed is developed in an existing virtual laboratory environment and the labs are tested in this test-bed. External consultants from industry help evaluate the contents and format of these experiments. Through these hands-on activities, students are provided with an active-learning environment by exposing them to real-world problems in the field of IT security and the opportunity to learn from experiences with advanced technologies and well developed tools. The research results are being widely disseminated through a designated web portal, workshops, seminars and publications to help instructors from other universities and colleges prepare and deliver IT security courses more effectively and efficiently.</AbstractNarration>
