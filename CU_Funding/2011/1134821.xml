    <AbstractNarration>Full Proposal for an I/UCRC for Energy Efficient Electronic Systems &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1134867 SUNY at Binghamton; Baghat Sammakia &lt;br/&gt;1134810 Villanova University; Alfonso Ortega &lt;br/&gt;1134821 University of Texas-Arlington; Dereje Agonafer &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Energy Efficient Electronic Systems will focus on optimizing energy utilization in electronic systems. SUNY at Binghamton, Villanova University and the University of Texas at Arlington are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with SUNY at Binghamton as the lead institution &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will focus on the development of systematic methodologies for operating electronic systems, including data centers, as dynamic self sensing and regulating systems that are predictive and verified in real time. Algorithms will be developed to control cooling resources and to assist expert system schedulers to schedule and/or migrate workload to achieve optimal energy consumption. Thermal management resources will also be allocated dynamically in response to system needs. Problem-oriented research related to Thermal Management Protocols, Software Systems, Control Systems, and Implementation and Assessment, will be addressed during the Center's first five year program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will enable a significant reduction in energy consumption in electronic systems, including data centers, thereby potentially reducing electrical power consumption across the nation. This will, in turn, reduce the nations consumption of carbon-based fuels and related emissions. The center will attract a diverse group of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, by providing industrially-relevant training required by graduates entering the workforce. The proposed center is committed to attracting talented and motivated students from all groups, and will integrate a variety of mechanisms across the partners, including enhancement of existing minority pipeline programs to exceed participation by women and under-represented students. The center also intends to leverage existing programming on its campuses to engage K-12 students in conversation on energy conservation.</AbstractNarration>
