    <AbstractNarration>Educating the next generation of engineers and technicians specialized in renewable energy is of critical importance to our nation's energy security. This project aims to enhance student education in renewable energy and power engineering by: 1) developing and using sun tracking solar power systems as an enabling tool to create innovative teaching materials including demonstrations, hands-on experiments, and course modules; 2) integrating state-of-the-art applications of sustainable energy such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and smart grid into the engineering technology program; and 3) engaging college students in the mentoring of middle and high school students on renewable energy technologies. Curricular enhancements focus on authentic problem solving to engage students in problem-based learning. The progressive approach used in building content knowledge throughout the curriculum prepares graduates with strong backgrounds and the research skills needed to advance the field of renewable energy. The project will reach to community colleges and secondary schools to build a renewable energy education pipeline. The project will provide a model for student recruitment and retention in renewable energy technology. The results of the project will be disseminated in refereed journal publications and conference presentations. The project will contribute to the development of a highly-skilled renewable energy workforce for this nation.</AbstractNarration>
