    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for US graduate students to participate in the International School of Cosmic Ray Astrophysics in 2012 to be held on July 4-10, 2012 in Erice, Sicily, Italy. The theme of the Course is "A New Era in Particle Astrophysics." It will present the new experiments, new experimental results and the current understanding of them. The course will emphasize the multi-messenger approach to astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. This summer school is important in the education of such young scientists not only because of the lectures they listen to, but also because during the School they directly communicate with the older experienced scientists who are the lecturers.</AbstractNarration>
