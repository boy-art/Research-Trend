    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor John D. Protasiewicz of the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University will explore the development of new types of conjugated molecules and polymers. While such types of technologically important materials have been known for some time, most of these materials are solely based upon arrays of carbon-carbon double or triple bonds. This project seeks to expand the range of conjugated materials to include other types of double bonds, especially those that include the double bonded group 15 elements phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. New types of synthetic methods achieve these materials will be also developed. Photochemical studies of these new materials will be undertaken to explore new properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work could lead to new classes of hybrid organic-inorganic conjugated materials having significant photophysical properties. These materials will also contribute to the basic understanding of conjugated materials chemistry. Advances in this project could have impacts on fields and applications such as sensor technology, organic light emitting diodes, solar photovoltaics, molecular electronics, and other areas where energy (in the form of light or electricity) meets molecules and polymers. In addition, this project will provide excellent interdisciplinary training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
