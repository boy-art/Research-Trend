    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to support travel by U.S. academic scientists for participation in the ICES Annual Science Conference, its Working Groups and Workshops, Symposia, Theme Sessions, and Training Programs. Applications by young and established scientists will be considered to assure strong and diverse representation by the U.S. academic community in ICES activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important for the United States to maintain a leadership role in marine science, in accord with the recent Presidential Executive Order on ocean stewardship, the Ocean Research Priorities Plan and the goals of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. The new structure of ICES and its five Steering Groups that are focused on science for ecosystem-based management provide opportunities for U.S. scientists to engage in collaborative international research. NSF funding will insure that U.S. academic science can exercise both leadership potential in ICES and the ability to recruit young scientists into ICES activities. Funds also will help to insure that the academic community is well represented, balancing the strong input of U.S. governmental science, primarily through NOAA.</AbstractNarration>
