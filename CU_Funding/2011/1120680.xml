    <AbstractNarration>Ergosterol is the major sterol found in the membranes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Ergosterol is an end-product sterol primarily found in fungal organisms like yeast. While past studies have identified some ergosterol mutants in C. reinhardtii, very little is known about the sterol biosynthesis pathway in this species. The model organism, C. reinhardtii, is very unique in the sense that it accumulates ergosterol in its membranes. With the elucidation of the Chlamydomonas genome, bioinformatics analysis has allowed the determination of potential genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. With this knowledge, a working model of the pathway has been designed. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to employ molecular biology techniques to complement sterol mutations in yeasts with ergosterol genes from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Complementation would allow us to amplify the sterol genes from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, transfer those genes into the previously characterized sterol mutants of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and characterize their function in a heterologous species. Better understanding of this pathway and the genes involved will also provide new information about the evolution of this species and possibly other algal systems. In addition, it will advance the understanding of lipid biosynthesis in this model system.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: As the national leader in producing the largest number of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) students who go on to receive Ph.Ds, Xavier University has upheld a reputation for excellence in the sciences. Students will have an opportunity to participate in a project that incorporates lipid biochemistry, as well as molecular biology techniques that will train and prepare them for the rigors of graduate school at other institutions. This project will help to continue to support the infrastructure of students who are interested in pursuing successful careers in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
