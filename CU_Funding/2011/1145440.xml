    <AbstractNarration>Nematodes are frequently considered the most diverse, abundant, and ubiquitous animals on earth. This assertion however, is not strongly supported by the number of formally described species. The gap between formally recognized species and species yet to be discovered has been referred to as the "biodiversity identification gap." This gap is thought to exist due to difficulties in identifying diagnostic characters in nematodes, overlapping intra- and inter-specific variation, and the lack of taxonomists engaged in the activity of species discovery and description. An important factor that has not been generally addressed is the actual process of species delimitation in the field of nematology. This proposal focuses on the role of species delimitation through an integrated taxonomic examination of a select group of soil-dwelling, plant parasitic nematodes in the family Criconematidae. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The species delimitation process will improve our ability to diagnose nematode species and contribute to the development of a plant-parasitic nematode biogeography. The project will incorporate young aspiring scientists and citizen scientists using nematodes as a bridge to the microbial world. Together with the nonprofit organization Discover Life in America, surveys and workshops will be conducted at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, serving as a model for other parks and preserves.</AbstractNarration>
