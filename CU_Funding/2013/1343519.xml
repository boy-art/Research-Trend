    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;#1343519&lt;br/&gt;Raveche, Elizabeth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal employs multiparameter analysis of individual cells using markers with specific fluorescence tags that upon laser excitation emit a signal that can be distinguished from all other signals and background. Through this multi-color analysis exquisitely small samples can be identified and ultimately sorted and employed in molecular and functional assays. . This proposed research will test the ability of this technology to define unique malignant precursor cells that will be important for future scientific breakthroughs. This proposal initially takes advantage of the engineering advancements that have allowed fluorescent dyes with unique excitation and emission profiles to result in the ability to differentially excite and collect these emissions. The analysis of individual cells (or particles) rather than the whole population allows for detection of multiple properties measured on the same cell. The detection is rapid (as fast as the cell in the fluid sheath passes through the laser beam). In addition to analysis of individual cells, some types of flow cytometers can physically sort cells based on signals associated with the parameters being detected. and scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
