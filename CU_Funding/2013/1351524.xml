    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to determine the couplings of rotational and translational body oscillations underlying dynamic legged locomotion, and develop strategies to exploit them for faster, more efficient and more stable running and climbing. The planar point-mass dynamic models which have informed the design of existing single-mode running robots will be extended to better capture the three-dimensional dynamics evidenced by animals that allow for rapid negotiation of a variety of terrains via multiple modes of locomotion. The benefits of coupled roll, pitch and yaw with traditional translational motions, as well as inclines, attachment, and body inertia will be examined for multi-modal legged runners. These findings will be used in turn to inform control strategies for robots capable of high-speed running and climbing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will enable legged robotic systems to run more quickly, across more treacherous terrains, and maneuver with more agility. The currently "missing" reduced-order dynamic models for climbing will be developed, affording better understanding of the mechanisms and methods employed by biological climbers. These insights will also enable robot designs and controllers to effectively utilize the inherent rotational dynamics over a range of surface inclines and geometries. Running reliably down hills, through rough terrain, up trees, and over obstacles will be easier for these biologically anchored multi-modal devices. These advances will lead to unprecedented mobility for robots involved in search and rescue, hazardous material clean up, and inspection tasks in natural and urban disaster areas.</AbstractNarration>
