    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this project is to address the feasibility of a novel paradigm for the Internet of Things based on radio-less backscattering devices that can communicate with each other independently. The novel device is referred to as sense-a-tag, and it will allow for point-to-point and multihop communication. The work also involves development of protocols for the sense-a-tag. The research is exploratory and of transformative nature. If the feasibility of the envisioned sense-a-tag is demonstrated, one will have the long-sought device that can enable a vast range of applications within the framework of the Internet of Things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit is in the design of a novel device and its protocol. The protocol will make seamless the device?s operation with commercial Radio Frequency Identification tags and readers. The device will play a central role in the Internet of Things where proximity-based sensing and tag-to-tag to communication are critical. The new sense-a-tag will also permit novel solutions for localization, tracking and monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts are in advancing the research and technological growth of Radio Frequency Identification as a key pillar to the Internet of Things. The device will facilitate low cost and high scalability deployments, a sine qua non for the growth of the Internet of Things, thus bringing it to reality much sooner. The latter will benefit society in innumerable ways. Furthermore, with the proposed device, better Radio Frequency Identification systems will be designed and consequently, more technical and societal benefits will be reaped.</AbstractNarration>
