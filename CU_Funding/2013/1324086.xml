    <AbstractNarration>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 11.6 million people were admitted to jail from 2011-2012;&lt;br/&gt;yet, there has been relatively little research examining the impact of short-term incarceration on offender&lt;br/&gt;adjustment. Two opposing theories have typically been provided to explain how inmates adapt to the&lt;br/&gt;incarceration environment. The importation model suggests that inmates bring a host of pre-incarceration&lt;br/&gt;experiences and characteristics with them into the incarceration environment that account for how&lt;br/&gt;inmates adapt and behave. Conversely, the deprivation model posits the oppressive incarceration&lt;br/&gt;environment is responsible for inmate adaptation. Research has found support for both models. &lt;br/&gt;However, these theories have not been tested longitudinally in jail. This project will test these theories&lt;br/&gt;throughout a stay in jail and into the community to update and expand these models. The study will test&lt;br/&gt;the overarching hypothesis that traumatic experiences with violence encountered before, during, and after&lt;br/&gt;jail are related to increased mental health difficulties and recidivism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two hundred male and female inmates will be recruited to participate in the present study. Subjects will&lt;br/&gt;complete surveys approximately once a month for four months, starting from the initial point of&lt;br/&gt;incarceration and ending a month after release from jail. The subjects will self-report psychosocial&lt;br/&gt;problems including symptoms of anxiety, post-traumatic stress, depression, antisocial behavior,&lt;br/&gt;aggression, and substance use. Recidivism data will also be collected for released subjects. The&lt;br/&gt;researchers will use self-report data on violence exposure prior, during, and after incarceration, to explain&lt;br/&gt;the development of psychopathology and predict mental/behavioral outcomes, as well as identify risk&lt;br/&gt;factors for recidivism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current study is the first longitudinal examination to assess developmental changes in mental and&lt;br/&gt;behavioral health throughout jail and in the community. This project will identify risk and protective&lt;br/&gt;factors that can be used to create interventions and programs, reducing the risk of recidivism. By learning&lt;br/&gt;more about the context in which offenders must adapt, researchers can provide informed&lt;br/&gt;recommendations to policy makers and increase safety in communities and jails.</AbstractNarration>
