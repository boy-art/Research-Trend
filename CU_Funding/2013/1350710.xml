    <AbstractNarration>In the oceans, the amount of organic nitrogen is in great part controlled by the balance between two microbially-controlled pathways: Denitrification, the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas, and nitrogen fixation, the reduction of nitrogen gas to ammonium. Because the large spatial variability of nitrogen fixation is difficult to resolve with current measurements, the development of new methods for high resolution measurements is highly desirable. In order to characterize the geographical distribution of oceanic nitrogen fixation rates and ultimately yield better estimates of new nitrogen, researchers at Duke University will develop a novel method for in situ measurements of nitrogen fixation. By providing insights into the biogeography of oceanic nitrogen fixation rates, this method and ensuing observations will fill a gap in the current state of knowledge of the mechanisms governing the biogeochemistry of new nitrogen in oceanic environments, and ultimately aid in the refinement of oceanic ecosystem models for current and future climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Through a partnership with the Museum of Life and Science, the project will provide a platform to foster climate and climate change literacy well beyond the duration of the proposed work. In addition, Informal Science Education educators will participate in research to further their scientific knowledge, and educate student researchers on effective strategies to communicate science. Finally, the study will provide opportunities for mentoring of undergraduate students, graduate student support, and teaching material for undergraduate and graduate courses at Duke University.</AbstractNarration>
