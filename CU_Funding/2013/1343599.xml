    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports student travel for select students participating in the Doctoral Consortium at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2013), that will be held in Beijing, China, August 3-9, 2013. The biannual IJCAI conference is the premier international conference spanning all topics in AI across a fully international research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This consortium is oriented on research and career development for students who have identified their PhD topics and are just embarking on that independent research. This consortium is covering topics that are important and relevant to the success of these students, including, "funding and strings attached to them, use of subjects in research (including IRB), data collection, maintaining privacy and integrity of data, authorship (single and multi-author submissions, ghost writing), plagiarism and self-plagiarism, proper use of citations, reviewing of papers and proposals, and how to get the best out of attending a conference."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student participation in this conference has direct impact through encouraging promising U.S. students to engage in internationally-competitive research. This program will also enhance the broader scientific community through exposure to emerging research topics. IJCAI is the major international conference that will figure prominently in the research careers of these young investigators. Students gain valuable research insights from the exchange of technical ideas in this broader venue. In the process, they make valuable connections with potential collaborators from around the world. In addition, students participate in the main IJCAI conference activities. This allows them to attend presentations of the leading research in AI, as well as avail themselves of the available tutorials, workshops, and demonstrations.</AbstractNarration>
