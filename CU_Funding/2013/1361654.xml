    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program of the Chemistry Division supports work by Professor Trevor W. Hayton at the University of California Santa Barbara to carry out fundamental studies on the synthesis and reactivity of molecules in unusual oxidations states. Often, these molecules have the ability to effect challenging bond forming and bond activation reactions; reactions that are relevant to a wide variety of catalytic processes. In addition, these complexes further our understanding of metal-ligand bonding and help to validate new computational methodologies. These molecules are stabilized by the ketimide ligand, which possesses a combination of orbital interactions that permits it to stabilize both high and low oxidation states. The basic research funded by this award advances our understanding of the chemistry of the earth abundant elements and assists in the transition to a carbon-neutral, sustainable economy. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits, such as the use of these materials in catalysis or magnetic information storage, as well as the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the synthesis and characterization of inorganic and organometallic complexes. Professor Hayton helps organize the Southern California Organometallics meeting (SoCal Organometallics). This meeting allows organometallic students from Southern California to present their current research and interact with students and faculty from neighboring institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project pays particular focus on ketimide-containing complexes of the earth abundant elements, manganese, iron, and copper. Their properties are being studied using a variety of techniques, including NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and SQUID magnetometry. Their reactivity with small molecules, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and ethylene, is also being explored.</AbstractNarration>
