    <AbstractNarration>The research program at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory focuses on timely topics in nuclear spectroscopy and neutron-induced reactions. Much of this work utilizes nearly monoenergetic fast neutrons and is reliant on the radiation detection capabilities we have developed. Our broad-based research includes selected studies in several forefront areas: nuclear structure relevant to double-beta decay and the mass of the neutrino, nuclei undergoing shape transitions, the decays of collective nuclear excitations, deformed nuclear structures and shape coexistence, nuclear structure contributions in support of searches for fundamental symmetries. The determination of nuclear level lifetimes in the femtosecond regime provides crucial information in many of these investigations. Additional projects that are particularly appropriate to the capabilities available in our laboratory are pursued, and collaborative research with colleagues from other institutions is a vital component of our program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels continues as the nexus of all activities in our laboratory, and graduates are trained nuclear scientists who are capable of making important contributions in meeting our national needs. Providing a supportive professional experience for students is an ongoing, vital component of our program, and students enthusiastically participate in experiments at other facilities, scientific conferences, and the activities of professional societies. Research at a small accelerator laboratory, such as ours, permits hands-on experience for students, and these young scientists are mentored on a daily basis. For many years, the research facilities of our laboratory have been made available to students and faculty from non-doctoral-granting institutions, as well as scientists from other research universities, national laboratories, and nuclear-related industry. Research performed in our laboratory has contributed directly to addressing areas of national need, such as homeland security and the design of advanced nuclear reactors, and will continue to do so. These applications are well represented by the activities of government and industrial partners who utilize our accelerator and research equipment. For example, collaborative studies with colleagues from industry have led to improved neutron-detection-based methods for the inspection of luggage for explosives and illegal drugs, and data obtained in our laboratory has been used to evaluate direct energy-storage devices. In each case, the unique capabilities of our laboratory were important considerations in the selection of our facility for this work.</AbstractNarration>
