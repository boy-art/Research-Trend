    <AbstractNarration>The 2013 Redbud Geometry/Topology Conferences will be held March 8-10, 2013 at the University of Arkansas, and Fall 2013 at Oklahoma State University. These conferences will continue the biannual Redbud Geometry/Topology conference series for 2013. The spring 2013 conference will focus on connections between different areas of low dimensional topology, including Heegaard Floer homology, symplectic and contact geometry, 3- and 4-manifolds, knot theory and mapping class groups. The spring conference also includes a graduate workshop, held Friday, March 8, 2013. The fall 2013 conference will predominantly consist of talks by early-career mathematicians from Arkansas, Oklahoma and surrounding states. It will feature talks on a range of topics in topology and geometric group theory, based around the research interests of faculty at the three schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These meetings continue the series of Redbud conferences held in Fall 2011, Spring 2012, and Fall 2012 at the University of Arkansas, Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma, respectively. By all accounts, these conferences were a success, bringing many outstanding researchers from across the country to the area and creating connections between researchers among these institutions, and to those from around the country. The Redbud conferences serve to bring nationally recognized researchers to the Arkansas and Oklahoma areas and to broaden connections between the areas schools. We hope and expect the conference series to continue and grow in the coming years. The conference website is: http://comp.uark.edu/~jv002/redbud/.</AbstractNarration>
