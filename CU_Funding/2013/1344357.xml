    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is intended to investigate the use of stable noble gases as both tracers of groundwater flow and weather patterns in places where rainwater infiltration is rapid, i.e., in fractured rock systems. Noble gas concentrations in water are temperature dependent and the noble gas thermometer has been used for decades in paleoclimate reconstructions in sedimentary systems. Recent work in the Galapagos Islands suggests that recharge water in fractured groundwater systems reflect the temperature of the ground surface at the precise time of infiltration rather than the mean annual air temperature value, as is commonly assumed. If this is confirmed, noble gases in fractured rock areas will be recording seasonality, and thus, should provide information about timing and location of recharge. Noble gases in many Galapagos samples also suggest that water sometimes is not in equilibrium with the atmosphere at the surface. A recent pilot study of rainwater in Michigan not only suggests that rainwater is indeed not in equilibrium with the atmosphere at land surface but that there is a direct link between the noble gas composition in rain and weather patterns. Both rain and Galapagos spring water suggest that fog might modify the noble gas composition of air saturated water. The main goal of the proposed work, which will be carried out mostly in East Maui where the presence of precipitation and fog is prominent, and where there is an abundance of springs and groundwater wells, is to test these hypotheses and to assess whether or not noble gases can be used to trace both groundwater flow and weather patterns in rapid rainwater infiltration systems. &lt;br/&gt; The broader significance and importance of this work will be felt at multiple levels, with both an intellectual and societal nature. On an intellectual level, this study will lead to an in-depth understanding of poorly understood and constrained surface and near-surface processes capable of impacting atmospheric noble gas concentrations and thus, the use of the noble gas thermometer in many regions around the world. On a societal level, this work is relevant because it contributes to better water resource management plans in fractured, water stressed areas, both in the US and throughout the world. Maui itself faces a growing population and a forecasted increase in water demand of 40% until 2030, combined with decreasing rainfall due to climate change. This work will also foster collaborations between the University of Michigan, US Geological Survey, and the University of Hawaii. This project will support a PhD student and contribute to drawing increasing numbers of undergraduate non-science majors into scientific careers by creating new opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in the PIs? research.</AbstractNarration>
