    <AbstractNarration>The role of the water channel aquaglyceroporin-3b (Aqp-3b) in cellular dynamics during early nervous system development and neural tube closure &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During early embryonic development, changes in the shape and placement of cells causes the neural plate to form the neural tube. Transcription factors like Zic1 in the neural plate direct the expression of genes that regulate cellular behavior during neural tube closure. While previous work has identified aquaglyceroporin-3b (aqp-3b), a water channel, as a downstream target of Zic factors, little is known about how aqp-3b affects nervous system development. The zebrafish model system will be used to determine the role of Aqp-3b during changes in cell shape and adhesion as the neural plate forms the neural tube. The goal of this project is to use the genetic and optical assets of the zebrafish embryo to study the closure of the neural tube, a developmental event that has far-reaching consequences for normal nervous system development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training goals of this project are to provide experience in early nervous system developmental research conducted across species and to provide experience with developing undergraduate education. The education goals of this project involve using the rapid development and genetic accessibility of the zebrafish as a tool to integrate undergraduate instruction with molecular research. Aspects of this project will be developed into a course for American Indian tribal college students to introduce biological research and to create a lasting positive effect on their future participation in the field of developmental biology and neuroscience. This research-based course will expose students early in their biology careers to research with the goal of increasing their future success in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
