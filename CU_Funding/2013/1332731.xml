    <AbstractNarration>By supporting graduate students to attend IEEE SECON 2013, this award will increase the dissemination&lt;br/&gt;of the conference research results to a larger and a more diverse audience, which otherwise&lt;br/&gt;would not have been able to attend. In so doing, this award will contribute to the strength&lt;br/&gt;and inclusiveness of the research community, and will lead to the long-term health and vitalization&lt;br/&gt;of SECON. In addition, by giving preference in grant awards to women and under-represented&lt;br/&gt;students, it is hoped that it will increase the participation among these groups. By advertising to a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should&lt;br/&gt;be able to attend and benefit from the conference. A broad and diverse population is key to&lt;br/&gt;the health of the research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities&lt;br/&gt;for students (especially those from under-represented groups) to attend a high-quality conference,&lt;br/&gt;this project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students themselves&lt;br/&gt;benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable&lt;br/&gt;setting, and from attending research presentations that may be related to their research areas.&lt;br/&gt;The research community benefits from the improvement of the students in the pipeline, and&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction of new researcher perspectives. Additionally, everybody benefits from&lt;br/&gt;the increased diversity of participants attending the conference.</AbstractNarration>
