    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) site led by Professors Greg M. Swain and Robert L. LaDuca both at Michigan State University. In this project, students are learning how sustainable practices impact all fields of chemistry and how these practices cut across different disciplines of science and engineering. The research experience will provide them with the skills needed to carry out chemical research or chemical processes in an environmentally-conscientious manner. The overall objectives of the project are therefore, (i) to involve undergraduate students in graduate-level research in sustainable chemistry, (ii) to provide a positive mentoring experience for undergraduates, (iii) to better prepare undergraduate students for graduate school, (iv) to motivate undergraduate students to consider pursuing an academic career, and (v) to recruit undergraduate students for graduate school at MSU. Student interns will also participate in outreach activities that will provide high school and middle school students with educational benefits and the interns with valuable experience in communicating scientific information and mentoring. The impact will be even broader when interns communicate their positive experience with others at their own institutions. The activities will teach the student interns, who will be part of the next generation workforce, how chemical research is conducted in a sustainable and responsible manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participating student interns will receive 10 weeks of hands-on, interdisciplinary research experience in sustainable chemistry and chemical processes. Student interns will be engaged in research involving green synthesis, water purification and quality monitoring, renewable energy-related materials, and advanced imaging and spectroscopy. Students will also benefit from weekly journal clubs, mentoring faculty research presentations and networking dinners, and from participation in teaching modules on research ethics, statistics, laboratory and chemical safety, strategies for applying to graduate school, and professional development. All of the program activities are designed to sharpen the student?s critical and scientific thinking skills, provide them with experience in all aspects of research from experimental design through performance and analysis, and help to make them knowledgeable about sustainable chemistry and chemical processes.</AbstractNarration>
