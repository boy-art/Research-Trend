    <AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the 29th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, to be held June 17?20, 2013 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium on Computational Geometry (SOCG) is the oldest and most influential international conference in computational geometry. Throughout its almost 30-year history, SOCG has played a seminal role in the formation and evolution of the field, and it continues to serve as the flagship venue for groundbreaking research in all areas of geometric computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will be used to encourage and facilitate the participation of under-represented groups in this top-tier computer science conference. They will also contribute towards attracting more underrepresented groups to computer science research giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional and social exchanges that SOCG fosters. Finally, the conference itself and all conference attendees will benefit from the greater attendance and consequently higher proportion of students and under-represented groups that this travel grant makes possible.</AbstractNarration>
