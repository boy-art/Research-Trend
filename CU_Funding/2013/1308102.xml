    <AbstractNarration>Technical Description: The objective of this research is to develop a fundamental understanding of carrier transport across materials interfaces. Rectifying interfaces between different materials such as p-n junctions and metal-semiconductor contacts are the foundation of modern digital logic and optoelectronic devices. This research provides knowledge of how carrier attenuation, parallel momentum conservation, and interface band structure affect carrier transport. The scientific objectives are to: i) measure the effects of interface band structure and parallel momentum conservation upon carrier attenuation, ii) locally map these effects with nanoscale resolution, and iii) develop custom materials interfaces which enhance or suppress these effects. The technical approach consists of thin film deposition in a state-of-the-art ultrahigh vacuum chamber, and carrier transport measurements using low-temperature in-situ ballistic electron emission microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: The project addresses fundamental areas of charge carrier transport across materials interfaces that have high technological relevance. Hot-carrier attenuation, conservation of parallel momentum, and interface band structure are fundamental aspects of carrier transport in solid state logic and optoelectronic devices. Advancements in this knowledge enable improvements in functionality and efficiency that are critically needed to keep pace with the ever increasing demands placed upon electronic devices. In addition, a significant program in outreach and education is included that enables research experience for high-school students, as well as the participation in community and K-12 outreach events. Furthermore intensive training and development of graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, is a significant part of the project.</AbstractNarration>
