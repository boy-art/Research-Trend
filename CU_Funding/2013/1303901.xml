    <AbstractNarration>This work explores the hypothesis that parasitic chytrids (fungi) may change the seasonal cycle of ice algal abundances and diversity by targeting specific ice algal taxa, mainly certain diatom species. In addressing this hypothesis, this grant aims at providing information on the spatial and temporal patterns of abundance, and diversity of marine fungi in arctic sea ice in comparison to water column information and relate this information to various environmental data which will include salinity, temperature, and as well as ice thickness and snow cover. Field work will be conducted between 2014 and 2015 on the fast ice in Barrow and in spring of 2015 on RV Sikulaq in the Bering sea. The combined data set will allow for a refined interpretation of the relevance of the parasitic fungi for the food web structure in arctic seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is the first to explore these ecological processes in polar sea ice and can potentially lead to a paradigm change on carbon processing similar to one seen recently in freshwater science. Detailed studies on marine chytrids are rare in any ice covered marine region and these observations might stimulate new research in both Arctic and Antarctic regions. Biological community composition information will contribute to diversity research on fungi in general and the understanding of global patterns in microbial biodiversity linked. The research will have broader impacts in its engagement in teaching activities through training of two participating UAF students and through high school seminars as well as meeting with teachers in Barrow, and their potential participation in expeditions. A broad public audience including minorities will be kept informed through media coverage and project-specific web pages documenting the field and lab work.</AbstractNarration>
