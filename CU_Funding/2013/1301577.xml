    <AbstractNarration>The project aims at supporting the U.S. participation in a conference organized jointly by a group of scientists at Bar-Ilan University, Hebrew University, ORT Braude College and the University of Miami in the US to be held in Nahariya Israel on May 19-24, 2013. The participants will be prominent scientists, young researchers and students from the US, Canada, the European Union, Eastern Europe and Asia. Recently, techniques from complex analysis (e.g., the concepts of Schwarz function, quadrature domains, complex harmonic maps) have given new lines of attack on some long standing problems in physics, e.g., Hele-Shaw flows, gravitational lensing, Laplacian growth, etc. The presentations at the conference range from plenary lectures describing recent breakthrough results in Complex Analysis, Dynamical Systems and Mathematical Physics, in a form accessible to advanced graduate students and young researchers, to more specialized talks on more focused research topics. Each of the past conferences attracted a significant number of US Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers. The proposal's main goals are to build on the development of collaborations between mathematicians and mathematical physicists from all over the world, young and experienced. The project strives to increase the existing momentum and bring in another group of young US researchers and graduate students into collaboration with colleagues worldwide, initiate US young researchers and graduate students into an active research scene worldwide and introduce them to most of the active researchers in complex analysis from all over the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supporting the travel of young researchers and graduate students to such a conference where scientists from North and South America, Europe and Asia, old and young, prominent and just beginning, are spending all their waking hours together in an inspiring and congenial environment will inspire many beginning researchers. There are already several graduate students and young post-docs that will be participating in the conference. The project aims to significantly increase the participation of young students and researchers. One of the most important broader impacts of the project is also to increase participation of women and minorities in the event and insure their inclusion into a larger group of scientists working in the areas of the conference.</AbstractNarration>
