    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this REU Site program is to offer a unique training opportunity for undergraduates to conduct research in the multidisciplinary area of New-generation Power-efficient Computer Systems Design. In the design of high-performance massive multicore chips, power and heat, along with performance, are now considered as dominant constraints. The increasing power consumption is of growing concern due to several reasons, e.g., cost, performance, reliability, scalability, and environmental impact. More specifically, timely advances in exascale computing cannot be achieved without a holistic approach to reducing energy. The proposed REU program facilitates research and training in the complementary, multi-layered disciplines ranging from application layer to middleware to low level circuit design. Due to partnering with other REU programs on campus, the participating students will have opportunities to interact with a broad range of REU students from around the country, with many faculty members, and with graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the intellectual merits of this program is that it will enable high quality interdisciplinary research that links ideas from compilers and OS, Network-on-Chip (NoC), computer architecture, parallel and distributed computing, complex networks, optimization techniques, digital communications, and circuit design to address power and thermal efficiency in multicore-based computer systems. Another intellectual merit is that the program creates opportunities for undergraduates to study challenges in designing new generation of power efficient multicore architectures. As a unique feature, the participating students are exposed to research and development activities in the sustainable computing area through planned visits to partner industries and a national lab. The broader impact of this REU program includes (1) making contributions to producing a workforce that is trained in the multidisciplinary topic of sustainable computer system design; (2) advancing discovery in energy savings in computers for economical and ecological reasons; and (3) promoting teaching and learning in sustainable computing. This interdisciplinary effort is valuable for undergraduate students as they are exposed to research ideas that will have a significant impact on environmental sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
