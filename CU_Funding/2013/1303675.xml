    <AbstractNarration>The source of energetic electrons in the radiation belts during magnetic storms has long been and remains an unsolved problem in magnetospheric physics. In the most common model electrons are first accelerated in the near-Earth plasma sheet and these accelerated particles provide a ?seed? population for the radiation belts. Under this model the seed electrons undergo further acceleration in the radiation belts. Recently some studies have questioned whether or not this seed population is necessary. In this view the electrons are locally accelerated in the radiation belts. This proposal will investigate whether or not a seed population is necessary. The investigators will examine the phase space density of electrons as a function of radial distance by using observations from the THEMIS satellites, the Van Allen Probes, SWARM (an ESA mission) and e-POP (a Canadian mission). This will be a statistical study that uses a number of events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has long involved secondary school students in his research. His research projects for high school students have been very successful. He will continue this under this grant. The research findings from this proposal are important for space weather applications.</AbstractNarration>
