    <AbstractNarration>This award will fund the conference entitled "Representations of Reductive Groups" to be held May 19-23, 2014, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The conference will address developments in the representation theory of reductive Lie groups and algebraic groups over finite and local fields, as well as connections of this theory with other subjects, such as number theory, automorphic forms, algebraic geometry and combinatorics. It will feature one-hour lectures from renowned experts in these areas. A significant portion of the award will be used to support the participation of current graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representation theory is a central subject in modern mathematics. Historically, its study arose from attempts to understand the role of symmetry in physics. More recently, it has become the framework to address many of the most important and long-standing questions in number theory. The conference will highlight exciting recent developments in this area, and will draw junior participants into the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference webpage is available at http://math.mit.edu/conferences/Vogan/ .</AbstractNarration>
