    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research in support of the conference on "Bacteria-Material Interactions" is cofunded by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program, in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. This conference will focus on how materials interact with bacteria, and in developing an understanding the nature of these interactions. One possible outcome of this conference would be in coherently developing better materials that enhance positive tissue-cell/material interactions and simultaneously inhibiting bacterial colonization. This conference would provide an important forum for the exchange of ideas among not only the established and emerging leaders in this field but also the next generation of scientists, who will carry the field forward and integrate it into the broader context of advanced biomaterials. Exchange of ideas at the forefront of this important field, and definition of key pathways for the development of next generation infection-resisting biomaterials would be identified and shared amongst a broad array of scientists and engineers. Sessions will be organized covering a broad range of topics related to materials, and material-microbial interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: With this award, both graduate and undergraduate students would be able to present their research findings, and would provide them an opportunity in discussing potential career choices with individuals from academia, government, and industry. The broadest impact of this project would be the interdisciplinary scientific and professional training/experience that the various young researchers supported by NSF funds would have. These experiences will help train a diverse and interdisciplinary set of students who will integrate the new paradigm in designing novel materials in preventing bacterial infection.</AbstractNarration>
