    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the College of William and Mary provides twelve undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear and particle physics, theoretical physics, applied physics, and non-destructive evaluation. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have shared highlights of the research through a weekly public blog, given two research presentations, one of which is either a talk at the end of the program or a poster presentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics. The project plans to be informed by an on-going evaluation, which examines clear goals.</AbstractNarration>
