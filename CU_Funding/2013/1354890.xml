    <AbstractNarration>This Research Coordination Network will investigate pathogens across scales of biological organization with the goal of better understanding of the processes that determine pathogen transmission and disease occurrence. Why do pathogens, even different strains within a species, differ so dramatically in the severity of disease induced in a host? And why do pathogens vary in efficiency of transmission from one host to the next? These questions focus on different biological scales (the host organism versus the host population) yet are inextricably connected in determining evolutionary pressures on pathogens: persistence of a strain is jointly determined by exploitation of individual hosts and by transmission across the host population. Network activities will build collaborations among microbiologists, immunologists, epidemiologists and evolutionary biologists via workshops and research exchanges. Network members will develop data and tools to: a) identify causes of variation among strains of important pathogens; b) predict pathogen evolution in diverse immunological and epidemiological contexts; and c) design medical interventions to minimize chances of pathogen evolution rendering drugs or vaccines obsolete. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring benefits to multiple stakeholders. For researchers, the Network will provide a database with linked analytical tools, plus ample training opportunities. For students of biology, mathematics and medicine, the Network will generate teaching modules that convey interdisciplinary skills and insights. Finally, the Network will promote the development of evolution-proof medical treatments.</AbstractNarration>
