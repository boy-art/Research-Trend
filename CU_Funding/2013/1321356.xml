    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated platform for investigating small networks of dissociated neurons, based on monitoring their electrical activity. The targeted platform is a multielectrode array (MEA) tool, distinguished by very accurate patterning of neuronal networks using mechanical and chemical methods. By virtue of its superior signal-to-noise ratio, this tool will have transformative impact in all fields of cell-based sensors and neuroscience by enabling repeatable and sensitive experiments.&lt;br/&gt;This tool can be used for investigating the highly complex processes of learning and memory in a systematic and simplified manner within cultured cells. It can be also used in the pharmacological industry as a test bed for examining the influence of pharmacological agents on neurons. Alternatively, it can be used as a cell-based sensor, in which changes in electrical activity may be indicative of the presence of neuroactive compounds. In this project, it will also be used as a training tool in bioengineering labs and as a demonstration unit for a summer program targeting middle school girls to increase the number of female engineering students at Lehigh University.</AbstractNarration>
