    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating shrinkage reducing admixture formulations to fill technology gaps in the construction industry wherein more durable concrete is needed for repair and maintenance and construction of new infrastructure. The translated technology has the following unique features: rapid identification of new target compounds with high activity for reducing shrinkage and associated cracking of concrete that provides exemplary cost savings in the development stage as well as the ability to identify new and non-intuitive molecular structures for a given application with improved performance when compared to the leading competing technology in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by applying computer aided molecular design (CAMD) technology resulting in the identification of new compounds with improved characteristics for use as shrinkage reducing admixtures in concrete; the efficacy of which will be demonstrated on a prototype-scale concrete slab. The partnership engages Tennessee Technological University (TTU), the University of Akron (UA) and technology consultant Mr. Hugh Cameron to provide guidance in the concrete construction materials industry and other aspects related to market development, licensing, business planning and financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the new technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be a reasonable market share of the existing shrinkage reducing admixture sales in the next five years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the concrete admixture market space. The societal impact, long term, will be to improve the performance of concrete infrastructure and thereby save potentially billions of future dollars in lost time and energy consumption due to avoided early and premature repair and maintenance.</AbstractNarration>
