    <AbstractNarration>The Sitka Sound Science Center (SSSC) is awarded a grant to improve the capability of scientists, especially those funded by the NSF, to conduct marine biological research at a time when changes to the ocean in the Gulf of Alaska will have dramatic impacts on world economies and local communities. These upgrades will allow for the deepening of understandings in a critically important geographic part of the United States where changes in the climate, oceanography and biology are being monitored closely by a broad array of scientists. In addition, the improvements will boost the Science Center?s successful efforts in integrating education and research and diversifying minority representation. The Sitka Sound Science Center is dedicated to scientific education and scientific research and is uniquely qualified to carry out this project. With formal and informal partnerships with high profile organizations such as the University of Alaska, Scripps Oceanographic Institution, the Smithsonian, Stanford, Duke, University of Washington, Alaska Department of Fish and Game and NOAA, the Science Center has hosted many researchers whose field work and scientific experiments require a reliable salt water system. In addition, the Science Center staff has extensive experience managing salt water systems and are ideally poised for the installation of these improvements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located in Sitka, Alaska, a community that is 33% Alaska Native, SSSC provides research and educational opportunities for minorities as well as rural coastal community members. Upgrades made to the facility will allow those opportunities to help diversify science into the future. The facility hosts many NSF-funded visiting scientists, and it conducts its own research and science educational programs which are also supported by the NSF. Additionally, it provides informal science educational experiences to thousands of visitors each year. The visitors will have a better aquarium experience and come away with better scientific understandings because of these upgrades. In addition, SSSC hosts hundreds of local and non local students who will have a better chance of conducting successful educational research projects because of these improvements.
