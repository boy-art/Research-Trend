    <AbstractNarration>Low-dose inspection for nuclear threats using monochromatic gamma-rays is a novel method to detect shielded nuclear material (SNM) with a potential to significantly outperform currently employed methods. The key advantage of the method we are pursuing is in low dose (&lt;20 mrad), ability for high-speed screening, accuracy in identification of nuclear materials, and relatively low cost and simplicity in design and operation. The advantages are achievable through use of ultra-compact superconducting accelerator technology applied to sources development, which can be tailored to produce multiple monoenergetic gamma rays and/or neutrons. Furthermore, monoenergetic sources coupled with the development of advanced radiation detectors and a new information science-driven approach for system design and data analysis have a potential to create unprecedented performance of the system in view of safety, efficiency and accuracy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique and innovative approach to the design is the enabling factor for future SNM detection technologies. Integration of the novel method of monoenergetic source generation through use of a new generation of ultra-compact accelerators with advanced imaging detectors has a potential for a paradigm shift in the ability to rapidly and accurately clear objects from nuclear threats. Moreover, this interdisciplinary work requires a broad combined expertize in the areas of compact hadron accelerators, monochromatic gamma-ray sources, detectors, and algorithms making our team particularly well-suited for the task. This research combines several new and high-risk ideas and, if successful, could bring about revolutionary advances in the methods to detect shielded SNM, with broad impacts and benefits to the welfare and security of the nation and society and promote the diversity and public understanding of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
