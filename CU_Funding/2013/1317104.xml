    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Tyler J. Massaro of The University of Tennessee, Knoxville to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. The project title is "How to best use resources to mitigate devastating bushfires." The host scientist is Dr. Daniel Spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In severe weather conditions there is potential for devastating wildfires to occur. Early detection and response increase the chances of preventing such fires, but minimal research has been done on the optimal allocation of resources between surveillance and response. This project develops analytical methods and numerical optimization models for determining investments in surveillance and response infrastructure that minimize the total costs of preventing fires from becoming a serious detriment to local economies and ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this project aims to immediately benefit fire-pacted communities in Australia and elsewhere by supporting local fire management with ecologically sound, economically feasible surveillance and response strategies.</AbstractNarration>
