    <AbstractNarration>Prominent theories of infant development have been built on the premise that freedom to move is essential (e.g., Gibson, 1988), and that restricted movement is harmful for development. Since it is ethically unacceptable for researchers to test effects of restricted movement by intentionally restraining infants, many studies have taken advantage of 'natural experiments' provided by cases of children reared in impoverished conditions, such as children in Romanian orphanages who were left in their cribs most of the time (e.g., Nelson, Fox, &amp; Zeanah, 2014). However, in these situations, children were also deprived of social interaction with caregivers, which makes separating the effects of restricted movement versus other types of deprivation difficult.&lt;br/&gt;This work capitalizes on a rare chance to study effects of restricted movement on infant development by examining the use of a 'gahvora' cradle in Tajikistan in Central Asia where restriction of infant movement is common, but infants receive plenty of social interaction and affection. Dr. Karasik, her collaborators, Drs. Adolph and Tamis-LeMonda, and their international research team will investigate the physical, motor, and social development of Tajik infants based on the duration and degree of restriction they experience during the first two years of life. This work also provides insights into whether and how development of motor skills influences development in other domains such as interactions with objects and people.&lt;br/&gt;This study addresses issues that are core to developmental psychology, including questions about cross-cultural consistency in children's development and the effects of context on early experiences and emerging skills. Data will be shared with the broader scientific community through the Databrary.org video data-sharing library. This project will engage undergraduate students and researchers in the U.S. and abroad by offering training in research methods and developmental science.</AbstractNarration>
