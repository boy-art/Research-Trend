    <AbstractNarration>Meeting: FASEB Conference on Mechanisms in Plant Development,&lt;br/&gt;August 11-16, 2013, Saxtons River, Vermont, USA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will promote interactions between biologists who are using different scientific approaches to study plant developmental mechanisms. These interactions will take place at the 13th International meeting on Mechanisms in Plant Development, which will be held from August 11th-16th, 2013 in Saxtons River, Vermont, USA. This meeting is the only regular international conference devoted entirely to plant developmental biology, which is the study of how plants grow and how they are able to make different structures, such as leaves, fruits and grains, that are critical to our agricultural economy. Discoveries in developmental biology may help in the design of better crops for food and biofuel production, as well as reduce the impact of agriculture on the environment. This particular conference is special because the small size and secluded location of the meeting are higly conducive to informal discussion of new ideas and emerging concepts, and also because it will support the involvement of early career and minority scientists. The results of the conference will be widely disseminated through a written summary and slides to be used by meeting participants to spread the exciting new findings presented.</AbstractNarration>
