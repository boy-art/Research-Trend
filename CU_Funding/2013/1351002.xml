    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate the integration of novel two-dimensional materials in silicon-based, planar photonic circuits to achieve broadband optoelectronic devices operating in the near- to mid-infrared spectral range. The two-dimensional materials to be studied include graphene and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides of various types. The approach is to develop fabrication processes and conduct characterization and measurement of two-dimensional materials integrated optoelectronic devices. The specific research goals include development of broadband and highly efficient photodetectors and modulators for the near- and mid-infrared, investigation and utilization of nonlinear optical phenomena in two-dimensional materials, and demonstration of waveguide integrated and coupled two-dimensional light emitters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional materials have not been widely utilized for integrated optoelectronic devices. The proposed research will demonstrate practical optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional materials with unprecedented performances. The integrated approach will also provide effective near-field means to investigate the optoelectronic properties of the two-dimensional materials. The research results will be the first steps to incorporating two-dimensional materials in large scale integrated, silicon-based photonic circuits and systems for optical communication and computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will impact the industry and the scientific community by providing new materials for optoelectronic devices. The education and outreach activities will encourage high-schools students to pursue a career in science and engineering, disseminate the knowledge learned in the project through undergraduate participation in research and curriculum development, and recruit minority students to participate in research.</AbstractNarration>
