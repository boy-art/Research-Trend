    <AbstractNarration>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;Symposium C: Thin-Film Compound Semiconductor Photovoltaics will be held at the 2013 Spring&lt;br/&gt;Meeting of the Materials Research Society. Thin film photovoltaics have demonstrated high&lt;br/&gt;light-to electricity conversion efficiencies and are leading candidates to provide lower-cost&lt;br/&gt;energy due to potential advantages in manufacturing and materials costs. The topic has great&lt;br/&gt;importance for the materials research community to further its contribution to the increased&lt;br/&gt;urgency in the US and globally for developing alternative energy sources. The specific goals&lt;br/&gt;of the symposium are to present and disseminate significant recent advances in the understanding&lt;br/&gt;of these materials and devices and to help develop a diverse and active community including&lt;br/&gt;established researchers and young scientists to further technical progress in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The symposium brings together a wide range of experts in research on thin-film photovoltaics&lt;br/&gt;including twelve internationally recognized invited speakers along with students and other&lt;br/&gt;young scientists. There will be sessions on many different aspects of the technology and&lt;br/&gt;a range of different materials needed for production. Synergies between different materials,&lt;br/&gt;processing approaches, and characterization methods will be highlighted. This range of technical&lt;br/&gt;presentations along with a symposium organization designed to foster open discussion will&lt;br/&gt;help further scientific progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the symposium target two different impacts. First, the technical content&lt;br/&gt;will further the potential of thin-film photovoltaics to contribute to US and global energy&lt;br/&gt;and environmental needs. Second, an emphasis on developing a broad, collaborative research&lt;br/&gt;community with a specific focus on the educational development of students and early career&lt;br/&gt;researchers and their incorporation into this community will help develop the next generation&lt;br/&gt;of scientists needed to meet our research needs.</AbstractNarration>
