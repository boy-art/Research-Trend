    <AbstractNarration>Objective of the project is to pursue research in analysis and design of super-tall buildings through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) aided shape tailoring and geometric optimization of the structure. Super-tall buildings not only need to be safe but also need to be comfortable to occupants in high winds. CFD simulations will allow the architects to change the aesthetics of the building and permit the structural engineer to develop structural systems that are safe, serviceable and efficient. The integration of cutting-edge CFD technologies with state-of-the-art structural system optimization is the innovation of this project. The results will give U.S. consultants a competitive edge in the international market of design of tall buildings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two fundamental stages of the building design process, conceptual and preliminary, will be investigated with the aim of enhancing analysis methodologies and optimization procedures. Concerning the conceptual design stage, low dimensional CFD simulation strategies that allow the efficient and robust comparative aerodynamic assessment of parameterized - envisaged as part of the Building Information Modeling (BIM) process - geometric profiles, morphable through embedded dynamic mesh algorithms, will be developed. These strategies will take full advantage of the latest advances in CFD flow simulation while avoiding the large computational burden through low-dimensional modeling. This will lead to a first-of-its-kind tall building aerodynamic shape/form tailoring tool that will not only shed light on the aerodynamic effects of geometric modification, but also help define aerodynamically optimum profiles. Step two of the design process will be investigated with the aim of developing performance-based topology optimization algorithms specifically geared at defining robust and innovative structural systems to be coupled with the building profiles of stage one. These algorithms will yield optimum structural topologies subject to performance expectations, defined in terms of system fragility, explicitly modeling the uncertain environment in which the structural system of tall buildings must exist. These algorithms will be analytically embedded within specifically developed topology search spaces capable of yielding structures with the morphology and constructability demanded by the complexity of the architectural design space of modern tall buildings.</AbstractNarration>
