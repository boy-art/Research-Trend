    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Sara Elizabeth Rowland of the University of Maryland at the Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the Korean Institute of Ocean Science and Technology in Ansan, Korea. The project title is "Analysis of Protein Folding in Thermophilic Hydrogen Producing Microbes." The host scientist is Dr. Sung Gyun Kang. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biohydrogen offers a clean alternative to the utilization of fossil fuels. The proper folding of enzymes including carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and hydrogenase is critical for efficient yield in select carboxydotrophic hydrogen producing microbial systems. Molecular chaperones are proteins that assist in the proper folding of other proteins including enzymes. This project investigates the development of a more productive hydrogenogenic system by introducing unique chaperones from specialized bacteria that use carbon monoxide as an energy and carbon source into Thermococcus onnurineus strain NA1, a carboxydotrophic hyperthermophilic hydrogen producing microbe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow will share the EAPSI-facilitated research experience with her home academic institution upon completion of the program, potentially encouraging new international collaborations between institutes.</AbstractNarration>
