    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry at the national Science Foundation supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at The University of Iowa focused on providing undergraduate students with research opportunities in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The REU program will support ten undergraduate students for ten weeks during the summer and will be administered through the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute at the University of Iowa (NNI@UI). Participants will be recruited from institutions with limited undergraduate research opportunities and underrepresented minorities and women will be recruited by coordinating with on-going diversity efforts at The University of Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU participants will have the opportunity to work on a cutting edge research project with faculty mentors from the departments of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Chemistry, and Pharmacy. Given the increasing importance of nanoscience and nanotechnology, it is imperative to provide undergraduates with early exposure to research in this emerging, interdisciplinary field and to enhance their interest in science and engineering for graduate studies and as a career path. REU participants will take part in a technical communication workshop, research ethics and laboratory safety seminars, research seminars, graduate school and networking sessions and a university-wide undergraduate research symposium.</AbstractNarration>
