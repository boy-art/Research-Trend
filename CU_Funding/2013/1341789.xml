    <AbstractNarration>To realize the full potential of spin-based devices, ways must be found to inject, manipulate, and detect the spin of the electron by purely electrical means. Recently, the Principal Investigator (PI) successfully demonstrated that lateral spin orbit coupling (LSOC) can be used to create a strongly spin-polarized current by purely electrical means; that is, in the absence of any applied magnetic field. The PI proposes to extend these studies to spin valve structures composed of a quantum dot or wire coupled to the source and drain via asymmetrically biased quantum point contacts (QPCs). With an asymmetric bias on the gates of the two QPCs, their spin filtering, when combined with Coulomb blockaded transport through the active channel, should lead to spin-blockaded transport through the spin valve. When operated close to threshold, all electrical spin valves could also be used to investigate new many-body effects, such as electrically controlled spontaneous spin polarization, Wigner crystallization and formation of spin lattices in nanoscale devices, which are burgeoning fields of spintronics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed planning visit to initiate research with Swedish partners at the University of Linkoping to provide the first theoretical investigation of the Coulomb/Spin Blockades and Wigner Crystallization regimes of operation in all-electric spin valves in the presence of LSOC. Since these many-body effects cannot be modeled using a one-particle Hamiltonian approach, the cooperative technical approach will be to develop a theoretical framework based on a multi-particle Fock space and steady-state rate equations, and to calculate the conductance of these spin valves. Theoretical efforts will complement recent experimental efforts at the University of Cincinnati to create all electric spin valves and other recent reports on quantum manipulation of single spins in quantum dots which rely on subtle spin correlation effects leading to intriguing non-linear transport phenomena such as Negative Differential Region (NDR), multiple NDR, and bistability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;A thorough understanding of the Coulomb and Spin Blockades, and Wigner crystallization in all electric spin valves in the presence of LSOC would be a major milestone in the field of spintronics. A deep understanding of these non-linear effects in strongly correlated systems will contribute to future advancement in fields where non-equilibrium dynamics are involved. If successful, this project is likely to theoretically produce the first simulator that includes the effects of Coulomb and Spin blockade and models spin transport in nanoscale devices in the presence of LSOC. The software developed will be useful to investigate heterostructure parameters for design and fabrication of all electric spin valves for applications in spin-based sensors, spin filters, multilevel logic circuits and data storage applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project described is intended to catalyze new collaboration between the School of Electronics and Computing Systems at the University of Cincinnati and the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology in Linkoping, Sweden. This effort will serve as a precursor for long-term collaboration between Cincinnati and Linkoping Universities to engage undergraduate and graduate physics/engineering students in both countries through a research exchange program during which the students would benefit from the guidance of engineers and physicists with complementary expertise.</AbstractNarration>
