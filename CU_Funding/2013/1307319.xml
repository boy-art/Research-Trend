    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the Division of Chemistry, Qian Wang of the University of South Carolina will develop a new strategy to synthesize functional polymer-protein core-shell nanoparticles. Specifically, the project will focus on the design and synthesis of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers for the fabrication of polymer-protein core-shell nanoparticles. The assembly process will be characterized quantitatively using solution small angle neutron scattering, fluorescent microscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry and quartz crystal microbalance techniques. Finally, in order to validate the synthetic chemistry, a model core-shell nanoparticle system will be created for delivery and release of a molecular payload. The broader impacts of the project involve the interdisciplinary training of project participants, ranging from high school students to undergraduate and graduate students. The project will enable them to develop advanced research skills and provide international networks that will serve students well in their future careers under the ever-growing situation of economic globalization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will uncover new ways to create small particles with nanometer dimensions that are hybrids of synthetic materials and proteins. Such knowledge is essential for the development of low-cost, structurally well-defined particles that could be used for applications ranging from drug delivery, to protein pharmaceuticals, and to the stabilization and support of enzyme catalysts.</AbstractNarration>
