    <AbstractNarration>Researchers have developed an immersive 3D video game to teach programming, where users have to use Java programming language to complete levels. This project to date has expanded the boundaries of educational technology in multiple ways: 1) rather than being a lecture-based system, it is a digital game with an engaging plot, characters, and setting; 2) it includes a competitive multiplayer mode; yet 3) the technology is also a full-spectrum learning platform that includes an interactive textbook, an in-game integrated development environment (IDE), automated IDE support, live chat support, and a storyline that progressively introduces complex programming concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would enable providing scalable computer science education to a large number of middle and high school students. Advances in educational research would be made through this project as it explores what it means to provide engaging game-based education on regional and national scales. There is a known challenge in hiring qualified computer science teachers at the K-12 level, and this project could help bring highly engaging computer science education to the classroom without having to increase instructional costs.</AbstractNarration>
