    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will support U.S.-based participants attending the ``Young Geometric Group Theory'' meeting to be held at the Centre International de Recontres Mathematiques (CIRM) at Luminy, France on January 20--24, 2014. There will be four senior speakers giving mini-courses on fundamental topics, as well as several outstanding postdocs giving short talks on their work. The mini-courses and short talks will be on subjects central to geometric group theory, but will also explore connections with other fields, including dynamics, logic, topology, algebraic geometry and measure theory. The topics of the in-depth mini-courses include dynamics and circle packings, hyperbolic geometry and expanders, and Thompson's groups. The shorter talks will cover various topics in CAT(0) geometry, hyperbolic groups, Teichmuller theory, and other areas of current interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric group theory is a young and dynamic field of mathematics, studied by an international community of researchers. Most of the workshop attendees will be early-career mathematicians; the schedule is designed to maximize the interactions among young researchers, as well as to give them extended contact with leading experts in the field.
