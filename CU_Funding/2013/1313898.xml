    <AbstractNarration>Professors Paul J. Chirik of Princeton University, and Elizabeth Jarvo of the University of California-Irvine, are supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to chair a workshop to discuss the opportunities and difficulties in seeking abundant, relatively non-toxic, and inexpensive alternatives for precious metal catalysts. The workshop brings together a diverse group of established and emerging leaders in order to address the lack of readily available synthetic precursors, the suppression of deleterious radical chemistry, the identification and optimization of unique mechanistic pathways and metal properties, and the implementation of spectroscopic and theoretical/computational methods for characterizing open shell transition metal compounds serving as catalysts in homogeneous reactions. Each of these critical topics must be addressed for base metal catalysts to attain or surpass the success of their precious metal (e.g. platinum, palladium, gold, etc.) counterparts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalysts plays a critical for the commercial production of renewable energy as well as for the manufacture of polymers and building materials, and the synthesis of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This workshop focuses on fundamental research in which rare, expensive, and/or toxic metals are replaced with earth-abundant, inexpensive, and benign chemicals. Industrial participation underscores the practical challenges associated with base metal catalysis in the commercial economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to broaden dissemination, this workshop is coupled with the Fall American Chemical Society National Meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana (Sept. 8-12, 2013). Additionally, the workshop proceedings and conclusions are disseminated to the scientific community through websites and a workshop report.</AbstractNarration>
