    <AbstractNarration>SES-1333561 &lt;br/&gt;Miguel Centeno &lt;br/&gt;Maria C. Abascal &lt;br/&gt;Princeton University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How will the introduction of a third, major ethnoracial group affect relations between pre-existing ethnoracial groups? This dissertation broaches this question through the lens of Hispanic population growth and its impact on black/white relations in the United States. The black/white divide has characterized US race relations for most of the country's history; Hispanics are changing that through high birth rates and continued immigration. This project examines the impact of real and perceived levels of Hispanic population growth on Blacks' and Whites' attitudes toward each other and their support for race-targeted and race-coded policies, like affirmative action and welfare. Previous research hints at two possible outcomes of Hispanic population growth: 1) the reinforcement of a black-nonblack divide; or 2) the merger of Blacks and Whites along a shared (American) identity that excludes Hispanics on the basis of cultural rather than racial differences. The study analyzes nationally representative survey data along with original experimental data to address these questions. An analysis of trend data from the General Social Survey and the American National Election Studies data documents how Blacks' and Whites' racial and policy attitudes change over time and in response to local levels of Hispanic population growth. Public goods games will be conducted to extend survey findings to observable behaviors in a controlled laboratory setting. By manipulating two aspects of the game (participants' perceptions of Hispanic population growth and the racial composition of the game group, the games examine whether Blacks' and Whites' contributions to a racially-mixed group vary in response to perceived population trends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As public disagreement over the role of government grows, Americans' racial and policy attitudes and the future of the American welfare state become important topics of both academic and public policy concern. This is especially true in the context of substantial Hispanic population growth, which is no longer limited to a handful of immigration gateways. The recent shift toward new destinations of immigration compels scholars to examine the impact of diversification in communities without established immigrant or minority populations. Research findings have important implications for social policy, including: 1) predicting sites of racial/ethnic hostility, and 2) detailing the impact of diversification on public support for policies like affirmative action and welfare. The study will yield practical information about the value of experimental game methods for the study of race relations. Accordingly, the experimental protocol and data (with identifying information removed) from the games will be made available online, and thus publicly accessible. The findings of this research will be disseminated via interdisciplinary journals and conferences, facilitated in part by ongoing affiliations with the Princeton University Center for Migration and Development and the Center for the Study of Social Organization.</AbstractNarration>
