    <AbstractNarration>MapReduce has been widely leveraged as a new programming model to tap the power of parallel data processing for Big Data. More and more systems are being deployed to serve data-intensive analytics applications written in MapReduce. Many jobs can show up at the same time on a system with conflicting resource requirements. This project investigates cross-layer cooperation techniques to achieve system efficiency, cross-phase techniques to enhance job fairness and system throughput, and cross-job task co-scheduling techniques to exploit the temporal relationship among jobs for better throughput and services to analytic queries composed of multiple MapReduce jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has profound impacts in several aspects. These include (1) strengthening computer science courses at Auburn University, and enhancing instruction effectiveness with student research projects on MapReduce; (2) recruiting and cultivating students of diverse backgrounds, particularly under-represented minority and female student groups for careers in computing; (3) disseminating research results as publications, presentations, conference tutorials and demonstrations, releasing open-source software codes, and eventually pushing them for integration into the official Hadoop code base; and (4) collaborating with industry, strengthening research partnerships, and cultivating opportunities for technology transfer to industry.</AbstractNarration>
