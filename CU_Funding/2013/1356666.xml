    <AbstractNarration>The San Antonio College (SAC) Motivating Engineers to Achieve (META) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program is providing scholarships and support services to talented engineering students who demonstrate financial need. The program is enhancing retention rates, timely associate's degree completion and transfer to four-year institutions for these SAC engineering students. Thus, the project is increasing the numbers of well-educated and skilled engineers in the workforce, addressing the growing regional need for petroleum, materials, marine and mining engineering professionals to support the Texas oil and gas industry. Because SAC is an Hispanic-Serving Institution, the META program is also increasing the number of engineering degrees awarded to students from this historically-underrepresented group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;META's overarching goal is to enhance the quantity and quality of SAC engineering majors who earn degrees, enabling these students to enter the engineering workforce, or continue their formal education in engineering or related fields. In addition to awarding 20 scholarships per year to academically-talented engineering students with financial need, META is accomplishing its goals by providing model academic support services and cohort-building activities that are designed to engage engineering majors with each other and their discipline. Key support activities include recruitment and transition initiatives through the summer Early Development of General Engineering (EDGE) summer program for high school students; opportunities to work on student-led, faculty-guided undergraduate research; dedicated spaces for study, support services and student interaction; and opportunities for students to learn about engineering careers through site visits, guest speakers and internships. Program evaluation, which includes documentation of scholar participation, perceptions, and outcomes, is advancing knowledge and understanding regarding the effects of financial, academic, and social supports on low-income engineering student success.</AbstractNarration>
