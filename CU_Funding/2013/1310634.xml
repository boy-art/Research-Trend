    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This project considers both theoretical and practical aspects of&lt;br/&gt;response, control, and status of the University of Hawai`i Manoa (UHM) campus&lt;br/&gt;electrical microgrid and studies its behavior when distributed renewable energy sources&lt;br/&gt;are added. This project will transform the UHM campus's electrical distribution network&lt;br/&gt;into a more modern, intelligent and responsive microgrid which relies on a greater share&lt;br/&gt;of locally generated energy and energy efficient practices. Three interlinked research&lt;br/&gt;projects will be integrated into the education program on smart grids, renewable energy,&lt;br/&gt;and energy efficiency. The first component assembles all relevant information about the&lt;br/&gt;state of the microgrid and surrounding environment. A second component models and&lt;br/&gt;analyzes the microgrid using probabilistic signal processing and networking models to&lt;br/&gt;accurately predict the state of the microgrid and detect anomalous events (e.g. ramps in&lt;br/&gt;amount of solar PV produced and electrical grid outages). Once accurate models are&lt;br/&gt;constructed and verified through simulations and data gathering, the third project&lt;br/&gt;provides decision-making capability for the microgrid using distributed control and&lt;br/&gt;optimization algorithms to create a secure and stable microgrid to reduces costs and&lt;br/&gt;energy use. Students and faculty will work in a newly created smart campus energy lab&lt;br/&gt;(SCEL) which will house the data and networking components of the UHM campus&lt;br/&gt;microgrid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: UHM researchers and students will be able to combine what they&lt;br/&gt;learn in the classroom with theoretical and practical research projects in the SCEL and on&lt;br/&gt;the UHM campus microgrid. This understanding and practical knowledge will lead to&lt;br/&gt;better insight on the design and integration of new technology for the microgrid and&lt;br/&gt;future utility-scale smart grids. Through collaborations with the Native Hawaiian&lt;br/&gt;Science and Engineering Mentorship Program (NHSEMP) and the Society of Women&lt;br/&gt;Engineers (SWE), the project will also target underrepresented students. This project&lt;br/&gt;differs from other smart sustainable microgrids being deployed at other academic&lt;br/&gt;institutions and communities as our energy profile is unique (Hawaii pays the highest&lt;br/&gt;electricity prices in the nation), we will incorporate large shares of distributed renewable&lt;br/&gt;energy (rooftop PV), and Hawai`i has unique micro-climates (no heating and wide&lt;br/&gt;variability in rainfall and cloud cover).</AbstractNarration>
