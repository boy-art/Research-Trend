    <AbstractNarration>The grand challenges of geoscience require working across traditional disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;boundaries. Scientists are being called upon to find, access, and use diverse and voluminous&lt;br/&gt;data types that are described with semantics. The BCube project has put together a strong&lt;br/&gt;team of geoscientists, cyberinfrastructure experts and social scientists to address these&lt;br/&gt;interoperability challenges using a maturing Brokering Framework for discovery, access, semantics,&lt;br/&gt;web crawling, workflows and enhanced user services. The first three have been explored for&lt;br/&gt;geoscience and are mature enough to provide near term engagement of geoscientists in a test&lt;br/&gt;bed environment. Crawling, workflow and services will be developed during the project. The&lt;br/&gt;geoscientists, (including early career scientists) from the domains of hydrology, oceans, polar, &lt;br/&gt;weather, will compile community needs and assess broker capabilities in an increasing complex series of user scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;To address the cultural barriers, BCube includes social science and education in the project team. BCube engages five major&lt;br/&gt;repositories (DataOne, OOI, USGS, NCAR/RAL, NSIDC) to test and demonstrate interconnections&lt;br/&gt;with the Broker Framework, with extension to international repositories in the second year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broker discovery and access modules have two important and unique characteristics: a design&lt;br/&gt;that builds interoperability without putting a burden upon either users or providers and an&lt;br/&gt;interfaced web crawling capability to find new data, models and services. New capabilities&lt;br/&gt;also come as the Broker translates cyberinfrastructure research in areas such as semantics&lt;br/&gt;and workflow into a user-oriented capability for cross-discipline geoscience research. An&lt;br/&gt;agile development process will support rapid adaptations to changing user needs. Since not&lt;br/&gt;all needs can be anticipated, the Broker will also have APIs for scientists to write modules&lt;br/&gt;for their own applications. BCube will look at the cultural issues in cross-discipline research&lt;br/&gt;to improve acceptance and use of the broker. Both the technical and cultural broker attributes&lt;br/&gt;will be exercised through user scenarios that start with individual geoscience research issues&lt;br/&gt;and move to more complex cross-discipline research studies. This will develop reference cases&lt;br/&gt;for metrics, monitoring and validating progress as the Broker Framework evolves and matures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the grand challenges facing society, geoscientists need a sustainable and evolvable&lt;br/&gt;cyberinfrastructure supporting cross-discipline research with powerful interoperability. Success&lt;br/&gt;in addressing the project?s six diverse domains will demonstrate this and engender advancements&lt;br/&gt;in the broader geosciences. The Broker module for web 2.0 will support use of crowd sourcing&lt;br/&gt;and citizen science. BCube?s education analyses and early career scientists will consider&lt;br/&gt;the best way to reach a new generation. Expansion to international data access will be demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;through collaboration with the BCube?s international repository partners and a special interest&lt;br/&gt;group of the international Research Data Alliance.</AbstractNarration>
