    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports participation of approximately 22 US dissertation-stage doctoral students in the Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) doctoral consortium to be held at the Academy of Management meeting in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, in August 2013. The OCIS doctoral consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the Academy of Management conference since 2000, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding researchers in organizational communication and information systems. Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. Student participants will make formal presentations of their research during the workshop, and will receive feedback from a faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other OCIS research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual OCIS doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of researchers in organizational communication and information systems, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is OCIS-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees. Participants will be a diverse group with regard to their research topics, methods, backgrounds, and the kinds of institutions they attend.</AbstractNarration>
