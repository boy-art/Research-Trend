    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Nevis Laboratories of Columbia University provides ten undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in experimental high energy physics and particle astrophysics. Two of the students will spend the summer conducting research at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland. In addition to participating in research with an mentor, the REU students will gain knowledge of and practice technical communications, research collaboration and networking, and responsible conduct of research. By the end of the program, every student will have presented the results of the work in a final talk and a research paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics and from non-research institutions. The project is informed by an on-going evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
