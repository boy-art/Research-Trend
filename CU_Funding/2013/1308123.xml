    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Massachusetts Amherst is in developing an understanding of the fundamental connections between polymer chemistry and biomembrane transduction activity. This project is cofunded by the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. Learning to build simple polymeric structures with protein-like activity is a critically important goal of modern science. Comprehensive structure-activity relationships will be essential for gaining novel insights and laying a foundation for understanding the mechanistic origins of these unique molecules. Because these molecules transverse the phospholipid membranes, new insights will be gained on how molecules bind with and move across this critically important biological barrier. This project combines state-of-the-art organic and polymer chemistry with translocation and delivery across biological membranes. Educating and training students within this multi-disciplinary proposal will prepare these young scientists with a broad technical background ready to work across traditional disciplines to join the modern workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research is the engine that has driven and will continue to drive the U.S. economy. As a result, continued and growing investments in fundamental discoveries remain essential. This current proposal focuses on discoveries at the interface of organic chemistry, polymer science, and biology. Using natural systems for inspiration, a novel series of synthetic molecules will be designed that capture the essential features of these natural systems. In the long run, research like this will impact many fields of science and lead to new fundamental knowledge at the interface of materials science and biology. This project will also train graduate students and serve as advanced training for post-doctoral fellows. With experience spanning from organic chemistry to cell culture, students will be trained broadly to revolutionize the American workforce. Specific efforts will focus on continuing to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities to ensure we utilize all of our countries talent.</AbstractNarration>
