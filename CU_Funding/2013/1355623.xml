    <AbstractNarration>This research team plans to further develop a suite of products that aid in mobility for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The technology includes stand-alone sensor modules as well as controllers that can convert an existing power wheelchair into a semi-autonomous mobility platform. These "smart wheelchair" technologies are designed to achieve the following qualifications (1) modular, reconfigurable and customizable designs that satisfy practical user and provider constraints and; (2) intuitive user interfaces combined with shared human-robot control algorithms for enabling mobility for individuals with general and age-related disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project could help further the field of assistive robotics through the creation of cost-effective, modular, reconfigurable and customizable sensor, actuator and controller designs for smart wheelchairs by enabling individuals with disabilities with assistive mobility. The technologies developed through this project may enable translation of capabilities to alternative applications involving robots in smart and connected healthcare, such as rehabilitation devices for improved health as well as general human-supervised robot control systems.</AbstractNarration>
