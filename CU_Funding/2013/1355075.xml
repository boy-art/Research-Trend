    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will increase our understanding of how the brain operates by revealing fundamental principles of information processing by the cerebral cortex, which is widely held to be the site of human conscious experience. Brains cannot be understood until their fundamental processing unit, the cortical column, is understood using the type of circuit level analysis proposed. In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of the proposal will offer a unique opportunity to train young undergraduate students in both neuroscience and mathematics, disciplines that increasingly are synergistic in neuroscience. Women and minority undergraduate students will be recruited to participate in the research and materials for educators of middle and high school students will be developed that deal with the neuroscience of our senses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive functions such as thinking, perceiving and remembering, rely on the coordinated activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex. The cortical column is believed to be the functional unit of the cortex, thus understanding its circuitry and function is crucial to determine how the cortex works. The cortical column is composed of 6 interconnected layers, each with distinct function and connections. The goal of this application is to understand the role of this layered structure in cortical information processing. Primary visual cortex (V1) will serve as the model system because its anatomy and functional properties are better known than those of any other cortical area. Electrode arrays will be used to record simultaneously across all layers the responses of populations of neurons in V1 to visual stimuli that are known to drive this area of cortex. This approach will reveal how the different layers of V1 are activated in time and space by different kinds of visual stimuli. These methods will also allow an examination of the flow of visual information processing across layers of the cortex, a fundamental but heretofore understudied question. Finally, mathematical modeling will be used to understand how complex interactions between connections within a cortical column compute the neuronal responses specific to each layer.</AbstractNarration>
