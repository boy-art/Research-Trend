    <AbstractNarration>This project has implications for increasing understanding of the primary geochemical variables influencing the potential toxicity of arsenic, a carcinogen, which exists in elevated levels in gold mine wastes throughout California and elsewhere. Human exposure to fine-grained arsenic-bearing mine wastes through the inhalation pathway is a potentially significant exposure route about which little is known. Furthermore, airborne transport processes and risks posed by airborne mineral dusts are likely to grow in importance over time with increased land-use activity and climate change, which could result in larger, drier, hotter, and windier (semi-)arid regions where such mine tailings are located. Careful physical and chemical characterization of the tailings, in vitro simulated inhalation studies, and in vivo bioavailability studies could greatly improve the ability to predict the toxicity potential of arsenic in respirable airborne particles. Results will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders impacted by the mine sites and may also lead directly to the development of remediation strategies in areas where arsenic contamination is cause for environmental concern. This project will also entail the training of undergraduate students in independent and interdisciplinary research. This project has additional potential implications for understanding how to more safely mine other elements, which is of global importance given the demand for elements (e.g. rare earths and precious metals) for critical technologies such as computers and cell phones. Understanding the potential interaction of mine-produced dusts with animal models could provide a foundation of knowledge upon which to base practices for safer harvesting of earth resources. Given this dimension, this project is being partially supported by the NSF Sustainable Chemistry, Materials and Engineering initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose a systematic, integrated, multidisciplinary approach to determine the relationships between particle size and the physical and geochemical properties of airborne particulate matter generated in contaminated mining environments in the north-central Mojave Desert. It is expected that these relationships will improve the ability to predict the bioavailability of arsenic in the airborne size fraction and to provide a sound scientific basis for the development of effective remediation strategies to control metal(loid) fluxes and exposures from these mine sites. This approach utilizes a combination of macroscopic analyses of both physical and chemical properties of airborne particulate matter, synchrotron-based spectroscopic studies, simulated bioaccessibility extraction tests, and animal exposure experiments. Such knowledge is applicable and expected to be transferable to other environmentally-contaminated regions where fine-grained dusts and their associated contaminants have the potential to be mobilized and inhaled, increasing exposure to residents/visitors.</AbstractNarration>
