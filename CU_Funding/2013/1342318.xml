    <AbstractNarration>ECCS - 1342318 &lt;br/&gt;Wang, Alan X. &lt;br/&gt;Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;BRIGE: Surface-Normal Plasmonic Modulator for Three-Dimensional Board-to-Board and Chip-to-Chip Optical Interconnects &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The objective of this BRIGE proposal is to investigate a surface-normal plasmonic modulator structure with ultra-high energy efficiency and modulation bandwidth for three-dimensional optical interconnects based on sub-wavelength metallic photonic crystals. In recent years, the demand of ultrahigh-speed optical modulation above 100G bit/sec is becoming increasingly imperative as the bottleneck of electric interconnects has significantly constrained the performance of communication and computer systems. Today's research in optical interconnects focuses on planar-lightwave-circuit devices integrated with printed circuit boards and microprocessor chips, which is difficult to provide three-dimensional optical links. This BRIGE proposal explores a surface-normal plasmonic modulator with &lt;10 femto-joule/bit energy efficiency and &gt;100G bit/sec modulation speed for three-dimensional board-to-board and chip-to-chip optical interconnects. Compared with existing surface plasmon waveguide photonic devices that have high metallic absorption, the proposed surface-normal architecture efficiently reduces the total optical loss below 3-dB with stable and convenient couplings to single-mode fibers and surface-emitting laser diodes. Elucidative exploration and proof-of-concept demonstration of such innovative plasmonic modulators will lay a solid foundation for further system integration with electronic circuit and communication systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research promises to impact academia, industry, and society at large by providing an innovative surface-normal plasmonic modulator structure for out-of-plane optical interconnects. If successful, it can accelerate the frontline research of both plasmonic photonic devices and optical interconnects. This unique plasmonic device promises to transcend existing high-speed electro-optic modulation technologies for optical communication, signal processing, optical sensing and nonlinear optics. The synergy of this research and education will benefit graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students, and broaden the participation of women and under-represented minorities at Oregon State University through the programs of Summer Experience in Science and Engineering for Youth. This research also aims at promoting broad participation of under-represented students in industrial partnerships through short-term visits, summer internships, and research collaboration with local companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Voxtel. Exposure of students with a diverse background to cutting edge research will enrich their research experiences, cultivate their creativity, and train their hands-on skills, which will contribute to strengthening the quality of the U.S. workforce in the future.</AbstractNarration>
