    <AbstractNarration>This project will examine how natural species assemblages are affected by climatic change, especially in those ecosystems where temperatures are already exceptionally warm and where precipitation varies greatly. In sub-tropical stream ecosystems, such climatic change may lead to major shifts in natural ecological communities and processes. These shifts can influence distributions of important freshwater stream insects that break down organic matter and filter out the bacteria and other suspended particulates. These insect species are critically important in maintaining clear water for recreational uses and municipal water supplies. Grounded in 25 years of studies in the Luquillo Experiment Forest in Puerto Rico, the proposed research will identify the main factors that affect spatial and temporal distributions of key stream species and their effects on processing organic matter in streams at different elevations within large drainage networks. The analysis will identify specific network locations and geomorphic features where particular species are most likely to be vulnerable (e.g., shallow depth, high temperatures, low dissolved oxygen, and lack of flow). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will benefit the public, policy makers, and water managers by providing an in-depth understanding of the effects of extreme variability of water flows on stream dynamics that influence water quality and locations of vulnerability. The project will also provide interdisciplinary learning experiences for students, especially Puerto Ricans, who will participate in developing the online learning modules. These interdisciplinary learning modules will illustrate concepts of climate-driven changes on biodiversity and the economic values of key species in sustaining reliable, high-quality clean water for multiple uses.</AbstractNarration>
