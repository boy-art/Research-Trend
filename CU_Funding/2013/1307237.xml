    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to explore and lay a solid foundation for a new generation of microactuator devices. The robust microactuator device developed in the program will satisfy the imperative demands of energy efficiency and operation in harsh environments, including high temperature and pressure, radiation, corrosion, chemical and biological domains, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to develop a novel microactuator device technology which combines the advantages of photonic actuation and wide bandgap silicon carbide material. The all silicon carbide platform truly exploits the superior material properties of silicon carbide for demanding applications. The photonic actuation enables intrinsic safety, reliability, and electromagnetic interference immunity. The key technological challenge currently limiting silicon carbide microelectromechanical systems fabrication will be solved by an innovative surface micromachining process. High speed and high energy efficiency will be accomplished by a series of unique approaches. The proposed work is expected to achieve a new device technology offering harsh environment operability and long-term reliability, open a new strategic area of research on silicon carbide, and advance the state-of-the-art of a wide range of sensing and actuating systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are to expose graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project to an interdisciplinary approach for problem solving, including solid state electronics, mechanical engineering, photonic and quantum mechanical simulations, and device fabrication and characterization. It will broaden dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding through journal and conference publications, K-12 outreach, and industrial interaction and partnership.</AbstractNarration>
