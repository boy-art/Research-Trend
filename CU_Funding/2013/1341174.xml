    <AbstractNarration>Predation risk is assumed to be a critical factor influencing primate behavior; however, because predation events are rarely witnessed, the degree to which predation pressure affects primate sociality is poorly understood. Furthermore, the data that do exist on primate predator-prey interactions are focused on primates, with little co-consideration of predator behavior. The question remains: How do primates cope with the possibility of predation and do these coping mechanisms thwart hunting by predators? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study by doctoral student Dara Adams (Ohio State University), under the guidance of Dr. Dawn Kitchen, will incorporate experimental methods to investigate predator-prey dynamics between bald-faced saki monkeys (Pithecia irrorata) and their predators - including one of their main felid predators, ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) - at a field site in Amazonia Peru where both predators and prey live at high densities. The project will utilize 1) ecological and behavioral data to assess whether habitat structure, including tree height, understory and canopy coverage, affect perceived predation risk and anti-predator behaviors in these primates; 2) remote camera traps and GPS telemetry on radio-collared ocelots to determine whether sakis adjust behavior in relation to felid movement and activity; and 3) predator models (ocelot, snakes and eagles) and audio playback experiments to determine how sakis respond to alarm calls, what information may be conveyed in these calls, and whether these calls are salient to ambush-style predators and result in changes to their hunting behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incorporation of data on both primate and predator behavior will provide a more holistic picture that lends itself to comparisons across species and ecological contexts. Such an approach rarely has been applied to primate studies and will contribute much-needed empirical data to the debate regarding the degree to which predation pressures have impacted primate ecology and evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doctoral dissertation project will support academic training of a female graduate student and Peruvian undergraduates, strengthen research connections between Peruvian, Brazilian, and US universities, and promote interest among children in science and conservation through an educational program at a local school in Peru. Finally, monitoring of saki monkeys and predators, including ocelots, at the field site will support local conservation initiatives. The conservation implications are particularly important because the region is undergoing rapid development, including increased logging and mining.</AbstractNarration>
