    <AbstractNarration>Recent investments in sustainable energy resource integration with the energy infrastructure are invariably resulting in the adoption of additional solid-state converters in the power grid. These converters have short operational lifespans compared to other power grid components, but they possess attractive unrealized capabilities for the smart grid concept, including real-time diagnosis and self-healing, which is a long-term research plan of U.S. energy sectors. Thus, basic research to (i) advance reliability and availability of sustainable energy conversion systems and (ii) realize real-time diagnosis and self-healing features are timely topics. Meanwhile, as the power grid begins to adopt more solid-state converters, the nexus between power electronics and power system classes in power engineering curriculum is desired to address the power industry's urgent need for a highly educated workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this CAREER proposal are to: (i) create intelligent-reconfigurable grid-interactive solid-state converters as smart elements for the smart grid concept, (ii) advance availability and reliability of solid-state converters in wind and solar energy conversion systems, and (iii) impart required knowledge and skills of practical problems of sustainable energy systems to the next generation of U.S. power engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research includes the filling of crucial gaps in the literature regarding smart grid-interactive converters for wind and solar energy systems. This work offers the following advantages: (i) the formation of an innovate family of solid-state-based power converters with diagnostic, healing, and lifetime prognostic features, (ii) the improvement of grid-interactive converter reliability by preventing catastrophic failures and mitigating stress on vulnerable components, (iii) the reduction of overall system downtime and maintenance costs, and (iv) the facilitation of movement toward the next generation of power grid (smart grid). The broader impacts of this research include: (i) the provision of quality-integrated education, research, and engineering to adequately equip the emerging workforce and the U.S. energy industry needs, and (ii) research findings that are readily extendable to other critical technologies, such as flexible power transmission lines, electric hybrid vehicles, mechatronics, robotics, etc.</AbstractNarration>
