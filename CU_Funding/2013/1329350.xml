    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project is directed towards developing new methods for optimizing production of useful compounds by genetically engineered bacteria. In typical industrial settings, large scale production is fraught with reduced efficiency and yield of desired compounds. The problem is that an industrially useful compound may not be useful for the bacteria, and so there is selective pressure against "producer cells" and for "non-producer cells" which can then overwhelm the population. To address this problem, a strategy called Programmed Evolution has been created, which will introduce genetic variation into bacterial populations and reward cells for producing the largest amount of compound. This project aims to investigate this optimization process using a mathematical approach in order to gain a better understanding as to how the cells reach their final evolved state. Programmed Evolution will be a plug-and-play system for the optimization of any desired output so researchers and companies can produce the most compound possible for applications in energy, and bioremediation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;The Programmed Evolution project will increase diversity for STEM education since the research is conducted entirely by undergraduates. The investigators will continue their successful model of recruiting students from underrepresented groups. The project will contribute to a trained STEM workforce because the students involved will be highly valued as a result of their authentic research experiences. The Programmed Evolution process could improve efficiencies for industrial-scale commercial production of useful chemicals and pharmaceuticals, thus improving American economic competitiveness. In addition to strengthening the infrastructure for research and education on the two collaborating campuses, the project will enable the investigators to continue to serve as national leaders in undergraduate synthetic biology education and research through the Genome Consortium for Active Teaching (GCAT). The project will enhance the undergraduate education of the students, contribute to their development as scientifically literate citizens, and provide them with the background needed to pursue research careers. As the undergraduate students learn how to program the evolution of bacteria, they also learn how to program the course of their own futures as professionals, educators, and research scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>
