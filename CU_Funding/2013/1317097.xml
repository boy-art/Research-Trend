    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Kevin Yehl of Emory University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at National University of Singapore in Singapore. The project title is "Correcting Gene Errors by Using a Nanoparticle Therapy." The host scientist is Dr. Xiaogang Liu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nature's ability to selectively edit the genome by cleaving and ligating portions of messenger RNA (mRNA) is a process termed splicing and enables a single gene to encode for a diverse set of proteins. This processes increases the diversity of living systems and is responsible for why complex organisms, such as humans, can display vast collection of proteins using such a relatively small number of genes. Although this process is highly regulated, it remains error prone, and can result in specific types of diseases. This research project addresses this problem by rationally designing a synthetic spliceosome, a nano-spliceozyme, through spatially confining the appropriate catalytic units on a nanoparticle scaffold, which can edit these problematic gene products (mRNA). If successful, the project may lead to novel therapeutics to treat cancers and undruggable genetic diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. This experience will initiate future collaborations between the two labs and also establish future collaborative contacts for the Fellow. In addition, the Fellow intends to construct a blog, which will be posted at the home university's chemistry department website and will be updated bi-weekly during the summer collaboration. Moreover, the Fellow will construct a publically accessible webpage describing in general terms the research studied and pictures documenting the summer experience and Singapore culture. Prior to departure, the fellow mentored Emory undergraduates in preparing the necessary enzyme for the research project. Also, the Fellow will give a presentation to the home chemistry department describing the experience. In order to impact the local community, the Fellow will work with Emory's center for science education to incorporate their scientific discoveries into local high school and college curriculums.</AbstractNarration>
