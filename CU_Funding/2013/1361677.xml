    <AbstractNarration>This project will further develop an important subfield of mathematics called dynamical systems. This field originated at the end of nineteenth century and at the beginning of twentieth century with the work of great mathematicians such as Henri Poincare and Jacques Hadamard, to mention only two. Their research overlapped with physics, classical mechanics, and differential geometry; this current project is also multidisciplinary. It involves, in addition to dynamical systems, several other subfields of mathematics such as number theory and probability theory. In this project the PI will build on these fields and contribute to their development by laying down rigorous methods as applicable to those fields as to dynamical systems. The project is intended to involve at least eleven scholars from three continents as collaborators. Among them included are four scholars from the United States, one from Canada, five from Europe, and one from Japan. The results of the proposed research will also form a source for further research and provide material for teaching advanced graduated courses. The supported scholars will visit the PI's institution in Denton, Texas to conduct research, deliver seminar lectures, and interact with faculty and graduate students there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes, in seven separate but interrelated subprojects, to advance the theory of Diophantine approximations, transfer (Perron-Frobenius) operators, discrete groups, countable alphabet conformal iterated function systems, holomorphic dynamics, random dynamical systems, and ergodic averages. Diophantine approximations include geometrically extremal measures and badly approximable vectors in finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Transfer operators include Apollonian circle packings and dynamical systems with holes. Discrete groups include geometric rigidity for Kleinian groups and Gromov hyperbolic spaces. Conformal iterated function systems include harmonic measure, exact dimensionality, continuity of Hausdorff measure, and non--autonomous conformal iterated function systems. Holomorphic dynamics includes doubling measures and rational semigroups. Random dynamical systems include shrinking targets, dynamical rigidity in random conformal dynamical systems, random conformal iterated function systems with transversality, random rational functions, and random transcendental meromorphic functions. These subprojects will require methods from dynamical systems, ergodic theory, functional analysis, geometric measure theory, number theory, complex analysis, and probability theory. The goal of each subprojects of this proposal is to solve the major dynamical, geometric, and analytical problems related to these fields. It builds upon the methods and results the PI has obtained throughout his entire research career, focusing mainly on about 40 papers written in the past five years.</AbstractNarration>
