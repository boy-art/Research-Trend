    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused towards the development of an incident command decision support solution that is designed to enable generation of accurate situational awareness in a wildfire situation by providing advantages in safety, cost, and ability to gather real-time data. The technology, consisting of ground station software that would work in conjunction with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with onboard sensing and communication facilities, would allow UAV control, data processing, and visualization. Real-time fire monitoring and prediction using UAVs requires engineering knowledge across multiple disciplines. This technology combines real-time image processing with telemetry to develop estimation and prediction models based on weather and vegetation information of the area. This technology will be one of the first to integrate the various elements of fire prediction and monitoring into one comprehensive technological tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating real-time UAV sensory data into effective fire-predictor software will allow an incident commander to make timely and informed decisions which can optimize the resource allocation process and save lives. Wildland fires across the globe pose a serious environmental and socio-economic threat with far-reaching consequences. In addition to loss of lives and long-term repercussions on human health, wildland fires have severe effects on ecological biodiversity and adverse economic impacts on the affected areas with timber and infrastructure losses, lost wages, and rehabilitation costs, in addition to firefighting costs. Data collection and its interpretation for generation of situational awareness, known as Emergency Informatics, is a major challenge in responding to any large-scale hazard or disaster. This research, leveraging the use of UAVs for wildfire monitoring, can yield tools at the disposal of incident managers that will provide improved situational awareness and help them make decisions in complex situations resulting in societal benefits such as cost savings, safety of lives and properties, and benefits to the environment.</AbstractNarration>
