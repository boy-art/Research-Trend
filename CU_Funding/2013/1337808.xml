    <AbstractNarration>1337808&lt;br/&gt;Morton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central aim of this proposal is the acquisition of analytical equipment that will allow for the rapid establishment of a Sustainable Engineering Research Laboratory located in the Department of Engineering at James Madison University (JMU). The specific instrument requested, an advanced high performance liquid chromatography system, has been selected based on the potential for greatest and most immediate impact on existing as well as pending research. JMU is a primarily undergraduate institution with an institutional goal of fostering outstanding undergraduate research. This proposal will significantly advance this set of goals while providing the initial investment in the longer goal of developing a research laboratory to develop undergraduate researchers focused on solving the pair challenges of energy availability and water quality, which is at the root of the challenge to the global societal sustainability. While initially, faculty and undergraduate students based out of the Department of Engineering will most benefit and utilize the instrument requested in this proposal, faculty and students from other disciplines, such as Chemistry, Biochemistry, Integrated Science and Technology, and Geology and Environmental Science, will also utilize this instrument.</AbstractNarration>
