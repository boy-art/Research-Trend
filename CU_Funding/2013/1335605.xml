    <AbstractNarration>RAPID: Salvaging dinosaur embryos, eggs, and associated geological data from Tustea, Romania, for future phylogenetic and paleobiological studies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gerald Grellet-Tinner, Journey Museum, Rapid City, South Dakota&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1335605&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;PI requests funds to travel to Cluj, Romania to salvage fossil dinosaur eggs and embryos and associated geological data from the world-renown Tustea dinosaur-nesting site. The extremely small Tustea fossil site is presently 90% destroyed by unwarranted bulldozing. The destruction of the relatively thin fossil-bearing layer represents a major loss for paleontology and science and threatens hope for future, long-term studies of the identity of the embryos, their phylogenetic placement, in depth paleobiological investigations of the nesting sites, and the association of dinosaur embryos with the associated eggs. Dr. Codrea from the University of Cluj discovered and recovered fossil dinosaur eggs and embryos. He asked Dr. Grellet-Tinner to travel to Cluj to assist in the salvaging operation and study of the resultant specimens. The PI's home institution, the Journey Museum in Rapid city, South Dakota, serves a large community of Native Americans, the regional school system, and the national and international adult population. A portion of the museum's geology/paleontology exhibit features the PI's previous research. It will be updated and expanded to incorporate the outcome of the new research in the form of displays and molds of the embryos and eggs.</AbstractNarration>
