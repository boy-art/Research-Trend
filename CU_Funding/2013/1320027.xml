    <AbstractNarration>The energy efficiency of high-end computers has reached a plateau for some time now, yielding devices that are constrained by power and thermal limits and do not realize the full performance potential of advanced semiconductors. This research project will explore computing architectures that rely on energy recycling to operate with significantly improved energy efficiency and are thus capable of achieving sustained clock speeds well in excess of 10GHz without any special cooling requirements. The resulting technologies will be assessed through the design and evaluation of silicon prototype chips. The outcomes of this research project can be transformative, demonstrating integrated computing systems that achieve unprecedented performance levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the realization of next-generation high-performance computers, promoting discovery, teaching, and learning in novel design technologies that yield energy-efficient electronics. Broader outcomes of the proposed effort include the integration of research activities into graduate-level courses, the development of lectures and projects for advanced undergraduate-level courses, the direct involvement of electrical engineering and computer science majors through senior-level design projects, and the engagement of high school students.</AbstractNarration>
