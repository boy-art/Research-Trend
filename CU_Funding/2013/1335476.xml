    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award is to solicit fundamental knowledge and understanding in fabricating piezoelectric devices with controlled shape and functional characteristics in order to develop an innovative and cost-effective additive manufacturing process for the nation's biomedical imaging industry. In the planned research, both the green-part fabrication for desired accuracy and resolution and the heat treatment procedure for required piezoelectric properties will be studied. The process modeling and related controlling methods will be established for the piezo-composite based additive manufacturing process. The effects of the addition of Sol-Gel solutions and related heat treatment procedures will be evaluated to understand their relations to piezoelectric properties. The property measurement and experimental validation will be performed with industrial partners to verify the capability of the additive manufacturing process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel piezoelectric devices used in electronics, photonics, sensors and actuators require more complex shapes and better precision for improved performance. Research results of this GOALI award will provide knowledge and understanding to meet the critical need of improved accuracy and resolution control as well as the densification control in the piezo-composite based additive manufacturing process for piezoelectric device fabrication. A globally competitive biomedical imaging industry will contribute to the nation's economy and healthcare, and new piezoelectric devices with better quality and lower manufacturing cost will benefit consumers and the society. The project will also enhance the infrastructure for ultrasonic imaging research and education at the University of Southern California by providing a digital fabrication method with increased shape flexibility. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students and mid-career professionals will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. Outreach programs to high school students will be utilized to increase minority participation. The designed hands-on learning experience and exposure to advanced manufacturing applications will increase the interest of domestic students in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
