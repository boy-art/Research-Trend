    <AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Endeavor, a 185' general purpose research vessel operated by the University of Rhode Island as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Endeavor is a well-equipped, intermediate sized research vessel that is owned by NSF and operated under a Charter Party Agreement by the University of Rhode Island. The vessel was built in 1976 and refit in 1993. She can carry up to 17 scientists on cruises up to 30 days in duration. The vessel supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography. In 2012, R/V Endurance completed 215 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 123 days or 57% of the total sailing schedule. In 2013, R/V Endeavor is scheduled for 205 days with NSF days accounting for 54% (111 days) of the total sailing schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic instrumentation requested in this proposal includes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MC-800 Multicorer $37,515&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade of CTD Connectors and Cables $35,212&lt;br/&gt; $72,727&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
