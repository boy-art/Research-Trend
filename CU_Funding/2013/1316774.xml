    <AbstractNarration>Twice annually, regional meetings on mathematical string theory are held in central North Carolina at Duke University. These meetings inexpensively fill a critical need, by regularly bringing together isolated research groups to collaborate and hear research talks, and also by training students and postdocs both by exposing them to a wide array of ideas as well as giving them a forum in which to themselves give talks, thereby substantially aiding both training and research efforts. The location of these meetings allows for substantial impact, as Duke is one of three major universities within a forty-minute drive of one another, all of which have researchers working in related areas, and is centrally located with regards to a number of other universities and related researchers within driving distance. Duke's existing facilities will be used to record lectures and post them on the web, allowing for even greater impact. Efforts are being made to involve more underrepresented minorities and genders, both as participants and as speakers. Partial funding for these meetings in the form of participant support is awarded for the next three years. In addition, funds may be used to provide travel support for speakers traveling from outside the region. The support will enhance the quality of these meetings and their contribution to regional collaborations. It will especially contribute to the training of students and postdocs in the region who will be more readily able to attend. The availability of travel support for outside speakers will make it possible to attract outside visitors, including members of under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
