    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Josh Egan of The University of Minnesota Conservation Biology Program to conduct a research project in Biological sciences during the summer of 2013 at National Chiayi University in Chiayi, Taiwan. The project title is "The Evolution of Generalist Feeding Strategies in Marine Fishes." The host scientist is Dr. Chien-Hsien Kuo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evolution of specialized trophic niches has been extensively researched. This research has shown that trophic niche specialization is stimulated by complex, stable, and productive habitats and promotes speciation and the evolution of phenotypic diversity. In contrast, generalist trophic niches, although recognized as common, have been the focus of few evolutionary studies. This represents a significant gap in our understanding of the generation and distribution of biodiversity. To address this gap, this research uses phylogenetic comparative methods to test two fundamental hypotheses regarding the evolution of generalist trophic niches: (1) the evolution of generalist trophic niches is associated with transitions to habitats with temporally variable food webs and (2) the evolution of generalist trophic niches is associated with morphological and behavioral adaptation. The project uses the clupeiform fishes as a study system to address these questions because this order is diverse, widely distributed, and contains trophic generalists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this research will advance our understanding of evolutionary processes and species richness patterns, knowledge that is increasingly used to inform biodiversity conservation and management efforts.</AbstractNarration>
