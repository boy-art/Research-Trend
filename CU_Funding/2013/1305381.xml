    <AbstractNarration>Model-Driven Development (MDD) is an approach to software development that is gaining traction world-wide. The Repository for Model-Driven Development (ReMoDD) is a resource that has been developed to facilitate and accelerate research and education in MDD through the sharing of high quality modeling experiences. ReMoDD provides facilities for curating, querying, and operating on models. The first version was developed under a prior NSF grant and currently supports a broad and growing community of Software Engineering researchers, practitioners, educators, and students. New requirements emerging from the community of developers and users are the basis for this new grant. The project will significantly improve ReMoDD as follows: (1) To help attract more artifacts from industry, we will provide facilities that can be used to sanitize models so that valuable proprietary information is obfuscated; (2) to help attract artifacts that demonstrate the application of MDD methods on industrial software development problems, we will provide facilities for industry/academia collaborations on industry-relevant challenge problems; (3) to extend the scope of relevant artifacts that can be accessed via ReMoDD, we will work with developers of related repositories (e.g., the European Open Models Initiative) so that searches in ReMoDD will yield artifacts stored in collaborating repositories; and (4) we will extend ReMoDD with social networking features that support, for example, crowd sourcing challenging modeling problems. The enhancement of ReMoDD will be a collaborative effort involving teams from Colorado State University (CSU) and Michigan State University (MSU). ReMoDD has an Advisory Board of leading MDD researchers and industry representatives that are committed to ensuring that ReMoDD continues to be a useful and sustainable community resource. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing ReMoDD as MDD community infrastructure, groups performing MDD research will advance the overarching objective of Model Driven software Development (MDD), which is to reduce the cost and effort of developing complex software systems through the use of software models. The problems tackled by MDD researchers are challenging and good solutions typically evolve through a community process driven by feedback from the use of solutions in research and industrial settings. The project will strengthen engagement with the international research community, who will contribute new ideas, share tools, and share in the project effort. To support the international collaboration, this award is being co-funded by NSF?s Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>
