    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Grain growth is one of the most important unsolved riddles in metals science. It is understood in broad terms how and why it occurs, but the details necessary to quantitatively predict it remain elusive. This project takes a unique direction of attacking this unresolved, fundamental question by investigating the topological mechanisms of grain growth in metals to determine the influence of grain-size distribution on them. Investigations will use three-dimensional Monte Carlo computer simulations to explore varied virtual grain size distributions and interesting grain topologies. Simulations will provide information where experiments cannot. Experiments will be conducted to examine grain topologies and size distributions following growth. Serial sectioning will be used to accumulate three-dimensional data sets. This study will provide first-time results of the topological and distributional nature of grain growth. Education and training will be enabled for graduate and undergraduate students, who will engage in outreach activities at local schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Grain growth strongly affects the mechanical properties of materials and is prevalent in industrial processing, yet many details of its occurrence are not understood. This project addresses the need to better understand these aspects. The fundamental mechanisms that produce grain growth will be explored through a combination and computational simulations and laboratory experiments. Both approaches will produce three-dimensional sets of information that will be compared and used for scientific inquiry. An improved scientific understanding for the mechanisms that govern grain growth in metals is expected from these studies. Improved scientific understanding will impact future capabilities to predict and control grain growth in metals and alloys important to a wide range of technological applications, from bridges to automobiles to electronics. Education and training will be enabled for graduate and undergraduate students, who will engage in outreach activities at local schools.</AbstractNarration>
