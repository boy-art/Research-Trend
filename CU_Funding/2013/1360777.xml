    <AbstractNarration>Building on the success of the 2012 Conference, Algebraic Statistics in the Alleghenies at Pennsylvania State University, a four day conference on Algebraic Statistics at the Illinois Institute of Technology, May 19-22, 2014 will provide a focus for the further development and maturation of this exciting area of research as well as its interconnections. The unifying theme for the proposed workshop is provided by the common mathematical tool set as well as the increasingly close interaction between algebra and statistics. The program will allow researchers working in statistics to interact with those working in algebra, algebraic geometry, and discrete mathematics, and make fundamental advances in the development and application of algebraic methods to statistics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic statistics advocates polynomial algebra as a tool for addressing problems in statistics and its applications, and it motivates further developments in theoretical and computational algebraic geometry. The program will foster international collaborations between U.S.-based participants and their international counterparts. This funding will allow junior researchers to attend the meeting and present their work, and interact with the broader community of researchers in algebraic statistics.</AbstractNarration>
