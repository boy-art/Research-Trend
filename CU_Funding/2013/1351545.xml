    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 1351545&lt;br/&gt;PI: Desjardins, Olivier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed CAREER project is focused on the computational investigation of the fluid physics at the interface between two fluids moving in the turbulent flow regime. This research and education project aims at improving the state of theoretical understanding of turbulent atomizing liquid-gas flows using recently advanced numerical methods in conjunction with high performance computing resources. The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive mechanistic and statistical theory of turbulence for interface interactions in liquid-gas flows. The proposed theory could have far-reaching impacts in the way such flows are approached by scientists and engineers, including new predictive models to enable simulations of engineering devices and natural processes that were impossible to do before. &lt;br/&gt;The main outcomes of this effort are expected to be a significant leap forward in first-principle modeling of turbulent liquid-gas flows, a new massive open online course (MOOC) on multiphase flows to maximize the educational impact to engineering students, and an iPad multiphase flow simulator to inspire students and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While a significant body of work deals with fundamental stability of liquid-gas interfaces, a comprehensive mechanistic and statistical theory of turbulent atomizing liquid-gas flows remains to be proposed, its development hindered by lack of experimental data and, at least until recently, inadequate numerical methods. The proposed work is centered upon unique, high fidelity numerical simulations of the interactions between turbulent eddies and active interfaces. The proposed work will not only lead to a new theory, but also to new large eddy simulation (LES) models that will be based on the concept of optimal estimators and on the transport equation for sub-grid scale kinetic energy. Such models can change the way engineers make predictions for such flows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex turbulent atomizing liquid-gas flows are ubiquitous in both nature and industrial applications, with relevance in climate modeling and oceanic transport, fire suppression, technical devices such as pumps, combustors, and pipelines, and applications such as fuel injection, nuclear cooling, hydropower, and concentrated solar power among many others. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which turbulence interfaces behave can lead to the design of safer and more efficient processes in these systems. The PI plans to make code developed in this project available to the scientific community, enabling research elsewhere. The educational activities of the proposed project will improve education and scientific literacy at different levels. A philosophy of ?accessibility of research? will be used to form and mentor two undergraduate students per year, chosen from under-represented minorities. The proposed multiphase turbulence theory will be integrated into a new graduate course on multiphase flow dynamics. To impact a larger number of engineering students, this course will be offered as a MOOC. Finally, an iPad app will be developed that exploits rapid and robust schemes for real-time computation and rendering of two-dimensional multiphase flows, providing a physics-based entertaining and educational application to inspire and educate middle school students about fluid dynamics science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
