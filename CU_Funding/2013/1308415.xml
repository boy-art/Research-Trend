    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Kathleen Foote of North Carolina State University to conduct a research project in the Education and Human Resources area during the summer of 2013 at National University of Singapore in Singapore. The project title is "Characterizing the Evolution of University Physics Reform in Different Cultural Settings." The host scientist is Dr. M. V. Venkatashamy Reddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCALE-UP, "Student Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-Down Pedagogies," is a reformed pedagogy and classroom design originally developed for large enrollment university physics courses at North Carolina State University. Now, almost two hundred institutions worldwide use this approach to teach over thirteen disciplines in various types of institutions. This project examines the transfer and evolution over how three generations of transfer have caused the reform to evolve over cultural and geographic boundaries. Results of this study promote the successful spread of this reform in diverse settings. Since this collaborative, interactive and technology-rich approach to learning physics has been shown to reduce failure rates, improve performance and increase interest in STEM fields, studying and aiding the implementation process spreads these benefits to more students worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the SCALE-UP reform has been shown to improve student problem solving, conceptual understanding, student attitudes and retention rates in introductory courses, especially for females and racial minorities. This project documents the transfer process, using the challenges and successes of the case study sites to improve professional development of instructors and simplify future implementation efforts. Sample course materials and classroom videos will be added to the website of existing resources for implementers and instructors.</AbstractNarration>
