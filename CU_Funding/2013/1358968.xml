    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Coe College provides eight undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in optics, glass science, acoustics, molecular biology, modeling, biomaterials, all under the common focus of spectroscopy. In addition to participating in research with an experienced and dedicated mentor, the REU students will engage in activities such as seminars and lectures and give two oral presentations, one at mid-term and then a final twenty minute talk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site, where each summer two high school teachers from nearby school districts participate in a research project. During the academic year, the teachers are invited to bring their students to Coe College to learn about the work they carried out. The teachers will use their experience to motivate their students to better understand the physical world and prepare them to become the future generation of scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from institutions offering little or no research opportunities and first generation students. The site has an excellent evaluation plan which is designed to give feedback and to improve the project on an on-going basis. Additionally, training students and teachers in spectroscopy has relevance to national security.</AbstractNarration>
