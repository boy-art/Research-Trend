    <AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses NSF?s call for universities to nurture students and/or faculty who are engaged in projects having the potential to be transitioned into the marketplace. I-Corps Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is creating a new I-Corps Site that will build upon their existing expertise, while filling a gap that is critical in the commercialization and translation of university-based research. This I-Corps Site will enable Illinois to broaden its innovation services, update current entrepreneurial programming and reach additional prospective and under-represented participants to create a robust and diversified pipeline of entrepreneurial teams to enroll in the NSF I-Corps program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of these activities include a wider network of students and faculty involved with technology development and commercialization efforts. Students will be exposed to technology entrepreneurship efforts as Entrepreneurial Leads, contributors, and by attending targeted entrepreneurship curriculum. Faculty entrepreneurship will be enhanced through team formation, business guidance, and financial support. Under-represented groups will be especially encouraged to participate in I-Corps Site and technology commercialization activities.</AbstractNarration>
