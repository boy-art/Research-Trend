    <AbstractNarration>1346952 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Banerjee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide travel support for US Scientists to attend workshops, organized under auspices of ISHMT (Indian Society for Heat and Mass Transfer) and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers), at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) from Dec. 28-31. The workshops are centered on five topical areas related to thermal fluids science and engineering and multiphase flow phenomena and are designed to nurture discussions on the major challenges in this area with the intent of initiating new collaborative teams and sustaining past Indo-US research collaborations. The US participants have varied levels of experience - ranging from graduate students to early career academicians to senior faculty members and reputed industrial practitioners (including women and minorities). Engaging researchers early in their career will facilitate long term collaborations enabling a globally-engaged workforce. Topics covered in the workshops encompass both fundamental and applied aspects of emerging technologies that are impacted by heat and mass transfer. In addition to enriching the cross-cultural and educational experiences of the participants, the workshops will also augment Indo-US cooperation through information sharing, germinating institutional links, and sparking new research topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A website will be developed by the PI at Texas A&amp;M University for wider dissemination of the report on the workshop outcome that will be submitted to NSF. The report will also include discussions on the experience of the US delegates. The report will be highlighted in panel discussions and presentations at the International Heat Transfer Conference (IHTC 2014) in Japan for publicizing the collaborative research activities internationally among the broader scientific community for enhancing participation in the future. The recent spurt in the R&amp;D investments in India and other Asian countries can be leveraged effectively by joint Indo-US collaborative ventures. This will help the researchers based in the US to maintain their research effectiveness and impact by leveraging collaborations with prominent research programs in India and researchers from other Asian countries. Women and minority participants at the workshops will add to the diversity.</AbstractNarration>
