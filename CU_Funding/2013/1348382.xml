    <AbstractNarration>The project, "Framing the Chemistry Curriculum," led by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, plans to develop a sustainable two-semester chemistry course sequence at Nebraska Indian Community College (NICC, a tribal college). The course is being designed to be relevant to American Indians by including culturally rich examples and real-life applications. Possible topics include water and wastewater treatment, Missouri River water quality, organic farming, alternative energy, ethnobotany, honey bee colony collapse disorder, and Type 2 diabetes. These topics are being developed into case studies, the findings of which will be disseminated at faculty workshops and enrollment campaigns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;American Indian students are underrepresented in all STEM fields. This proposal addresses an opportunity and a need to create an introductory chemistry course sequence at NICC, to be disseminated to other tribal colleges, including nearby Little Priest Tribal College (LPTC). Science education studies have shown that science courses are made relevant to American Indian students through the inclusion of culturally rich examples. To do this for chemistry, the project team is developing case studies based on community topics, each of which is linked to specific laboratory methods or measurements. The laboratory experiences are modular for use in a variety of courses. This project advances and improves current STEM education practices at tribal colleges by developing a sustainable process that involves community engagement. Students learn how to connect topics of interest to the community to curricular materials by way of a partnership that involves community leaders, college faculty, college students, and community outreach. This facilitates student learning and deepens existing Native American student knowledge and engagement in STEM fields. The resulting materials and practices are applicable to all educators seeking to increase participation of underrepresented STEM groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project promotes STEM learning by Native American students, as well as learning about chemistry instruction by studying these students? attitudes toward continued enrollment in chemistry courses. The process for making deep connections between community-relevant topics and laboratory exercises shows how to connect the mission of community colleges to the sciences in a way that attracts and retains individuals from other underrepresented groups to STEM education - leading to more students pursuing higher education in STEM fields and a more diverse and stronger STEM workforce. The results of the methodology and assessment lead to measurable outcomes that are used to inform others through local outreach, publications in tribal college and science education literature, and presentations</AbstractNarration>
