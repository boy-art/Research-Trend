    <AbstractNarration>This project will develop the key technologies needed for interactive wireless applications operating in shared spectrum. Sharing is the new spectrum paradigm, and interactive applications are the most demanding in terms of the quality-of-service they require. Thus, they are the perfect vehicle to push the frontiers of our understanding of sharing. This project will explore new high-reliability coding techniques to protect interactive applications while meeting tight latency constraints and explore how to coexist with neighboring disparate systems through explicit and implicit signaling. The project will contribute the fundamental understanding required to define the correct regulatory structure for spectrum sharing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, the interactive applications that this project will study are the key to the next growth phase in commercial wireless - as machines need to interact with each other to improve the performance of real-world systems. Because industrial control is a critical use case, this project can help invigorate the agile manufacturing sector of the economy. Efficiently shared spectrum is much more economical than exclusive-use spectrum and hence could help innovative high-skill manufacturing where the United States has an advantage over low-wage countries. While developing this technology, the project will train students in a way that encourages cross-fertilization of ideas between wireless communication, circuit implementation, control theory, and coding theory. These ideas will be brought into the classroom, including our new M.Eng. courses aimed at educating innovative technical leaders. The project will also broaden participation in the technical workforce by mentoring students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
