    <AbstractNarration>This award to Washington State University by the Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), is jointly funded by the Chemical Measurements and Imaging program, in the Division of Chemistry (Math and Physical Sciences Directorate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical description&lt;br/&gt;Mass analysis of biological molecules was enabled in the late 1980s with the advent of new ionization techniques that extended the mass range from 1,000 units to 20,000 units. Unfortunately this technology is limited because the size of proteins, complexes, RNA, DNA and viruses greatly exceed 20,000 units, so they are not easily analyzed. The proposed development of a new digital ion trap mass spectrometer will extend the mass range out to 10,000,000,000 units and beyond, allowing direct and quantitative measurement of massive biological molecules and complexes, and to observe interaction of these massive species with others small or large. The effect of this technology will be felt across a wide range of disciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, biology, physics, medical, veterinary and plant science. It will provide opportunities for students to collaborate and broaden their scientific knowledge beyond their specific disciplines. The results of this work will be disseminated through publications, collaborations, teaching and outreach that include undergraduates and high school students. Publications and collaborations will create a demand for this instrumentation, which the instrument manufacturers will eventually fill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;The three-year project will develop a digital ion trap (DIT) technology to extend the working range of ion trap mass spectrometers by five orders of magnitude. In the first phase of the project, a prototype that will enable direct analysis of intact singly-charged proteins and protein complexes and their interactions with small molecules will be developed. The second phase of this project will install a mass independent Faraday detector, and methods will be developed to analyze intact singly-charged proteins, complexes, RNA and DNA and their weak non-covalent interactions.</AbstractNarration>
