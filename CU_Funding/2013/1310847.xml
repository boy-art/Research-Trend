    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Lauren Wheeler of the University of Maine to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at GNS Science in Lower Hutt, Wellington, New Zealand. The project title is "Modeling the Effects of Glaciation from the Last Glacial Maximum to Present on Mountain Building in the Central South Island of New Zealand." The host scientist is Dr. Phaedra Upton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is examining the effects of glacial mass loading and unloading on the tectonics of New Zealand's central South Island using three-dimensional numerical modeling. The South Island is a highly-studied region, and the tectonics and glacial-interglacial periods are well constrained by both field observations and numerical models. These models give us the opportunity to develop a sense of how glaciation affects mountain building (topography and changes in strain) from the Last Glacial Maximum to present. Work of this kind is ongoing for southeast Alaska. The size of the glacial load on the South Island is comparable to those in Alaska. New Zealand and southeast Alaska are both tectonically active regions and comparing the two will develop a sense of how glaciation affects mountain building in multiple mountain ranges. Due to the spatial variation in both New Zealand and southeast Alaska, it is not sufficient to model these systems using a single two-dimensional cross section (as is often done) through the mountain range to represent the mechanics. This is especially inaccurate in a region where the mechanics are influenced by glaciation as glaciers vary in their spatial extent and thickness. Modeling the influence of glaciation on tectonics in three-dimensions is not only a new addition to the scientific literature and community but more accurately represents the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the University of Maine School of Earth and Climate Sciences is involved in synergistic activities with the local communities. This experience provides the opportunity to conduct an outreach program with local middle and high schools. The School of Earth and Climate Sciences often incorporates research projects into undergraduate course modules. The results and the research that stems from this project may be used as course modules in the Geophysics and Global Tectonics courses taught at the University of Maine.</AbstractNarration>
