    <AbstractNarration>Scientists who work in the field have a common set of issues when it comes to documenting,storing, and representing data. Members from the different geological communities would benefitgreatly from the opportunity to discuss the types of data that they collect in the field with a group of cyberinfrastructure and software development professionals and researchers. By holding meetings in the field, the computer scientists will gain a better appreciation for the types of data that are typically collected in the field, common methods for collecting those data, the field tools/technology that are employed, data recording conventions, and the types of question typically addressed with these data. "The field" is an ideal location for appreciating geological concepts, and the very act of being in the field, together with other professionals, often foster personal connections that promote successful collaborations&lt;br/&gt;and the exchange of ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work on this RCN will facilitate digitization of geological field data. The researchers will take steps to: 1) Document what exists currently for field data collection; 2) Assemble a community for discussing and exploring field data collection issues, specifically targeting young investigators; 3) Motivate distinct communities to work together on common issues associated with digitization; 4) Evaluate what is missing in the creation of open and accessible data. The objective of the RCN Proposal is to develop communication between cyberinfrastructure community and those involved in field-based, solid earth geoscience. In order to facilitate knowledge of the activities, they will conduct a series of both informal and formal meetings as national meetings - workshops at GSA and townhall meetings at AGU and AAPG). The goal of the initial meetings will be to: 1) foster community awareness of EarthCube-related activities, 2) discover and catalog the additional existing resources, 3) determine ways of giving publication ?credit? for recording and sharing digital data, 4) identify attributes of a clearinghouse website that would be most useful, and 5) find ways of motivating the community to move quickly toward digital data collection/conversion and data sharing.</AbstractNarration>
