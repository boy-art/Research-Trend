    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program supports Professor Martin Kirk of the University of New Mexico for a project entitled "Donor-Acceptor Interactions, Long-Range Electron Correlation, and Dynamic Spin Manipulation: Relationship To Molecular Electronics." The project focuses on electronic structure contributions to the ground state properties of magnetic donor-bridge-acceptor biradicals. The primary goals of the research are to understand excited state contributions to bridge mediated electronic coupling, understand how open-shell excited state singlet configurations promote long-range electron correlation, and develop new platforms for spin control of excited state dynamics in photoexcited donor-acceptor molecules. The research project is achieving these goals by adding to the electron/spin transport knowledge base and providing new insight into electronic structure contributions to molecular electronic materials, particularly as they relate to switchable electron transfer/transport conduits, spin-polarized electron transport, and the control of quantum interference effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research activities broadly impact our understanding of how molecular and molecule-based systems can advance new technologies based on molecular electronics. The project advances discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning through incorporation of research advancements in the classroom, student research presentations at international meetings, and mentoring undergraduate and high school students who are involved in the research. Broader participation is emphasized through New Mexico's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (NM EPSCoR) projects, The University of New Mexico (UNM) Nanoscience and Microsystems program, mentoring students from underrepresented groups, and mentoring early career faculty members at UNM. Infrastructure for research and education is being enhanced through an association with the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, sharing spectroscopy facilities with collaborating scientists and UNM junior faculty, and contributing to improved computing infrastructure at UNM. New research results are constantly being injected into the classroom environment, which contributes to the broad dissemination of research results. Finally, potential benefits to society derive from the ability to transform the results of the basic research to an increased understanding of electron and spin transport, long-range interactions, and excited state dynamics in molecular electronic systems at the nanoscale.</AbstractNarration>
