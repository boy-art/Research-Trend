    <AbstractNarration>The mechanisms of how organisms maintain metabolic homeostasis in light of significant environmental variation in food availability are not completely understood. Of particular interest of the field are the underlying mechanisms that form homeostatic responses to starvation. This research project will take advantage of the tractability of the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster and powerful molecular and imaging tools to address fundamental questions regarding metabolic decisions. One principal outcome of this proposal is to enhance understanding of the conservation of these metabolic networks. Preliminary results suggest that these networks are very likely to be highly conserved, and may therefore be leveraged for many practical applications, ranging from therapeutics to pest management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary data from the PI supports the hypothesis that the energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates the secretion of Adipokinetic Hormone (AKH), which functions to mobilize energy stores and is required for behavioral and physiological responses to nutrient limitations. This project will investigate: i) Functional mechanisms of hormonal signaling on AKH cell physiology; ii) Connections between hormonal signaling systems and AMPK; and iii) Regulatory mechanisms of AKH cell excitability. The planned experiments in this proposal will contribute new information into the cellular signals within a defined cell population, which is required for generating specific behavioral and physiological changes to maintain energy homeostasis. This research project will also be used as a vehicle to extend undergraduate research opportunities to students, and also to faculty at regional institutions. These opportunities will provide research opportunities to underrepresented populations at both the faculty and student level. This seamless integration of research and education will have broad impacts, in providing the benefits of undergraduate research opportunities to a diversity of students.</AbstractNarration>
