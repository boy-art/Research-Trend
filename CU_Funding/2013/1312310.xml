    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a non-invasive monitoring of nutrition (NIMON) sensory necklace with an embedded microphone, wireless module and data processing unit to fill the need of automatically detecting swallows and eating patterns. The translated NIMON technology has the following unique features: low-cost, low-power, wearable, automated filtering of noise from audio signals, detection of swallows and daily eating patterns that provides exemplary performance, cost savings, efficiency and efficacy when compared to the leading competing nutrition monitoring programs or nutrition monitoring software such as DietMaster or Nutrinote, or even the activity monitoring devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project accomplishes this goal by deploying unique signal processing algorithms providing noise-filtering of audio signals, segmentation, feature extraction and classification algorithms resulting in a proposed necklace. The partnership engages WearSense Inc. to provide guidance in the health and nutrition market and commercialization and further financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the NIMON necklace technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be $250 million in the next 5 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the health and nutrition market. The societal impact, long term, will be enhanced nutrition and health, the potential to diagnose swallow and diet-related disorders while providing a foil against which several technologies can grow.</AbstractNarration>
