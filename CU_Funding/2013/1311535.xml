    <AbstractNarration>The evolution of virulence is of critical importance to predicting the outcomes of a disease introduction into a new host population. Past hypotheses have postulated that the direction of evolution in virulence should be away from antagonistic relationships, but observations on human disease, particularly those borne by vectors such as mosquitoes, have challenged this view. This project seeks to examine the trade-off hypothesis, an important concept in disease ecology, which suggests that the virulence of a disease is restricted by an evolutionary link with transmission rate. This project will test this hypothesis by estimating the virulence and transmission rate of parasites of several medically important mosquitoes through modern molecular biology techniques along with traditional ecology modeling methods that will allow an assessment of the success of both host and parasite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has broad implications beyond exploring the trade-off hypothesis. By understanding how virulence has evolved across the lineage of a parasite, valuable insight into mechanisms related to disease virulence can be gained. Further, as mosquitoes are vectors for many human diseases, an increased understanding of the role of parasites of those mosquitoes might assist in future control efforts of host mosquitoes. Finally, this work will also present a chance to mentor and train undergraduate students in ecological modeling and quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques.</AbstractNarration>
