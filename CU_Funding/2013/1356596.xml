    <AbstractNarration>The University of Hawaii at Hilo seeks to establish a scholarship program for 19 economically disadvantaged students who intend to major in astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, geology, marine science, mathematics, or physics. The goal of the proposal is to recruit local Hawaii students as well as students from the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands (Samoa and Micronesia) and retain them in these targeted STEM fields through graduation. The following support services are planned for the participants: (a) a summer Bridge Program prior to the freshman year, (b) faculty mentoring, (c) peer-tutoring for introductory STEM courses, (d) summer and academic year research support on campus, (e) opportunities for research internships, (f) advising and support to participate in summer research programs at US mainland universities, and (g) community service in which students provide math and science tutoring for K-12 students. Some of the program activities operate in conjunction with, but expand upon, current university programs, such as the Keaholoa STEM Scholars Program (supported under the NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities Program), while other activities are new initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data generated through assessment and evaluation supports the rationale that institutionalizing initiatives that provide students with a supportive community motivate them to become self-identified scientists who are retained through graduation. Formative and summative evaluation focuses on determining which support strategies are most effective and which can be improved in relation to four areas (a) recruitment and retention, (b) student support activities, (c) research opportunities and internships, and (d) STEM careers/graduate education. Data collection methodologies include mixed methods, including faculty and student participant surveys, interviews and observations. Dissemination occurs through annual professional society meetings and peer-reviewed education journals such as the Journal of College Science Teaching. Project deliverables include results of summative evaluation and the activities developed within the project.</AbstractNarration>
