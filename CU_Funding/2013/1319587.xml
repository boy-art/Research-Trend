    <AbstractNarration>As the computing industry steps into the many-core regime, the main memory system has&lt;br/&gt;become one of the key bottlenecks that limits both performance and scalability. To address these&lt;br/&gt;challenges, the memory industry is developing 3D-stacked DRAM technology. Die stacking can&lt;br/&gt;provide lower latency, much higher bandwidth, and significantly reduced energy dissipation.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, stacked memory is unlikely to have sufficient capacity to completely replace&lt;br/&gt;traditional DRAM. Therefore, future memory systems will likely use stacked memory in&lt;br/&gt;combination with off-chip DRAM, either architecting stacked DRAM as a giga-scale cache or as&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous main memory. However, to fully utilize the potential of stacked memory, the&lt;br/&gt;system architecture must make choices that exploit the unique latency and bandwidth&lt;br/&gt;characteristics offered by stacked DRAM. For example, simply applying traditional "well-understood"&lt;br/&gt;cache designs and memory designs to stacked DRAM results in low performance&lt;br/&gt;and poor bandwidth utilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project first looks at caching organizations and management strategies for stacked DRAM&lt;br/&gt;that are tailored to exploit latency and bandwidth properties of 3D stacking. It then looks at&lt;br/&gt;memory organizations that can incorporate stacked memory as part of memory address space,&lt;br/&gt;without relying on OS support to exploit temporal locality and still perform memory&lt;br/&gt;management at fine granularity. Finally, this project investigates morphable architectures that can&lt;br/&gt;dynamically reconfigure the stacked DRAM between cache structure and main memory, in order&lt;br/&gt;to conserve power and optimize performance depending on the workload requirements. The&lt;br/&gt;research solutions in this study will thus help future systems obtain an order of magnitude&lt;br/&gt;improvement in both bandwidth and energy-efficiency from the effective use of memory&lt;br/&gt;stacking.</AbstractNarration>
