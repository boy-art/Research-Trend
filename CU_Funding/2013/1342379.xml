    <AbstractNarration>Technical Description the Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program focusses on understanding and exploiting the effect of microstructure and interface layer on the fracture and thermal properties of particle reinforced polymer nanocomposites. Well characterized and functionalized nanocomposites will be fabricated from different particles and polymer systems. Both micro-scale and macro-scale fatigue crack growth experiments using microscopic stereo vision and digital image correlation will be conducted. Dynamic fracture experiment will also be conducted using the modified split Hokinson pressure bar technique. The thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites as-fabricated and after subjected to mechanical loading will be measured experimentally and numerically. Finally, combining the experimental results with a modified micromechanics model, the effective thermal and fracture behavior of the nanocomposite as a function of individual component properties will be determined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Description of the Project's Signficance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the fracture and thermal properties in nanocomposites as a function of individual material properties of the particles is essential and needed from small industry to large research centers for a better optimized design of nanocomposites. The outcome of this study is important especially in structures and applications where the performance of the components depends mainly on the effectiveness of providing cooling for a device hot spot. Furthermore, the findings can lead to the development of novel nanocomposite materials that can report damage and micro cracking by sensing changes in thermal properties before irreversible damage occurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening Participation of Underrepresented Groups in Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project supports the effort to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups by directly involving students in the proposed research and through the outreach activities. As a part of continuous outreach effort, a set of laboratory demonstration events, using polymer and nanocomposites, will be organized for local high school students, of which one-third are from underrepresented groups. The students will be exposed to and familiarized with the current nanotechnology, 3D computer vision and digital image correlation techniques. The PI will also work with Historically Black Colleges and Universities in South Carolina and nearby states, through the Center for Science Education at the USC as well as the SCienceLab program there. A collaboration with a faculty member at Benedict College has already been established and will be facilitated through this BRIGE award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has been funded through the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering solicitation, which is part of the Broadening Participation in Engineering Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is also funded through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), which is part of the Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>
