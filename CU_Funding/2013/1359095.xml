    <AbstractNarration>The goals of this REU Site Program are to attract and retain students from diverse backgrounds into science and engineering and prepare them for graduate programs and careers in these fields. To accomplish this goal, the proposed program will provide an interdisciplinary research experience at the interface of nanotechnology and biomedicine to undergraduate students from other institutions, leveraging the diverse interdisciplinary expertise, resources, and training opportunities in this area at the University of Georgia (UGA). This program will host 10 REU students over a nine-week summer program where they will participate in interdisciplinary research projects that apply nanotechnology to specific biomedical questions. Each REU student will be co-mentored by paired faculty from the nanotechnology and biomedical disciplines on a collaborative research project. In addition to a total-immersion, hands-on research experience, REU students will participate in enriching activities that will include an ethics-in-science workshop; weekly lunch presentations on the opportunities in interdisciplinary research, and what to expect in graduate school; a career workshop; research seminars; tours to UGA research facilities; participation in a regional summer symposium in nanotechnology and biomedicine; and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. The REU experience will be enhanced for all involved by our efforts to recruit students from diverse backgrounds, with a major emphasis on participants from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines, and is expected to broaden participation by the next generation of scientists and engineers in interdisciplinary research endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose a new and innovative REU site program where the central theme is an interdisciplinary research experience in nanobiotechnology, with research projects co-mentored by faculty in nanotechnology and biomedicine. The existing world-class programs and facilities and collaborative research culture at the University of Georgia (UGA) create a strong setting for this interdisciplinary REU site. Students will be recruited nationwide with particular emphasis on African American and Hispanic citizens. This REU site program serves as an opportunity to bring together researchers across different disciplines, fostering a collaborative atmosphere. Further, UGA serves a very diverse student body and the availability of the interdisciplinary education modules will put UGA students at the frontiers of science and engineering, preparing them for graduate study or industrial careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Materials of this program will be disseminated to public through publications, conferences, and learning communities. Outreach efforts include (1) training REU students as STEM mentors to help local STEM education once they return to their institutions; (2) offering high school teachers a summer research experience to develop classroom materials based on nanobiotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is co-funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (BIO/DBI)."</AbstractNarration>
