    <AbstractNarration>Investigation of hydrothermal heat and mass flux between the crust and the ocean between the Costa Rica Rift axis and Ocean Drilling Program Hole 504B is designed to aid in development of an integrated crust-hydrothermal-ocean circulation model. Heat flow will be measured along a 300 km long corridor as an integral component of a large multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional project called OSCAR (Oceanographic and Seismic Characterization of heat dissipation and alteration by hydrothermal fluids at an Axial Ridge). In combination with oceanographic plume mapping that will guide assessment of hydrothermal flux at the spreading axis, the new heat flow results will show how conductive flux varies as the plate ages, in particular where the transition from focused, high rate flow to diffuse, lower flux circulation occurs. This is a long-standing question in mid-ocean ridge studies. The influence of disrupted basement structure on local heatflow will be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US scientists will work closely with UK and German colleagues that lead the main project. Addition of the heat flow acquisition enables addressing a main theme of the InterRidge Third Decade plan- heat and chemical exchange between the crust and the deep ocean. A female graduate student whose main training is in analytical modeling will gain experience in seagoing data acquisition, exposure to international scientists, and insight into the advantages and limitations of having surface-only data to constrain a subsurface flow model.</AbstractNarration>
