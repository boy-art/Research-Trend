    <AbstractNarration>Stroke occurs in 2.9% of the US adult population and there are nearly 800,000 new or recurring&lt;br/&gt;cases annually. Neuromuscular impairment is a common consequence, though one from which recovery&lt;br/&gt;is possible with appropriate therapy. Though most healthcare plans cover post-stroke therapy,&lt;br/&gt;insurance reimbursement caps typically limit it to a few weeks, despite a growing body of&lt;br/&gt;evidence that therapeutic gains are possible months and even years after a stroke. Adding&lt;br/&gt;the fact that patients generally prefer out-of-clinic care, there is a compelling case for&lt;br/&gt;delivery of physical therapy in the home setting. The new product that will result from this&lt;br/&gt;project will increase dosing of meaningful exercises that promote recovery and minimize co-morbidities&lt;br/&gt;such as pain, swelling, spasticity and (shoulder) subluxation.&lt;br/&gt;This project?s outputs respond to other trends in the US healthcare system, including the&lt;br/&gt;dwindling supply of qualified care providers, the movement toward evidence based medicine&lt;br/&gt;and the economic requirement for increased self-care. The ultimate goal of our Virtual Coach&lt;br/&gt;technology is to leverage scarce human-based care with computer based solutions at substantially&lt;br/&gt;lower cost. The self-adjusting goal-setting capability developed in the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will enable professional therapists to extend their reach to patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One significant challenge in computer-based coaching is devising algorithms that affect human&lt;br/&gt;behavior in an intended way. It is difficult to predict how people will react to commands,&lt;br/&gt;instructions, prompts and rewards. Some respond well to a nurturing "atta boy!" while others&lt;br/&gt;respond better to a drill sergeant?s "that?s not good enough!" Moreover, not only is there&lt;br/&gt;variability among people, but also within a particular individual from day-to-day. To be a&lt;br/&gt;viable, pervasive solution, Virtual Coaches will need to be responsive to the psychology&lt;br/&gt;of the people they serve. Pursuit of our objectives, especially the exploratory research objective,&lt;br/&gt;addresses this challenge in the context of motivating people to adhere to an exercise regimen.&lt;br/&gt;A second challenge is designing exercise software factoring in the heterogeneous presentation&lt;br/&gt;of individuals with neuromuscular impairments. Such patients have varying levels of motor&lt;br/&gt;control, cognitive ability and co-morbidities associated with their impairments. Off the&lt;br/&gt;shelf exercise packages do not account for their limitations. Our translational research objective&lt;br/&gt;is to overcome this challenge by leveraging research conducted on impaired patients and an&lt;br/&gt;already developed software architecture for coaching them through movements that promote long&lt;br/&gt;term recovery.</AbstractNarration>
