    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Joseph M. Fox of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Delaware will design synthetic catalysts that derive stereoselectivity from their larger secondary structure. In particular, he will study conformationally flexible chiral bimetallic rhodium complexes that adopt distinct secondary structures, referred to as the 'chiral crown' conformation. He will develop a diverse family of catalysts in which the crown conformation is enforced, and illustrate how these catalysts can be used to promote novel reactivity. His group will design new types of mixed ligand chiral crown complexes, and use these complexes to catalyze asymmetric CH functionalization reactions of indoles and pyrroles. He will also use these complexes to catalyze reactions of alkynes with diazoesters to give chiral butenolides via sequential ring expansion/sigmatropic rearrangement cascades. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have broad impact through the creation of new catalysts and patterns of reactivity that will have impact across academia and pharmaceutical research. This program will also be integrated with Undergraduate and Graduate education/training initiatives. This award will continue to support research opportunities for a diverse group of scientists, and will create research opportunities for undergraduate students for the span of the award. This award will also provide funding for high school students to participate in research experiences in his laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
