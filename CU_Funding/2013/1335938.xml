    <AbstractNarration>Doyle, Patrick &lt;br/&gt;1335938 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on the study of the static and dynamic properties of self-entangled double stranded DNA in micro and nanofluidic devices. The central goal of this project is to develop an understanding of how self-entanglements affect the transport properties of DNA. Both single molecule experiments and computer simulations will be performed. The three main objectives of the project are: (1) develop means to efficiently generate and characterize self-entangled DNA, (2) study the stretching and relaxation of self-entangled DNA subject to planar elongational fields, (3) use coarse-grained simulations to study self-entangled DNA. Applications of this work are in the emerging field of single-molecule genomic analysis and inter-nuclear DNA dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed will result in work at the front edge of fundamental studies of nonequilibrium dynamics of polymers and DNA. The PI will leverage a newly discovered and novel method to create self-entangled DNA to be used as the model polymer system. New mechanistic insights will be developed regarding self-entangled polymer systems. The fundamental discoveries from this project will result in contributions to polymer physics texts and journal articles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;This project will train undergraduate and graduate students to enter the workforce (academic and industry) to work on cutting edge engineering topics combining molecular manipulations and microfabrication. Through the PI's involvement in the MIT Laureates and Leaders Program, minority students will be involved in research and mentored to pursue a PhD in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) fields. High school teachers will be involved in summer research through the Center for Material Science and Engineering RET program. A new text for undergraduate chemical engineering fluid mechanics will be completed by the PI during the course of the research period. Undergraduates will partake in collaborative international research experiences during summers in either France or Singapore.</AbstractNarration>
