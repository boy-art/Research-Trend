    <AbstractNarration>Android software is widely used in smartphones, tablets, and various&lt;br/&gt;other devices. In devices with limited resources, an application that&lt;br/&gt;consumes too many resources can lead to slowdowns, crashes, and&lt;br/&gt;negative user experience. Software defects related to leaking of&lt;br/&gt;resources are widespread and varied, but there does not exist a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive strategy for testing and debugging of such leaks.&lt;br/&gt;Another common problem in Android software is when an application&lt;br/&gt;takes too long to respond to a user action, in which case it is&lt;br/&gt;perceived as sluggish and of low quality. There do not exist testing&lt;br/&gt;techniques or tools for exposing the underlying software defects&lt;br/&gt;leading to poor responsiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resource leaks and poor responsiveness can have severe effects on&lt;br/&gt;software reliability, performance, and marketplace success. This&lt;br/&gt;project develops LeakDroid, a novel approach and toolset for testing&lt;br/&gt;and debugging of such defects. Static code analyses are used to&lt;br/&gt;extract precise GUI models of Android applications; such analyses are&lt;br/&gt;essential for many algorithms for program understanding, optimization,&lt;br/&gt;testing, and debugging. Next, GUI tests are generated based on common&lt;br/&gt;leak patterns, through sequences of GUI events that should not lead to&lt;br/&gt;increases in resource usage. Poor responsiveness is exposed with tests&lt;br/&gt;that introduce delays at chosen code locations. Debugging techniques&lt;br/&gt;are then employed to find leaking data structures and poor&lt;br/&gt;responsiveness operations, as well as the corresponding defective&lt;br/&gt;code. These contributions advance the state of the art in the&lt;br/&gt;important area of analysis, testing, and debugging for Android&lt;br/&gt;software. When these advances and tools become part of software&lt;br/&gt;development practices, they would result in lower costs and increased&lt;br/&gt;quality applications for millions of users of mobile devices. The&lt;br/&gt;educational efforts of the project develop the skills of the next&lt;br/&gt;generation of creators of mobile software</AbstractNarration>
