    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Gregory K. Friestad of the University of Iowa is establishing a series of new carbon-carbon bond construction reactions for synthesizing biologically active compounds. This effort involves fundamental reactivity studies in reactions which proceed via both radical and polar reactions, so-called "radical-polar crossover reactions," and their application to prepare complex nitrogen-containing compounds. A broader impact of this work is the application of free radical reactions to many subdisciplines of chemistry. The types of compounds that can be prepared through the new reactions have broader impacts on health sciences research, particularly in drug discovery, thereby improving the well-being of individuals in society. Combining radical and ionic transformations into one operation saves time, energy, and materials, with broader impact upon sustainability of chemical synthesis. The project is also developing more diverse personnel resources, which assists in the economic growth of industries dependent upon science and technology education and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expanding the versatility of stereoselective radical additions to imino compounds, so that heterocyclic groups may be present in the precursors, producing structures bearing chiral amines in combination with heterocycles. These developments are being used in synthesis of biologically active compounds of importance in medicinal chemistry. Additional studies are developing reactions in which the oxygen- or nitrogen-containing heterocyclic structural units are formed during the new reactions, using combinations of radical and ionic bond constructions in a single operation. Professor Friestad is also developing approaches to increase outreach between the university and neighboring communities with significant populations of minorities, which are traditionally underrepresented in physical sciences with the goal of building science interests and experiences among people of more diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
