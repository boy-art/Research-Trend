    <AbstractNarration>The Great Lakes Geometry Conference 2013 will take place at Northwestern University on April 20-21, 2013. The main theme of the conference will be geometric analysis. It is well-known that many problems in differential geometry can be formulated in terms of differential equations on manifolds. These equations differ from traditional differential equations in Euclidean space in that they usually encode global, geometric information. To solve them, one needs both analytic techniques and geometric insight. This conference will feature eight speakers who are experts in various fields across geometric analysis, including General Relativity, Kahler geometry and Riemannian geometry. A common theme of much of their work is the study of the Einstein equations, which first arose in General Relativity and now play a central role in Kahler and Riemannian geometry. A major goal of this conference is to expose graduate students and junior mathematicians to new developments in these areas of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Lakes Geometry Conference conference is a well-established conference series that has been annually held in the Great Lakes region, and this will be its 12th edition. The conference will have geometric analysis as its main theme. This is an important field of mathematics with great impact and applications to other areas in mathematics and physics. Geometric analysts use and develop the tools in analysis and partial differential equations to tackle problems which originate from geometry and physics. The conference this year will bring together eight well-known experts working in a number of active research areas in geometry. We expect that the conference will attract a large and diverse spectrum of participants from Northwestern University and other Midwestern universities, and we encourage the participation of early career mathematicians, women and underrepresented minorities. A major goal of this conference is to expose graduate students and early career mathematicians to the recent developments in this active field of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is: http://www.math.northwestern.edu/greatlakes2013</AbstractNarration>
