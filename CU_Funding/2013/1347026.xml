    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide financial support to allow a number of graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, the opportunity to learn about the latest research results and tools in the Cloud and Autonomic Computing (CAC) field. In addition, it will give the supported students the opportunity to network and interact with active researchers and other students doing research in this important and emerging research area. Networking and interactions among the conference attendees are facilitated through the CAC conference's structure. For example, the conference provides breakfast, lunches, one reception during the poster/demonstration session, and a dinner banquet. By providing all these activities, the supported students will have invaluable experiences and plenty of opportunities to interact with and learn from CAC researchers and other graduate students about their research activities and approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in computing, networking, software and mobile technologies have lead to the development of cyberspace services that are pervasive and ubiquitous, such as cloud services, that will touch all aspects of our life and economy. Cloud services will revolutionize the way we do business, maintain our health, conduct education, and how we secure, protect, and entertain ourselves. However, along with these advances, there are grand challenges in how to ensure that our cyberspace resources and services are manageable and secure. The main focus of the CAC conference is to be the premier international forum to present the latest research, applications, and technologies to make cloud and autonomic computing systems and services self-manageable with little involvement of human or system administrators.</AbstractNarration>
