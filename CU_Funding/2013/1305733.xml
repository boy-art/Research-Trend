    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program supports the collaboration of Profs. Daniel Burden and Lisa Keranen Burden at Wheaton College (IL) to investigate novel modifications of single protein nanopores. The research systematically explores a series of chemical additions to alpha hemolysin, a nanopore-forming protein with potential applications in ion and small molecule sensing, polymer characterization, DNA sequencing, and biomedical analyses. The interdisciplinary work gains broad impact by addressing fundamental questions in single-nanopore transport theory, membrane protein structure and dynamics, synthetic biochemistry, and protein purification. A host of biophysical techniques, including atomic force microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, single ion-channel electrophysiology, Langmuir trough monolayer measurements, and cell lysis assays are employed to characterize the structure and function of the nanopore constructs. Computer modeling tools are used to generate a theoretical understanding of novel nanopore design principles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because certain proteins form small holes or pores in cell membranes, scientists have recently begun devising ways to detect various chemicals as they pass through the pore interior. This project advances the field of nanopore sensing by investigating the relationship between structural changes to the nanopore and molecule transport. Beyond contributions to nanopore science and engineering, the program enables high quality undergraduate research education by creating a unique environment that fosters integration among students and faculty from different scientific disciplines, including chemistry, biology, physics and computer science. The work has potential commercial relevance for biomedical sensing and involves under-represented minorities from the greater Chicago area. Aspects of the program will be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum, including courses in biochemistry, advanced analytical chemistry, and the general biology laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
