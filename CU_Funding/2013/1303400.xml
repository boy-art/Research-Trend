    <AbstractNarration>The NSF CAREER awards program serves a critical role in innovative research and education in the United States by identifying, fostering, nurturing and supporting the nation's most promising and creative junior faculty. Beyond the CAREER program solicitation, the majority of junior faculty members usually have little exposure to NSF, let alone interactions with program directors. Many young professors also have no experience in writing successful grant proposals. The goal of this one-day CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop to be held at the University of Texas at Arlington is aimed to fill this gap. This workshop not only introduces young faculty to the CAREER program but also gives them unique opportunities to network with CISE program directors, former program directors and recent awardees. Major activities of the workshop include presentations on proposal writing, experience sharing, mock panels, and proposal writing clinic. The workshop is open to participants from U.S. national universities including HBCU/MEI. Indeed, significant effort is made to involve HBCU/MEI junior faculty into CAREER proposal writing practice, and helps them to become more successful in cutting-edge research and education, thus enhancing their overall research capability to a competitive level. Overall, the workshop is expected to be an invaluable experience for junior faculty as they become successful in their academic careers. By giving priority to participants from under-represented groups, the workshop is expected to make tangible impact to the society. Key presentations and workshop materials are planed to be archived and to be available for download, extending the broader impact of the workshop beyond the one-day event.</AbstractNarration>
