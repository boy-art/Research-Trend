    <AbstractNarration>In recent years theoretical linguistics has shown increased interest in compounds, a phenomenon which can be used as a testing ground for different models of grammar because it lies at the interface of different linguistic components: phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. The focus of this workshop is a particularly interesting type of compound which has been largely neglected in the literature: phrasal compounds, illustrated by the German "ein Lass-mich-in-Ruhe-Blick" and its English counterpart "a leave-me-alone-look". This type of compound has mixed grammatical properties of both phrases and one-word lexemes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support U.S. participation in an international workshop funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, to be held at the University of Mannheim, Germany, in June, 2013. Workshop participants will discuss phrasal compounds from a theoretical and cross-linguistic perspective. The workshop will facilitate the development of a new long-term international collaboration between researchers at Syracuse University and the University of Mannheim. The core collaboration and the resulting research road map will catalyze further work on typologically diverse languages: Japanese, Turkish and additional Turkic languages, and other Altaic languages such as Mongolian, in addition to the languages and language families addressed by the workshop presentations: German and Germanic, Italian and other Romance languages, as well as Modern Greek.</AbstractNarration>
