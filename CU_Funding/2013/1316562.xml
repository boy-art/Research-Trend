    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Beatrix Dudzik of the University of Tennessee to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the Kyushu University Museum located at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan. The project title is "Examining Cranial Variation in Japanese Skeletal Samples Using Three Dimensional Data." The host scientist is Dr. Noriko Seguchi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collection of metric skeletal data in countries where data is not well represented within the academic literature is imperative for the advancement of biological and forensic anthropology. Procurement and curation of this type of information provides a means for both burgeoning and seasoned researchers to address hypotheses that have both broad and focused implications for scientific communities. This project explores cranial morphometrics by collecting three dimensional landmark data which can be used to provide further insight into an array of topics including how functional modules within the cranium are affected by factors such as migration patterns and adaptation. Specifically, this study examines morphological variation of the human cranium in Japanese populations across a broad temporal span. This study is the first to record and analyze three dimensional landmark data of the human skull from a large Japanese skeletal sample that dates from the Yayoi period to the modern Edo period. Analyses of the data collected investigate the hypothesis that morphological patterns of a range of skeletal samples from various temporal depths can be used to infer evolutionary patterns within East Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the data collected for this study will be added to the Forensic Databank of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Tennessee, which is available to researchers and graduate students at accredited national and international laboratories and universities to promote skeletal research in the field of biological and forensic anthropology. The prospect of adding a vast dataset of an underrepresented population to a growing U.S database offers direct benefits for assisting biological and forensic anthropologists in formulation of an accurate biological profile for unidentified remains, ultimately aiding law enforcement in reducing missing person's lists. In addition, building international relationships with professionals in the field of biological anthropology and anatomy is invaluable as it promotes research collaboration and adds to the broad ranging goal of collecting biological data in all geographic regions of the world, which has large implications for skeletal research conducted in the United States, as this country is comprised of populations from around the world. Ultimately, establishing academic rapport with international agencies provides foundations for future opportunity for both American and international researchers to travel and network in foreign countries with the common goal of education, collaboration and global scientific advancement.</AbstractNarration>
