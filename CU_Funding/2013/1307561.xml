    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to elucidate the science underlying the optical properties of nanowires, and to harness these properties for novel photonic devices. The approach is to develop the science needed for nanowire-based photodetectors, for filter arrays for multispectral and polarization imaging, and for plasmonic lasers. The photodetector and filters will be based upon the recent discovery by the Principal Investigator's group that vertical silicon nanowires can appear a wide variety of colors that depend on their radii. The lasers will consist of nanowires positioned in plasmonic waveguides.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Due to their unique attributes, much interest has been paid over the past decade to semiconducting nanowires. It is somewhat surprising how little attention has been paid to the dramatic effects that waveguiding and resonance phenomena can have upon their optical properties. This work will reveal the science, and demonstrate that these phenomena can be used advantageously for nanowire-based photonics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: While the proposed program will investigate the science, it is entirely possible that the devices studied in this work will find their way, in some form, into commercial products. The work therefore could contribute to the United States photonics industry. The project also creates not only the science, but also the human infrastructure required for future advances. The Principal Investigator will provide training to a diverse range of undergraduate and graduate students, and will undertake a variety of outreach efforts in the local community.</AbstractNarration>
