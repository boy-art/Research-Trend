    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to integrate surface acoustic wave with nanophotonic devices on piezoelectric aluminum nitride thin films. The approach is to employ the latest nanofabrication techniques to fabricate surface acoustic wave devices with corresponding acoustic wavelengths comparable to the wavelength of co-propagating optical wave, both are guided and confined in a thin AlN layer. The proposed integrated surface acousto-optical device systems will lead to many novel applications for optical communications and RF/microwave photonics. Ultrafast switching and modulation of nanophotonic cavities and optical isolation based on non-reciprocal mode conversion will be demonstrated. Coherent acoustic phonon generation through stimulated Brillouin Scattering will also be explored. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Although acousto-optics has a long history, the state-of-the-art development of nanofabrication technology can bring the field to an unprecedented new regime of extremely strong light-sound interaction at the nanoscale. The proposed integration of surface acoustic wave devices with nanophotonic devices will lead to miniaturized acousto-optical devices that can be incorporated in integrated photonic systems, tunable optical isolation on a chip, and coherent surface acoustic phonon generation.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project will impact the industry and the scientific community by providing a new class of integrated photonic devices for optical communication and sensing technologies. The education and outreach activities will encourage high-schools students to pursue a career in science and engineering. A series of experimental demonstrations of optical science will be performed during the summer camp programs to inspire and educate K-12 students and at the Science Museum of Minnesota.</AbstractNarration>
