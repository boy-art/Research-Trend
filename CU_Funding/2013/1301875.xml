    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to provide travel support for US participants to attend the international conference 'Representation Theory 2013' at the Inter-University Conference Center in Dubrovnik, Croatia during the period of June 21-27, 2013 (http://www.iuc.hr). The conference will cover a variety of topics in representation theory including Kac-Moody Lie algebras, vertex algebras and related structures, and representations of real and p-adic Lie groups. The main goal of the conference is to gather experts and researchers to present the most recent developments in this dynamic field. Some recent breakthroughs include new constructions of W-algebras, logarithmic tensor product theory for vertex algebras, construction of combinatorial bases for affine-type vertex algebras, new results in the theory of Macdonald polynomials, and an algorithm for computing the unitary dual of real Lie groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representation theory is an important area of modern mathematics with many profound applications in both the mathematics and physics communities. The broader impacts of the proposed conference are twofold: training of younger scientists and dissemination of new results and techniques. At this meeting we will take further steps to improve communication within and across research communities. We aim to encourage US researchers to seek stronger links with their colleagues from Europe. Several graduate students and junior faculty will be supported by this award, some of whom will give talks at the conference.</AbstractNarration>
