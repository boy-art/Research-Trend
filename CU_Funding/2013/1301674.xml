    <AbstractNarration>The program "Algebraic Graph Theory" will run from June 17-28, 2013, at the University of Wyoming. This summer school is part of an annual program sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium (RMMC). The purpose of this program is to introduce graduate students and researchers to topics in algebraic graph theory and their applications, foster collaboration, and build ties between young researchers. Daily lectures will provide the participants with background in the subject, and contributed talks and problem sessions in the afternoon will reinforce the lectures and give the participants a chance to work together on open problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of algebraic techniques to solve graph theory problems has been a very fruitful approach, and continues to have applications beyond pure mathematics to physics, computer science, biology and statistics. The topics covered include spectral graph theory with applications to quantum computing, association schemes with applications to design and coding theory, and graph polynomials with applications to the Potts model and DNA self-assembly. The aim is for a diverse body of student and researchers. Participation of members of groups underrepresented in mathematics is encouraged and supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about the program can be found at: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.uwyo.edu/jwilliford/rmmc2013/rmmc_2013.html</AbstractNarration>
