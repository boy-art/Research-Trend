    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to develop an industrial engineering curriculum that provides students with multiple exposures to sustainability concepts in order to develop both the passion and the skills to integrate industrial engineering tools and methods with sustainable practices. The project team is revising undergraduate core industrial engineering courses to add an emphasis on environmental and social consciousness and sustainable practices, identifying critical issues in sustainable development that will be integrated into the curriculum, developing modules containing new learning material and case studies customized to fit within each industrial engineering course, and developing a new stand-alone course on sustainable development. The evaluation effort, under the leadership of a university-wide evaluation unit, is using student and faculty surveys, focus groups, and assessments of student products to monitor progress. Dissemination is being accomplished through website postings, conference papers, journal articles, and faculty development workshops. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the instructional material and graduates that have a social and environmental awareness and the skills to contribute to a more sustainable future.</AbstractNarration>
