    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) and the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Programs of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Linda Peteanu of Carnegie-Mellon University and her graduate and undergraduate student colleagues are investigating some of the photophysical properties of organic-based photovoltaic and electroluminescent materials. Despite the fact that these materials have become important in a large number of consumer electronics applications, there are aspects of their microscopic behavior that remain poorly understood. Prof. Peteanu and her group are working on improving our understanding of some of the molecular-level behavior of these materials, with an eye towards making improved materials. The young scientists working with Prof. Peteanu will receive interdisciplinary training in experimental physical chemistry and macromolecular science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Peteanu and her group are carrying out a multi-pronged research program to obtain a better understanding how molecular-level behavior influences the photophysical properties of organic oligomers that mimic important classes of organic polymers. Specifically, Peteanu and her students are: (1) performing experimental and theoretical studies of the ways in which electric fields lead to emission quenching in a variety of engineered materials; the theoretical work benefits from collaboration with David Yaron (Carnegie Mellon University), Sergei Tretiak (Los Alamos National Laboratory), and Jing Ma (Nanjing University); (2) conducting experimental and theoretical studies of aggregate spectra; experiments will benefit from collaboration with the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven National Laboratory; and (3) developing higher-resolution imaging of confluent films and device structures to understand the photophysical behavior of differing regions (core/shell) in aggregates. Students working with Prof. Peteanu receive training in modern physical chemistry methods. Prof. Peteanu and her group are also involved in educational outreach efforts to the larger community, including National Chemistry Week activities at the Carnegie Science Center.</AbstractNarration>
