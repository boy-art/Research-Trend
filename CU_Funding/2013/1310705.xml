    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Debra Perrone of Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment at Vanderbilt University to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at the National University of Singapore in Singapore. The project title is "Sri Lanka's Water-Food-Energy Nexus: An Economic Analysis of Water Allocation Schemes." The host scientist is Dennis Wichelns, Director of the Institute of Water Policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The water-energy-food nexus is a central focus in efforts to allocate scarce water resources. This work explores how Sri Lanka, a small island nation in South Asia, makes choices in allocating its water resources with respect to energy and food: water for energy and economic growth or water for agriculture, food security, and cultural preservation. A portfolio of scenarios is created to understand projected water supply and water demand within Sri Lanka over the next twenty years. Different water management scenarios are explored using opportunity cost theory, and tradeoffs are analyzed to prioritize water allocation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Dissemination of the anticipated results is a key aspect of the proposed work, as the results are intended to inform decision makers and support effective management of water resources. All results from this researchl will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at national and international conferences, and available on the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment webpage.</AbstractNarration>
