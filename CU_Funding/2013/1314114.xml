    <AbstractNarration>The research team has developed a torrefaction approach for converting any carbonaceous material into biocoal, which is a material similar in its characteristics to coal. The torrefaction process comprises of the following stages: (1) pretreatment of the biomass (shredding and drying), (2) fast preheating that uses centrifugal forces for fast heat transfer, (3) a torrefaction reactor that uses exothermic phase transition for self-heating, (4) a downsizing stage, (5) compaction to produce densified biocoal suitable for logistic, operational, and safety. Through control of the torrefaction process (residence time, temperature) researchers can customize a biocoal product to match a given coal type such as bituminous or sub bituminous coals. Through this process the research team is also able to offer a synergistic approach between the production of customized biocoal and an accurate assessment of the biocoal performance in a specific application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea behind this project is to produce a clean sustainable replacement for coal, from biomass - biocoal - as a drop-in fuel in all coal applications: liquid transportation fuel from pyrolysis, energy through combustion mostly for power generation, and chemicals through gasification. The total addressable market is about 1 billion ton in the US in 10-15 years at a value of $150-300 billion. The technology is called torrefaction which is a thermal treatment of the biomass at temperatures of 200-300 degrees Celsius in absence of oxygen. Biocoal is a product that is driven by environmental regulations and meets Renewable Energy Portfolios. If successfully implemented, this technology may enable manufactures to customize biocoal for a customer's specific system, reducing a number of risk factors with high cost implications.</AbstractNarration>
