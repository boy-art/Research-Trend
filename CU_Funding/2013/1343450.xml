    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating water repellency properties of low cost replicated microtextured surface technology to fill the anti-icing and corrosion resistance technology gap. The water repellency technology has the following unique features: long-term durability, high bonding strength and extremely high water repellency characteristics that provides exemplary low cost manufacturing to generate cost savings and added safety when compared to the leading competing technology of specialty nanoparticles in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by low cost replication of laser generated microtextured patterns resulting in prototype samples for industrial evaluation and examination of commercial feasibility. The partnership engages aircraft manufacturers, renewable energy generators and dish antenna producers to provide guidance in the aerospace, energy and RF communications market and other aspects including entrepreneurship and technology commercialization as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be in billions of dollars in the next ten years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the aerospace, communications, energy and transportation market places. The societal impact, long term, will be improvements in aerospace safety, long-term operation of structural components and lowering fuel consumption.</AbstractNarration>
