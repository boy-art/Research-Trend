    <AbstractNarration>The Tropical Cyclone Research Forum will be held on March 5-7, 2013 at the NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction in College Park, Maryland. The theme of the workshop is "Tropical Cyclone Research: Our Vision for the Future". Topics include: snapshots of tropical cyclone R&amp;D; federal numerical modeling initiatives; transitioning research to operations; tropical cyclone model development and technology transfer; observations and observing strategies for tropical cyclones and the environment; improvements in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services; and social science applications to the tropical cyclone forecast and warning notification problem. The Tropical Cyclone Research Forum is sponsored by NSF, NOAA/OAR and the Office of Naval Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;At the Tropical Cyclone Research Forum, representatives from the academic research community, industry and federal agencies will have the opportunity to discuss the latest developments in tropical cyclone research such as:&lt;br/&gt;1. Review of the 2012 hurricane/typhoon season from both an operations and reconnaissance perspective;&lt;br/&gt;2. The Navy's Model Development and Improvement Program/Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program (HFIP);&lt;br/&gt;3. NSF program initiatives, to include the University-based National Ensemble Program;&lt;br/&gt;4. Earth System Predication Capability (ESPC)/Next-Generation Suite of Models;&lt;br/&gt;5. Joint Hurricane Testbed: Project Updates and Plans for the Future;&lt;br/&gt;6. Improvements in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services, to include storm surge and inland flooding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The workshop is important to the nation because it brings together the academic research community, industry, federal agencies and other user communities such as emergency management, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the Nation's hurricane forecasting and warning program. Some graduate students will also participate in this workshop, promoting education and training that NSF sees as importance to science and society.</AbstractNarration>
