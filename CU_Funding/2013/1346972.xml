    <AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Sciences is awarded a grant to support a study to assess the importance of and make suggestions for field stations, marine laboratories, and natural reserves (FSMLNRs) to advance science, education, and public outreach in a financially sustainable manner. The National Research Council will convene an independent, expert committee to review current contributions to determine the types of research, training, and public engagement efforts commonly undertaken; examine the infrastructure, logistical, and financial needs to advance science, education, and public outreach endeavors; and develop a range of long-term strategies to enhance financial stability and effectiveness of FSMLNR activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FSMLNRs serve three broad, functions: research and innovation, education, and public engagement in science. Recent publications describe key investments needed in infrastructure, education, and public outreach to maximize the unique value and function of FSMLNRs. FSMLNRs are poised to benefit also from input on how to adapt to changing scientific capabilities or societal needs, develop collaborations and partnerships, and incorporate financially sustainable strategies to support FSMLNR needs and roles. The proposed activity will help build the research, education, and public outreach infrastructure needed to advance technologies, address national and global challenges, and prepare citizens and future workforce to engage in environmental science, conservation biology, sustainability, and other FSMLNR-related science and engineering topics.
