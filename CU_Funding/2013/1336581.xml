    <AbstractNarration>1336581&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ehrman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spray pyrolysis processes can be used to make unique materials not accessible via traditional precipitation or vapor deposition processes. Additional advantages include scalability and solvent free final product powders. Aerosol production of oxidation resistant materials such as silver and palladium has been demonstrated, but extension to lower cost base metals on an industrial scale has been challenging. The objective of this project is to develop a mixed-phase spray pyrolysis route for producing multicomponent base metal powders with increased protection against oxidation, for printable electronics applications including hybrid integrated circuitry and metallization of solar cells. Spray pyrolysis will be used to achieve kinetic control of microstructure, enabling formation of particles that cannot be made by other means. The test bed will be particles that contain both copper and copper/tin alloy, but the processing approach will be broadly applicable to other material systems. A team consisting of student, faculty and industrial researchers from DuPont and the University of Maryland will conduct experimental and simulation based studies to overcome technical hurdles associated with mixed phase powder processing. This team draws upon University of Maryland expertise in chemical engineering, materials characterization and aerosol technology and DuPont expertise in materials chemistry, powder processing, and statistical design of experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this work will enable incorporation of low cost base metals into conductive pastes, leading to overall reductions in cost for solar cells, electronics and medical devices. Use of aerosol based production routes for metal powders will realize additional environmental and cost benefits over conventional precipitation-based processes. Elements of the value added by this project include: (1) fusion of industrial and academic perspectives (2) interactions between industry and university researchers and students that will allow participation at all stages from laboratory innovation to applications testing and (3) interjection of real world elements into activities and research experiences for pre-college and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
