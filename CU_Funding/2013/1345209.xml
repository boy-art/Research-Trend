    <AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Hampton University will build a self-sustaining High Performance Computing center. Building on Hampton University's strength in atmospheric sensing, the institution will develop a complementary modeling and data analysis capability through the acquisition of a large, parallel computer cluster. The proposed infrastructure will advance research in Polar Stratospheric Clouds (potential harbingers of climate change), Jet Stream Dynamics, Dust Transport, Long-term Atmospheric Evolution, Atmospheric Chemistry and Parallel Algorithms. In addition, the proposed infrastructure will enable the development of high-resolution, high-fidelity physical models and data analysis tools capable of ingesting very large and heterogeneous data sets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Research goals include computational fluid dynamics models of the Antarctic Circumpolar Jetstream to be integrated with analysis of multi-satellite, multi-instrument datasets, analysis of the planetary boundary layer for comparison with LIDAR data, line-by-line radiative transfer models for interpreting limb sounding data, and parallel algorithm development taking advantage of structured matrices.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing new insights into Earth's Polar Regions, study of the dynamics of Earth's Antarctic Circumpolar Jetstream will be extended to jet streams on other planets. The new computing cluster will allow researchers to explore dynamical effects that could not be incorporated into previous simulations. Evolution of atmospheres on terrestrial planets will also be investigated by focusing on the set of feedbacks identified within the mantle: the effects of water and mantle temperature on volcanism and lithospheric stresses (and hence subduction). The other feedback of interest is the influence of the surface temperature on the mantle temperature which then influences all the mantle fluxes. Proposed computational resources will also enable project researchers to run the Mars Weather Research and Forecasting model, which is capable of performing simulations at the necessary scales for&lt;br/&gt;parameterization development. This work will help constrain the conditions under which dust-driven convection occurs on Mars and greatly improve our understanding of their dynamics once they evolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The high-performance computing platform and student pipeline to be established by this project will benefit society through improved understanding of the atmosphere and climate, through development of more effective observing and modeling techniques, and through the training of a diverse workforce expertise in advanced physical modeling methods. The proposed computational resource will allow researchers to propose more advanced modeling and analysis efforts, incorporate more detailed physical models, increase coverage and resolution, and explore wider ranges of parameter space than are possible now.</AbstractNarration>
