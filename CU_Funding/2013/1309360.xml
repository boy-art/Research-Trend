    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1309360, Principal Investigator: Christina A. Sormani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will apply Intrinsic Flat convergence between Riemannian manifolds to better understand how close space-like manifolds studied in Mathematical General Relativity approximate the standard well known models. The Intrinsic Flat distance, first introduced by the PI with Stefan Wenger using methods of Ambrosio-Kirchheim, is particularly well-suited to some questions arising in General Relativity because increasingly thin gravity wells disappear under this convergence. In joint work with Dan Lee, the PI has shown that spherically symmetric Riemannian manifolds with increasingly small ADM mass converge to Euclidean space in the pointed intrinsic flat sense, and here proposes to generalize this result. In addition, the PI proposes to develop two new notions of convergence: the first will allow mathematicians to study Lorentzian manifolds directly, and the second will prevent regions from disappearing due to orientation and cancellation. Both notions are specifically adapted to questions arising in General Relativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Einstein's Theory of General Relativity describes how space is curved by gravity. Even within our own solar system, when computing the trajectories of spacecraft heading to Mars, engineers must take into account the curvature caused by the mass of the planets and the sun. Each planet forms a gravity well. If the mass of a planet is small, one would like to know in what sense the space around it is almost flat. In fact, the space around a planet of arbitrarily small mass could be very highly curved (and have a very deep but thin gravity well). In joint work with Dr. Stefan Wenger, the PI has developed a new means of measuring the closeness between curved spaces and, in joint work with Dr. Dan Lee, she has estimated how close the space around a single perfectly spherical planet is to Euclidean space. In this project, she will develop tools allowing one to better understand the space around groups of planets which are not perfect spheres: like the ones in our own solar system.</AbstractNarration>
