    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this project include the design of networked mobile robotic sensor nodes, which are&lt;br/&gt;inspired by insects within the family gerridae, that can monitor water quality in lakes and rivers, and jump&lt;br/&gt;repeatedly to enhance communication capability to overcome the effect of water on radio signal propagation.&lt;br/&gt;This work will also develop energy efficient algorithms that carefully select sensor nodes to jump to gain the&lt;br/&gt;benefit of longer distance communication while managing the energy required to jump. The robotic sensor&lt;br/&gt;can harvest solar energy in a outdoor environment to maintain long term performance. New methods for&lt;br/&gt;sensor localization as the sensor floats within a lake or river will be developed as well as efficient algorithms to collect sensor data and deliver it to the cyber infrastructure that could be used for hydrology modeling and prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research effort should significantly enhance the capability of networked mobile sensor&lt;br/&gt;systems for water quality monitoring in response to water pollution or other environmental conditions. These&lt;br/&gt;concerns can be from oil spills, issues of bacterial levels, or even detection of levels of radiation from nuclear power plant disasters. This research should provide a cost-effective approach for water quality monitoring that can protect health and emergency management such as advising people to vacate areas of environmental damage. Furthermore, new sensor technology should be developed that provides enhanced opportunities for business and job opportunities to industries and society and provides students with a platform to learn and understand all levels of sensor development and operation.</AbstractNarration>
