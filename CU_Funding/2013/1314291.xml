    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this award is to help increase student attendance and participation at the 15th 2013 Summer Bioengineering Conference (SBC) sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers to be held in Sunriver, Oregon June 26-29, 2013. The primary purpose of the SBC is to promote state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and scientific discourse in the broad field of bioengineering with focus on biomechanical engineering, encompassing molecular to tissue and organism-level approaches. This conference highlights students, promotes advancement in their education and furthers their careers towards becoming future leaders in bioengineering. The theme for this year is Translational Research. The selections of the plenary speaker, workshops, and highlighted sessions will serve to inform, educate and inspire attendees about the importance of and pathways for translating their technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will allow the conference organizers to reduce student registration fees and provide complimentary student registration to 36 Ph.D. finalists in the Student Paper Competition. All abstracts submitted are 2-page extended abstracts and the Ph.D. student finalists are selected after a rigorous review process (3 reviewers per abstract). Six finalists for each technical area are selected by the SPC committee and the students present their work in 6 parallel podium sessions. In addition, the conference also supports an MS and BS poster competition as part of the Student Paper Competition with the awards presentation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All presentations are documented in the two-page extended abstract format and compiled in a CD that is distributed to all registrants. Copyright is provided and an ISBN number issued to allow appropriate archiving of the conference material.</AbstractNarration>
