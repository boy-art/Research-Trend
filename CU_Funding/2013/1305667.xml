    <AbstractNarration>This research aims to develop a key microelectromechanical systems&lt;br/&gt;(MEMS) device necessary for low-power, low-cost, robust 2D GC. The specific objectives of this&lt;br/&gt;project are to (a) develop a good understanding of the physics and chemistry governing the&lt;br/&gt;microscale thermal modulation based on theoretical modeling, (b) develop a new MEMS-based&lt;br/&gt;thermal modulator (microTM) device design such that it enables a 2D GC system that achieves&lt;br/&gt;theoretically predicted maximum peak capacity and minimum peak breakthrough, (c) fabricate the&lt;br/&gt;designed Ã¬TM and experimentally characterize its performance, and (d) finally, demonstrate micrTM incorporating&lt;br/&gt;2D GC with the highest compound separation performance with optimal operational conditions determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: With the development of the microTM, our study will provide the first step towards&lt;br/&gt;fully implementing comprehensive 2D GC with MEMS technology. It is readily conceivable that the&lt;br/&gt;improved separation power of 2D GC systems would pave the way for highly reliable and accurate&lt;br/&gt;in-situ monitoring/detection of VOCs in a sample even containing complex co-contaminant&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds. This project will make important contributions to micro analytical instrumentation for&lt;br/&gt;ultimate use in field-deployable GC analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Together with cost effectiveness, complete elimination of consumables from the 2D GC&lt;br/&gt;operation with the microTM would fill the gap between the current relatively limited use and future&lt;br/&gt;general use of the 2D GC technique in a wide spectrum of applications, potentially opening new&lt;br/&gt;commercial markets. The fundamental knowledge gained from this research will be assimilated into&lt;br/&gt;the PI's graduate course on MEMS and chemical sensing. Summer interns from underrepresented groups will be trained through synergetic&lt;br/&gt;coordination with the NSF National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) program.</AbstractNarration>
