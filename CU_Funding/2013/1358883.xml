    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Washington, located in Seattle, WA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-2017. The REU program is open to all undergraduate students who are citizens, nationals or permanent residents of the United States. Students who participate in the program gain skills in lab research, develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, understand the process of science, and communicate their research results to their peers and the general public. Students will have an opportunity to present their results in a national conference. The REU program provides students an experience that is typically not available to them in their academic curriculum. Students from schools with limited opportunities for research and from underrepresented groups are encouraged to apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU Site is to provide a carefully mentored research experience for talented undergraduate students at the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering (CSNE). Each undergraduate student will enter a collaborative team with a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow mentor and a faculty member as they undertake a research project. The team will focus on a CSNE project that has been carefully selected as a good example of interdisciplinary biosciences and engineering research and one that has ties to industry interests. The students will also participate in a weekly communications course and journal club that deals with both oral presentation and writing skills. Each student will be required to write a journal style report of their research for publication and deliver an oral and poster presentation of their summer research in a mini-symposium session. Emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from under-represented groups. The common assessment tool provided by the NSF BIO program will be used to assess the REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.csne-erc.org , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Eric H. Chudler at chudler@u.washington.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Thomas Daniel at danielt@uw.edu).</AbstractNarration>
