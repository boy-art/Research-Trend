    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1342650, Principal Investigator: Li Sheng Tseng, Zhiqin Lu, Lei Ni, Jeffrey Streets, Chuu-Lian Terng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southern California Geometric Analysis Seminar (SCGAS) is an annual two-day conference that rotates between the University of California - Irvine and the University of California - San Diego. This award provides partial support for three years of meetings of the SCGAS, beginning with the February 2014 session at UC-Irvine. The conference features talks given by acclaimed researchers and promotes interactions among members of the southern California mathematics community working in the field of geometric analysis and related areas. It further seeks to introduce to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows some of the most exciting recent developments in geometric analysis. This funding award is geared towards supporting and encouraging the participation of graduate students and recent PhDs, especially women and under-represented minorities, by providing them the necessary travel support to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric analysis is an important area of modern mathematics and is related to many other branches of mathematics. Using analysis as its main tool with differential geometry, topology, and algebraic geometry as foundations, geometric analysis has solved a large number of problems in global geometry, topology, several complex variables and mathematical physics. As the success of the first twenty meetings have demonstrated, the SCGAS conference has now become an important and anticipated event for the southern California region and has also attracted a substantial number of participants from the rest of the country each year. Indeed, it is the unique annual meeting of its kind in the southern California area, and continues to foster interests in geometric analysis at all levels. In the years past, interactions among the participants during the conference have led to a number of new collaborations and research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web sites for the Southern California Geometric Analysis Seminar may be found at http://www.math.uci.edu/~scgas/ and https://math.ucsd.edu/~scgas/.</AbstractNarration>
