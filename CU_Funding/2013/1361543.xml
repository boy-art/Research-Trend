    <AbstractNarration>In Phase II operation, the University of Maine Site of the I/UCRC for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) intends to focus on optimizing the silvicultural and genetic systems needed to produce high quality, raw materials thereby contributing to the cooperative research of the center and making significant progress in increasing forest productivity through forest genetics, site manipulation, and better growth &amp; yield modeling. Many of the problems and opportunities facing the management of forests today bridge disciplinary and regional boundaries. To achieve the technological advances needed for new 21st century challenges, existing university/industry cooperatives must approach research questions at multiple spatial (including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, forest, and ecosystem levels) and temporal scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research conducted by the University of Maine site of CAFS increases the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners. Industrial members benefit by becoming knowledgeable about a wider range of technological capabilities and technology transfer between CAFS scientists and member personnel fosters rapid implementation of new technologies. Students trained via CAFS research are unique in the forestry sciences because of their applied problem-solving skills using interdisciplinary techniques across multiple scales. Aggressive recruiting for graduate students among under-represented groups will continue to be conducted, increasing the diversity of the workforce for both academia and industry in this traditionally diversity-deficient discipline. Opportunities will continue to be sought to involve undergraduate students in CAFS research activities, exposing them to the excitement of forest science and encouraging them to pursue graduate education.</AbstractNarration>
