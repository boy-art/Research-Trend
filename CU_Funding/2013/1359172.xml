    <AbstractNarration>This REU award to Brandeis University, located in Waltham, MA will support the training of 10 undergraduate students for 10 weeks in the summers of 2014-2016. The research theme of modern cell and molecular visualization techniques reflects the common interest among 50 faculty in the Life Sciences at Brandeis. These mentors will introduce undergraduate students to a broad range of topics concerning biological structure and function. Training will take place in a supportive and interactive environment with state-of-the-art facilities, and the participating faculty have a strong record of mentorship of undergraduates for research. In addition, students will participate in weekly lunch seminars, which will include faculty research presentations, professional development activities, and career panels. Students will have an opportunity to interact with scientists with diverse interests and at different stages in their careers. In addition, there will be group discussions of ethical issues and the mentorship relationship in science. Students will develop a written synopsis of their summer work, with feedback and editing and will participate in a capstone symposium including poster presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be recruited from a nation-wide pool through the web, as well as personal outreach at undergraduate research conferences and visits to institutions with limited opportunities for research. Participants will be selected based on academic record, recommendations and potential for research in biology. The value of the experience for students and mentors will be measured by various assessment instruments, including the BIO REU common assessment tool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the experience will be monitored by tracking students for continued interest in science, further educational choices and career paths.
