    <AbstractNarration>The Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison provides intensive mentoring and experience in scientific research and in professional development to undergraduates from historically underrepresented populations: racial and ethnic minorities, low-income, and first-generation college students -- who have expressed and demonstrated an interest in a career in scientific psychology. Pedagogically, PREP has been designed within the framework of social constructivist models of learning, whereby students participate in a broad range of activities with others who are more capable and, as a consequence, appropriate (internalize) the outcomes produced by working together. It features a balance of mentored laboratory research (approximately 30 hrs./week) and a curriculum of scientific instruction, professional development, and networking opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual focus of PREP for the years 2014-2016 is plasticity and processes of change. Over the past several years it has become increasingly evident that these are factors that no scientific psychologist can ignore, regardless of sub-discipline, and PREP provides a thorough grounding in the principles of plasticity and processes of change from the perspectives of five traditional sub-disciplines within psychology: biological; clinical; cognitive and cognitive neuroscience; developmental; and social.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The explicit motivation of this program is to address the well-documented achievement gap whereby members of the targeted populations (1) apply to PhD programs in psychology and (2) successfully complete their doctoral training in proportions far lower than their representation in the overall population. PREP?s combination of intensive research experience and training in professional development and networking is designed to equip its participating students with the skills that are necessary for a successful career in academic psychology. Thus, it will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in many branches of psychological science. In addition, PREP contributes quantitative and qualitative survey research to The Student Assessment of their Learning Gains (SALG) instrument, an NSF-supported project to improve teaching and mentoring in the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
