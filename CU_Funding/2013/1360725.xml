    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to conduct a rigorous "proof of principle" experimental test of coherent perfect rotation (CPR), which is a first example of a hermitian (thus reversible), multiport, 100% quantum efficient optical mode conversion process. Hermitian "coherent perfect" processes are a generalization of the antilaser (coherent perfect absorption, or CPA that combines wave interference with a (sufficiently large) time reversal symmetry breaking transport process. The PIs have shown theoretically that CPR can optimize the optical efficiency and contrast in many optical devices including cavity-based laser frequency locks, opto-magnetic sensors, and optical modulators.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The theory of CPR is relatively complete, simple and subtle. As a general result of linear optics, CPR provides useful insights into optimizing optical systems with components as ubiquitous and prosaic as beam splitters and cavities. This understanding of fundamental symmetry (time-odd optical elements) combined with coherence may be used to improve select non-linear optical processes as well. Verification of CPR will be a first step in the extension and diffusion of this methodology for improving optical design and devices.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Because this research illuminates the use of fundamental symmetries and coherence in optimizing quantum efficiency, experimentally verifying the method is of value for a broad array of optical devices and protocols, and may ultimately inform commercial optical design.&lt;br/&gt;Testing CPR will involve mentoring a postdoc and undergraduate physics and engineering students, through their inclusion in the Photonic, Electronic, and Optical Materials (POEM) research group at YSU.&lt;br/&gt;Their participation will include extensive, novel laboratory work, co-authorship of scientific publications (for some of the students it will be their first peer-reviewed scientific publication) and presentation of research findings at national meetings. The PIs have a proven record of successful and effective post-doc mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have long-standing commitments to science education in northeast Ohio through YAPA (a teacher outreach program active since the 1970's, initiated during the PSSC era) and the Ohio Section of the American Physical Society (OSAPS) and the regional American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT). The PIs will use activity generated by this research support in outreach by promoting public interest in science and exciting younger students about the innovative careers opportunities in technical fields (primarily Physics and Electrical Engineering).</AbstractNarration>
