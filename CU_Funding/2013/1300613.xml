    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of a novel dynamic window technology for energy efficient buildings. Dynamic windows can accomplish three essential functions. First, they can efficiently harvest visible light to minimize electricity use during daylight. Second, they block solar heat from entering buildings in the summertime and thus can lower energy use for cooling. Third, in the wintertime, they let heat in to reduce heating costs. These innovative windows are inspired by the mature heat pipe and novel photonic crystal technologies. Heat pipes have been widely used in managing the flow of heat in a wide range of products such as air conditioners and refrigerators. Photonic crystal is a new class of optical materials designed for controlling the flow of light. A scalable doctor blade coating nanomanufacturing platform will also be developed for making large-area photonic crystal coatings on window glass. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will lead to significant breakthroughs in improving energy efficiency of windows for both residential and commercial buildings. Windows are one of the main sources of energy loss in buildings. On average, they account for 36 percent of overall building heating and cooling loads. Consequently, this research will contribute to reduce the consumption of oil, natural gas, and electricity needed to power buildings. This could greatly enhance the energy security of the United States. Buildings contribute about 40 percent of U.S. carbon emission. This novel dynamic window technology could significantly reduce their impact on the environment. Moreover, the scalable doctor blade coating nanomanufacturing platform will advance many other areas ranging from high-speed optical computing to ultrasensitive bio-sensing, where the inexpensive fabrication of large-area periodic nanostructures is important.</AbstractNarration>
