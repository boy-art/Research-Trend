    <AbstractNarration>This is to organize and provide travel support for a two day workshop near the Washington DC area to explore the utility, challenges and interest level for science investigations enabled by regular in-situ profiling of the upper atmosphere. Multiple companies are currently in the process of developing commercial reusable suborbital spacecraft. While these companies originally targeted space tourism as the primary customer base, it is rapidly becoming apparent that this dramatic increase in low cost access to space could also provide revolutionary opportunities for scientific research and STEM education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is planned for the spring of 2013. It will be widely publicized within the relevant scientific communities, including via aeronomy community mailing lists. Featured participants, and student participation will be particularly solicited with a focus on under-represented communities, and a modest participant support budget is requested to defray the costs of these individuals. Results of the workshop will be summarized in a report and the workshop will also be used as the basis for the formation of an informal working group that will continue to organize the community around this topic.</AbstractNarration>
