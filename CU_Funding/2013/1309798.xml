    <AbstractNarration>Superparticles are nanoparticle assemblies in the form of colloidal particles. They exhibit physical and chemical properties inherited from their nanoparticle constituents as well as the collective properties of these constituents induced from coupling effects. Under the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program at NSF, Prof. Cao and his research group aim to: (1) develop size-controlled synthesis of colloidal superparticles, (2) explore the principles that govern the constituent-packing and surface morphology of colloidal superparticles, and (3) investigate the formation of colloidal superparticles from binary nanoparticle constituents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop synthetic methodology for making monodispersed colloidal superparticles potentially useful for new manufacturing technology for next generation industries. The research effort is integrated with educational activities for training graduate and undergraduate students in multidisciplinary nanoscience and nanotechnology research areas. This project also includes outreach activities to promote the interests of high school students in science.</AbstractNarration>
