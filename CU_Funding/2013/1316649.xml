    <AbstractNarration>This action funds David Fryxell of the University of California Santa Cruz to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. The project title is "Invasive Species in a Changing Climate: How Will Contemporary Trait Change Shape the Dynamics of Invaded Ecosystems?" The host scientist is Dr. Kevin Simon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As global temperatures rise freshwater organisms must adapt, and recent evidence suggests that rapid evolutionary adaptation can affect ecosystems in contemporary time. In order to understand the potential effects of contemporary thermal adaptation on freshwater ecosystems, this project focuses on understanding how an invasive fish, the western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), has adapted to warm geothermal ponds, and how that thermal adaptation affects freshwater communities and ecosystems processes. This project is the first to explicitly test the ecological implications of contemporary thermal adaptation. It also addresses key issues facing New Zealand's environment (global warming and invasive species), and contributes novel insight to the nascent field of eco-evo dynamics (where evolution and ecology are interacting in contemporary time). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow is working alongside several undergraduates; he hopes to share with them novel perspectives in biology. In addition, the Fellow is giving a talk at a local high school about the importance of evolution to conservation.</AbstractNarration>
