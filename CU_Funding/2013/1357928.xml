    <AbstractNarration>The Research and Education (R&amp;E) communities of the U.S. and Mexico have a long history of cross-border collaborations. Given the proximity and the breadth of research taking place at R&amp;E institutions in California and Mexico, the opportunity for enhancing network-dependent cross-border science research and education collaborations holds great promise. An important cross-border collaboration involves Mexico's Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CICESE) and the University of California San Diego (UCSD).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2010, the NSF International Research Networks Connections (IRNC) program funded FIU's Americas Lightpaths (AmLight ) proposal, which included upgrading the network connection between Los Angeles, San Diego, and Tijuana to 10Gbps. With support from Mexico's National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT), Corporaci√≥n Universitaria para el Desarrollo de Internet (CUDI), and other institutions in Mexico, the 10Gbps network connection was extended from Tijuana to Ensenada to connect CICESE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are continuing challenges in cross-border science research and education collaborations benefiting from the use of the enhanced network infrastructure between Mexico and California, and the U.S. Researchers, both in the U.S. and Mexico, must be better informed of the network capability the AmLight project has made available, and explore how to leverage the network?s capability to dramatically enhance cross-border research and education activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to stimulate growth in cross-border science research and education, FIU and CENIC (stakeholders of the AmLight project), with support from UCSD, CUDI, and CICESE, a Big Data, Big Networks workshop explores how to enhance existing or to form new cross-border networks of collaboration between researchers and students connected by the AmLight West 10G link. The broader impacts of the Big Data, Big Networks workshop are aimed at identifying opportunities to underpin with the AmLight cross-border network infrastructure the current and planned cross-border Big Data projects, and at linking into U.S.-Mexico inter-governmental activities aimed at fostering cross-border science research and education collaborations, such as initiatives fostering innovation and education.</AbstractNarration>
