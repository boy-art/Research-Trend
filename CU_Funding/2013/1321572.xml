    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Project aims to optimize and test prototypes of continuous, multi-analyte sensors based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels. The proposed sensor array will be capable of monitoring multiple biomarkers relevant to several common human diseases such as diabetes, ketoacidosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and even obesity. During this project, the first generation wired sensors will be validated by long-term in vitro and in vivo (mice models) testing. Although the long-term (beyond current project) goal and final application of the device developed here-in will be in humans, in this project we will focus on developing a sensor targeting needs in animal research and the scientific community. This strategy creates a strong foundation and generates confidence in the sensor for clinical studies in few years. The proposed work will be accomplished within three subprojects: 1) Validation of long-term stability of hydrogel-based sensors in plasma, 2) Optimization of first generation wired implantable sensor array, 3) Long term validation of sensors in mouse models and basic histology studies. The team strongly believes they can accomplish these aims and build a product ready to serve the animal research and scientific community by the end of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from the strong demand and an unmet need for continuous multi-analyte sensor in human and in animal-research market. Before attempting to enter the huge and difficult-to-penetrate human-market for continuous metabolic sensors the team will first generate revenue by providing devices for the more accessible animal market while continuously improving the sensor array. There are approximately 50 million research animals in the world. Assuming an average sales price of $250 per/sensor and the proposed technology addresses 1% of the total market, annual sales could exceed $100 million. This technology will provide researchers with a new tool to continuously monitor relevant biomarkers in a given animal over many days, which not only increases the efficiency of studying animal models but also supplies greater detail of their metabolism than is currently allowed by periodic sampling. A continuous monitoring system would save money, speed research, and provide greater insights into the pathogenesis and new potential therapies of diseases.</AbstractNarration>
