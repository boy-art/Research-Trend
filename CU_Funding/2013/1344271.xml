    <AbstractNarration>Typically, an electronic component goes through process of design, fabrication, assembly, distribution, usage in the system, and finally end of life. Obsolete integrated circuits (ICs) are commonly targeted by counterfeiters through recycling, remarking, and cloning. If counterfeit components end up in critical applications such as defense, aerospace, automotive, or medical systems, the results could be catastrophic. This research will raise awareness of counterfeiting, piracy, and electronic components recycling and remarking issues which will have positive socioeconomic effects on electronic components innovation and growth, rights' holders and consumers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detecting these counterfeit ICs is an extremely difficult task because of the large number of counterfeit types, part types, and defects and anomalies associated with the counterfeit parts. In this project, we develop innovative 2D/3D optical imaging for detecting exterior physical defects, novel 3D X-ray imaging technologies for interior physical defects detection and to eliminate the need for decapping of ICs, and a Tera-Hertz imaging technology for exterior and interior physical defects detection.</AbstractNarration>
