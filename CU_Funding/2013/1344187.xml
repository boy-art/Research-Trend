    <AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Population and Community Ecology Program in the Division of Environmental Biology in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and by the Emerging Frontiers Program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences, and by the Office of Integrative Activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatial and temporal variability are common across many areas of study ranging from physics to ecology. In all areas, it is important to understand dynamics across space: under what conditions are dynamics synchronous across space and when is there a lack of spatial coherence? Ecologists have struggled to understand spatial synchrony for over a century, in part because lack of synchrony often promotes persistence of populations. Within physics, studies of magnetic materials or of crystal structures have posed similar questions about the coherence of states across space. This project will explain how broad-scale synchrony can arise from local couplings by mapping relevant ecological models to an equilibrium model developed in physics. The interdisciplinary team of researchers has preliminary data establishing a correspondence between ecological non-equilibrium models and the equilibrium properties of physical models. Research will build on these preliminary results to confirm the presence of phase transitions for a wide variety of systems, thus providing ways to unify approaches for understanding the dynamics of synchrony. The primary tools will be computer simulations that are complemented by analytic approximations that provide understanding of transitions. This combination will both provide a deep understanding of synchrony in ecological systems that is not model specific, and produce new models of interest within physics, thus benefitting both disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This novel interdisciplinary project will contribute basic, new theory to the disparate fields of ecology and condensed matter physics by developing a basic understanding of the dynamics of synchrony at different spatial scales. Understanding of the emergence of spatially and temporally synchronous behavior in agroecological systems could have tremendous impact on effective management of plant and animal diseases, control of pests, agricultural strategies, and ultimately on food security. It is very rare that a theoretical project spanning two disparate disciplines has such potential to address questions of food security, providing novel ways to address a problem that will grow in importance with time. The researchers plan to train students in interdisciplinary approaches and will hold workshops both at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis and the Santa Fe Institute to provide broad dissemination of the approaches developed.</AbstractNarration>
