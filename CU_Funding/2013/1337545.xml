    <AbstractNarration>Technical Descrition:&lt;br/&gt;This award from the National Science Foundation is for the acquisition of an electrospinning system for cutting-edge research in nanofibers. It will be used by faculty from the Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, Material Science, and Biology departments at Georgia Southern University in a wide variety of research projects, from generating new avenues for cancer therapeutics, biocompatible nanofibers, lightweight ultra-tough hybrid fibers, multifunctional materials to antimicrobial coatings and compounds with extraordinary thermal, mechanical and biological properties, to name just a few. The acquisition of the electrospinning system will greatly enhance the emerging group of nanotechnology researchers at Georgia Southern University and southeast Georgia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;This award from the National Science Foundation is for the acquisition of an electrospinning system for cutting-edge research in nanofibers. The instrument will be an important resource for rural southeast Georgia, strengthening the already existing ties with Armstrong Atlantic University, South University, and Savannah State University, as well as industry, and establishing new partnerships. Undergraduate and graduate students throughout southeast Georgia will benefit from exposure to research and courses on nanofiber- and nanotechnology that otherwise does not exist in this form in this region, providing hands-on, real-life experiences and preparing them for their careers. To strengthen the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pipeline, the PIs will develop a professional development workshop for high school teachers in rural southeast GA sponsored by an industry partner, Solvay Specialty Polymers (Alpharetta, GA).</AbstractNarration>
