    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is to gain deeper insight into the physics of the new process of Laser Induced Plasma Micromachining, which promises better and faster micro-feature fabrication as compared to conventional micro-machining with a focused laser beam. Physics-based models will be formulated for the investigation of the mechanisms of plasma generation, plasma-matter interaction, and the prediction of machined feature geometry. New optical techniques and unique enhancements to this process, based on the optical manipulation of the shape of the plasma into plasma patterns rather than a spot, will be explored. This will increase process productivity and speed by at least one order of magnitude, and facilitate the fabrication of two- and three-dimensional geometries and patterns. Comprehensive experiments involving all aspects of the mechanics of the process will also be performed to validate the models developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully realized it is anticipated that the technology created by this project will enable major advances in critical areas of miniaturization technologies, given its multiple concomitant advantages such as its multi-materials capability, low heat-affected zone, high throughput, greater in-process flexibility and, most importantly, its pattern or feature/area-based rather than spot-based or writing nature of machining. This latter ability will result in significantly increased process throughput as compared to current focused laser beam based micro-manufacturing processes. Process capabilities will include the ability to generate high-accuracy features such as deep channels, dimples, through holes and other freeform structures on a variety of materials including metals, polymers, ceramics, composites and other transparent, reflective and brittle materials. The obtained results will also open doors for new research on non-lithography based single-step micro-manufacturing techniques for building and generating micro/meso-scale devices and patterns.</AbstractNarration>
