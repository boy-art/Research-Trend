    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Igor Klebanov, Alexander Polyakov, and Herman Verlinde at Princeton University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this project, Professors Klebanov, Polyakov, and Verlinde will carry out a broad program of research in theoretical and mathematical physics, with the goal of extending advances in the foundational aspects of quantum field theory and the Einstein theory of gravity. These researchers also intend to apply these advances to the physics of the Universe, to quantum black holes, to particle physics beyond the Standard Model, and to condensed-matter physics. An important aspect of this research program concerns the precise relations between quantum gauge field theories and gravitational theories, known as gauge/gravity dualities. Also included in these studies are gravitational theories that contain fields of arbitrarily high spin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is also envisioned to have an essential educational and mentoring component: preparing post-docs, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates for successful research careers. Some of these students and post-docs go on to become leaders in theoretical physics, while others embark on successful careers in biophysics, neuroscience and other sciences. In all cases, the education, research supervision and mentoring they receive provides a broad impact that transcends the immediate research results. The physicists supported by this award will also continue to be active in organizing advanced schools, workshops and conferences. They have also organized and presented public lectures, informing broader audiences about recent research developments.</AbstractNarration>
