    <AbstractNarration>The mouth connects the digestive system with the external environment. Without this connection animals cannot eat. Remarkably, despite its obvious importance, there have been few studies that address how this initial connection is established. It is also not often considered in studies of orofacial evolution, development and birth defects, and is rarely mentioned in developmental or anatomical textbooks. In this project, a series of experiments will define how the first connection to the digestive system is formed, and how its development is intimately tied to the formation of surrounding facial structures. Specifically, the hypothesis is that growth and tension within the face pulls the mouth open. Molecular, cellular, embryological and biomechanical approaches in Xenopus will be combined to test this hypothesis. Based on preliminary data it is expected that novel connections between molecular signals, cellular junctions, such as desmosomes, and mitosis will be uncovered. This work is potentially high impact in that it is the first to study: 1) the role of tension in orofacial development and 2) the molecular mechanisms governing how the connection to the digestive system is established. Additionally, this work is integrated into an innovative educational plan. Graduate and undergraduate level laboratory courses will be created where students will perform experiments contributing to the project. In addition, undergraduate independent study and summer research projects are planned for VCU's minority programs. On the opposite end of the educational spectrum is a preschool component where children will be exposed to living frogs at various life stages combined with art, math and reading activities. Together, this work will provide students at several levels with the opportunity to contribute to a better understanding of vertebrate mouth development.</AbstractNarration>
