    <AbstractNarration>This S-STEM scholarship project for low income students focuses on preparing engineers with the skills required to be part of a global engineering workforce. The Global Engineering Preparedness Scholarship (GEPS) program includes strategies to equip a total of 25 academically talented, low income students to enroll and graduate from the Swanson School of Engineering at University of Pittsburgh with technical, global competency and leadership skills. With the development of students' intercultural and global competency skills, the GEPS program is addressing the National Academy of Engineering's Educating the Engineer of 2020 (2005) call for preparing engineers to be leaders in global engineering fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the GEPS program are to: 1) provide access, through scholarship opportunities, to engineering education to talented low income students to enroll and graduate in engineering, with concerted effort to increase the enrollment of underrepresented minority (URM) students; 2) provide continuous academic support for the retention and graduation of GEPS scholars in engineering; and 3) provide opportunities for GEPS scholars to develop global competency and leadership experience. Scholars gain global leadership experiences by selecting from four options: stay-at-home service learning activities, internships, Engineering for Humanity Certificate capstone design course, or study abroad experiences with on-location projects. Recruitment strategies include emphasis on transfer students, who typically are not provided scholarship opportunities. Evaluators will provide formative feedback to assist in iteratively improving global engineering preparedness, peer and faculty mentoring, academic counseling, tutoring, and other program components.</AbstractNarration>
