    <AbstractNarration>The project team is developing a web-based application designed for small group collaboration around video artifacts. Beyond simply viewing video, this application is equipped to allow users to dive in and analyze and annotate the video and to have discussions around the video artifact while either co-located or distributed. The application is designed to be a system that has features to enhance collaborative sense-making around video. There are few other systems designed for groups of people to privately work with video artifacts to transform the data embedded in video content into information and knowledge that can be used in creative pursuits and in analytics and decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercialization of this technology has the potential for broad societal impacts. Video capture is already ubiquitous and is only increasing, leading to millions of hours of video that is under-utilized across a wide spectrum of domains. This system, if made widely available through commercialization, can help people to work with video to transform the data in their video content into information and knowledge. The technology enables collaborative sense-making that can lead to more creative outcomes in art and design domains and to better understanding and better decision makings in complex environments such as medicine, science and defense.</AbstractNarration>
