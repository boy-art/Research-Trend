    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop novel polymer coatings that bind hydrogen peroxide (HP), even after the surface has dried, thus maintaining sanitized surfaces and preventing microbial growth and the spread of disease. This allows the surface to maintain long-lasting antimicrobial effects between cleanings. It is expected that these coated surfaces will kill 99.999% of microbes that contact the surface. HP is currently receiving renewed attention as a safe, environmentally-friendly, and cost-effective antimicrobial, as evidenced by the recent introduction of several commercially-available cleaning products based on HP. Healthcare facilities are known to be breeding grounds for a variety of infectious diseases. The pathogens that cause these diseases can reside in many places in the hospital environment ? not just in devices and equipment used in medical procedures, but also from common surfaces such as bed rails, bathroom fixtures, hand rails, and computer keyboards. Microbes living on these contaminated surfaces, which are touched by multiple people, lead to increased spread of healthcare associated infections (HAIs). It is estimated that 1 in 20 hospital patients will be infected with an HAI as a direct result of the care they receive in the hospital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project go beyond the medical and hospital applications for which the coatings will be developed and the potential for use in other areas are enormous, with broad utility in the consumer, industrial, and institutional markets. Multiple people touching everyday objects spread infection and disease. One dirty hand can infect numerous surfaces. Rubbing one?s eye or eating a sandwich can become a vector for infection. Even surfaces that are cleaned and sanitized frequently can quickly become recontaminated after the applied disinfectant has evaporated. Examples of places where such coatings would have great impact on public health include bathroom fixtures in public restrooms; kitchen equipment and tables in restaurants, schools and other institutions; home appliances; and seats, armrests, railings, and tray tables for airlines, cruise ships, and other public transportation. Such coatings could be easily implemented into existing manufacturing processes, retrofitted to existing equipment, or even sold as paints for DIY use. The commercial potential for these coatings is huge, especially in consideration of the potential savings to the healthcare industry. A 20% percent reduction in HAI?s translates into an annual savings of $7.2 million, demonstrating that money spent on preventative steps translates into meaningful savings.</AbstractNarration>
