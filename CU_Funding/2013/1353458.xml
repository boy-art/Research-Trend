    <AbstractNarration>The 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the Arecibo Observatory is a landmark event for&lt;br/&gt;one of the nation?s storied and most significant federal scientific facilities. To mark the&lt;br/&gt;anniversary, SRI International (SRI) proposes a science symposium that will both celebrate&lt;br/&gt;and publicize the Observatory?s past accomplishments, current investigations, and importance&lt;br/&gt;to future exploration. Keynote speakers will review the Observatory?s 50 years of scientific,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and educational accomplishments in Ionospheric and Atmospheric Science, Radio&lt;br/&gt;Astronomy, and Planetary Radar Astronomy. Presentations by active users will survey current&lt;br/&gt;research activities, and moderated forums will offer the opportunity to discuss strategies&lt;br/&gt;for the future scientific direction of the facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will facilitate the exchange of scientific findings, insights, and techniques&lt;br/&gt;across the interdisciplinary community that uses the unique observational resources of Arecibo&lt;br/&gt;Observatory. Such conversations are likely to stimulate ideas for expanded investigations&lt;br/&gt;and spark interest in novel explorations, resulting in increased and more diverse applications&lt;br/&gt;for the Observatory?s instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the symposium flows from the educational and outreach missions of the&lt;br/&gt;Observatory, and the global economic and ethnic diversity provided by a U.S. federal facility&lt;br/&gt;located in Latin America. Extensive public press coverage of this event will communicate our&lt;br/&gt;scientific and educational activities to an extensive, diverse community. The symposium will&lt;br/&gt;present rich scientific content, provide a pivotal point in strategic planning for future&lt;br/&gt;achievement, and recognize and appreciate the scientists and engineers who developed and use&lt;br/&gt;this national treasure.</AbstractNarration>
