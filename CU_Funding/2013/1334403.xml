    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to develop polymerization chemistry for light-mediated control of the shape of a surface coating. This comprehensive study of a new class of monomers and polymer coatings will provide new insights and new capabilities in the field of nano- and micro-structures that change shape in response to light. We expect the development of this field of materials chemistry to enable the selective deposition of controlled-thickness films over many geometrically-complex actuation modes not currently accessible with traditional solution casting methods, overcoming a major technological hurdle associated with this exciting class of materials. The approach of this research will be to 1) use computational methods to evaluate the behavior of the proposed materials with experimental synthesis and characterization of the materials to rationally design a new class of light-responsive monomers, 2) evaluate speed and spatial control over coating formation, and 3) elucidate the governing principles of actuation of these coatings over complex nanoscale geometries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will bridge the gap between two-dimensional actuatable materials and applications in devices as varied as artificial muscle motion, switchable surface adhesion, and directed fluid flow. Graduate students will be trained through the execution of this research. Undergraduate students will be trained in association with this project and an existing Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at the University of Kentucky. The computational effort will also integrate into ongoing outreach activities at Kentucky-based non-PhD granting institutions. The PIs will continue to attract and retain qualified undergraduate and graduate researchers from underrepresented minorities for the advancement of the proposed work. Finally, this work supports the development of an educational program in surface characterization and analysis for painting professionals at local and national automotive manufacturing facilities.</AbstractNarration>
