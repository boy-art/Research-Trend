    <AbstractNarration>The Austin Peay State University (APSU) Natural History Collections (NHC) include over 100,000 specimens of plants and animals from the Mid-south region of the U.S. These collections are vital to faculty and student research, serving as the foundation for over 200 publications, theses, and dissertations. The NHC are used in public outreach and as instructional materials supporting APSU biology courses. APSU students traditionally underrepresented in science including, military (28%), women (&gt;50%), low-income, first-time college, and minority students, receive training through courses utilizing the NHC and through collections-based research. Due to recent, drastic growth in the NHC and the discontinued use of toxic fumigants, collections are threatened by damage from overcrowding, fire, and insects. This award will secure the collections through acquisition of storage systems that increases space and prevents specimen damage. Additionally, funds will be used to improve electronic storage of specimen data and to increase accessibility through a consolidated and improved NHC website that provides online access to specimen records, images, and other associated natural history information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Austin Peay State University (APSU) Natural History Collections (NHC) include the Mid-south's largest herpetological collection, a rapidly growing fish collection, and the second largest regional herbarium. APSU NHC's mission is to serve as the primary specimen repository for the Mid-south, to lead efforts to describe regional biodiversity, and to train new generations of students through excellence in mentorship, research, and public outreach. While the NHC have contributed significantly to education and research locally, use by the broader scientific community has been limited. Due to recent drastic growth, the NHC are threatened by physical damage from insufficient storage, active insect infestations, and potential future fire, water, and earthquake damage. Project goals are to (1) secure existing collections through installation of compactor shelving systems and implementation of non-toxic pest management, (2) increase utility through development of a single Specify database, and (3) increase accessibility via development and enhancement of online interfaces and collaboration with iDigBio and other data-sharing portals. These actions will promote the NHC's mission and convert currently under-utilized but regionally significant collections into broadly accessible resources that will support education and research related to of one of the most biodiverse areas of the US. More information about the APSU herbarium is available at www.apsu.edu/herbarium/databases; similar outlets will be developed for the vertebrate collections as part of the activities supported by this award.</AbstractNarration>
