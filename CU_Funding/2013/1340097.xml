    <AbstractNarration>The California State University, East Bay (CSUEB) Noyce Scholars Program Phase II (NSP II) is building on and expanding Phase I efforts to recruit and support academically successful senior mathematics and science majors and STEM professionals in completing a credential program and becoming highly effective teachers in high needs, urban schools. This four-year joint project, in collaboration with K-12 districts across Alameda and Contra Costa counties, supports 32 new math and science teachers (16 scholarships in year 2 and 16 in year 3) and focuses on two areas: 1) continuing to increase the number of middle and high school math and science teachers obtaining their credentials at CSUEB and 2) informing understanding of how best to attract, prepare, and provide ongoing support in order to retain highly effective STEM teachers by expanded evaluation of program efforts and the effectiveness of participating scholars. The NSP II is significant in its focus on the early recruitment of teacher candidates who are highly qualified in disciplinary areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The East Bay Area, which includes Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, supports an ethnically and racially diverse population. STEM professionals are in high demand but there are significant shortages in the workforce of those possessing competence in science and math. The future economic health of the region depends increasingly on an educational system capable of preparing teachers to respond successfully to the needs of students who require intensive and effective educational programs in science and math. The Noyce scholars furnish the tools to their students that enable underrepresented groups to be competitive in the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
