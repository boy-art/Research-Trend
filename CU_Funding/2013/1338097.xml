    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of an integrated Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) system with diverse functions at the Stillwater Campus of Oklahoma State University (OSU). The main FTIR spectrometer is equipped with state-of-the-art optics and electronics resulting in unprecedented accuracy of FTIR data collection. Integration of an array of components, including tunable nanosecond laser, cryogenic system, infrared microscope, focal plane array detector, and temperature controlled attenuated total reflection cell, makes this instrument a rare and one of the most powerful and versatile FTIR systems for biological research. This multi-functional advanced FT-IR system will significantly impact and enable a broad range of research projects, including but not limited to: develop infrared structural biology for structure-function studies of proteins, investigate principles in receptor activation in biological signaling, explore catalytic mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation for bio-energy, probe structural dynamics of IL-18:IL-18BP complex formation for autoimmune responses, and analyze polymer nanocoatings for biomedical applications. This system will also be used to characterize biopharmaceuticals for vaccine formulations, and investigate cellular responses in endothelial cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels upon sheer stress for bioengineering of artificial heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrument will be housed in the Henry Bellmon Research Center, a recently completed state-of-the- art building dedicated fully to cutting edge multidisciplinary research. The advanced FT-IR system will be used to catalyze the developments and applications of the emerging field of infrared structural biology of proteins that will significantly impact a wide range of research in life sciences, including basic research, bio-energy, and biomedical research. This powerful and versatile instrument will significantly enhance the research not only by a large number of OSU researchers, but also external users, including from California and New York. An annual workshop on Infrared Structural Biology and a new course on "Infrared Biology: FT-IR Spectroscopy and Imaging" will be initiated and offered to train postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, including many under-represented minorities. To increase the participation and research experience of under-represented minorities, we have established partnerships with Langston University (85% minority students in a historically black college), Northeastern State University (40% minority students with high percentage of native Americans), and two minority programs in Oklahoma State University-Stillwater campus;the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK- LSAMP) and the Native Americans in Biological Sciences (NABS) Center. Building on the existing strength of the PI, a leader in promoting women in physics, and 6 women and 2 minority team members, continued efforts will be made to encourage, mentor, and train women and minority scientists at the postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate levels.</AbstractNarration>
