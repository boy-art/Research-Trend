    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S participants in the program "Noncommutative Distributions in Free Probability at the Fields Institute" that will be held from July 1-31, 2013, at the aforementioned institute in Toronto, Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this wide-ranging program is free probability and its ramifications. Free probability theory is a probability theory adapted to deal with variables having the highest degree of noncommutativity. It is based on replacing independence modeled on tensor products by independence modeled on free products. The theory has important connections with von Neumann algebras, random matrices, combinatorics, and certain problems in mathematical physics. Surprisingly, the part of basic classical probability theory for which there are free probability analogues is unexpectedly large and keeps growing. The program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
