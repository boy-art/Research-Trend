    <AbstractNarration>Preservation Archaeology is both a philosophy and a strategy that integrates big-picture research, cultural resource preservation, and education. Archaeology Southwest has been developing this vision of Preservation Archaeology for 25 years and they believe that it has an important role to play in the future of the discipline. Archaeology Southwest has expanded its Preservation Archaeology Field School as an REU Site, building student diversity by targeting Native American undergraduates and other under-served populations from institutions across the U.S. The site offers students a transformative experience in a beautiful, rural Southwestern setting that is rich in cultural and natural resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;This REU site offers undergraduate students an intensive, immersive experiential learning program. Through completion of several complementary intellectual tasks and program components, students learn the fundamentals of archaeological fieldwork, the basic tenets of Preservation Archaeology, and how to develop and implement archaeological research designs. They are expected to think critically about the values of archaeology and history to different communities, and explore different ways to communicate the results of scientific research to the public. In addition, students are active participants in the collection of data that contribute to Archaeology Southwest's long term research program focused on demographic reorganization, migration, and community organization in the southern U.S. Southwest during the late precontact period (ca. A.D. 1200-1500).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The Preservation Archaeology REU Site trains the next generation of archaeologists - students who will one day pursue careers at universities, private companies, tribal organizations, museums, and government agencies. Discussions of current ethical issues facing archaeologists provide them with a framework to face similar issues in their future endeavors. Even those students who do not go on to careers in archaeology learn the value of collaboration and collegiality, critical thinking, and the potential values inherent in nonrenewable cultural resources.</AbstractNarration>
