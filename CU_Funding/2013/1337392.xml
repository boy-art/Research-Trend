    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to St. Mary's University in San Antonio TX to purchase a fluorometer for the use of at least eight faculty members in the School of Science, Engineering, and Technology. Fluorometry, the measurement of light emission from fluorescent chemicals, is versatile and very sensitive, so it can be used in multiple fields. The eight faculty members will use the instrument in research that varies from chemosensor design, to detection of genetic transcription control elements, to the design of quantum dots for use in LEDs, to water-quality studies in natural aquifers. It will also be used to describe protein-protein interactions and protein dynamics in studies of enzymes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The faculty members using the fluorometer in their research engage exclusively with undergraduate students in their projects, and since St. Mary's University is a Hispanic Serving Institution, the instrument will be used by undergraduate students from an underserved minority. The exposure of students to this high-quality instrument will expand their experimental, verbal and analytical skills, and enable them to perform meaningful research. Students will make discoveries that will be disseminated through publications in reviewed journals, and they will attend research conferences to discuss their findings. Since the projects to be performed are so varied, the instrument will impact students in various majors, from biophysics to organic chemistry to cell biology. The water quality studies have the potential to benefit users of the Edwards Aquifer, which serves San Antonio and surrounding communities. The instrument will be shared with students at neighboring universities.</AbstractNarration>
