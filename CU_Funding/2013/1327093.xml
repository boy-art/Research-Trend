    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop a robust and scalable vapor phase based manufacturing and engineering strategy to produce wafer-scale high quality MoS2 atomic layers, a highly promising 2D semiconductor, and their in-plane hybrids with graphene and h-BN towards high performance and extremely compact 2D electronic devices. A systematic quality evaluation procedure including structural, electrical and mechanical characterizations will also be established, followed by detailed device characterizations to provide critical feedbacks for the manufacturing and engineering process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to realize the potential of large scale manufacturing and rational engineering of several emerging 2D materials for future 2D electronic device applications. It is very exciting to be able to control the domain shapes and sizes of several in-plane heterostructures through atomic layer engineering. In fact, with the appropriate selection of atomic layers of materials with different electronic properties, entire devices could be engineered and fabricated within a single atomic layer, bringing a completely new dimension to device technologies and representing a truly transformative advancement for future electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are promoting interdisciplinary research and educational efforts integration from physics, chemistry and engineering communities in the next decade. Graduate students and/or post-doctoral fellows will be positively impacted as they will be undertaking important research assignments in this project. Cross-boundary educational efforts, due to the nature of this research, would be strongly encouraged to train talents who would contribute to scientific discovery and engineering innovation in this emerging field in US.</AbstractNarration>
