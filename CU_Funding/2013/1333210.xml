    <AbstractNarration>Title: Planning Visit Proposal in Support for High Performance Computing for Econometrics Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the planning visit is to establish a collaborative research program in the multidisciplinary area of econometrics and high performance computing. Unlike scientific computing which has been mostly the focus of parallel computing, the econometrics area does not get much attention by computer scientists. As part of this planning visit, we will identify what are the major computational challenges in the econometrics domain and how computer science and high performance computing can help in addressing these challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lack of software to use large scale computing power for econometrics applications has forced researchers to make either some approximations in quantitative analysis of economics data or not fully validate the theories they develop to explain an economic phenomena. Developing tools and libraries that help researchers in the area of econometrics to use massively parallel computing power will enable them to make basic science advances in econometrics that were not possible otherwise. The outcome of this planning visit would be a proposal in this area to NSF.</AbstractNarration>
