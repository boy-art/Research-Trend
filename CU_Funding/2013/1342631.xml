    <AbstractNarration>The research team has developed a thermostable and acidotolerant mobile enzyme sequestration platform (mESP) system capable of enhancing deconstruction efficiency of pretreated lignocellulosic substrates. The current research is focused on preparing this technology for use in 2nd-generation bioethanol production processes, and can also be employed in corn-based (1st-generation) production. The technology enhances the efficiency of enzyme-mediated processes that deconstruct pretreated feedstock and convert complex carbohydrates to simple fermentable sugars. The research team plans to upscale mESP technology from a laboratory-scale system to an industrial system that can potentially; accelerate the development second generation mESP prototypes for lignocellulosic (2nd-generation) production processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of mESP systems can result in significant savings for 1st-generation bioethanol producers and open markets for 2nd-generation products. Additionally, mESPs enable wider-spread production of lignocellulosic-based biofuels (2nd generation) by providing another option for high efficiency feedstock deconstruction. Opportunities to use mESPs in bioremediation and food production will also be explored by this I-Corps team.</AbstractNarration>
