    <AbstractNarration>This award by the National Science Foundation to Morgan State University is for the acquisition of a combined atomic force and magnetic force microscope (AFM/MFM). This instrument will be used to probe the underlying physics and characterize thin magnetic films and multi-layers. In recent years, the PI has developed novel lower-dimensional solid state structures with optical, electronic, and magnetic characteristics governed by quantum mechanics. Probing the size effects and surface and interfacial physics is important in understanding these structures and developing new technologies. The AFM/MFM provides information on features as small as an atomic lattice for either conductive or non-conductive samples, it enables manipulation for sample growth, and it makes it possible to image in in-situ and controlled environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to probe materials with Atomic and Magnetic Force Microscopy (AFM/MFM) is critical in understanding the physics of novel thin film magnetic materials a few nanometers thick and a few square millimeters in surface area. The instrument will be used to study technologically important materials used in ultra-high-density data storage for next generation personal computers and in developing fast, miniaturized, and reliable electronic devices. The instrument will complement an existing magneto-optic Kerr effect instrument and magnetron sputtering thin film growth system. Students at Morgan will learn the basics of operating and building an AFM / MFM through a weeklong workshop at the manufacturer's headquarters. This knowledge will enable modification of the instrument to advance a variety of research needs and will be passed on to future students at Morgan State University.</AbstractNarration>
