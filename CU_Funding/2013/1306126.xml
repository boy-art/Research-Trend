    <AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation grant to the Rutgers University Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics group will enable studies of the structure of the nucleon. We will study neutrino scattering from nuclei at the Fermilab National Accelerator Facility (FNAL). We will also investigate quark distributions within the nucleon with the SEAQUEST experiment at FNAL. We will participate in several upcoming experiments at Jefferson Lab with the upgraded 12 GeV electron beam. Finally we are preparing for an experiment to scatter muons and electrons from the proton (MUSE experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland) in order to investigate the proton radius, which has puzzled scientists in recent years because of inconsistent results with different techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the scientific impact, this work will serve to train both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral researchers, in the methods of scientific research. This training in fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers in and outside of physics. Our students and post-docs have successfully moved to varied careers in medical physics, homeland security, and finance, as well as continuing in fundamental research.</AbstractNarration>
