    <AbstractNarration>This workshop will explore factors common to the mass incarceration of women and the gendered dimensions of immigrant enforcement, detention and deportation. Prior research has examined incarceration and immigration as separate legal and political issues, affecting different communities. This workshop explores similarities and differences across these two issues to assess whether a common set of factors links policies and experiences, and how a gendered lens facilitates such understanding. The workshop will be interdisciplinary, bringing together legal scholars, criminologists and other social scientists, and practitioners to examine existing research and identify new questions. The emphasis will be on the linkages between the social, historical and cultural factors that influence public policy in these areas and on intervention strategies to support women, families and communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research workshop will result in an edited volume incorporating the theoretical and empirical papers presented, and in a policy-oriented paper. In addition, the workshop will incubate two or more interdisciplinary collaborative research projects between junior and more established researchers and offer opportunities for collaboration between researchers and community organizations. A public event will close out the workshop. Legislators, state officials and grassroots leaders will be invited to the public forum.</AbstractNarration>
