    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding to partially support travel of students attending the 45th North American Power Symposium (NAPS), which will be held on the campus of Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas in September 2013. The North American Power Symposium (NAPS) is a non-profit event that is aimed primarily at student participation. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of the papers are presented by students. The symposium is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE-PES and it is expected that about 140 conference papers will be presented and become available on IEEE-Explore. NSF?s support will positively impact student participation at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: NAPS is unique in its focus on students preparing and presenting technical papers. This conference provides a unique opportunity for NSF to interact with and promote interaction among students, academia and power industry to promote and discuss NSF?s vision of technical challenges in power and energy systems, including technical, societal and economic aspects; and more broadly in cyber-physical (CPS) systems. NAPS is also a venue to an exciting student paper competition for identifying and fostering high quality research performed by students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: NAPS conferences have a history of giving students their first opportunity of research presentations. Further, NAPS encourages discussion of systematic integration of research and teaching. Based on recent history of NAPS conferences the student program has been able to attract 20% minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>
