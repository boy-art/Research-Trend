    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an unprecedented battery separator technology - alumina nanowire battery separators - to address the stringent requirements for large-sized lithium ion batteries for the coming era of electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in Hybrid EVs (PHEVs). The proposed battery separator will provide high temperature stability, long term stability and high ion conductivity, which are unachievable by the state-of-the-art commercial separators. The successful development of the proposed separator technology will result in large-sized lithium ion batteries with a much higher level of consumer safety and lifetime compared to present and even improved batteries. The successful commercialization of the proposed separator technology will assure the large scale commercial use of large-sized lithium ion batteries in EVs/PHEVs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is paramount. The global automotive battery market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% during 2012?2017 and surpass $41 billion by 2017. Lithium-ion batteries are gaining worldwide attention as a preferred battery option for transportation vehicles. Large-sized lithium ion batteries with high energy density, high power density, long-term stability and safety, sufficient power performance at a wide temperature range are highly desirable for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Battery separator is a critical component in lithium ion batteries, since it is critical for the overall safety and long term stability of large package batteries. The overall market for lithium-ion battery separators is expected to grow to $2.5 billion in 2020, mainly driven by the demand for electric vehicles. Moreover, if the high temperature stability of our flexible ceramic separator is further explored, it is possible to construct high temperature batteries in which new battery chemistry can be adopted.</AbstractNarration>
