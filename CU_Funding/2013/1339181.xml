    <AbstractNarration>SRI will investigate the potential of a computer science curriculum, Build IT that successfully encourages African American and Latina girls' interests and pursuits in computer science, to encourage these girls? educators to pursue computer science learning and careers. Preliminary data suggest that Build IT may increase IT education and career pursuits among the educators, who are primarily women of color in their 20s and 30s. SRI will conduct a mixed-methods study in both the Girls Inc. network of affiliates throughout the United States and the California School-Age Consortium (CalSAC) network of afterschool programs in California to understand (1) under what conditions do Build IT educators pursue computer science learning and careers, (2) what types of computer science learning and careers do Build IT educators indicate interest in and pursue, and (3) to what extent is there a relationship between educators' computing interests and pursuits, their implementation of Build IT, and youth outcomes for Build IT. To address these research questions, the team will conduct a study of Build IT and other STEM educators in the Girls Inc. and CalSAC networks gathering data on their STEM backgrounds, implementation practices, and their IT career plans. The team will examine the impact of the Build IT educators' IT interests and career plans on youth outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important for practitioners, researchers, and policymakers interested in encouraging underrepresented populations to pursue STEM learning and careers in general and computer science learning and careers, specifically. While there is some evidence that teaching STEM programs may encourage afterschool educators to pursue further STEM experiences, there is a gap in the research on the role that teaching such an afterschool computer science curriculum can play to activate or reactive young women from African American and Latina backgrounds in pursuing computer science and the effect that these educators? pursuits can have on girls' computer science learning and career interests. This research will inform practice and research on programmatic designs and implementation environments that encourage underrepresented populations of both learners and educators to pursue computer science. Through Girls Inc. and CalSAC, the Build IT curriculum and research findings and practices can reach hundreds of thousands of middle school girls and thousands of afterschool educators who are predominantly female and from African American and Latina backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
