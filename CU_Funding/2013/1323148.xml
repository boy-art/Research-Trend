    <AbstractNarration>The highest rates of erosion of bedrock on Earth are generally thought to occur&lt;br/&gt;in steep areas subject to the action of large rivers and glaciers. However, &lt;br/&gt;there are many deserts around the world where wind and wind-blown sand are the &lt;br/&gt;dominant agents of erosion and where even relatively flat bedrock landforms can be &lt;br/&gt;eroded as quickly as the fastest eroding rivers and glacial valleys on Earth. &lt;br/&gt;Relatively little is known about how wind and wind-blown sand erodes bedrock and&lt;br/&gt;what variables control the morphology of yardangs, the dominant landforms created&lt;br/&gt;in such areas. Wind erosion can also influence the behavior of faults and folds &lt;br/&gt;in the Earth's crust by reducing the stress caused by topography in areas of high &lt;br/&gt;erosion (i.e. on the windward side of a slipping fault or growing fold). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further global climate changes will likely lead to more desertification, making &lt;br/&gt;wind erosion and its impacts on humans (e.g. reduced air quality) even more &lt;br/&gt;important to understand and predict. This project will improve our ability to &lt;br/&gt;quantify wind erosion, a process influencing human health and land sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;The project includes field areas in southern California and the Qaidam &lt;br/&gt;Basin of the Tibetan Plateau (in collaboration with Chinese colleagues). We will combine field work, remote sensing, numerical &lt;br/&gt;modeling, and geochronology to quantify the interaction between the flow of wind and&lt;br/&gt;wind-blown sand over topography, the erosion of that topography, and the behavior&lt;br/&gt;of faults and folds in Earth's crust. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly supported by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program, Tectonics Program, and NSF's OIIA International Science and Engineering Section.</AbstractNarration>
