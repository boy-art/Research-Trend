    <AbstractNarration>This planned center site at the University of Alabama - Birmingham (UAB) for the I/UCRC for Health Organization Transformation (CHOT) intends to focus on the evaluation of health care delivery innovations, such as information technology, care coordination, and facility design strategies with the ultimate goal of generating knowledge that may result in efficient, high-quality care that is patient-centered and equitable. Our research activities align well with the proposed focus of the UAB CHOT site, and can be organized into seven domains: 1) information technology, 2) care coordination, 3) facility design, 4) efficiency, 5) quality of care, 6) patient-centeredness, and 7) equity. The new site plans to expand on CHOT's existing capacity, extend the geographic reach of the CHOT in the Southeast, and broaden the types of industry partners involved in CHOT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With health care costs in the U.S. reaching nearly 18% of GDP in 2011, and projections of this rate increasing to 20% by 2020, the need to identify ways to "bend the cost curve" has never been more critical. It is important to develop meaningful and multi-disciplinary partnerships between academic institutions and industry partner to yield innovative solutions to various issues in the U.S. health care system. They can also facilitate practice-based research related to the development and assessment of various health care delivery interventions. UAB's affiliation with the CHOT I/UCRC will facilitate and accelerate such research in our region by joining an experienced learning collaborative, and by leveraging the resources of UAB and potential industry partners. UAB's participation in the CHOT will enhance our graduate student experience in the classroom and in the field, and will provide faculty with opportunities for practice-based, multi-disciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>
