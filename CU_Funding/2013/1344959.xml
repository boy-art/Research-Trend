    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is to support participation of mathematicians based in the United States to the quarter program "Random Walks and the Asymptotic Geometry of Groups" to be held at Institut Henri Poincare (IHP) in Paris, France, from January 3rd to April 6th, 2014. &lt;br/&gt;This program is concerned with the theory of random walks on groups and its relations and interactions with combinatorial and geometric group theory. The aim of the program is to provide an introduction to this area of research and its most recent developments, to review and disseminate recent progress and to stimulate the emergence of new ideas and directions of research. Some of the activities are aimed specifically at researchers at the beginning of their career and at people who have no prior specific knowledge of this area of research. Other activities are aimed at specialists. Most of the activities will focus on recent developments and new directions of research. The program's website is available at http://www.ihp.fr/en/ceb/geowalks.</AbstractNarration>
