    <AbstractNarration>This is a 2-year postgraduate fellowship research project to study turbulence in the near-Sun plasma and its role in solar corona heating and in solar wind acceleration. The project aims both to predict the qualitative properties of the turbulent fluctuations that will be measured in situ by the upcoming ESA/ Solar Probe Plus and NASA/ Solar Orbiter missions near and within the Alfven critical point and to create a theoretical framework for the interpretation of these measurements. Utilizing the ?synthetic spacecraft data method? developed by the PI during his graduate research, together with various turbulence and coronal heating models, three specific objectives will be pursued: 1) Quantifying changes in the measured power spectra near and within the Alfvenic critical point due to the violation of Taylor's Hypothesis and using these changes to verify the presence of whistler and/or kinetic Alfven waves; 2) Compiling a set of observable signatures which can be used with in situ observations to distinguish between various coronal heating mechanisms; and 3) Using nonlinear simulations as a separate check of the validity of the synthetic data method. The work will be carried out at University of New Hampshire under the mentorship of Professor Chandran. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of turbulence in plasma heating and acceleration are fundamental plasma physics problems that are of interest to a broad scientific community working on astrophysical plasmas (e.g. accretion disks and magnetospheres of young stars), space physics (e.g. solar wind and planetary magnetospheres), and laboratory plasmas (e.g. fusion reactors). The work will be done by a recent Ph.D. graduate as his introduction into a teaching and research career in the geospace community.</AbstractNarration>
