    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign provides twelve undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in biological physics, high-energy physics, nuclear physics, acoustical physics, astrophysics and condensed matter physics. In addition to participating in research with an experienced team of mentors, the REU students will gain knowledge of and practice technical communications, research collaboration and networking, and responsible conduct of research. They are given career guidance and advice on applying for graduate school and graduate research fellowships. By the end of the program, every student will have presented the results of the work in a mid-term talk, a final talk, and a research paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics and from non-research institutions. The project is informed by an on-going evaluation and there is a plan to disseminate successful undergraduate research practices.</AbstractNarration>
