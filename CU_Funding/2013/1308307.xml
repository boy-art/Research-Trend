    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Chrys Wesdemiotis at the University of Akron and his group will develop multidimensional mass spectrometry methodologies for the microstructure characterization of synthetic polymers. Liquid chromatography and ion mobility separation will be combined with tandem mass spectrometry to characterize novel amphiphiles, hybrid materials, glycopolymers, biodegradable polymers, and self-assembled macromolecular systems. The ultimate goal is accurate identification of the corresponding compositions, connectivities, and architectures in order to ascertain the structural elements that control macroscopic properties and, thus, facilitate the design of advanced materials for specific tasks. Many synthetic polymers are engineered for biomedical applications. These materials are invisible to cells unless proteins attach to their surface. A second goal of this project is to probe if changes occur to proteins that interact with synthetic polymers and to quantify protein adhesion on polymers prepared for biomedical and clinical use. A third, related objective concerns the advancement of methods that probe the surface layer of synthetic polymers, so that alterations resulting from environmental factors or segregation phenomena can be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major motivation for the planned studies is the need for sensitive chemical analyses of the novel materials produced for industrial and clinical purposes at the University of Akron and its industrial partners in Northeast Ohio. The methods developed in this project will help chemists to design and produce better performing and commercially important materials for a variety of uses such as medical implants, drug delivery compounds, and high performance plastics. At the same time, the planned research activities will educate and train American undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, in modern materials research and mass spectrometry techniques, two areas with growing employment opportunities that are vital for the nation's technological progress.</AbstractNarration>
