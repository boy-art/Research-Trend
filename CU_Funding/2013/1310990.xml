    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Christopher Ortega of the University of Houston to conduct a research project in materials science during the summer of 2013 at Yunnan University in Kunming, Yunnan. The project title is "The Synthesis and Characterization of a Nanostructured Composite Photoanode used for Solar Assisted Hydrogen Generation." The host scientist is Dr. Zhu Liu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project works toward the synthesis of a composite photoanode consisting of a nano-mesoporous Tungsten Trioxide film, that is electrochemically coated with hematite. The nanoporous Tungsten Trioxide film provides a scaffold for the hematite resulting in a nanoporous network, with an increased surface area that allows for higher efficiency in hydrogen generation. Precise electrochemical pulse deposition is used to coat the nanoporous network of the WO3 film with a highly uniform hematite film. The use of a composite structure, alongside a nanoporous structure allows for a highly efficient photoanode, capable of generating hydrogen when exposed to solar light. This research is novel clean energy research topic since hydrogen is the required fuel for fuel cells, but the majority of hydrogen is currently generated using fossil fuels, making hydrogen fuel cells a non-fully clean energy process. By developing a renewable method of generating hydrogen, it is possible to have a completely renewable energy generation process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this project allows for both Dr. Zhu Liu and the Fellow to disseminate the results of the research at conferences and workshops in the United States and the host country. This ensures that the research impacts a wider audience in the countries that have the highest need for clean energy. The research conducted will also be shared with the Fellow's home university, through seminars and department presentations showing the benefits of international collaboration, international culture exchange, and the value of clean energy fuel synthesis.</AbstractNarration>
