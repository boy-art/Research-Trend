    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The North American Catalysis Society (NACS) meeting is the most prestigious meeting for the catalysis community outside of the International Congress on Catalysis. The NACS meeting is held each 2 years and is organized in turn by each of the Local US Catalysis Societies. The 23rd NACS meeting is being held in Louisville, KY. The meeting topics typically cover many aspects of catalysis utilizing both oral and poster presentations. Attendees can be immersed in various areas of catalysis, whether they are currently working in the area or wish to gain an understanding of catalysis work in a completely different arena. Some participants come from outside the US, thereby allowing initial contact with the global catalysis community. Prof. Gary Jacobs from the University of Kentucky is the chairman of the Kokes Award Committee which seeks funds to partially offset the costs for graduate students to participate in the NACS meeting. The support of graduate student attendees is an excellent way to allow them to begin the understanding of the diversity of work in the catalysis field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The entire meeting is an educational event for those workers in the field. This award would enable partial support of approximately 100 graduate students to attend the meeting. Many will be giving poster or even oral presentations. There will be ample contact with existing and new colleagues in catalysis. The work presented is current research at academic, industrial and national laboratories. The support of graduate student attendance has been a customary and well-placed investment from the Catalysis &amp; Biocatalysis Program of CBET/ENG in NSF.</AbstractNarration>
