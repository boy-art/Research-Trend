    <AbstractNarration>Data centers worldwide use approximately 30 billion watts of electricity&lt;br/&gt;with data centers in the United States using approximately 8 to 10&lt;br/&gt;billion watts. Power consumption of datacenter systems is expected to&lt;br/&gt;continue to grow both absolutely and as a percentage of national&lt;br/&gt;consumption. The goal of the proposed research is to develop massively&lt;br/&gt;parallel processor arrays that work in conjunction with traditional&lt;br/&gt;enterprise-class processors to compute datacenter workloads with vastly&lt;br/&gt;greater efficiency. The proposed research may lead to new applications&lt;br/&gt;and capabilities that were previously constrained by power dissipation&lt;br/&gt;or processing throughput.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project participants will propose, model, develop, and characterize&lt;br/&gt;novel fine-grain many-core architectures, VLSI chip designs, and&lt;br/&gt;application algorithms for a processor array serving as a co-processor&lt;br/&gt;or functional unit. The proposed programmable fine-grained many-core&lt;br/&gt;processor array contains no algorithm-specific hardware and is of a core&lt;br/&gt;granularity that is very lightly explored in prior work. The array will&lt;br/&gt;operate inside or near, and in co-ordination with a host&lt;br/&gt;enterprise-class processor and compute key computational kernels often&lt;br/&gt;with similar or higher performance than the host processor, but with&lt;br/&gt;orders of magnitude higher energy efficiency. During kernel computation,&lt;br/&gt;the host processor could attend to other tasks or enter a low power&lt;br/&gt;state. The targeted workloads include sorting, regular expression based&lt;br/&gt;pattern matching, encryption, data compression, video encoding and&lt;br/&gt;decoding, and other enterprise workloads of high impact that are&lt;br/&gt;discovered during the course of the research.</AbstractNarration>
