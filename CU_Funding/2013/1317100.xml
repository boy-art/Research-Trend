    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Eric G. Gharakhanian of University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) in Nomi, Ishikawa. The project title is "Development of Poly(peptide) Materials Demonstrating Thermally-Activated Shape Memory." The host scientist is Dr. Tatsuo Kaneko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops and studies naturally-derived polypeptide biomaterials which show shape memory in response to thermal stimulus. This work involves the preparation and study of poly(glutamate) materials functionalized with a photo cross-linker. These materials are being cross-linked to varying degrees and the thermo-mechanical properties of the resultant plastics are being investigated. The knowledge gained from these studies provides a guide towards the development of bio-resorbable materials with thermally stimulated shape memory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, biomaterial devices inspired by this research will help improve the well-being of individuals in all societies. This work will continue a scientific partnership with the Kaneko lab, helping maintain the U.S. scientific infrastructure through this international collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
