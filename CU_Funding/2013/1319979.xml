    <AbstractNarration>Modern imaging devices, sensors, data acquisition systems allow to gather data with unprecedented speed and&lt;br/&gt;accuracy. Most of the times, however, we are not interested in accumulating data per se, but rather to&lt;br/&gt;uncover some hidden patterns in the data. For instance, given a large network, we might want to discover &lt;br/&gt;a small subset of notes that are tightly connected to each other. Such highly connected substructures&lt;br/&gt;are of interest in biological datasets, but also in social network analysis, and in signal processing. &lt;br/&gt;Finding such patterns requires highly efficient algorithms that can process large amount of data and&lt;br/&gt;uncover tenuous statistical signatures. The investigators develop new algorithms that simultaneously optimize&lt;br/&gt;both metrics: statistical efficiency and computational efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider in particular the problem of finding an anomalous submatrix in a large data matrix with independent &lt;br/&gt;random entries. If the anomalous submatrix has entries with a different distribution, this can be done via &lt;br/&gt;principal component analysis, as long as the submatrix has dimensions of the order of the square root of&lt;br/&gt;the ambient dimensions. The investigators introduce a class of first order methods with linear complexity,&lt;br/&gt;and determine the optimal algorithm within this class. This appears to provably outperform existing approaches. &lt;br/&gt;The same framework is generalized to several other classes of high-dimensional estimation problems. &lt;br/&gt;Optimal iterative procedures are developed under strict computational constraints.</AbstractNarration>
