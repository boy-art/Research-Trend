    <AbstractNarration>This project is supporting cohorts of upper division undergraduates at Eastern Washington University (EWU) who demonstrate academic potential, motivation for STEM, and financial need. Guiding objectives are: 1) to improve educational opportunities in the STEM disciplines by annually awarding scholarships to nine students; 2) to increase degree achievement by providing increased faculty mentoring and access to specialized student support services; 3) to build capacity in institutional practices that increase the retention of STEM students and of first generation and/or underrepresented minority students; and 4) to create and maintain community partnerships that increase EWU's visibility and generate training and employment opportunities for the students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notable project implementation components include mentoring, financial support, and enrichment activities designed to increase academic integration, motivation, identification with STEM, and retention to graduation. Students are recruited from three majors: Biology, Biochemistry, and Environmental Science which allows for: (1) an exploration of the interdisciplinary nature of STEM on the part of the cohort of scholarship recipients and (2) better matching of regional workforce needs with agency/industry partners. Encouragement of diversity in the STEM workforce is promoted through a combined incentive and support program to help recruit students, many of whom are first-generation college attendees and/or members of underrepresented groups in STEM. Finally, the project offers multiple mentoring experiences through cohort-building enrichment activities that include professional development, career planning, information literacy and civic engagement.</AbstractNarration>
