    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on development of a scalable and economical process for production of non-precious metal electro-catalysts, and electrodes based on these materials. The reliance on precious electrode catalysts currently hinders broader commercialization of a number of promising technologies. The materials being developed in this project have unique properties compared to currently available electrode materials, and can be used for a number of important applications, including batteries, fuel cells, and industrial electrolysis. In this project, pH Matter, LLC will develop a scalable process using low cost starting materials for the production of the non-precious metal electro-catalysts, and develop electrodes based on these materials for early adopter applications. The project will result in commercial product offerings from pH Matter that will enable higher-performing electrochemical cells for customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is related to a number of electrochemical applications, including batteries, fuel cells, and next-generation electrolysis processes. The strongest value proposition of pH Matter?s material is for replacement of precious metal electrodes currently required in many of these applications. Developing an alternative to precious metal electrodes will enable introduction of high performance and low-cost primary and secondary metal batteries. Applications for these batteries could range from portable electronics to grid load leveling. Reducing the cost of fuel cells by replacement of the precious metal cathode would enable wider adoption for fleet vehicles and possibly automotive applications. Further, next-generation electrolysis processes, such as chlorine synthesis with an oxygen depolarized cathode, could improve efficiency by 30% for the largest source of industrial electricity consumption. Consequently, the materials being developed on this project have broad applicability that will promote energy efficiency and alternative energy use.</AbstractNarration>
