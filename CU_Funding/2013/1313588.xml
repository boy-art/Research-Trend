    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide funding to support four equipment-based upgrades at the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) laboratory. The purpose of these requests is to support the research and educational role of the laboratory, as well as its service to other users. The Arizona AMS laboratory functions as a service, research and educational laboratory. A key component is providing educational opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students from around the country to learn AMS techniques. Many students who have benefited from these programs have gone on to start their own research with applications in AMS. The lab also provides key support to users, including interpretation and understanding of their results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support equipment and related support for four majors areas of study: low-voltage AMS, Iodine-129 measurements, sample automation and dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) in groundwaters. These areas all represent areas of emphasis that have been highlighted at recent AMS and Radiocarbon conferences. The development of AMS capabilities at lower energies can lead to development of smaller machines or new experimental approaches, as has already been demonstrated. Sample automation is vital for more rapid sample preparation, and the improvements to 129I, DIC and DOC measurement capability will directly impact Arizona's ability to serve the needs of our own research, and those of our users.</AbstractNarration>
