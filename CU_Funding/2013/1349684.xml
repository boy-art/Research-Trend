    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Erica Emry has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and to broaden participation of underrepresented minorities in the Earth Sciences while at The Pennsylvania State University and The University of Rhode Island. She will investigate the structure of the upper mantle beneath Africa using new full-wave seismic tomography techniques on ambient noise and earthquake data. She will address questions of African mantle dynamics and their impact on surface processes by creating a synoptic map of the upper mantle shear velocities throughout southern Africa, focusing on the East African Rift system (EARS) and the Archean cratons. In particular, she will focus on imaging three unresolved regions in the African mantle and answering the following questions that will help to elucidate the relationships between mantle flow, cratonic lithosphere and surface processes: 1) What is the depth and lateral extent of the Congo craton? 2) Are the East African and Ethiopian low velocity zones connected at the Turkana Depression? 3) What is the depth and lateral extent of the Afar hotspot, and are the slowest upper mantle anomalies associated with the Afar hotspot located beneath the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) or the Afar Depression? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project will contribute to the larger African geology and tectonics community and current research initiatives such as the NSF GeoPRISMs Rift Initiation and Evolution (RIE) program. The finalized results of upper mantle structure beneath southern Africa will be made freely available online for use in other geophysics and earth science research (http://www.iris.edu/dms/products/emc/). As part of this proposal, Dr. Emry will expand upon the Africa Array diversity program, acting as primary instructor for the summer geophysics field course in 2014 and 2015. This course run by Penn State and the University of Witwatersrand brings undergraduate students from minority-serving institutions to Penn State and South Africa to learn geophysical field techniques and South African geology. In addition to the field course, she will continue to mentor students from the Africa Array diversity program on a monthly basis during online webinars, by introducing them to new research, and by discussing careers in the geosciences. Furthermore, during each school year, she will advise students from the Africa Array diversity program who are interested in completing a senior thesis focused on African tectonics or seismology.</AbstractNarration>
