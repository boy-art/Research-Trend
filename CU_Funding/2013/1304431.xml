    <AbstractNarration>This project is focusing on the issue of declining student enrollment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields by offering a retooled Applied Associate of Science (AAS) Engineering Technology (ET) degree to meet the needs of Iowa employers for highly qualified ET workers. It is also developing a comprehensive marketing and recruitment plan to attract students to the program and inform them about ET career and educational pathways. Ultimately, the program is increasing the quality and availability of individuals in Iowa pursuing technology related careers, providing clearly articulated educational pathways, and filling a gap in the needs of the business community for highly qualified ET employees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The AAS curriculum is being developed to align with the standards of the Accrediting Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). This accreditation is offering students an improved chance of finding employment or of pursuing a baccalaureate degree through an articulation agreement with a partner institution. Implementation of an ABET-accredited curriculum is a unique approach to attracting more individuals, including those from underrepresented groups, into technology related fields of study since ABET accreditation provides assurance that a college program meets the quality standards established by the profession. It also adds a level of confidence to participants that the program contains the foundation and skills directly aligned with the intended career. A critical ABET component is the continuous improvement aspect of education, ensuring that the program exercises a high degree of self-analysis as to content and quality. The project also includes outreach efforts to high school students and their parents that are designed to provide information on the careers available in ET and the benefits of pursuing an educational path in this field. High school teachers and counselors are receiving similar information along with professional development opportunities. Formative and summative evaluations are assisting in determining the impact of the retooled curriculum and its implementation at the high school level, along with additional activities provided along the career and educational pathways pursued by program participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is increasing recruitment, completion, and retention of ET students through implementation of an industrially-relevant and rigorous program of study and thereby increasing the skilled workforce in Iowa. Employers across the state have indicated an unmet need for qualified technology employees and studies indicate an overall lack of the middle-skill employees that are critical to the manufacturing sector in the state. This project is serving as a model for providing ET instruction both at the community college level and through high school Career Academies, thus fostering an interest among high school students as they decide upon their future educational plans. The materials developed during this project, including the AAS and summer camp curricula, marketing materials, and professional development materials, are being made available to institutions across the state and the nation with the intent that the information could be utilized and/or modified asynchronously and independently. Articulation agreements that are being developed with four-year institutions in Iowa are applicable to similar technology programs at community colleges throughout the state.</AbstractNarration>
