    <AbstractNarration>This project will support approximately 10-15 U.S.-based graduate students to attend the 11th USENIX Symposium on File and Storage Technology (FAST), which is scheduled to take place February 12-15, 2013. FAST is a leading forum for innovative research in storage systems, bringing together researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia. Topics include reliability, performance, mobility, power management, measurement, and other areas germane to file and storage systems. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work.</AbstractNarration>
