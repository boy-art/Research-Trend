    <AbstractNarration>Defining the mechanism that regulates the insertion of the voltage-dependent potassium channel 1.1 into the surface membrane of neuronal dendrites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit 1.1 on the cell membrane tightly regulates a neuron's resting state and determines how a neuron responds to its environment accordingly. In the dendrites of neurons, voltage-dependent potassium channels that contain the 1.1 subunit influence changes in synapses that are considered to reflect the different types of learning or formation of memories. This research aims to identify the molecular mechanism governing the insertion of the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit 1.1 into the surface membrane of dendrites. The proposed study will examine how the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit 1.2 promotes the surface expression of subunit 1.1. Furthermore, this research will investigate the mechanism by which the suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin, a protein that positively regulates translation, leads to the protein synthesis of the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit 1.2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discoveries from this study will expand the current understanding on the mechanisms that influence learning and memory at the molecular level. Furthermore, findings from this investigation will provide a holistic characterization on how the protein-the mammalian target of rapamycin-regulates the production of other proteins. Data generated from this project will be used to gain a faculty position and establish a laboratory at a university that will further elucidate the molecular events that regulate learning and memory, and support the education and research training of underrepresented populations in science.</AbstractNarration>
