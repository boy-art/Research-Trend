    <AbstractNarration>Mobility models are an indispensable tool in the design, testing, and evaluation of wireless networks and their protocols. It is now widely recognized that mobility models should account for both geographical features of the region being studied as well as the social relations and interactions among users. This project aims to develop a unified yet flexible mobility modeling framework that combines both social and geography factors that influence how users move, and to develop formal statistical learning methods to calibrate mobility models using real mobility data. Additionally, an important deliverable of the project is to develop software tools that implement our models and can be used by researchers and practitioners to evaluate mobile systems and protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to have significant impact on the way network researchers and practitioners design, test, and evaluate mobile networks and their protocols. The project also has an important educational component: students working on this research are expected to develop a crosscutting research and academic and background. Research results from this project will be disseminated through project Web site, and technical papers published in conferences and journals. The mobility generation software tool will also be freely available through the project's Web site.</AbstractNarration>
