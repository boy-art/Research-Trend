    <AbstractNarration>Under the guidance of Dr. Cynthia Robin, Kristin Landau will carry out an archaeological mapping and excavation project at the ancient city of Cop치n, located in the Maya area of western Honduras. Cop치n was one of the most important polities during the Classic period (AD 400-900), and today is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The site is unique for its two generations of intensive research and hieroglyphic decipherment within the city center, which has revealed a wealth of information relating to political events. However, archaeologists understand much less about everyday life for the majority of people and how they related to central administration. Landau's research investigates the full history of the "San Lucas" neighborhood of Cop치n to determine if and how local residents were affected by the political events discussed in the hieroglyphs at the city center. This goal will be achieved by re-mapping the neighborhood from a local -not city-wide - perspective, targeted excavations of select buildings, and new and exciting lab methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring the dynamic relationship between a city's central administration and its component neighborhoods improves knowledge of how cities work. Instead of following previous research that draws stark distinction between states that are either centralized or decentralized, this project argues that centralization fluctuates over time; determining when, how, and why centralization fluctuates will lead to better understandings of cities' and states' past and present. Additionally, the archaeology of neighborhoods is a newly emerging research focus that emphasizes both a specific geographic area, and daily social interaction on a local level. Despite the previous identification of distinct subsections of Cop치n settlement, no archaeological excavation of a full neighborhood has ever been conducted. Detailed re-mapping of San Lucas, targeted digging of excavation pits to reveal ancient households, and dating of building phases and special features will allow the investigators to understand in depth the history of one neighborhood, and relate it to major political events at the city center. Bayesian statistical analysis will increase the accuracy of traditional radiocarbon dating; microartifact analysis will point to possible crafting activities; a portable x-ray florescence will indicate the geological origin of craft materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this project seeks to improve the relationship between modern communities and archaeological research through close involvement with Honduran students. Project members have already begun to teach a formal course on anthropological theory and method at the high school located near the excavation site. These current classroom sessions will be complemented by the students' participation in excavation and lab analysis once the archaeological project commences. Students will receive official recognition and support from the Honduran government, motivating them to complete school, and possibly attend the first-ever anthropology program at the national university. The results of the academic research and community activism will be disseminated through public talks, formal conferences, and peer-reviewed publications, in English and Spanish in the US and Honduras.</AbstractNarration>
