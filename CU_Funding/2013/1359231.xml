    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) site led by Professors Charles M. Garner, Patrick J. Farmer, and Kevin Klausmeyer all at Baylor University. In this project, the Site's goal will be to enhance opportunities for underrepresented students to obtain the quality research experience that will inspire their development as science professionals. A vital function of the REU program is to cultivate a passion for science in the students, which will lead to long and productive professional careers. The REU program is designed to reach under-served students from smaller colleges who lack access to advanced instrumentation and have limited research opportunities. Through the Advanced Instrumentation Workshops, the Baylor chemistry department has developed extensive contacts with small colleges and universities in a five-state region and beyond. These contacts have resulted in the participation of more than 160 undergraduates and 48 faculty members from a wide variety of institutions including several historically black colleges and many with significant Hispanic populations. A goal of the proposed REU is to increase the level of minority and female participation above previous programs at Baylor, which averaged 58% female and 30% minority. An equal number of Baylor undergraduate students, funded by faculty grants, will be able to participate full-time in the program along with the NSF-funded students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide summer research experiences in Baylor's Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry department for undergraduates from small colleges and universities with limited research opportunities. The summer program includes hands-on workshops on some of the most commonly used instruments in chemical research. The broader significance of this award is that deliberate exposure to instrumentation in a research context will provide students with a deeper understanding scientific methods and practices, and open their eyes to new career paths. The students will work in active research labs not only with graduate students and PhD researchers in the Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry department, but also in the Environmental Science, Geology, and Physics departments. In addition to the instrumentation workshops, the 10-week program is structured to include weekly lunchtime seminars, safety and ethics training, career perspectives, a field trip to chemically-relevant facilities, a concluding poster session where each student presents their research, and a written final report.</AbstractNarration>
