    <AbstractNarration>1351302&lt;br/&gt;Prescher, Jennifer &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imaging technologies have revolutionized our understanding of cancer progression by enabling researchers to 'look' into cells and tissues and visualize biological features in real time. While powerful, current imaging techniques are restricted in their ability to analyze cell movements and interactions over large time and length scales?processes crucial to metastatic disease. This NSF-CAREER application proposes the development of new imaging probes for visualizing tumor spread in vivo. The PI and her trainees will generate bioluminescent tools that produce light only when two distinct cell types come into close proximity (e.g., when tumor cells infiltrate distant tissues). Collectively, these tools will enable global surveys of cancer spread and will provide some of the first noninvasive, macroscopic views of metastases in preclinical models. The imaging probes will also be implemented in two outreach activities, including a luminescence screening laboratory (for undergraduates) and imaging demonstrations (for middle school students). The PI's outreach program also includes an innovative seminar series to introduce graduate students to a diverse set of scientific careers and highlight the impacts of scientific professions in society at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award will result in a number of broader impacts. First, the proposed imaging tools will enable the direct interrogation of metastatic cancer cells not currently possible with existing toolsets. Such studies will provide macroscopic images of tumor spread and may fundamentally change existing views on malignancy. Second, the proposed tools will likely inspire new discoveries in diverse areas of science, as imaging technologies are widely used in materials research, neurobiology, and numerous other fields. Third, the imaging probes will be incorporated into a variety of educational outreach programs that will impact large numbers of students. These students will learn about the challenges and excitement associated with imaging and research in general. Last, the proposed outreach work will expose students from diverse backgrounds to the impacts of science in society by highlighting unique career opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
