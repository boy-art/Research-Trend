    <AbstractNarration>The ``Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems workshop" is to be held at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on March 21-24 2013. It will highlight recent developments in ergodic theory and dynamical systems. The conference focuses on the important theme of smooth dynamical systems. The main talk, given by the colloquium speaker will address the question of genericity of the``ergodic" assumption among classes of continuous dynamical systems. Several of the topics covered are central in extremely active areas of current research in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics conference will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty. Young researchers are given ample opportunities to speak, to talk and to participate in the conference activities. At the same time this conference serves as a platform to recruit graduate students from developing countries like Africa to graduates program at US-based academic institutions. The conference aims at improving the participation of women (the colloquium speaker is a woman) and, more generally, of members of under-represented groups. Collaborations between participants are encouraged, and it is anticipated that the resulting research papers will be published in a proceedings volume.</AbstractNarration>
