    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to develop new electrospinning technologies and methodologies to create cost efficient electrospinning materials as cell culture platforms. Standard cell culture platforms are disposable, plastic dishes or wellplates with tightly controlled properties to ensure reproducible cell culture conditions. However, these platforms lack topographical, physical structures that are present within the native tissue microenvironment, limiting their relevance to clinical applications. The research team strives to attenuate the disparity between cell culture platforms and biological tissues by use of electrospun fiber scaffolds. These scaffolds are composed of polymeric fibers only two microns or less in diameter. Cells from all tissues of the body readily recognize the fibrous scaffold and utilize its structure for attachment, migration, and directed elongation, which produces morphologies more similar to those found in native tissues than standard culture platforms achieve. Electrospun fibers are commonly fabricated for intra-laboratory use, but lack the potential for widespread dissemination due to an inefficient fabrication process. Production is labor intensive and requires a skilled technician for fabrication and characterization. The goal for this proposal is to automate the manufacturing process and scale up production while retaining tight control over the fiber properties in order to commercialize electrospun fiber scaffolds as a consumable research tool. Implementing computer-aided manufacturing systems will provide the necessary precision and control for fabrication of these microscale-featured scaffolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current paradigm for development of pharmacological therapies to any particular disease begins in the basic science laboratory where chemical compounds are screened against cell cultures for a desired effect. This screening process is a prelude to rodent studies that test safety and efficacy, which gives way to more complex animal models before human clinical trials. Unfortunately, the number of successful outcomes from this process is quite low, it is costly, and there are countless incidences of unanticipated side effects even after reaching the marketplace. The proposal described herein is set to initiate transformation of this flawed system. Electrospun fiber culture scaffolds emulate tissue architecture in vitro, providing more sophisticated cell culture data to enhance the screening process in the earliest stages. The role of the fibers is not limited to only a research tool, but they can also serve as the therapy itself given their unique physical properties and controlled compound delivery capabilities. Providing researchers with more information earlier can also lead to a reduction in animal testing, which reduces ethical concerns and minimizes product overhead.</AbstractNarration>
