    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop methods for modeling, estimation, and prediction of wireless networks in real time. The modeling approach generalizes to diverse propagation environments including "urban canyons", and directly addresses issues such as the random and ever changing interference effects and noise sources caused by the transmitter population. The research will result in general methods that will improve communication channel utilization and thereby performance of various wireless networked system applications. Deliverable includes fundamental algorithms, modeling and analysis tools, demonstration and validation via simulation and hardware implementation, documentation of research results, and engineering student education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, particular benefits of this research will accrue to networked control systems, such as mobile sensor networks, unmanned vehicles, remote surgery, haptics collaboration, health monitoring, agricultural areas/farms, home networking, and wireless networks multimedia applications. For example, the economically efficient delivery of highly reliable electric power is increasingly dependent on networked SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System) and distributed control systems operating over commercially available, and frequently internet protocol (IP) based communication technologies. The results will be disseminated using different platforms to allow the creation of commercial software and hardware (transceivers) with increased performance, reliability, and reduced wiring costs. The educational plan places a particular emphasis upon the cultivation of a diverse student population and inclusion of under-represented minorities, by utilizing student and mentor teams, incorporating graduate and undergraduate students, and focusing upon project-oriented integrated systems design. A partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory will provide realistic data sets and applications, and opportunities for direct feedback from practitioners to the students.</AbstractNarration>
