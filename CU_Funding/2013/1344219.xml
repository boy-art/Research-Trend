    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Biophotonics (7236)and Biomedical Engineering (5345) programs in the CBET Division in the Directorate for Engineering; the Robust Intelligence (7495) program in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering; and the the Organization (7712) program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Directorate for Biology and the Instrumentation and Instrument Development (1108) program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure, also in the Directorate for Biology. Emerging Frontiers (7275) money was provided for the Organization and Instrumentation and Instrument Development programs by the Directorate for Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to optically image real-time physiological processes in living systems is of central importance for understanding how biological systems compute and function. In order to enable the imaging of deep, arbitrary-scale tissues, the PI proposes to address one of the fundamental limitations in live tissue imaging: the scattering of light by live tissues. Much work has been devoted to adaptive optics using conventional off-the-shelf spatial light modulators, interferometers, cameras, and other hardware. Here the PI proposes to create new technologies for adaptive optics based instead upon nanotechnology, which can help correct optical imaging for the scattering properties of living tissues. The project goal is nothing less than that of making real-time physiological processes visible throughout live tissues and organs, important for understanding how biological computations occur. The impact will be large for any field where understanding complex 3-D systems is key - for the study of live organs such as heart and brain, for the immune system, for the study of metabolism, for the study of development and aging, and for cancer biology. &lt;br/&gt;They will distribute all tools as freely as possible, and pursue distribution mechanisms to maximize the availability of tools, at cost whenever possible. The proposed innovations will also benefit the field of optogenetic control of complex systems. These innovations will also greatly help with teaching of biology and medicine at all levels of education, since the ability to visualize things is powerful in education; we will incorporate these tools into teaching both at MIT and elsewhere, engaging scientists-in-training, as well as the public. Through both direct impact of tool usage, as well as via teaching, they anticipate that these proposed technologies will result in a more scientifically literate workforce. they also anticipate commercial impact, in the creation of new methods of diagnostics and medicine. The ability to hunt down better disease mechanisms, or mechanisms of disease treatment, may accelerate the development of new drugs and therapies. Some of the technologies here proposed could also lead to new companies, or new products, thus contributing to economic development, as well as helping with dissemination of the tools.</AbstractNarration>
