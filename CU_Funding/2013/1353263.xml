    <AbstractNarration>How does the brain decide when it is time to work to obtain food or put its effort into finding a mate? What changes in the brain to assign priorities to specific rewards depending on the internal state of the animal? In these experiments, the investigators will study how the hormone, estradiol, acts in the brain of the female rat to decrease food intake and the motivation for food, while enhancing reproductive motivation. The investigators will study the chemistry of the brain as it responds to the presentation of a cue that has been previously paired with a reward. These studies will investigate how changes in the neurotransmitter, dopamine, is affected by reward-related cues under different hormonal states. These results will enhance the understanding of the role of hormones to influence motivation and decision making processes, and will contribute to the understanding of neuroplasticity in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the female rat, estradiol decreases food intake and the motivation for food while enhancing female reproductive motivation. Further, dopamine (DA) increases in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) upon the presentation of a cue that has been previously paired with a reward, and NAc DA is implicated in attribution of incentive salience for that reward. How DA signaling is affected by reward-related cues under different hormonal states, and the mechanism through which estradiol affects the incentive salience of these cues, is critically important to our understanding of motivation in the female rat. Experiments will use fast scan cyclic voltammetry to measure spontaneous DA release in the core and shell of the NAc during responding for a mate or food under different hormone conditions, using our novel paradigm to quantify female reproductive motivation. The role of DA in mediating the switch from choosing food to choosing a mate in the female will be determined. Graduate students and undergraduates will be involved in these studies. Findings will be disseminated through scientific publications as well as presentations at conferences at the local and national level. Specific activities for students in the laboratory included pre/post assessment of laboratory skills and development of a BrainsRule! presentation to local and Detroit middle school students about the neural mechanisms of motivation and choice.</AbstractNarration>
