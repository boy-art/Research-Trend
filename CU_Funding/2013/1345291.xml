    <AbstractNarration>Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) are critically important in maintaining a healthy pipeline of domestic graduate students in computer science and related fields. These early research experiences are often formative for their participants, giving them both an understanding of the research enterprise and the confidence required to consider a research career. In addition, REUs provide valuable skills and long-term mentoring relationships that are likely to contribute to personal satisfaction and success in graduate school. The current demand for REU opportunities exceeds the supply. The goal of this proposal is to increase the supply of REU opportunities by offering encouragement, resources, and support to research-active faculty members. This award will fund four short workshops on undergraduate research at major research conferences over the next two years. The conferences will be chosen to represent a broad cross section of areas covered by the CISE Directorate.</AbstractNarration>
