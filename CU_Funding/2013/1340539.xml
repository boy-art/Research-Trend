    <AbstractNarration>This is to support the Graduate Climate Conference (GCC) to be held at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, November 1-3, 2013. The goal of the GCC is to provide a discussion forum for graduate students undertaking research on climate and climate change in an array of disciplines, including atmospheric, biological, earth and ocean sciences. Each year participants share new techniques and avenues of research, discuss recent findings and their implications, and consider the major questions in the future of climate research. The format is designed to encourage new climate scientists to become acquainted with the details of diverse areas of climate research and to place their own research in the broader context of the climate science community. This opportunity allows graduate students to familiarize themselves with the breadth of climate science as well as the enormous range of tools available to help answer complex questions. This opportunity allows graduate students to familiarize themselves with the breadth of climate science as well as the enormous range of tools available to help answer complex questions. Approximately 90 graduate students selected through a competitive process, will attend the GCC. Applications from mathematics and physics departments, with the goal of stimulating an interest in climate science problems in students who may not have considered this field before.</AbstractNarration>
