    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Andrew Ronald Friedman of the University of California, Berkeley to conduct a research project in Geoscience during the summer of 2013 at the Research Center for Environmental Changes, Academia Sinica, in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "Variability of the Hemispheric Temperature Contrast." The host scientist is Dr. Shih-Yu Lee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project investigates the variability of the temperature contrast between the northern and southern hemispheres and its relationship with tropical rainfall. The project explores how the temperature contrast has varied over the twentieth century in response to the different climate forcings between the northern and southern hemispheres, as well as other factors. It investigates temperature contrast variations on interannual timescales, as well as an abrupt climate event: a sharp decrease in the north-south hemispheric temperature difference around 1970. A project aim is to attribute these changes to climate forcing factors by comparing the spatio-temporal signatures of historical and specific-forcing global climate model runs with observations. Another goal is to quantify the impacts of the temperature contrast on shifts in the latitude of the tropical rainfall bands over the twentieth century and in global climate model simulations of twenty-first century climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language of Taiwan. The project will foster fruitful collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, and the Academia Sinica, Taipei. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the research project aims to develop insight into twentieth-century and projected future climate change at hemispheric and regional scales. In particular, a goal is to develop understanding of shifts in tropical rainfall that may affect water resources and agriculture in marginal regions. The Fellow plans to communicate the project results to climate impacts research community and make the findings publicly available online.</AbstractNarration>
