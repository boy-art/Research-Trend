    <AbstractNarration>This award will support an NSF-CBMS regional conference to be held at Oklahoma State University in the summer of 2014 on the regularity problem for partial differential equations modeling fluids and geophysical fluids. The principal speaker of this conference is Professor Peter Constantin, William R. Kenan Jr. Professor and Director of the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University. He will deliver ten lectures during this five-day conference. His lectures will cover some of the most recent advances on the regularity problem and associated issues concerning the surface quasi-geostrophic equation, the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, the Boussinesq system, and other related equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF-CBMS conference will reflect the distinguishing features of the NSF-CBMS conference series: focus on a single important and timely area of research by a leading practitioner, published monograph for a wider audience, and continued effect and local stimulation through regional emphasis. The lectures of this conference will present the major ideas and most recent progress in a field with some very exciting new developments, and will help advance knowledge and chart future directions. Besides, this conference will have broad impacts. Around 30 participants will be invited and special efforts will be made to involve, support, and encourage the participation of junior mathematicians and researchers from under-represented groups. A monograph based on the lectures will be published and is expected to reach a much wider audience.</AbstractNarration>
