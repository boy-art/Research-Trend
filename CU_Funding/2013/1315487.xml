    <AbstractNarration>The innovation of this SBIR project includes effective and efficient big data analytics and mining techniques to extract social and people related information from massive amount of Internet data. The advanced analysis algorithms in name dis-ambiguity, connection inference, information categorization, etc. can quickly capture and analyze people related information in real time to help organizations to establish, strengthen and accelerate their customer relationships and facilitate business deals. The tool extracts and infers information from a wide spectrum of data from the whole Internet to complement the limited and subjective data volunteered by users themselves in social network websites like Linkedin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact includes enabling business people save valuable time in researching new prospects and identifying the best ways to connect with people, and ultimately close more deals by better understanding their prospects in less time. In other words, it simplifies business functions such as sales, recruiting, etc to be more efficient and effective.</AbstractNarration>
