    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Kenneth Gene Yancey of Cornell University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at The National University of Singapore in Singapore. The project title is "Simultaneous Detection of Cancer and TB using DNA-based Nanobarcodes in a Portable Device for In-home Diagnostics." The host scientist is Dr. Jackie Ying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year, the World Health Organization reports that 1 in 4 people in the United States will die of cancer and that one third of the world population has tuberculosis (TB). Early detection reduces the incidence and fatal potential of cancer and highly transmittable diseases like TB. To address this, we are developing tree-like DNA nanobarcodes which use a unique ratio of fluorescent tags to detect multiple disease simultaneously. Already these barcodes are demonstrating multiplexed attomole detection using the specificity of DNA hybridization and the sensitivity of fluorescence. In the course of this EAPSI project, this system is being improved by applying it to real DNA samples and integrating it in a microfluidic device for the detection of disease anywhere in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this EAPSI project is not only potentially developing better methods for the DNA-based detection of new diseases, but also promoting outreach to students of all ages and disciplines. Several undergraduate students are involved with this project and results will be disseminate using a series of Youtube videos and apps designed to engage the community. The host location is ideal for accomplishing EAPSI's goal of fostering international exposure of U.S. graduate students due to the NUS' highly collaborative environment consisting of numerous academic, industrial and clinical collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
