    <AbstractNarration>Vast effort and resources are spent to control invasive plants. It is typically assumed that once these resources are spent and the invader is successfully removed, the impact of that species on the community is also eliminated. However, invasive species may change the environment in ways that persist long after the species itself is gone. This is called a legacy effect. This project will examine the legacy of a highly successful invasive shrub in the Pacific Northwest, Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), that invades forest clearcuts and inhibits forest regeneration efforts. Scotch broom leaves a complicated legacy after its removal, primarily due to its ability to fix nitrogen: plant material entering the soil contains both nitrogen and toxic defense compounds. This legacy of complex soil chemistry changes can then directly impact the survival and growth of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), the dominant native tree that is economically important in this region. Further, this legacy could indirectly impact Douglas-fir by changing the soil biota closely associated with both growth and disease of Douglas-fir trees. This project will take an integrated, field-based approach to simultaneously quantify the Scotch broom legacy and its interactive effects on soil biota and Douglas-fir. The project will focus on beneficial soil organisms, called mycorrhizal fungi, which are suppressed in Scotch broom-invaded soils. The project will also examine how the suppression of these beneficial fungi may inadvertently increase soil-borne tree diseases, the spread of which could further thwart Douglas-fir restoration. Most importantly, this project will examine these dynamics in the context of time, asking: After invasion, do soil chemistry and soil biota experience rapid shifts or do changes accumulate slowly over time? How reversible are these changes? If soil-borne fungi have long-lived spores and can disperse long distances, do these traits help decrease the amount of time an invader's legacy persists, and thus contribute to the recovery of ecosystems? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has important implications for improving forestry practices in the Pacific Northwest, where Scotch broom invasion causes major economic losses in the forestry industry. The results will enhance the restoration potential of Douglas-fir, a species that provides products from paper to Christmas trees and is the focus of an economically and culturally important industry. The project integrates research with education and training of undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. Additionally, the project has a strong outreach component involving foresters and land managers in the Pacific Northwest. The principal investigators will organize annual meetings with private and public stakeholders to share information in a collaborative environment, fostering discussions about what efforts have been made, what has worked and what has not.</AbstractNarration>
