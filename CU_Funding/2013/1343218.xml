    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating basic research in glycoscience to fill a technology gap in the field of rapid detection kits for infectious agents. The translated science has the following unique features: The small molecules are sensitive, selective, and robust, easy to produce in large quantities with no lot-to-lot variation, easy conjugation to different sensor surfaces, can be used directly as recognition molecules in bio-sensing applications or can be used in combination with existing technologies. These features provide rapid test kits that will have extended shelf life without the requirement of refrigeration and therefore can be used in a variety of settings including low resource areas, can be used by untrained personnel, and are inexpensive when compared to the leading competing antibody or nucleic acid based technology in this market space. The project accomplishes its objectives by developing and integrating glycoconjugates in a rapid diagnostic test resulting in a proof-of-concept prototype for select infectious agents. The partnership engages industrial partners to provide guidance in the biosensor marketplace as the partners are actively involved in the research and development of rapid diagnostics and other development aspects such as optimization, testing, product positioning, etc. as they pertain to the potential to translate the science/technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential economic impact of this project is expected to be very significant in the next five to six years as the market for point of care diagnostics is estimated to be over twenty billion dollars. This novel technology can overcome some of the problems associated with current rapid test kits, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this market space. The societal impact, long term, will be decreased morbidity and mortality as early diagnosis is key to selecting appropriate countermeasures to control and minimize the impact of harmful toxins and pathogens.</AbstractNarration>
