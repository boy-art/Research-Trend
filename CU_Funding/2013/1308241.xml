    <AbstractNarration>The award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in the "Computational Methods and Function Theory Conference, 2013" that will be held June 10-14, 2013, at Shantou University in Shantou, Guangdong, China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event, which is the seventh in a series of quadrennial international meetings devoted to the theme of interactions between complex analysis and scientific computing, will host a formal delegation of thirteen individuals from the U.S. The delegation will comprise ten junior mathematicians (i.e., recent Ph.D.'s and graduate students) and three plenary speakers (Olga Holtz, Don Marshall, Joel Shapiro). Function theory, as one of the fundamental disciplines of mathematics, has widespread applications in many areas of the sciences and technology. Its methodology, for example, is a fundamental tool in developing computer algorithms for problems in systems theory and control. Conversely, some of the basic research problems in function theory have recently become more manageable through the use of the vast power modern computers provide. Thus there is a synergistic relationship between function theory and computational methods that greatly benefits both areas and that this conference will serve to highlight. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
