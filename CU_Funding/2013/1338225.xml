    <AbstractNarration>This award, administered by Prof. Michael Haley of the University of Oregon, will support a newly established Gordon Research Seminar (GRS; conference title: Physical Organic Chemistry--Methodology, Scope and Defining New Frontiers) in Summer 2013. This event brings together young scientists working in areas ranging from mechanistic organic, bio-organic and physical chemistry to theoretical, macromolecular and materials chemistry to discuss, communicate and learn about new research in these fields. Their attendance will be complemented by the involvement of established senior scientists who can discuss the latest developments in the field and provide an exchange of ideas between junior and senior investigators. The attendees will also participate in a tandem conference, the Gordon Research Conference on Physical Organic Chemistry, which encompasses areas ranging from synthetic and mechanistic organic chemistry, including reactive intermediates, computational chemistry, spectroscopy and photochemistry, to advanced functional materials and supramolecular chemistry as well as chemical processes in biological systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physical organic chemistry is broadly defined and of fundamental importance for the development of interdisciplinary areas that link together chemical synthesis, biological and material sciences with theoretical and physical chemistry. Participation in two related conferences on analogous topics will help "jump start" the careers of young investigators on the threshold of their careers.</AbstractNarration>
