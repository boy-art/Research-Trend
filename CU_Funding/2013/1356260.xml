    <AbstractNarration>Computer science and biology have enjoyed a long and fruitful relationship for decades. Biologists rely on computational methods to analyze and integrate large data sets, while several computational methods were inspired by the high-level design principles of biological systems. Several common aspects and goals of computational and biological systems suggest that we can use one as a source for studies of the other and vice versa. With recent advances in our ability to generate and analyze biological data it is now possible, for the first time, to design new, bi-directional studies that directly link biology and computer science. This form of coupled experimental and computational thinking, which will be utilized in this project, can greatly benefit both biology and computer science. The proposal also seeks to help establish the usefulness of this approach to increase public interest in science and engineering and to provide interdisciplinary educational and research experiences for a diverse population of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This joint experimental-computational project will use a bi-directional approach to study the design, communication and coordination of networks utilized by Escherichia coli. The overall goal is to determine how biological systems utilize distributed networks over different scales, environments and varying communication strategies. The project will address biological questions ranging from how information processing is performed in signaling networks to the importance of various topological features of E. coli networks to coordination in a population of bacterial cells. In addition to addressing the biological questions these studies seek to provide insights into the design and usage of networks for distributed computational systems that can tolerate harsh environments, failures and limited resources making them applicable to a wide range of real world applications. Distributed networks are utilized by species ranging from single cell organisms to mammals. The proposal seeks to determine shared principles regarding the design and usage of such networks in E. coli. and the findings can be applied to understand similar systems in other species, as well. Beyond the immediate impact of the biological modeling and the algorithms developed, the synergy between computational and biological systems is of great interest to computer scientists, biologists and the general public. The proposal includes an interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, engineers and biologists. Students funded as part of this project will spend time at collaborators' labs from other disciplines leading to interdisciplinary training and the research will support and provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups. The PI and co-PIs plan to develop and offer a new class on biologically inspired computational methods and to organize workshops and tutorials in relevant international meetings about the topic of this proposal. Project outcomes will be disseminated at http://www.algorithmsinnature.org.</AbstractNarration>
