    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Robert Zinna of Washington State University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the Niimi laboratory at Nagoya University in Nagoya, Japan. The project title is "Diversification of Weapon Form: Insights from Development of Horned Beetles." The host scientist is Dr. Teruyuki Niimi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robert Zinna is PhD student in Entomology at Washington State University who studies the development and evolution of insect morphology, specifically morphology that has been adapted into weapons. Understanding the origins of new morphologies is one of the critical challenges of evolutionary biology. Using a combination of classical developmental biology techniques as well as new high-throughput methodologies, this project is investigating patterning mechanisms that contribute to weapon development using an insect model. The outcomes of this work will advance the understanding of the proximate mechanisms of evolutionary biology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. The scientific results of this fellowship will be disseminated through peer-reviewed scientific publications that involve not only the EAPSI host, Dr. Niimi, but also the Fellow's PhD advisor, Dr. Lavine, and a third collaborator, Dr. Emlen. This project facilitates international dissemination of research and research techniques, and allows the Fellow to share novel teaching methods with international science educators as well as learn from their methods. The ability to incorporate an international perspective when teaching science is an important step in increasing diversity in scientific literacy. The Fellow is also heavily involved in entomological and scientific outreach to a diverse audience at Washington State University, and the strong pro-insect culture present in Japan allows him to develop new methods of community outreach for Entomology, focusing on how insects can make educational house pets for all levels of K-12 education.</AbstractNarration>
