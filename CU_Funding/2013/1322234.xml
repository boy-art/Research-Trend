    <AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Oceanus, a 177? research vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Oceanus is a general-purpose research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by Oregon State University. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research in the Pacific Northwest. RV Oceanus completed 139 days in 2012, 111 (80%) of which were for NSF. In 2013, the vessel is scheduled to sail has 182 days with 70% (127 days) of the schedule for NSF. With this proposal, OSU provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;1) Work Horse ADCP Board Replacement: $8000&lt;br/&gt;2) Slip Ring Upgrade: $10,500&lt;br/&gt;3) CTD Connector Upgrade: $26,500&lt;br/&gt;Total: $45,000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
