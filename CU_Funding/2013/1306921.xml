    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a new type of microscope and interferometer that&lt;br/&gt;uses the hydrogen Lyman-alpha (HLA) line at 121.6nm as the source wavelength. This&lt;br/&gt;wavelength is convenient, because it is short enough to provide transverse resolution&lt;br/&gt;improvement of 5X above visible light microscopes and, although it is in the vacuum ultraviolet&lt;br/&gt;(VUV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, it has an atmospheric transmission window of&lt;br/&gt;up to several centimeters in dry air. Therefore, samples do not need to be in vacuum. Subnanometer&lt;br/&gt;vertical resolution is expected from the interferometer configuration. The intellectual&lt;br/&gt;merit is a first demonstration of imaging and interferometry at the HLA wavelength for a variety&lt;br/&gt;of objects, like graphene, silicon nanophotonic circuits and metamaterial structures. Potential of&lt;br/&gt;this technology will be investigated with advanced optical designs, and an attempt will be made&lt;br/&gt;to measure auto-fluorescence of biological structures, like electrospun fibrinogen fibers. The&lt;br/&gt;broader impacts of this technology are numerous, where the instrument transforms the range of&lt;br/&gt;practical optical microscopy into the VUV. Many researchers are now studying nano-devices&lt;br/&gt;and structures, and evolution of this instrument will enable characterization on this scale, which&lt;br/&gt;is between optical microscopy and electron microscopes or atomic-force microscopes. As the&lt;br/&gt;source technology improves, this system could enable sub-nanometer transverse resolution by&lt;br/&gt;application of stimulated emission-depletion ideas for fluorophore-tagged proteins in biological&lt;br/&gt;membrane samples. With respect to commercial interests, this technology provides a potentially&lt;br/&gt;useful tool for inspection of wafers and masks in the semiconductor industry.</AbstractNarration>
