    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Todd Hudnall of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Texas State University will explore the development of methods for stabilizing low-oxidation state and low-valent main group compounds. In addition to their fundamental value in improving our understanding of main group chemistry, these targeted low-oxidation state main group compounds may be further utilized in applications such as energy storage at the molecular level or in the preparation of novel nanostructured main group alloys. The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, and materials chemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels. Texas State University is classified as a Hispanic Serving Institution, and is well-positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science. Outreach activities involving K-12 students will also be part of the funded project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this work will explore the potential for a unique class of electrophilic carbenes to support main group elements in unusual coordination environments and oxidation states. By utilizing carbonyl-decorated carbenes as stabilizing ligands, this project seeks to synthesize: (a) stable radicals centered on heavy group 15 elements; (b) carbene-supported terminal borylenes and gallylenes; and (c) formally zero oxidation state main group allotropes and alloys.</AbstractNarration>
