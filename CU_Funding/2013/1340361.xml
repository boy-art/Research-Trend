    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1340361 PI: Peyton, Shelly ORG: University of Massachusetts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Multiscale Materials in the Study and Treatment of Cancer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Part: This a proposal for partial support of a symposium to be held in conjunction with the Fall 2013 Materials Research Society (MRS) conference in Boston. Biomimetic surfaces, nanoparticles, and even large three-dimensional scaffolds are able to capture the chemical and physical properties of certain biological systems, from nanometers (size of proteins and drug carriers), to microns (mimicking whole cells), to centimeters in length (modeling tissues). This biomimetic approach aims to detect invasive disease at early stages, to identify and image its location within complex, dense tissues, to identify novel drug targets, and to deliver therapeutics or contrast agents to a specific region. As with all new biomedical tools, variations in the unique properties of these materials (size, topology, functional moieties, mechanics, and chemistry) directly impact their interaction with the biological medium and surrounding environment. The importance of controlled design and fabrication and subsequent characterization of the materials will be emphasized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Part: This symposium brings together an international group of investigators in the synthesis of functional materials, surface chemistry/coatings, and identification of targeting agents to share their findings and insights from a variety of perspectives. The attendance of eight new and/or young investigators will be supported by $500 travel awards. Awardees will be selected by the symposium steering committee based on the abstracts of presentations proposed by attendees.</AbstractNarration>
