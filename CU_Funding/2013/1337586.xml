    <AbstractNarration>1337586&lt;br/&gt;Smith, Steve&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Instrumentation program supports South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T) with the acquisition of a Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) optimized for the study of biomaterials in aqueous environments, in combination with an inverted frame fluorescence microscope, suitable for simultaneous topographic and fluorescence imaging. This instrument will be used in research to correlate the optical and electronic properties of biomaterials with nanometer scale topography. The project will be the nexus for collaborative science undertaken by a diverse group of Physicists, Chemists, Biologists and Chemical Engineers, with broad scientific, educational and societal impacts. The instrument will also enable and support studies on many other soft materials, which may be immersed in liquids, and permit simultaneous and correlative fluorescence imaging. The instrumentation will be unique in the State of South Dakota, and will support several new graduate and undergraduate programs at SDSM&amp;T, including undergraduate and graduate programs in nanotechnology, applied biology, bio-chemistry and bio-physics. The instrument will facilitate collaboration across the SDSM&amp;T campus and with South Dakota State University. Many students in South Dakota will be exposed to the proposed research, thus broadening the educational impacts. SDSM&amp;T also maintains a permanent Native American outreach program, with established and well-organized outreach programs such as SD GEAR UP, aimed at increasing the number of Native American high-school students continuing on to college. On-going results of the project would be incorporated into the educational portions of this program.&lt;br/&gt;****&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Instrumentation program supports South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T) with the acquisition of a Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) optimized for the study of biomaterials in aqueous environments, in combination with an inverted frame fluorescence microscope, suitable for simultaneous topographic and fluorescence imaging.
