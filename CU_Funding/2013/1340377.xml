    <AbstractNarration>The 35th Midwest Probability Colloquium at Northwestern University on October 10-12, 2013, at Northwestern University. Probability theory has been the most applicable branch of pure mathematics. During the last decade we have seen a clear surge in popularity of probabilistic tools and methods in other branches of pure and applied mathematics. This year's selection of program topics and speakers reflect the broad scope of applicability of the discipline. By maintaining a wide range of active research directions, the Midwest Probability Colloquium continues to provide a forum for the exchange of intellectual interest across a wide array of applied fields as well as for core areas of mathematics. Following the well established traditional format, the colloquium will be divided into the Tutorial Program and the Research Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The speakers of the Research Program are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martin Barlow (University of British Columbia) &lt;br/&gt;Lionel Levine (Cornell University) &lt;br/&gt;Dmitry Panchenko (University of Texas, A &amp; M)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of this year's Tutorial Program is "Random Walks on Groups" and will&lt;br/&gt;be hosted by Steve Lalley (University of Chicago)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MPC website is at http://www.math.northwestern.edu/mwp/</AbstractNarration>
