    <AbstractNarration>Abstract (Manfredi, 1344316): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and young mathematicians to participate in the Special Semester on "Evolutionary Problems" on December 2-4 2013, at the Mittag-Leffler Institute of Mathematical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Special Semester aims to bring together leading experts and researchers in nonlinear partial differential equations (both on the applied and theoretical sides). This proposal support US participants who will get involved in the institute activities during December 02-04. The list of speakers includes young mathematicians such as S. Amrstrong and C. Smart. During that period, the activities will revolve around the theory of nonlinear PDEs and related evolutionary equations. The one semester program at the institute focuses on some important classes of equations which among other things, are of importance in mathematical modeling. Between seventeen and twenty participants will travel from the US, and the majority of the participants to be supported are minorities. This proposal contains a letter of commitment from the Mittag-Leffler Institute to support the local expenses of up to twenty US participants.</AbstractNarration>
