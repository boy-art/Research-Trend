    <AbstractNarration>The project is to use remote technology in real-time to enhance nanotechnology education and training, with a goal to accelerate exposure of students in grades 10-14 to the nanotechnology field and to potential careers as nanotechnicians. The project promotes the use of remote technology and nanotechnology education in community colleges and high schools throughout Illinois by focusing on the following key activities: 1) training faculty to use lab and remote technology that permits real-time experimentation when they return to their own institutions, 2) developing and implementing new nanotechnology curriculum and labs in existing STEM courses, 3) encouraging the formation of nanotechnology 2+2 partnerships across the state, and 4) evaluating the effects of the new curriculum and labs on the outcomes of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remote technology has the potential to be transformative in bringing previously unavailable pedagogy into more classrooms. Exposure to nanotechnology at the high school and community college level encourages more students to explore the field in subsequent post-secondary education. The program design is based on proven models and involves participants in a statewide partnership that enhances collaboration and scientific inquiry. Collaboration with the Illinois Science and Technology Coalition and IL STEM Learning Exchange ensures outreach to traditionally underserved institutions and the program design makes it easily accessible to colleges and schools throughout the region.</AbstractNarration>
