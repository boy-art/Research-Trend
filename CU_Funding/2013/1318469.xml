    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to catalyze a research collaboration between the PI and Dr. Nicholas Shears, a Lecturer at the University of Auckland, to understand trophic connections and the effect of resource variability on consumers. This is necessary to predict how food webs may shift in the face of environmental change. The PI proposes to extend prior work to examine the role of kelp detritus in this very different kelp forest system. He will use stable isotopes and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to trace kelp carbon through the food web, and test the hypothesis that kelp detritus represents a significant source of carbon to suspension feeders living in the extensive Ecklonia kelp forests of New Zealand. This award is supported by the Catalyzing New International Collaborations program under OIIA/International Science and Engineering, with co-funding by GEO/Ocean Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macroalgae and phytoplankton support highly productive marine ecosystems on shallow coastal reefs. The objectives of the proposed research are to determine: (1) the contribution of phytoplankton and kelp detritus to the pool of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) available to reef consumers, and (2) how different components of the POM are used as food by reef suspension feeders. Broader impacts of this project will include educational benefits to a graduate student who is the first person in her family to attend college. The project will serve to expand her research and perspective to include a very different kelp forest system and introduce her to the value of international collaborations through mentoring by Dr. Shears and his group. Results of this research will be disseminated widely through scientific publications but also through our undergraduate teaching and public lectures at venues such as the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.</AbstractNarration>
