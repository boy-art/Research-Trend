    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Katie May Laumann of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, College of William and Mary to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the Natural History Museum &amp; Institute in Chiba, Japan. The project title is "Using Genetics to Build a Sturgeon Family Tree: More Data is Better." The host scientist is Dr. Masaki Miya. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding relationships among different species is important on many levels, but reliably elucidating these relationships requires significant amounts of data. Sturgeons are economically and culturally important, in addition to representing an ancient lineage of fishes. However, recent studies of relationships among the approximately 25 species of sturgeons have been limited in the amount of data available. This has led to conflicting family trees, with little resolution or agreement among researchers on the details of relationships among species. This study aims to resolve differences among the various proposed sturgeon family trees, and does so by using more genetic data than has previously been available. This project uses laboratory techniques to obtain genetic sequences of the full mitochondrial DNA (unit of DNA inherited only from the mother) for individuals of each sturgeon species. Similarities among sequences of different species are used to identify which species are most closely related to one another, resulting in a sturgeon family tree built from the largest data set available to date. This study provides new information about relationships among sturgeon species. Building a reliable sturgeon family tree is especially important because every sturgeon species is endangered, threatened, or requires protection. Although we know that habitat damage and overfishing of sturgeons have contributed to major population declines in these fishes, information about relationships among sturgeons can help identify more specific factors contributing to declines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, managers will be able to use this information to mitigate contributing factors and to aid in the recovery of those populations that are most threatened. This will aid in the conservation of species that are not only ecologically important, but economically and culturally important. Sturgeons produce the finest caviar, and support the caviar industry and all of the people whose livelihoods depend upon it. Additionally, sturgeons have been traditionally important to Native American and First Nations people, and are therefore of great cultural significance. This study will ultimately ensure that these fishes and the industries and cultures that value them are preserved.</AbstractNarration>
