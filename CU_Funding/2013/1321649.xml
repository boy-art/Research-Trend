    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests travel funding for the 13th Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design (PPEPPD) international conference to be held in May 26-30 2013, in Iguazu Falls, Argentina. The topics of the Conference include Fundamentals of Thermodynamics and Phase Equilibria, Transport Properties, Surfaces and Interfaces, Quantum Calculations and Molecular Simulations. Processing and Applications will focus on agrochemicals and biomass, new oil and gas processing challenges, renewable energy, product and process engineering, novel reaction and separation technology, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, biological systems, food processing, materials, nanoscience and nanotechnology, and environment, sustainability and risk management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will support young research workers (approximately 12) who would otherwise not be able to attend, as well as presenters of invited lectures and members of the international organizing committee (5 individuals). No request is made for local expenses, meeting organization costs, or for non-US participants. These conferences have provided excellent forums for fruitful discussions on curriculum issues among faculty of the participating countries. In addition to the personal contacts that the U.S. participants will make with people from the other countries, it will be beneficial to U.S. interests to foster exchanges of research and teaching ideas and of personnel, and establish research collaborations between chemical engineers from the U.S. and those from the emerging centers of expertise around the world. American participation is essential for making contributions to the general knowledge base, for becoming aware of the progress made by other parts of the globe, and for fostering international collaborations. Significant efforts will be made to include both young and underrepresented faculty in the group of U.S. participants. The conferences especially encourage senior members of the profession to interact with younger scientists and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
