    <AbstractNarration>This project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division of the NSF investigates organometallic complexes in order to discover new reaction methods and reactivity. These advances are sought in order to streamline the efficiencies of chemical pathways for the rapid assembly of complex molecules. A key aspect of these efforts seeks to define versatile, high-value methods for the construction of bioactive compounds to create a platform for studies of medicinal chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific aspects of the research examine the development of new reactions involving complexes of iron, indium and palladium. These studies are applied in the synthesis of natural products which display promising bioactivity toward various cancers and disease models of inflammation. Because of current limitations of the science, the natural products proposed in this investigation have not been previously prepared by synthesis. Therefore, success in this program is advancing the design and study of these substances as potential drug-like molecules. A goal of this research is to create new methodologies for generally useful cross-coupling reactions to produce chemically reactive allenes, and to design new carbocyclization reactions. These efforts are directly applied toward the synthesis of daphnicyclidin and tetrapetalone natural products, but also have broader applicability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This University laboratory offers state-of-the-art training and mentoring in the field of synthetic organic chemistry with a significant diversity program. A blend of predoctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and undergraduate participants emphasizes the inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities. All individuals receive training and mentoring to enable future opportunities as leading scientists of the next generation. The broader impact of these scientific results benefit society by enabling the discovery of new pharmaceuticals.</AbstractNarration>
