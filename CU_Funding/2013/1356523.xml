    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Chicago State University (CSU) is providing scholarships and support services to academically-talented students majoring in chemistry and physics who demonstrate financial need. As a predominantly minority institution drawing a majority of its students from African-American and Latino/a neighborhoods from the south and west sides of Chicago, CSU is well-situated to contribute to increasing the number of scientists of color in the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the CSU Chemistry and Physics S-STEM Scholarship program is to increase the number of chemistry and physics professionals from underrepresented populations by providing scholarship aid and professional development opportunities for academically-talented, financially-disadvantaged students. In addition to awarding scholarships, the project is accomplishing this by (i) providing one-on-one faculty mentoring; (ii) supporting the transition to the rigors of a university science program through a two-week, pre-college summer program that builds community, peer support networks, and establishes student cohorts; and (iii) supporting the enculturation of students in science by inviting them to participate in research experiences starting from their first semester at CSU. CSU's curriculum emphasizes modern teaching techniques and the use of inquiry in the classroom, both of which have been shown to be especially effective with traditionally-marginalized science students. The project also helps CSU students build community and develop identities as physical scientists through science engagement activities, networking, and the development of a supportive cohorts of students.</AbstractNarration>
