    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is seeking to develop a novel cost-effective strategy to modify dental implants with biomimetic nanofibers for controlled regeneration of gingival tissue. In order to seal the dental implants from bacteria and consequently protect the crestal bone from infection-induced deterioration, there is an unmet need to promote a prompt and effective attachment of gingival tissue onto the implant surface. The project proposes to coat aligned biomimetic nanofibers onto the collar of dental implants for rapid adhesion and controlled growth of gingival cells along the fibers. It is anticipated that an accelerated formation of new gingival connective tissue will take place right onto the biomimetic nanofibers, leading to a proper seal of dental implants from oral cavity. The same aligned nanofibers can be useful to modify other implant surfaces for guided accelerated tissue regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the proposed cost-effective biomimetic nanofiber coating will provide a competitive solution to a common problem, i.e., infection-induced implant failure. This type of nano-fiber coated dental implants has a great potential to penetrate the rapidly growing dental implant market which is projected to be $8.1 billion by 2015. Teaming up with the leading industry partners will facilitate the commercialization of this novel technology upon completion of the proposed studies.</AbstractNarration>
