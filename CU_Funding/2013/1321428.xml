    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of software for the development of solutions to complex life science problems. Life science is truly an interdisciplinary field for which real collaborations can substantially advance the level of technology and product development. However, collaboration between industry and academic/government institutions is currently limited by (a) necessity for industrial collaborators to analyze large amount of complex and specialized information, (b) various heterogeneous nondisclosure policies to protect intellectual property rights of collaborators, and (c) legitimate concerns of businesses that disclosures of their R&amp;D problems to the public could weaken their business position. To address these fundamental limitations, software will be developed with the following innovative components: (1) Text and data mining model for finding nonobvious biological relationships, and (2) Secure workspace for data storing and sharing implemented in new program language that enforces confidentiality and integrity policies of data resource. Phase I will produce preliminary software and documented results of feasibility studies. The results of these studies will be analyzed to evaluate broader impacts and commercial potential of proposed software. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial impact of this will be to develop innovative, unique software that will drastically change the way problems in life science and other interdisciplinary fields are currently solved. The software is intended to advance the level of product development in life science and other interdisciplinary industries, and to aid in analyzing large text data. The targeted customers will be life science small businesses as they have a great need for external collaboration but they have limited resources and expertise. Other potential customers include university professors and independent experts with relevant expertise in subject areas. It is anticipated that, once the proposed tool has matured, it also will be used by large industrial customers for troubleshooting problems that require bold action and broad cooperation.</AbstractNarration>
