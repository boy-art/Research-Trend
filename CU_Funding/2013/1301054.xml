    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at the University of South Florida entitled, "RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site: RET in Functional Materials at the University of South Florida", under the direction of Venkat R. Bhethanabotla and Dr. Sylvia W. Thomas. The University of South Florida (USF) College of Engineering (COE), in partnership with the school districts of Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties and St. Petersburg College will conduct an eight week summer RET in Functional Materials for 15 teachers per year for 3 years (45 total); 9 local high school teachers, 2 local community college instructors and 4 pre-service teachers. Materials Science is chosen as the focus because of its highly interdisciplinary nature (making it relevant to a large number of subject areas). The pervasive presence of materials in everyday life can provide multiple teaching contexts, and its research emphasis at the University of South Florida is the perfect conduit. USF has made substantial investments in the past 10 years in materials science through the hiring of 20+ materials research faculty, establishment of a shared metrology and clean room facility, an interdisciplinary master's program in materials science and engineering and large scale research computing facilities. The project team further proposes to sustain this collaborative atmosphere among participants through the creation of an educational resource, the Materials College, to be designed and implemented by the participants themselves. This web-based resource will house the participants' inquiry-based lesson plans within a coherent structure, containing additional content that provides an overview of Materials Science and its relevance to current technologies, describes the fundamental knowledge required by practitioners in the field and highlights applications to the field of core subjects taught in high schools and community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Materials College activity will provide a framework for the sustained engagement of, and collaboration among, teachers and provide a foundation for building additional partnerships with other school districts, community colleges and Colleges of Education. Web-based dissemination of lesson plans in a focused structure will enhance the professional development of a&lt;br/&gt;broad range of teachers. The diversity of participants will result in expanded participation of underrepresented groups and women in STEM disciplines. The project team expects that its efforts will result in an increased number of math and science certified teachers and U.S./permanent resident AA and BS degree holders.</AbstractNarration>
