    <AbstractNarration>The project at Central State University will infuse shale gas extraction principles into an integrated geosciences curriculum; engage faculty in providing innovative research experiences for undergraduates in the application of environmental engineering principles on shale gas production; and develop a certification program in shale gas technology. The project's focus on teaching and training students in shale gas technology is consistent with the needs of the state of Ohio and its shale gas economy. In collaboration with partner universities, Central State University will expand instruction and research in different facets of shale development such as site development, preparation for drilling, drilling, fracturing, well completion and fracturing fluids management. The certificate program will require an internship in the industry in addition to courses in cognate areas. The project will enhance institutional research capacity in the areas of geophysics, hydraulic fracturing fluids treatment and management, and air quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will impact the participation of underrepresented groups in the geosciences field and the shale gas industry. The project has an important emphasis on environmental impact in its educational and research program plan specifically integrating green engineering principles, optimization of water resources allocation, and other environmental solutions and conservation. Research experiences for undergraduate students will involve their participation in finding solutions to some of the major environmental challenges associated with fracturing for shale oil, in particular, the techniques for addressing treatment and cleaning of caustic flow water backflow. The curricular and research enhancements of the geoscience program will position Central State University as a regional leader at the forefront of geoscience research and instruction.</AbstractNarration>
