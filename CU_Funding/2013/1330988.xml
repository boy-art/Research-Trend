    <AbstractNarration>Jennifer Patico of the Georgia State University will investigate how debates about food security unfold in and across households in urban communities. Social scientists agree that contemporary Americans tend to imbue both eating and child-rearing with strong moral meanings. At the same time, they observe the "time bind" faced by double-earner families, whereby parents balance ever-lengthening professional work days with the labor of housekeeping and child-raising. The charged issue of children's food provides a strategic opportunity to examine standards for parental care and how these are negotiated under conditions of material and/or temporal strain in the United States. Based in an economically and racially diverse area of urban Atlanta, the study more specifically investigates how parental and institutional concerns about children's food might reinforce (or challenge) social inequalities by providing an arena in which the experiences, knowledge and values of different groups are communicated and/or evaluated. In-depth interviews will be held with adults from a total of sixty households that reflect the economic diversity of a local elementary and middle school. Other ethnographic methods include the observation of food-related practices within a select sample of individual households. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will illuminate how measures intended to improve the health of children - such as public service announcements or guidelines for "healthy" school snacks - are perceived and managed by caretakers and school employees. Further, it will show how these measures can have complex, unintended effects on the ground. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children's food has been framed as an American "crisis" in recent years; it is a topic of active debate in the mass media, in public health research, and at the community level. These data will be of critical importance to public health professionals, school administrators, parent activists, community organizers and others who seek to mobilize concern around children's nutrition and find effective ways to shape community initiatives.</AbstractNarration>
