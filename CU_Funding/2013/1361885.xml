    <AbstractNarration>With this new award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program A (CSDM-A) of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Steven Baldelli of University of Houston in a project that will use a technique to provide images of the boundaries between liquids and solids at the molecular level, helping us to learn how liquids wet surfaces. Although wetting of surfaces by liquids has been studied for many years, the process is not understood at the molecular level. The use of this novel imaging technique will provide the basis for a fundamental understanding of liquid-solid boundaries that will impact areas including catalysis, materials chemistry, adhesion, and basic surface science. In addition to university researchers, the project will include high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use surface sum frequency generation (SFG) imaging to provide spatial and spectroscopic information on liquid wetting of a heterogeneous surface. The goal of these investigations is to uncover the molecular basis of processes that rely on interfacial properties.</AbstractNarration>
