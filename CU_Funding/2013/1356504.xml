    <AbstractNarration>The need to increase the number and quality of STEM graduates in the workforce both nationally and in New York State is well-documented. A 2010 state-level analysis study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (http://cew.georgetown.edu/jobs2018/states) projects that by 2018 there will be a need to fill 359,000 STEM jobs in New York State. The Alliance for Science and Technology Research (ASTRA) projects that 68% of these STEM positions will require a bachelor's degree or higher. &lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Within Community (DWC) Program is St. Bonaventure University (SBU)'s proposal to enhance the quality of STEM education and increase the number of STEM graduates either entering the workforce or STEM graduate programs. The DWC Steering Committee conducts a thorough applicant-review process to select 25 talented students (Fellows) with financial need in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Sciences, Mathematics and Physics programs. Effective recruitment processes and outreach are used to increase public awareness about STEM and encourage high school students to further their STEM education by applying to the university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built on SBU's already strong community structure, the elements of the DWC Program improve student learning in STEM by reinforcing classroom education via symposia involving interaction with STEM faculty and STEM business professionals and tutoring sessions (both receiving and giving) that foster retention of knowledge and research opportunities. STEM student support services are enhanced through the formation of an interdisciplinary cohort sharing a common residency and taking core courses together to improve academic performance and increase retention rates. To ensure that 90% of S-STEM fellows graduate in four years DWC promotes collaboration among STEM faculty and students. Interdisciplinary exploration which is fully supported by faculty mentors allows S-STEM fellows to engage in internships and professional conferences throughout all four years and have opportunities to present research results. Partnerships with STEM businesses are consolidated and extend beyond the grant period to continue to address the need for a highly qualified regional STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation metrics include appropriate increases in inquiries, applications, acceptances, and matriculations, with a goal of a 15% overall growth in enrollment in all STEM majors. Program-specific measures are used to gain objective feedback from fellows, their teachers and tutors and from employers on the number and quality of internships and jobs obtained. Feedback from mentors and fellows are used to evaluate and improve these relationships during the grant period. The completion of research projects, the number of conferences attended, presentations given, and articles published, along with feedback from business professionals are used to assess the quality of these components, with a goal that 90% of S-STEM fellows who graduate immediately secure employment with a STEM employer or enter a STEM graduate program.</AbstractNarration>
