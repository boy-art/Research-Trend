    <AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant provides funding for research on the development of fiber-reinforced composite materials that are easy to inspect using standard non-destructive evaluation techniques. Non-destructive evaluation detects damage in structures, much as a doctor's x-ray detects a broken bone and such techniques are critical to the safety of a wide variety of industrial and commercial structures such as airplanes and pipelines. Nondestructive evaluation is common for metallic structures, but its application in non-metallic systems is much more challenging. To address this challenge, approaches developed for self-healing materials will be adopted. Materials will be processed that contain microencapsulated contrast agents to make damage easier to detect during magnetic and x-ray inspection of fiber-reinforced polymer composites. This research will take inspiration from nanoparticle-based contrast agents used for medical diagnostics and will apply them to advanced composites. The contrast agents will be synthesized and integrated into the materials and, in parallel, sensing systems for these contrast agents will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will enable quantitative analysis of damage in composites using highly accepted, readily available non-destructive evaluation techniques. This will improve the safety and reliability of composites. Lighter, more efficient structures would be enabled as engineers gain confidence based on improved damage detection in the structures they create. Graduate and undergraduate students in this research will be part of an interdisciplinary project combining solid mechanics, instrumentation and materials chemistry and the results will be published in journals and presented at national and international conferences. Educational initiatives include peer-based instruction and other self-directed techniques in engineering courses that will foster creativity and improve retention of STEM students. Aspects of this research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses as well as an engineering summer camp for high school students. All course materials and demonstrations from the research will be available through the research group's website.</AbstractNarration>
