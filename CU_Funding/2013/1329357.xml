    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports the mission of the Disasters Roundtable of the National Academy of Sciences, which facilitates and enhances communication and the exchange of ideas among scientists, practitioners, and policy makers to identify emerging issues related to natural, technological, and other disasters. To meet this objective, the Roundtable convenes 2-3 workshops and other activities a year to stimulate discussion that advances the understanding of disaster-related issues and highlights strategies to mitigate the effects of disasters. The impacts of disasters on world health, environment, and economies are increasing as the number of natural, technological, and human caused disasters, and the losses associated with these disasters, increase. Addressing these issues requires cooperative and collaborative work among diverse stakeholder communities at the national, state and local levels, and between the public and private sectors. The Disasters Roundtable facilitates this type of exchange, providing a neutral forum in which representatives from diverse disciplines come together to examine issues, share perspectives, and further the understanding of the entire cycle of preparedness, response and recovery, and resilience to natural, technological, and human caused disasters. In doing so, the Disasters Roundtable occupies a unique and important niche in harnessing and applying the most current thinking among the disaster research, practitioner, and management communities towards disaster related issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Disasters Roundtable membership is comprised of recognized experts who are academicians, practitioners and others in disaster-related fields, with approximately half being ex-officio members that provide financial support for the Roundtable's activities and participate as full members. The Disasters Roundtable leverages the contributions of the ex officio members to achieve the common goals of both the federal agencies, and the larger disaster community, and to inform policy through advances in science, research and technology. By using the unparalleled convening power of the National Academies to bring together experts from diverse sectors, the Disaster Roundtable can illuminate emerging issues, and move towards finding solutions to disaster related issues through advances in science, technology and policy. Disasters Roundtable sessions are carefully structured to feature appropriate presentations and discussions relevant to scientific developments and timely policy issues related to disasters. DR workshops draw 100 attendees or more per event in person and, reach a wider stakeholder community via webcasts and web archives. The DR uses web based opportunities in all of its open activities to extend its opportunities to share information, interact with and educate a broad stakeholder community and promote exchange of information and ideas across fields. The DR also interacts with key Congressional committees, staffers and other government representatives to engage in discussions relevant to science and policy issues related to disasters and hazards. The Disasters Roundtable was established in 2000 and has held more than 30 workshops, meetings, and activities on timely and important disasters-related issues during its tenure.</AbstractNarration>
