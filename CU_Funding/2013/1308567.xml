    <AbstractNarration>TITLE: Integrating acoustics, behavior, and radio telemetry to develop a novel technique of measuring acoustic amplitude in unrestricted, free-living animals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acoustic communication plays an integral role in mediating the behavioral interactions of many species. Research aimed at connecting variation in acoustic signals to their intended functions and effects on fitness has focused almost exclusively on differences in signal structure while largely ignoring the role of variation in amplitude (loudness). Measuring amplitude is challenging because amplitude varies depending on the distance between the signaler and the microphone and the orientation of the signaler in relation to the microphone. Consequently, current knowledge of the functional significance and fitness implications of amplitude modulation is based solely on non-quantitative observations or measures of absolute amplitude collected from animals restricted to a specific location or arena in the lab or field. Research supported by this proposal will develop a novel technique for measuring amplitude in free-living animals using microphone-transmitters, a type of radio-transmitter that enables a microphone to remain a relatively fixed distance from a mobile, vocalizing animal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellow will be trained in the physics of sound production and propagation while developing skills for assaying the directionality of acoustic signals, computer programming, and calculating mathematical correction factors to account for changes in acoustic frequency (pitch) and the posture of the signaler. This research will contribute to the training and mentorship of diverse undergraduates in both laboratory and field techniques in biology and physics. In addition, the research will foster a new inter-departmental collaboration between UC Davis and UT Austin. All results will be disseminated broadly through public lectures to local Audubon Societies, publications in scholarly journals, and presentations at national and international conferences.</AbstractNarration>
