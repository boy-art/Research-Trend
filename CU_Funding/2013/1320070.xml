    <AbstractNarration>The proposal requests for travel funds to support US participants, particularly&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and recent Ph.D.s, to attend the international&lt;br/&gt;workshop Model Theory 2013 that will be held June 10-15 in Ravello Italy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the objectives of this workshop will be &lt;br/&gt;bringing together researchers in Model Theory and other areas of mathematics where&lt;br/&gt;model theory has had significant applications. By presenting and discussion problems &lt;br/&gt;as well as recent advances in these areas we hope to facilitate further interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another goal of the workshop is to provide an informal setting where graduate students and younger researchers from US &lt;br/&gt;can learn about new trends and interact with one another as well as with prominent senior&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians. There will be three tutorials on recent developments&lt;br/&gt;in Model Theory given by experts and aimed mostly at young researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is expecting participation from a large number of&lt;br/&gt;graduate student and recent Ph.D.s.&lt;br/&gt;Besides providing an opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas and discuss open problems, another&lt;br/&gt;equally important goal of the workshop is to foster interaction among&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and recent Ph.D by providing a setting&lt;br/&gt;contacts with junior and senior researchers are naturally and easily made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about the workshop can be found on its webpage&lt;br/&gt;http://logica.dmi.unisa.it/Ravello/</AbstractNarration>
