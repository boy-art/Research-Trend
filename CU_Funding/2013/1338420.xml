    <AbstractNarration>Mark Q. Martindale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IOB-0642273&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Functional approaches to the origin of the bilaterally symmetrical body plan in animal development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses how morphologically complex animals evolved from simpler-looking animals and the relationship between morphological and molecular complexity. Most animals display obvious features of bilateral symmetry, such as lateral appendages or eyes, however, simpler, 'radially symmetrical' animals that arose early in animal evolution do not display these features. Recent results from the Martindale lab have shown that genes that normally participate in the formation of bilaterally symmetric structures are not only present but expressed in polarized patterns in the 'radially symmetrical' anemone, Nematostella vectensis. These data indicate that 'radially symmetrical' animals are built on a bilaterally symmetrical platform that arose earlier than previously thought. Dr. Martindale proposes experiments to further investigate asymmetric gene expression in Nematostella embryos. He will take advantage of Nematostella's recently sequenced genome and his group's extensive experience in the study of Nematostella embryogenesis. He will determine when asymmetric gene expression first begins, the hierarchy of asymmetric gene activation, and the interactions between genes that leads to asymmetric gene expression. To further determine the generality of these results he proposes to study homologous gene expression in closely related stony coral embryos. Dr. Martindale has a strong track record in training graduate and postdoctoral students from diverse backgrounds and the dissemination of results and reagents to the evolution and development community.</AbstractNarration>
