    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER project focuses on understanding problem-solving skills among biology undergraduates. The goals are to: (1) Investigate the problem solving steps of beginning and advanced biology students in the domains of protein structure and function and metabolism; (2) Determine the extent to which the use of particular problem-solving steps by biology students predicts their success and persistence in science; and (3) Apply the findings to enhance problem solving skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Longitudinal data are being collected from a cohort of biology undergraduates across their undergraduate careers. Data include students' problem solving steps along with demographic characteristics, academic characteristics, and career intentions. Problem-solving steps are analyzed qualitatively. Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling and Hierarchical Linear Modeling are used to determine the extent to which problem-solving skill predicts success and persistence in science. This project expands an online problem solving tutorial to enhance supportive problem solving skills in solving protein structure and function and metabolism problems. Additionally, biology faculty from the university and local high schools are meeting regularly to engage in discussion, implementation, and feedback about how to teach problem solving in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in this area is important for greater understanding of how students solve problems which can help educators develop targeted course interventions. Targeted course interventions have been shown to facilitate student success and persistence in science. More widespread success and persistence in science degree programs is necessary to meet the predicted demand for more workers in areas such as health care, biomedical research, and engineering in the United States of America. This project provides insights for building learning and teaching tools to increase the number of undergraduates who are prepared for science career paths. In so doing, the project will contribute to a globally competitive workforce in science in the United States of America. Additionally, the proposed project will increase our understanding of some of the factors that may have impact on the full participation of groups underrepresented in science-related professions.</AbstractNarration>
