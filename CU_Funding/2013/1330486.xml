    <AbstractNarration>The National Academies' Board on Mathematical Sciences and their Applications (BMSA) is a primary interface between the research enterprise and federal agencies that rely on the mathematical sciences. Through studies and workshops, the Board's 18 pro bono experts help to ensure that the nation's decision making is based on strong mathematical modeling and analysis and reliable computational simulations. Recent BMSA reports documented best practices for verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification of complex simulations; the health of the mathematical sciences enterprise and steps needed to improve the field's vitality; and research priorities for improving capabilities for analyzing big data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current grant will enable the Board to oversee new studies on (1) analytical tools for the next-generation electric grid and (2) improvements to the pricing of risk within the National Flood Insurance Program. It will also support the Board's development of new activities of value to the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Treasury, and National Institutes of Health. The grant will also allow the Board to help stimulate community action in response to challenges identified in its 2013 report on "The Mathematical Sciences in 2025."</AbstractNarration>
