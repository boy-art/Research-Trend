    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to investigate and leverage electroelastoacoustically coupled linear and nonlinear metamaterial-inspired energy harvesting concepts for self-powered sensor systems. The technical approach of this computational and experimental research program combines metamaterial-inspired structures and piezoelectric energy harvesting to extract low-power electricity from structure-borne propagating waves. Wave focusing and funneling, diode mechanisms, frequency bandgaps, and energy localization are some of the unique metamaterial properties that will be explored for improving the efficiency of linear and nonlinear piezoelectric energy harvesting. The research program will achieve its objectives by establishing lumped- and distributed-parameter modeling frameworks coupling the elastoacoustic dynamics of metamaterials and propagating waves with the electroelastic dynamics of piezoelectric energy harvesting, followed by experimental testing of specific configurations to validate performance enhancement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will yield computational tools and experimental concepts for the potential system-level applications of low-power electricity generation from elastoacoustic waves propagating in the environment of sensor networks. The economic and societal benefits of enabling self-powered sensor nodes include reduction of maintenance costs and chemical waste of conventional batteries in wireless monitoring applications. The multifunctional nature of this class of energy harvesters results in the absorption of wave energy (which would otherwise create undesired noise/vibration) while generating usable electricity. In addition to constituting unprecedented platforms for both resonant and broadband energy harvesting, the frequency range of operation of the considered class of metamaterials can be highly compatible with microelectromechanical system-based energy harvesting. Results from this research will be disseminated through conference presentations, scholarly publications, and academic courses. Educational laboratory activities and classroom modules, developed in partnership with the Georgia Intern Fellowships for Teachers program at Georgia Tech, will expose underrepresented high school students to basic results of the research and to underlying wave mechanics and electroelastoacoustic principles.</AbstractNarration>
