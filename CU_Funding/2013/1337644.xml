    <AbstractNarration>Cognitive neuroscience research seeks to understand the basic brain mechanisms underlying cognitive and behavioral functions. While there are a variety of available research tools, the majority of these techniques are correlational, in that neural activity (or a proxy of neural activity) is measured while human subjects perform a task. Data from these techniques do not allow causal inference, which requires perturbation of the neural system. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is currently the leading choice for neural perturbation in humans. With Major Research Instrumentation support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. McAuley and colleagues will purchase a TMS system to enhance research and training in cognitive neuroscience at Michigan State University. TMS can be used to produce temporary disruptions in neural activity or to stimulate the cortex in targeted brain regions. Recent developments in this technology allow image-guided TMS delivery, commonly referred to as neuronavigation. This method allows the TMS coil to be precisely positioned over a specified brain structure based on a person's neuroanatomical data obtained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. This capability is important because, although the structure of the brain is roughly similar across people, the exact anatomical location of neural structures can vary considerably. Targets for disruption/stimulation can be identified by selecting and highlighting the desired structure/locations with the brain. Image-guided (neuronavigated) TMS is quickly becoming a widely-used and standard technology in cognitive neuroscience research. The general value of this technology for cognitive neuroscience is that it is a non-invasive tool that can be coupled with functional and structural MRI data to make causal inferences about normal and disordered brain function that are not possible through fMRI/MRI studies alone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participating investigators are all active researchers in the cognitive neurosciences. The new instrumentation will transform Michigan State University's capability to conduct cutting-edge cognitive neuroscience studies that help unravel the neural bases of cognitive function in a diverse set of domains, including perception, attention, memory, cognitive control, and decision making. The acquisition will also more broadly contribute to university-wide neuroscience education and training initiatives at the graduate and undergraduate levels. As part of a new and popular undergraduate major in neuroscience, neuronavigated TMS will be included as one of the methods taught in a required core laboratory course that exposes students to a variety of different neuroscience methods. At the graduate level, the new instrumentation will strengthen introductory and advanced neuroimaging courses by providing new education and novel hands-on training and research opportunities. Michigan State University is a also leader in undergraduate research and training opportunities in STEM areas for women and underrepresented minorities, and the training opportunities created by the new instrumentation will interact synergistically with departmental, interdepartmental and university-wide initiatives. Opportunities for summer research experiences for high school students will be created through established contacts with science teachers in area high schools.</AbstractNarration>
