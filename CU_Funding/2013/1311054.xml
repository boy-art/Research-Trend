    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Paul Piula Taele of Texas A&amp;M University to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at Singapore Management University in the Republic of Singapore. The project title is "Improving Computer Applications for Creative Design using Natural Gesture Input." The host scientist is Dr. Richard C. Davis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in human-computer interaction and artificial intelligent research enable people to interact naturally with computers through gestures using their limbs instead of through computer peripherals such as keyboard and mouse. People already use interactions from the gestures expressed with their limbs to convey ideas, information, and emotional responses, and such interactions also have great potential in expanding creative design from the virtual into the physical world. Unfortunately, such interactions are also largely untapped by existing creative design computer applications, which focus prematurely on design content instead of on valuable early-stage raw design planning. This research therefore actively explores successful techniques to combine advances of natural gesture interactions in computer applications with the potential of producing powerful creative design in the physical world. The core tasks of this research include surveying target users for proposed ideas and features, developing improvements to the existing code base of approaches, deploying the research system to target users, observing those users' interaction with the system, and collecting qualitative and quantitative feedback following extended trials of users' interactions with the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, these aims are directly supporting techniques for advancing discovery and understanding in novel interactive environments by actively focusing on enhancing the creative design process--for example, communicating ideas more clearly, summarizing information more accurately, or provoking emotional responses. Since such tools are also highly applicable for promoting teaching and training, the Fellow is working with teachers and trainers on introducing these additional resources in instructional content design, encouragingucational activities tht offer students engaging design projects in novel interactive environments.</AbstractNarration>
