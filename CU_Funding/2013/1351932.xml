    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on developing a better understanding of the sources of nitrogen oxide emissions to the atmosphere. Samples will be collected from several key sources such as vehicles, biomass burning, and emissions generated from soils. The fraction of isotopic nitrogen (15N) will be measured in each sample. This will enable ?fingerprints? to be developed for each of the important sources to the atmosphere. Being able to identify the contribution of major sources of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere has broad implications for addressing environmental issues, such as the formation of smog and acid rain, and for air quality modeling and decision making associated with source reduction strategies. This research will be integrated with a multi-faceted education program to increase the participation of minorities in science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new method has been developed to enable the measurement of nitrogen oxides (NOx) without having the samples subject to fractionation upon collection. The method uses a solution of NaOH with KMnO4 that reacts with both NO and NO2 in the gas phase yielding nitrate in solution. The method has been tested in the PI?s laboratory and found to have a good level of reproducibility based upon repeated measures of standards and samples. A field deployable system is being developed by pairing this technique with a method to determine the fraction of isotopic 15N of the NOx. The resulting characterization of NOx sources will enable tracing the sources of NOx for studies ranging from urban pollution to nitrogen fertilization in ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>
