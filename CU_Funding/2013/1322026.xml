    <AbstractNarration>This project, at the University of Toledo, creates an I-Corps Site at an institution that has a track-record in moving projects from the lab to commercialization. The UT entrepreneurial efforts focus on students and involves coaching, mentoring and innovation curriculum. In addition, this institution will designate physical space to the I-Corps Sites activity. This new I-Corps Site builds on the University of Toledo?s Innovation Enterprises (UTIE) which developed a technology commercialization paradigm called ?Lab to Launch.? Lab to launch engages stakeholders at various points along the tech transfer, prototyping, commercialization, seed/venture funding and market entry continuum of business creation. The UT Site is student-centric and there is strong integration of faculty-student interactions. The facilities currently provided, and that will be expanded, are substantial and provide a strong foundation for an I-Corps Site. In addition, the broader impacts may be significant, impacting on economic development in the region and matching well to the mission of the I-Corps Site goals.</AbstractNarration>
