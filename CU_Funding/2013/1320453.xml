    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to conduct a holistic protocol design for large-scale cognitive radio networks. To support a large number of wireless devices as secondary users that able to dynamically access available channels, it is necessary to design decentralized architecture and solutions for cognitive radio networks. Based on the decentralized architecture, this project addresses important problems in spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation and pricing, and spectrum usage monitoring and charging in dynamic spectrum access networks. More specifically, this project focuses on three research thrusts: (1) A robust collaborative spectrum sensing algorithm to tolerate arbitrary false data reports from adversaries, (2) An efficient spectrum allocation and pricing scheme for a large number of secondary users to share spectrum resources based on localized and approximation algorithms, and (3) A scheme for monitoring and charging the spectrum usage of secondary users without sacrificing secondary users' privacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed architecture and the solutions to the relevant problems have the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art of cognitive radio networking research, in particular, in improving the efficiency of spectrum sharing. The technology developed in this project will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and engineering applications and result in a significant impact on the society. The project will perform a wide range of education and outreach activities, including integration of research findings into courses and curricula, and involving under-represented students in research projects. Research results will be broadly disseminated through conference and journal publications, research talks, and via the Internet.</AbstractNarration>
