    <AbstractNarration>Small populations face unique risks associated with inbreeding and reduced genetic variation which can influence hybridization and/or disease susceptibility reducing viability and likelihood of survival. This is especially true for endangered populations, which are vulnerable to inbreeding and loss of variation because they are small by definition and frequently consist of related individuals. This study will examine whether inbreeding and low variation at genes important for disease resistance: (1) affect reproductive success and survivorship (fitness) in endangered red wolves; (2) cause red wolves to seek unrelated or genetically dissimilar mates including mates from closely related species, and; (3) affect red wolf disease susceptibility as measured by parasite load and immune assays that test the ability of blood to fight pathogens. Preliminary results reveal that red wolves are highly inbred and have little variation at genes important for disease resistance which may cause them to experience reduced fitness, hybridize with coyotes to avoid mating with kin, and increase their susceptibility to pathogens. Results will help wild red wolf recovery by informing managers about actions needed to increase reproductive success and survival, such as increasing genetic variability through the introduction of captive red wolves, screening potential red wolf mates for genetic compatibility, and increasing vaccination regimes to reduce pathogen infections. More broadly, this study may highlight the importance of maintaining large natural populations with high levels of genetic variation and increase understanding of the factors leading to hybridization and disease in endangered species. Finally, this study will integrate research and education by taking advantage of Louisiana State University's extensive high school and undergraduate student outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>
