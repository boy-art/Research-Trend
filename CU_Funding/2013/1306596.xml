    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Catherine J. Murphy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on a project focusing on the nanoparticle-biology interface. Gold nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes are being developed as "gold standards" for the field. The thermodynamics, kinetics, geometry and cooperativity of protein-nanoparticle binding are revealed by numerous spectroscopic and mass spectrometric methods. The major hypothesis to be tested is that the underlying surface chemistry of the nanoparticles dictates the final biological behavior of the entire ensemble. LeChatelier's Principle, familiar from general chemistry, is being tested on the nanoscale in the context of gold nanoparticle-protein interactions, since light absorption by the nanoparticles leads to heating, which in turn can lead to either stronger or weaker binding depending on the enthalpies of the interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fundamental work at the interface of nanoparticles and biological molecules is to enable future applications and best practices in the area of nanobiotechnology. The applications include photothermal destruction of pathogenic or cancerous cells; improved drug delivery vehicles based on nanoparticles; and improved sensors for molecular diagnostics. Graduate students and undergraduate students trained in the laboratory gain great transdisciplinary experience at the frontiers of science, including opportunities to explain their science to nonscientists. The PI is developing educational modules about nanotechnology and interfacial chemistry for massive open online courses, freely available to the world.</AbstractNarration>
