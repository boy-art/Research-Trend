    <AbstractNarration>Long-term data provide a valuable context to understand how landscapes and species adjust to variation in climate, changing land use, and a variety of disturbances. This project extends a twenty-six year study of 14 plant species by combining experiments with models to understand the effects of local and regional variation on plant population dynamics. Field experiments will vary water and ash addition and removal, competition, and seed additions. Survival, growth, fecundity, and recruitment will be measured in both undisturbed populations and experimental treatments, and these small-scale responses will then be linked with larger-scale changes in climate and fire regimes. Long-term data and experimental results will inform models that predict how different fire and climate conditions affect key plant species. In general, this research takes advantage of long-term demographic data on multiple co-occurring plant species to reveal how plants respond across different spatial scales to environmental change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research incorporates education efforts at multiple levels. It will support high school research assistants each summer and will fund post-baccalaureate interns, continuing a unique, highly productive, in-depth research experience. Graduate students will be trained through their participation in the research. The project will provide a wealth of statistical, ecological, and conservation information, contributing directly to conservation of Florida scrub, an imperiled ecosystem that is home to dozens of endangered species. Specialized workshops and continual interaction with local land managers and policy makers through collaborations and presentations will increase the practical value of the research findings. Specifically, the project will inform land managers using fire and other tools to conserve critically threatened plants. Public displays and art projects will directly convey information to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
