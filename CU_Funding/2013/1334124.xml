    <AbstractNarration>The PI requests funding to develop and implement a novel forward scatter reciprocal acoustic scintillation instrument to measure path-averaged hydrothermal vent flow (horizontal and vertical), and temperature along the acoustic path (mean and turbulence properties). The instrument will be capable of reciprocal transmission and reception of acoustic signals from two pairs of transceivers at two depths to measure the mean and turbulent properties of the horizontal flow and sound speed (temperature) along the acoustic path. In particular, the measurement of temperature by reciprocal acoustic paths will provide a direct measure of heat flux issuing from the vents and quantify the effect of suspended particles and turbulence on their measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrothermal vents are scientifically interesting. Hydrothermal vents also appeal to the broader public and hence can serve as a valuable vehicle to attract high school and undergraduate students to STEM activities. The PI has already demonstrated evidence that she has been able to involve high school teachers and students in her activities.</AbstractNarration>
