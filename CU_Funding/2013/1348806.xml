    <AbstractNarration>This project provides funding support in order to make awards to graduate students to attend the 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2014) to be held in Atlanta, Georgia on June 23-26, 2014. The IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is a premier international conference for presenting the research results, problem solutions, and insights on new challenges in dependability and security of computer systems and networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DSN 2014 will provide many and varied opportunities for student submission and participation. These opportunities range from full-length conference and workshop papers to medium-length preliminary contributions considered by the Student Forum to brief descriptions of early-stage research in the Work in Progress category. This project is focused primarily on broader impacts through the education students will receive from attending the technical sessions of DSN, mentoring that they will receive through the Student Forum activities, and networking opportunities they will receive through numerous different conference activities.</AbstractNarration>
