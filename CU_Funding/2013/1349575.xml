    <AbstractNarration>Mass spectrometry is a chemical analysis tool that has played an important role in the advance of cell biochemistry and large-scale methods to study biological systems. This workshop, Mass Spectrometry Big Data to Knowledge, will seek to identify new mathematical and computational frameworks to advance the use of data produced by mass spectrometry. As specific software tools and methods can be drivers and enablers of new experimental paradigms, this workshop will also consider next generation ideas, for example questions that are not possible to answer now, experimentally, but may be enabled by new mass spectrometry-based approaches. This workshop is sponsored by the Division of Chemistry, the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences, and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mass Spectrometry Big Data to Knowledge Workshop, led by Professor John Yates III of the Scripps Research Institute, will examine the current challenges in bioinformatics and their relationship to mass spectrometry technology. The areas of discussion will include: 1) Bottlenecks in data analysis- where people spend their time; 2) Assessment of current methods to translate data to knowledge, and discussion of their limitations and challenges associated with application of these methods to mass spectrometry data sets; 3) The flexibility of current algorithmic methodologies in the face of changing landscapes of both instrumental and computational technologies, and 4) Where does mass spectrometry data fit in biological studies, including the discovery of mechanisms of disease? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conclusions of this workshop will be disseminated to the scientific community through websites and a workshop report.</AbstractNarration>
