    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1309787 PI: Liu, Julie ORG: Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Protein-based Materials with Tunable Adhesive and Mechanical Properties&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Major, invasive surgical procedures introduce tissue damage from the use of sutures and staples. Designing effective surgical glues will be transformative owing to decreased tissue damage that occurs from these traditional joinery methods. At this time, however, there are no suitable materials that fulfill all of the major criteria for an effective surgical adhesive of soft tissues: (1) set in a wet environment, (2) create strong bonds, (3) be biocompatible, and (4) be flexible to match the stiffness of soft tissues being bonded together. This proposal will develop new biomaterials that combine the adhesive properties of mussel adhesive proteins, which mussels use to strongly bind themselves to surfaces, and the flexible properties of the protein elastin, which contributes to the ability of blood vessels to withstand the mechanical demands of pulsatile flow. These studies will establish the material design parameters that modulate the adhesive and mechanical properties of the proposed biomaterials, thus allowing us to tailor the material for several procedures in which surgical adhesives are needed. The specific objectives are to: (1) Develop a family of recombinant proteins with both adhesive and flexible regions, (2) Establish the relationship between protein design and the adhesive and elastomeric properties, and (3) Evaluate the potential of the proposed biomaterials in biological applications. As a result of this work, we expect to develop novel materials and demonstrate the potential for a soft tissue surgical adhesive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: By providing an alternative to sutures and staples, the proposed biomaterials will improve clinical outcomes for patients undergoing invasive surgeries. Moreover, the biomaterials may have other clinical applications such as implant coatings and tissue-engineered matrices. The proposed research will serve to provide the basis for training and mentoring of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Both investigators are committed to motivate and encourage females and underrepresented minorities to become engineers, as evidenced by past and future activities. Specifically, the PI will continue collaborating with the Purdue Women in Engineering Program and develop a laboratory module to engage K-12 female students with the concept of developing and evaluating adhesive materials. The co-PI will continue general public outreach efforts with media presentations. In addition, this proposal will support the active participation of community college students in research. Finally, we will disseminate the research results through published journal articles, presentation at national conferences, and inclusion in classroom material.</AbstractNarration>
