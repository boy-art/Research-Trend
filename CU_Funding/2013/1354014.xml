    <AbstractNarration>Seeds provide the majority of protein and calories in the diets of humans and livestock and are the primary means of propagation of field crops. Ovules are the developmental precursors to seeds and knowledge of the control of their development can enable modification of seed structure to alter stability, germination, nutrition, and processability, and to eliminate undesirable seeds from some fruits. While some genes controlling ovule development have been identified, there are significant gaps in our knowledge of the genetic regulation of this essential process. The awardees will utilize mutagenesis, genetics and emerging high-throughput sequencing and analysis methods to identify novel genes regulating ovule development through screening for modifiers of existing mutants. Once novel genes are identified, genetic interactions with known ovule developmental regulators will provide initial information on how the genes act during morphogenesis. Further analysis will include evaluation of protein interactions, determination of expression patterns and, if indicated, protein activity assays. The researchers will use these results to formulate a more complete picture of molecular regulation of ovule development and of mechanisms regulating morphogenesis in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project spans the areas of genetics, molecular biology, developmental biology and agriculture, and leverages new concepts in sequencing and bioinformatics for rapid gene identification. The project will provide training to junior scientists and students in a research laboratory setting in genetics, plant biology and the latest methods of gene and sequence analysis. Outreach efforts will promote interest in science and scientific research among high school and middle school students at institutions with high under-represented minority enrollment.</AbstractNarration>
