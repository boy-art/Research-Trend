    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1351881&lt;br/&gt;PI: Yaguo Wang, University of Texas at Austin&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Ultrafast Phonon Dynamics in Complex Nanostructures: Systematic Investigation with Ultrafast Phonon Spectroscopy and Femtosecond Thermal Reflectance Technique&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations and the major heat carriers in many crystalline materials. Our scientific understanding of phonons lags behind that of electrons and photons, mainly because of the difficulties in measuring and manipulating individual phonon. In bulk materials, the phonon transport is purely diffusive and governed by Fourier's Law. In nanostructures, phonons can travel ballistically, scatter at boundaries, interfaces and nanoparticles, and can be localized by quantum confinement effects. When different nanostructures are integrated together, phonon dynamics becomes exceptionally complicated. This research will investigate individual phonon behavior in complex nanostructures with ultrafast phonon spectroscopy and femtosecond time domain thermal reflectance technique. The effect of different nanostructures on specific phonon modes will be examined in detail through a systematic introduction of boundaries, interfaces, nanoparticles, and quantum wells into the material. Phonon lifetime and group velocity will be characterized for specific phonon modes with the ultrafast phonon spectroscopy, and the effect on macroscopic thermal conductivity will be measured by time domain thermal reflectance technique. Quantitative information will be provided about the effects resulting from the degree of lattice-mismatch, superlattice period, nanoparticle size, type and concentration, and the interplay of these mechanisms. The results will be used to validate the predictions from numerical and theoretical studies and bridge the gap between macroscopic thermal property measurements and microscopic phonon properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will address the fundamental heat transport problems encountered by researchers in a wide variety of disciplines: thermoelectrics, quantum cascade lasers, infrared detectors, and nanoelectronics. The new discoveries obtained from this study will be integrated into both graduate and undergraduate courses. This project will prepare next-generation leaders in thermal sciences, ultrafast optics, material science and physics. Outreach activities will include demonstrating research findings in pre-college programs focused on K-12 students, and providing research opportunities to undergraduate women mentored by graduate women. This project will also enhance diversity at University of Texas at Austin by actively recruiting graduate students from under-represented populations, such as women and minorities.</AbstractNarration>
