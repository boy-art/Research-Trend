    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This workshop focuses on the professional development of materials science and engineering CAREER awardees in the third year of their award. The workshop programming will consist of a combination of talks from mentors (renowned scientists and educators) and NSF personnel, as well as panel discussions and interactive sessions with mentors. Workshop topics will include entrepreneurship, innovations in classroom teaching, pivoting to new research areas, career-life balance, and NSF initiatives and operations. Research scientists with experience and success in these areas will serve as speakers, panelists, and mentors. Establishing connections with these role models will not only provide an opportunity for career advice, but also provide opportunities to develop meaningful and sustained relationships. This workshop will also enable CAREER awardees to network amongst themselves to form meaningful relationships, which may lead to new research collaborations. The outcomes of this workshop are expected to provide important input for increasing the impact of future NSF workshops in a similar category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this workshop is to assist CAREER awardees engaged in materials science and engineering research in continuing their paths to research and education leadership. The primary workshop participants will be third-year CAREER awardees from the Division of Materials Research as well as third-year CAREER awardees from other divisions who engage in materials-related research. The participants will be provided information about NSF operations, funding priorities, and other initiatives that will better position them to promote their research and take advantage of funding opportunities. Additionally, the participants will receive mentoring from renowned professors, department chairs, and former CAREER awardees, along with NSF program directors. This workshop will take place on June 17-18, 2013 at NSF headquarters in Arlington, VA.</AbstractNarration>
