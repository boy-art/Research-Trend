    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. The Wind River Conference on Procaryotic Biology will be held June 5-9, 2013 (and the first week of June in 2014 and 2015)in Estes Park, Colorado. The meeting will explore a variety of topics in procaryotic bioogy, including gene regulation, molecular biology, physiology, ecology, and evolution. The diversity of systems and topics characteristic of this meeting will provide a fertile environment for new ideas, and for applying well-established concepts to newly emerging systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The meeting organizers are committed to inclusion of a diverse group of participants, and historically, a significant feature of these meetings has been their accessibility to graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and even some very talented undergraduate researchers. Efforts are made to keep the costs affordable,and travel grants will be offered as Muriel Rogers and Arnold Ravin Scholarships in recognition of two founding conference members who contributed significantly to the genetic scientific discipline and who were active supporters of this conference in its early years.</AbstractNarration>
