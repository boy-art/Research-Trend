    <AbstractNarration>The project aims to improve the quality of service and lifetime of real-time&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems, particularly those implemented on multi-core platforms. In&lt;br/&gt;contrast with many other quality metrics, such as performance and power&lt;br/&gt;consumption, reliability is difficult to accurately estimate because it is&lt;br/&gt;influenced by design decisions, environmental conditions, and process variation&lt;br/&gt;during integrated circuit fabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of three main technical tasks. (1) Develop a reliability&lt;br/&gt;modeling and analysis framework that can efficiently and accurately determine&lt;br/&gt;the impact of design and runtime management decisions on reliability. (2)&lt;br/&gt;Develop a reliability-driven resource management framework, which includes&lt;br/&gt;runtime algorithms for assignment and scheduling of real-time tasks to maximize&lt;br/&gt;system lifetime while keeping soft error rates low, and a lightweight technique&lt;br/&gt;to adaptively adjust the activation frequency of the algorithms (i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;overhead). (3) Develop wear state monitoring techniques and data collection&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure to enable the runtime refinement and validation of system-level&lt;br/&gt;reliability models that require long-term in-field system deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques developed in this project will support the production of more&lt;br/&gt;reliable and/or less expensive electronic devices, enabling integrated&lt;br/&gt;circuits, which are susceptible to wear due to lifetime fault processes to be&lt;br/&gt;used in special-purpose computers with strict reliability and performance&lt;br/&gt;requirements. In particular, this project aims to ease the use of multicore&lt;br/&gt;processors in high-reliability computing applications with deadlines, such as&lt;br/&gt;automotive, multimedia, and health care applications. These applications have&lt;br/&gt;historically seen slow adoption of multicore processors, despite their price,&lt;br/&gt;performance, and power consumption benefits. We believe this is partially due&lt;br/&gt;to gaps in knowledge of how to control and optimize reliability on such&lt;br/&gt;systems, some of which this project will fill. The involvement of both industry&lt;br/&gt;researchers and university students at the undergraduate and graduate level&lt;br/&gt;will result in a broad dissemination of the research results.</AbstractNarration>
