    <AbstractNarration>There are both harmful and benign bacteria and viruses all around us. Scientists use a technique called metagenomics to characterize these organisms by extracting DNA from a sample, and deciphering the genetic code of all of the DNA sequences. The scientific approach typified by metagenomics is to generate data and rely on large, fast, computers to solve complex problems. The Computational Enhancement of Analytical Metagenomics Systems award supports this work with computational infrastructure and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The team working on this project are world-leaders in the development of tools and analyses for metagenomics data. The computational infrastructure enabled by this award continues their leadership in this area for the coming decade. The computing infrastructure is also used by researchers at both San Diego State and other Universities in California, the United States, and around the world. The infrastructure enables the researchers to tackle really difficult problems that they couldn't approach before. An ~500 core computer cluster including machines with lots of memory and disk storage space allows the scientists to run their massive computations required to analyze this data to protect our nation, develop new therapeutics and understand our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This proposal directly supports an NSF Transforming Undergraduate Education in Science program that teaches genomics and metagenomics to undergraduate students at San Diego State University, an Hispanic-Serving Institution. Over the last six years SDSU has improved the graduation rate of all students by providing access to cutting edge research equipment like that proposed here.</AbstractNarration>
