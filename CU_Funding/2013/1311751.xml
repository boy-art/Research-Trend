    <AbstractNarration>1311751 (Arumugam). This conference will convene climate scientists, hydrologists, forecasting agencies, water utilities, reservoir operators and water management agencies together to advance understanding of the challenges and opportunities in developing hydroclimate forecasts relevant to water resources management. The conference will be held in Portland, OR during the end of July-begining of August, 2013. Over four days, the participants will focus on various issues related to hydroclimate forecasts and water management by addressing the following science questions: (1) What are the key sources of uncertainties that challenge development of skillful hydroclimate forecasts at daily, seasonal and interannual time scales? (2) How best do we reduce the uncertainty and improve reliability in downscaling largescale climate information for developing regional hydroclimate forecasts? (3) What are the key challenges in using probabilistic streamflow information in operational water resource management models and decision tools? (4) What are the limitations in applying streamflow forecasts for real-time applications? (5) How can we bridge the gaps between forecast producers (agencies, research institutions) and forecast consumers (water resource managers, operational agencies) for improving forecast applications in water management? These questions will be addressed in oral and poster sessions with invited and contributed talks. Also included will be a panel discussion for each day of the conference to discuss the critical points from the day?s oral and poster sessions. The conveners will prepare a monograph on ?Seasonal to Interannual Hydroclimate Forecasts for Water Resources Management? based on the invited talks and panel discussions. NSF funds will be used primarily to support participation of young faculty, students and minorities from the US.</AbstractNarration>
