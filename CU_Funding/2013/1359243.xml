    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of North Dakota (UND), located in Grand Forks, ND, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014-18. The scientific focus of the REU program is on environmental influences on gene expression. Research will be conducted under the mentorship of faculty at UND, Cankdeska Cikana Community College (Fort Totten, ND) and Turtle Mountain Community College (Belcourt, ND). Mentors will work closely with students to develop an independent research project. Some example projects include investigation into how environmentally determined changes in gene expression influence learning in fish, sex-determination in turtles, stress tolerance in nematodes, and wing patterning in butterflies and moths. Students will receive training in molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics, and others. In addition to the hands-on research experience, students will attend weekly seminars and workshops in which they will learn about science writing, ethical and responsible research conduct, and the graduate school application process. One of the goals of the program is to foster a sense of community amongst student participants and UND faculty. Therefore, although each student will be matched with a specific mentor, they will also have the opportunity to work and socialize with the other students and UND faculty. At the end of the program, students will present their findings at a symposium that is open to the public. The program will be assessed using pre- and post-surveys, as well as the REU common assessment tool. Students are provided a stipend, housing, meal allowance, and funds for travel to and from UND. Subsidized child care and family living accommodations are provided to students with dependents, using other funding sources. The program seeks students with a genuine interest in pursuing a career in science research and/or teaching. Students from groups that are historically underrepresented in the sciences, such as those from rural and tribal colleges with limited research opportunities, are especially encouraged to apply. Selection criteria include academic performance, as well as educational and career goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary mission of the program is to encourage students, particularly those from historically under-represented groups, to pursue graduate degrees in the sciences and enter careers that help strengthen science education, research, and literacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.
