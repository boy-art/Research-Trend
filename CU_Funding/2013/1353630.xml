    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses enhanced MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) technology to boost capacity, coverage, and enhance link robustness in wireless communications without using additional spectrum. This is accomplished by transmitting independent data streams all at the same frequency but on different antennas. MIMO technologies have been widely adopted and have been incorporated into the 802.11n and 802.11ac WiFi, WiMax, and the LTE-A cellular standards. However, for MIMO systems, the computational complexity required to detect data symbols increases dramatically as the system size (number of antennas) and data constellation size increases. Thus, MIMO symbol detection has become a critical step for wireless communication systems. Lattice-reduction (LR)-aided MIMO equalization has shown great potential to reduce complexity and improve the performance. This research develops and transitions advanced LR-aided equalization technology to real-time, hardware implementations that meet the stringent requirements of next generation wireless communication systems. These advanced LR-aided equalization techniques can reach near-optimal performance (an additional 5-20 dB of signal-to-noise-ratio gain relative to common equalizers currently used in industry). This project will result in the creation of a commercial-grade hardware implementation capable of realizing these gains in existing systems at only a slight increase in cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project extends to nearly all high-speed wireless data communications including WiFi, cellular, and backhaul/infrastructure. The advanced LR technology can be implemented in MIMO receivers to improve range, power, and spectral efficiency without requiring changes to existing standards or infrastructure. Furthermore, the advanced LR technology also enables the development of future systems with higher-order MIMO for higher data rates and better reliability. This project will develop and commercialize integrated circuit designs that directly address the problem of spectrum crunch being experienced by wireless network providers seeking to supply ever increasing data rates to meet customers? demands. This project will also establish a conduit for commercialization of further advances in communications and enhance the research partnership between the investigators and the researchers in the wireless communication industry facilitating application of scientific discoveries to the application domains.</AbstractNarration>
