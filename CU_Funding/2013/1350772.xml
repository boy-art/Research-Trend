    <AbstractNarration>In the last century, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of emerging infectious diseases that pose significant risks to wild and domestic animal and human populations. Moreover, greater than 60% of all human infectious diseases have originated in animals, including West Nile virus and avian influenza virus, for which birds serve as the sources. A prominent knowledge gap in disease epidemiology is an understanding of the factors that influence variation in infectiousness of individuals. This project has four main objectives: (1) Test how variation in host body condition, through food restriction, affects how a bird responds to West Nile virus, using American robin (Turdus migratorius) as a focal species. (2) Use genome-wide technologies to investigate how gene expression mediates variation in viral shedding using low pathogenic avian influenza virus and two species of waterfowl, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and blue-winged teal (A. discors). (3) Develop simulation models that are parameterized with the data collected in experiments to investigate the effects of individual variation on pathogen dynamics at the population level. (4) Adapt the models to allow college, non-STEM students in general sciences to learn about disease dynamics. Through a user-friendly computer interface students will be able to manipulate environmental stressors associated with climate change and/or other anthropogenic disturbances, and then track disease outcomes that are host and pathogen specific. Implementing a computer simulation exercise that illustrates concepts taught throughout the semester and allows students to answer relevant and thought-provoking questions will improve a student's learning experience in the large class environment. Overall this CAREER project will increase the understanding about the basis for variation in pathogen load and also which individuals may shed the highest pathogen loads (i.e. 'supershedders'), allowing development of more realistic epidemiological models that lead to cost-effective, targeted prevention and control strategies.</AbstractNarration>
