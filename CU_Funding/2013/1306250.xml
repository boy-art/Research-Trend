    <AbstractNarration>Experiments at rare isotope beam facilities open the door to new regions of exotic nuclei. Data gathered at these facilities is essential for accurate extrapolations of the equation of state of nucleonic matter in density, temperature, and proton fraction and is expected to impact the direct comparison of astrophysical observations with results of sophisticated simulations of neutron stars and supernovae. The projects funded by this award address fundamental theoretical aspects of nuclear physics using effective field theory and renormalization group methods to develop a systematic expansion of nuclear forces and decouple troublesome high-energy contributions from the low-energy parts we want to describe. The results are controlled, model-independent calculations that can exploit efficiently the steady improvements in computing power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training received by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates in carrying out the proposed activities contributes directly to the building of a diverse scientific workforce. The mix of analytical and numerical computation employed is excellent preparation for both academic and industrial research. The emphasis on universal aspects of physical systems, fostered by effective field theory and renormalization group approaches, as well as the direct application of techniques to problems beyond the nuclear domain, leads to enhanced collaborations between disciplines. Broader training in low-energy nuclear theory for both theorists and experimentalists is provided by participation in the TALENT (Training in Advanced Low Energy Nuclear Theory) initiative.</AbstractNarration>
