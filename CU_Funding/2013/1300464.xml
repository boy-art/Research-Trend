    <AbstractNarration>This award funded through the NSF Chemical Synthesis program supports work in the research group of John F. Berry at the University of Wisconsin--Madison aimed at using multiple inorganic functional groups to promote multi-electron processes. Here an "inorganic functional group" is defined as a unit capable of at least one redox reaction. Thus, combining multiple functional groups should lead to the observation of multiple redox reactions available to the same molecule. For example, a compound having a Mo(II)-Mo(II) quadruple bond 'functional group' can undergo two-electron oxidation to yield a triply-bonded Mo(III)-Mo(III) species, and a metal-oxo 'functional group' can undergo two-electron oxygen atom transfer processes. These two functional groups can be combined in such a way as to permit reversible four-electron redox and O-atom transfer reactions to take place. In this work, the exploration of compounds that combine inorganic functional groups will provide a pathway towards the discovery of new multi-electron reactions. The inorganic functional groups to be studied range from metal-metal multiple bonds, including metal oxo, carbene, and nitrido compounds, to heterometallic species in which each metal serves as a separate functional group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-electron reactions are very important in chemistry as well as in biological processes. For example, multi-electron reductions of molecules such as molecular oxygen are not only biologically important, occurring in aerobic respiration, but also play key roles in important energy-related technologies, such as fuel cells and water splitting. A fundamental challenge in the chemical community is to improve the efficiency of such multi-electron reactions. New ways to facilitate multielectron chemistry are of great significance, and this award supports a conceptual advance aimed toward the discovery of new multi-electron reactions. This advance involves combining traits of different transition metal compounds, each individually capable of electron transfer, into new compounds able to perform multi-electron transfer.</AbstractNarration>
