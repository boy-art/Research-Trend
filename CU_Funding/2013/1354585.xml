    <AbstractNarration>Aging and tissue death is a normal part of plant growth, but a leaf-feeding moth (Philodoria) has developed an extraordinary life-history strategy: its larvae can delay plant tissue from aging thereby giving the moth an adaptive advantage when food resources are limiting. This phenomenon has helped the insects achieve extraordinary localized diversity and become a major component of island ecosystems. This remarkable process is little understood, but has the potential to transform a broad spectrum of biological processes and increase understanding of the interactions between insects and plants. This project will generate a systematic framework, integrating molecular and morphological data, to revise the taxonomy and test hypotheses on the moth evolution, biogeography, and diversification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educating the next generation of biologists is essential at a time when global natural resources are diminishing. Project participants will teach the importance of biodiversity to the public through workshops and the PIs will train students of many levels (graduate students, undergraduates and high school students). Students, including minority and underrepresented students, will participate in fieldwork and disseminate information broadly via social media. This project will increase public awareness of the need to conserve endemic island biodiversity, including these plant-insect interactions that are important to horticulture and agriculture.</AbstractNarration>
