    <AbstractNarration>Polymers and polymeric composites are appealing for many engineering applications, from parts of aircraft, civil infrastructures, to retrofitting nuclear reactor containment concrete structures, etc. One of the main issues in utilizing polymeric based structures is associated to their durability under combined mechanical loadings and hostile environmental conditions, such as temperature fluctuations and diffusion/reactions of various substances through these structures. These complex loadings will cause material degradation at different scales, and eventually lead to structural failure. This workshop on "Durability of Polymers and Polymeric Composites. will be part of the NIST's and Underwriters Laboratories" workshop on "Service Life Prediction of Polymeric Materials: Vision for the Future". The NSF workshop consists of two sessions and discussion panel. There will be twelve speakers from academic, national laboratories, and industry. In addition, a poster-session given by graduate students is integrated as part of the overall workshop. The goal of this workshop is to bring together national eminent researchers who are actively working in the field of durability of polymeric engineering materials. They will share recent developments in modeling and experimental understanding/assessment of the degradation and life prediction of polymers and polymeric composite structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are still many unresolved scientific issues on understanding the failure mechanisms in polymeric based structures under constant exposure to hostile environments and complex mechanical loading. The interaction between national and international scientists and manufacturers present at the NIST workshop is expected to have tremendous impact in resolving current durability issues in many engineering applications. The outcome of this meeting is to address some of the current challenges and identify common research priorities in durability of polymers and polymeric composites. This meeting will also open opportunities for US researchers in academia to collaborate with researchers from national laboratories and industry partners, for further enhancing current methods in predicting life performance and degradation in polymers under various loading histories. This workshop also promotes the participation of women and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
