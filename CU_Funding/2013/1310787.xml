    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Julia M. Moriarty of Virginia Institute of Marine Science, the College of William &amp; Mary to conduct a research project in the Geosciences area during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "The Influence of Typhoons on Along-River Sediment Fluxes." The host scientist is Dr. Shuh-Ji Kao.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding changes in the transport of riverine material is crucial for estimating sediment budgets, but particulate fluxes vary widely in response to storms and other disturbances. Taiwan offers a unique opportunity to study these fluxes because of the exceptional historical and ongoing records of river discharge (water and sediment) along its small mountainous rivers, and because the island's sediment yields (riverine sediment discharge divided by watershed area) rank among the world's highest. Analysis of the historical record of daily and hourly river gauge data enables analysis of along-river fluxes during both low-energy periods and typhoons (e.g. 1996: Typhoon Herb; 2004: Typhoons Mindulle and Aere). This project will make measurements along the Jhuoshuei River (previously named the Choshui River) in 2013, including sediment concentration and grain size, in order to supplement the historical data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the research is being incorporated into an interactive activity to engage visitors at Marine Science Day, an annual open house at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) where attendance annually exceeds 1,500 people. This activity is also being developed into a grade-school lesson plan in collaboration with VIMS Marine Advisory Program educators.</AbstractNarration>
