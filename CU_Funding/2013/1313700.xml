    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to the National Academy of Sciences to support the Board on Life Sciences to: 1) hold one Board meeting per year, and 2) support staff time to develop topics for new studies and other projects and perform tasks related to completed studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board on Life Sciences serves as the National Academy of Sciences' focal point for a wide range of technical and policy topics in the life sciences, including genomics, biodiversity conservation, bioterrorism, and key topics in basic biolgical and biomedical research, such as stem cells. The Board organizes and oversees studies that provide advice to government and the scientific community on the biological sciences and their impact on society. The Board also oversees important studies on the improvement of biology education, particularly at the undergraduate level, and the maintenance of a robust life sciences workforce.
