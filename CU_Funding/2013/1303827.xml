    <AbstractNarration>The conference "Algebra, Combinatorics and Representation Theory" will take place April 24-28, 2013 at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. The objective of the conference is to disseminate progress in a diverse but interconnected set of topics in Lie theory and cluster theory as well as build and maintain connections between researchers in these various areas. Among the topics considered will be (1) cluster algebras and cluster categories, (2) allied geometry, including Poisson-Lie groups and moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces, (3) quantum groups, categorification and canonical bases, (4) the general representation theory of Lie groups, algebras and Lie superalgebras. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics of the conference lie on the interface between many different areas of mathematics, bringing together discrete mathematics (in the form of combinatorics) with continuous mathematics (in the form of Lie theory) and creating new and unexpected connections. By bringing together distinguished senior mathematicians in several fields with talented young mathematicians, we aim to create new opportunities for tying together seemingly separate fields. The grant will provide funding for 40-45 participants with special emphasis on graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s to attend the conference.
