    <AbstractNarration>The twelfth annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference will be held at the University of Texas at Austin, April 5 and 6, 2014. The conference will bring together approximately 170 graduate students from mathematics programs across the country. The topics discussed and presented will include a wide range of subfields in geometry and topology including low-dimensional topology, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and differential geometry. There will be two plenary talks by distinguished faculty members, Robion Kirby from the University of California Berkeley and Tony Pantev from the University of Pennsylvania, to expose graduate students to groundbreaking research. There will also be six talks by young faculty members who will present new avenues of research and important open questions. The majority of the talks (at least 24) will be given by graduate student participants. They will have the opportunity to explain their studies and original research to their peers in the field. The conference will provide sufficient time in between talks for participants to ask questions, discuss their perspectives on open problems, exchange ideas, and build friendships with a network of future coworkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twelfth annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is one of the largest meetings aimed specifically at graduate students. It provides a valuable training experience for graduate students to present their work to a large audience which includes specialists in that field, beginners eager to learn, and specialists in related fields. Listening to talks by faculty and graduate students exposes participants to ideas from a wide range of perspectives and informs them of progress being made on problems by mathematicians outside of their home university. Discussions with fellow students about common mathematical interests precedes joint research in the future. The Graduate Student Geometry and Topology Conference provides the groundwork for a connected, communicative, new generation of US mathematicians in a range of interrelated fields.&lt;br/&gt;More information about the conference can be found at: http://ma.utexas.edu/conferences/gstgc14/.</AbstractNarration>
