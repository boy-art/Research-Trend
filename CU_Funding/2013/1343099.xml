    <AbstractNarration>This I-Corp Team project investigates a high-precision (better than 1m in a 3-dimensional space) indoor location technology that uses only existing WiFi signals. The WiFi signal sensors employed by this technology operate independently, which eliminates the need to physically link sensors to each other and simplifies the installation of the technology. The core of this technology is an algorithm that employs clustered receivers to provide time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) information without requiring timing synchronization of any kind, resolving the major technical challenge of TDOA- based high precision positioning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clustered TDOA localization algorithm ? the core of this system, may resolve the challenges of existing location-based services (LBS) by enabling high-precision accuracy. For the individual user ? the technology utilizes existing WiFi hardware in SmartPhones, and therefore only requires installation of a software application. Widespread use of this technology could enable rapid growth of indoor LBS, which largely impacts advertising-centric services to consumers at retail points of sale.</AbstractNarration>
