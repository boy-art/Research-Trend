    <AbstractNarration>Researchers are working on a technology for 24/7 detection of bridge scour. The system leverages advances in sensor technologies to provide cost-effective early detection of bridge scour and the means to avoid bridge failure and associated costs. The scour sensing technology uses magnetostrictive flow sensors that are buried in the soil around bridge foundations. As scour develops and the soil begins to erode, the sensors are activated and able to detect water flow and automatically alert the bridge owner that remediation is needed. The macroscale and nanoscale magnetostrictive fluidic sensors investigated with prior NSF support are the basis for the advanced flow sensors system that is being used to provide robust and continuous detection of bridge scour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scour monitoring is a federally mandated part of regular bridge inspections but often bridge owners do not have sufficient manpower to inspect their entire bridge inventories more than once every year or two. Scour can thus go undetected for long periods of time and develop into very costly and even life threatening problems. The candidate scour detection system could both improve public safety and save costs to the owners of bridges. This is because the early scour detection can significantly reduce repair costs, which in cases of advanced scour, can involve the cost of a complete bridge replacement. A bridge experiencing or at risk of even moderate scour may be closed resulting in a significant economic impact on the surrounding communities. Often the solution to moderate to severe scour is replacement of an otherwise sound bridge at a significant cost. Early scour can be repaired at a cost of a few thousand dollars but late stage scour can cost a few hundred thousand to repair or millions if the bridge needs to be replaced.</AbstractNarration>
