    <AbstractNarration>1358368 (Spanos) This award is for partial support of the "Energy Technologies and Carbon Dioxide Management Symposium" which is to be held at the TMS 2014 Annual Meeting and Exhibition, February 16 - 20, 2014, at the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego, California. At this symposium, participation by students and other young investigators is viewed as critical to the fostering of future generations of materials scientists and engineers. NSF funding will be employed for registration support and/or partial travel support for at least 5 students and 3 post docs or special attendees. Appropriate students, postdoctoral fellows, or special attendees will be identified by the organizing committee of the symposium. This symposium will address issues, intricacies and challenges relating to energy and environmental sciences. It will cover various technological aspects of sustainable energy eco-systems and processes that improve energy efficiency, and reduce and sequestrate carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse emissions. It will also emphasize the need for sustainable technologies in extractive metallurgy, materials processing and manufacturing industries with&lt;br/&gt;reduced energy consumption and CO2 emission. Industrial energy efficient technologies include innovative ore beneficiation, smelting technologies, recycling and waste heat recovery. Topics will include (but are not limited) to the following areas: CO2 and Other Greenhouse Gas Reduction Metallurgy, Renewable Energy Resources for Metals and Materials Production, Photo-electrochemical Reduction of CO2, Waste Heat Recovery and Other Industrial Energy Efficient Technologies, Energy Education and Energy Regulation, Life Cycle Assessment and Carbon Footprint, Carbon&lt;br/&gt;Sequestration Techniques, Energy Process Fundamentals, and Thermo-electric/Electrolysis. Contributed talks are encouraged for inclusion in a special session on energy education. The support provided to student attendees will contribute to U.S. workforce development by giving students and other young investigators the opportunity to learn from and network with leaders in the field. Additionally, some of the supported students may present their own research.&lt;br/&gt;The question of how to reduce CO2 emissions is of broad concern for both the scientific community and society at large given the emerging concern surrounding global climate change. In light of this, fundamental technical research exploring all aspects of CO2 emission reduction from manufacturing process modification, to novel carbon recapture technologies, to changes in basic educational approaches is needed. This symposium provides the ideal forum for leaders&lt;br/&gt;in the materials arena to tackle this challenge.</AbstractNarration>
