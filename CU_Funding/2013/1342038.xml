    <AbstractNarration>The CREST-funded Cyber-ShARE Center of Excellence, a center focused on advancing research and education through cyberinfrastructures in support of interdisciplinary efforts, serves as the anchor for the project, Increasing STEM Participation and Success Rates of Latino Youth Using Culturally Relevant Immersive Technologies. The goal of the proposed work is to study the effectiveness of augmenting STEM-integrated learning modules with culturally relevant, immersive technologies and determine its impact on Latino middle school students' performance in STEM and motivation to study STEM topics. With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students who enter and complete STEM education at all levels. The project activities include development and delivery of integrated STEM modules that connect locally and culturally relevant materials with the Smithsonian's Mi Tierra-Mi Mundo interactive role play exploratory game and professional training that scaffolds Mi-Tierra-Mi Mundo and STEM modules to present in traditional STEM settings. The project will use a longitudinal mixed methods randomized control trial research design to determine what aspects of the intervention affect the differential participation and success rates of students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has two unique and important features. First, it aims to enhance knowledge and develop dispositions for STEM among Latino students in the context of integrated STEM content and activities. Second, the project will introduce innovative technology-based simulations of real-world situations that engage Latino students to address STEM issues related to local watershed problems. These strategies can be adapted for other STEM areas and teacher education programs. Prototype activities are adaptable to a variety of teacher professional development efforts, and the proposed technologies for implementing and teaching simulations will be widely available for use in the classroom and outreach settings.</AbstractNarration>
