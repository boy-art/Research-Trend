    <AbstractNarration>1343492 &lt;br/&gt;Kaluarachchi &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports a US-Egypt workshop on water resources to share research expertise related to hydrology and water resources, to develop a roadmap for future Egypt-US collaborative research; and to identify support opportunities for that research. The outline for this workshop was endorsed for funding by the US-Egypt Joint S&amp;T Board in its May 2012 meeting in Cairo, Egypt. The US organizer is Dr. Jagath Kaluarachchi, Utah State University and the Egyptian co-organizer is Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Motaleb, President of the National Water Research Center in Cairo, Egypt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The workshop is to bring US and Egyptian scientists to exchange information on research practices in addressing water shortages, and discuss areas of research needs including: non-conventional water; remote sensing in irrigation water management; impact of climate change; and transboundary water issues. Water issues are highly relevant for Egypt's future and for other countries facing water shortages and the 4 topics are all very important in the context of Egypt's water resources. The proposed workshop should enhance collaboration between Egyptian and US universities and water resources agencies. The project may significantly contribute to water resources research through the introduction of new techniques for addressing projected water shortages in Egypt and other countries. Participants from Egypt will include senior and junior hydrology and water resource scientists from governmental research centers and from universities. The US identified participants have a broad range of expertise and represent a number of US universities with major water resources research programs as well as from USG agencies, and the PI has substantial international water resources experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposal brings together Egyptian and US experts to address topics of importance for the management of the water resources in Egypt and in similar conditions. It is highly likely that this will lead to catalyzing new collaborations between US and Egyptian experts in water resources and engineering. The selected research themes to be discussed all have broad impact, including contribution to water resources management in an area where water is a scarce commodity, and contribution to education and capacity building in Egypt. The project will also expose US researchers to water resources issues in other countries and involve them in international collaboration. The workshop could potentially have significant impacts on the development of sound water management and practices in Egypt and in similar settings elsewhere in the arid regions in the world. The benefits to the host country can be very significant including the identification and development of innovative water saving techniques. This proposal is supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program where NSF supports the US side and the Government of Egypt funds the Egyptian side.</AbstractNarration>
