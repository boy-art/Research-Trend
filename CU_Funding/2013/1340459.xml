    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to characterize how the content and depth of students? ethnographic&lt;br/&gt;investigations impact their design decisions, specifically as students define the problem,&lt;br/&gt;develop design requirements and engineering specifications, select concepts, and develop&lt;br/&gt;validation studies. Successful design solutions must be practical in the cultural context in which&lt;br/&gt;they will be used. While all engineering students are not able to participate in a substantial&lt;br/&gt;cultural immersion experience, a clear understanding of how these skills develop, the&lt;br/&gt;challenges students face, and how design ethnography affects later stages of design will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate the development and integration of these techniques into engineering design courses&lt;br/&gt;as well as the development of validated metrics to evaluate proficiency in design ethnography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance of this research is to provide undergraduate engineering students with&lt;br/&gt;pedagogy, curricula, and experiences that teach them ethnographic and co-creation skills. The&lt;br/&gt;result will be design solutions that better address user needs for emerging global technological&lt;br/&gt;challenges. The ability of engineers to conduct ethnographic studies and use the data to make&lt;br/&gt;effective design decisions will facilitate the development of innovative, practical, and&lt;br/&gt;implementable solutions that address this century?s global challenges.</AbstractNarration>
