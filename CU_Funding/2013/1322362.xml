    <AbstractNarration>A major objective of the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference is to bring together every two years leading members of the scientific community, graduate students, and post docs to discuss new, cutting-edge research projects in marine chemistry within an informal setting. In 2013, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held August 4-9, 2013 at the University of New England, Maine. The theme for this year's conference will be "Chemical Geography of the Sea" and aims to synthesize the advances made in Chemical Oceanography due to high resolution measurements from global scale survey programs such as CLIVAR and GEOTRACES as well as smaller regional studies. The primary goal of the conference is to provide a forum that brings together scientists that are leading contributors in the field of marine chemistry and graduate students/postdocs to exchange ideas on new, innovative research. . Presentations and discussions at the 2013 Gordon Conference will center around the following session topics: (1) Overview of the US GEOTRACES North Atlantic Section; (2) Results from US GEOTRACES North Atlantic Section; (3) Processes at Ocean Boundaries; (4) Carbon, Oxygen, and the Biological Pump; (5) Towards a Definition of Ocean Biogeochemical Provinces; (6) Biogeography of Organic Compounds in Seawater; (7) Time-Series in Redox-Active Regimes; (8) Regional Seas and Margin Processes; and (9) Geography of Benthic and Nearshore Processes. The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and to forge new scientific alliances. For this reason, the National Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of at least 15 graduate student/post docs and 28 invited speakers/discussion leaders/chairs in the 2013 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference.</AbstractNarration>
