    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to improve the capacity and energy efficiency of different lossy wireless networks with different processing capabilities. The proposed approach is to synergistically and systematically combine two types of coding in wireless networks: intra and intersession network coding. The first one resolves bottlenecks by coding the packets of different flows, while the second one provides robustness to the link failures by coding the packets of the same flow together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The research has three major thrusts. The first thrust investigates the characterization and the fundamental limits of the proposed approach in lossy wireless networks under different settings. The settings include the unicast and multicast cases, the use of coding over multihops, and the use of coding with other traffic engineering techniques. The second thrust involves the design of distributed network protocols based on the insights drawn from the characterization. The designed protocols are ensured to be compatible with the current Internet and computer network standards. The final thrust deals with deploying the proposed protocols in different application settings and developing a simulator that captures the actual behavior of the protocols in different wireless networking scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This research has the potential to increase the role of coding in wireless networks, as it will tackle the fundamental characterization of coding in these networks. Research results will be integrated into the community mesh network of the city of Philadelphia. The protocols developed will also impact the broader community through programs at Temple University.</AbstractNarration>
