    <AbstractNarration>According to the American Mathematical Society, of the 1644 PhDs in mathematics awarded in 2012, just 80 were awarded to Hispanics. Of those, only 13 were awarded to Hispanic women. California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) intends to address the disproportionately low rate of graduate-level success from a variety of underrepresented groups indicated by these and other statistics by implementing a program of comprehensive preparation for undergraduate students aspiring to graduate study in mathematics, the Graduate Readiness and Access in Mathematics (GRAM) program. In addition to the students supported directly, GRAM will impact the larger CSUF community by providing the faculty with a sustainable institutional framework in which to support graduate school ambitions of CSUF students who are beyond the reach of direct GRAM funding. GRAM will also provide a model for other institutions, particularly Hispanic-serving institutions, for preparing their students to succeed in graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRAM program will consist of several components: (a) a Pre-GRAM program designed to create awareness of research opportunities and graduate school, (b) rigorous content preparation aimed at mathematical readiness for graduate studies, (c) undergraduate research, (d) training for the general and subject Graduate Record Examinations, (e) training and development of problem-solving skills, (f) participation in a variety of relevant professional conferences, (g) cultural and family support, (h) financial support for GRAM Scholars to decrease their work outside of academic activities, and (i) professional development that includes guidance on graduate school decisions, time and stress management, collaboration and networking skills, and skills tied to writing, reading, discussing, and exploring mathematics effectively. The undergraduate research projects that will be supported will span various fields of mathematics and mathematics education. Projects will deal with topics such as interpreting algebraic relations in terms of curvature invariants, characterizing elements in semigroups and groups that possess kth roots under a given operation, modeling human vision in detecting tumors using images from magnetic resonance imaging, using biomimetic pattern recognition with hyper-dimensional planes for cancer screening, statistical validation of a cognitive test for multiple sclerosis, and measuring the educational impact of supplemental instruction classes on students and leaders. This project is supported jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Divisions of Undergraduate Education and Human Resource Development within the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.</AbstractNarration>
