    <AbstractNarration>An international conference on Novel Directions in Inverse Scattering" will take place at the University of Delaware, Newark, July 29 - August 2, 2013 The organizing committee for this conference is F. Cakoni, University of Delaware (chair), L. Borcea, Rice University, Houssem Haddar, Ecole Polytechnique, France, Peter Monk, University of Delaware. For more information on the meeting please visit http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~colton/ This Conference will be a gathering of international experts as well as junior researchers in the area of inverse scattering theory with the focus being on novel techniques for solving inverse scattering problems. On the basis of current research trends and the wide spectrum of inverse scattering applications, we focus on the following topics at the forefront of research in this area: non-iterative techniques to determine the physical properties of complex penetrable targets (obstacles) with anisotropy, attenuation, or internal length scales as well as the reconstruction of surface- or line-like objects in a three- dimensional environment; cloaking; imaging through complex background media with e.g. random or periodic heterogeneities; multi-frequency and time-domain extensions of the existing monochromatic solutions; adaptive sensing; thermo-acoustic and other multi-modal imaging techniques. The conference will feature plenary talks given by international experts on the aforementioned topics, invited minisymposium speakers organized and contributed posters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inverse problems typically occur when we wish to infer properties of objects from remote measurements. The topics of the conference involve rapidly developing mathematics at the frontiers on today's research in the area of inverse problems. Applicability of these type of mathematics extends to many real life applications including medical imaging, non-destructive testing, underground imaging and oil exploration, cloaking an enhance visibility. The conference will also bridge the gap between theoretical and more applied aspects of inverse scattering problems. The exchange of ideas will be beneficial to both theoretical and applied aspects of research in inverse scattering theory. This gathering will also celebrate the scientific accomplishments of Professor David Colton.</AbstractNarration>
