    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Craig M. Anderson of the Chemistry Department at Bard College will investigate the synthesis of transition cyclometalated complexes. The study of these complexes may advance the understanding of fundamental catalytic reactions and eventually contribute in areas with energy implications, as cyclometalated complexes are well known in the study of artificial photosynthetic devices. Another very important aspect of this work is that it will involve undergraduates at all levels from first-year to senior students. It will also allow students to gain experience in many diverse skills and techniques such as synthesis, characterization, and analysis of results. The students will become well trained in order to continue further scientific studies, disseminate their work through written publications and oral presentations, and develop new hypotheses for testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyclometalated transition metal complexes are a very versatile group of compounds whose varied applications include acting as catalysts, sensors, artificial photosynthetic devices, and bio-organometallic agents. The effect that ligand architecture exerts on selectivity and reactivity of cyclometalated complexes is important to understand, as the coordination environment determines both reaction functionality and efficacy. First, the physical and chemical properties of these cyclometalated compounds will be tuned to maximize their benefits, which include catalysis and anti-cancer agents. Second, studying the regiochemistry of C-H and C-X bond activation will be examined in the area of synthetic chemistry. Third, several multi-heteronuclear species will be synthesized and their interaction with biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA will be examined</AbstractNarration>
