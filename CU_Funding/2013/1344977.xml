    <AbstractNarration>The proposed grant will promote the design, development and analysis of mobile computing and wireless networking technologies, systems, and applications by encouraging student participation in the ACM Mobicom 2012 conference. Besides technical paper presentations, MobiCom, through this grant, will be able to stimulate several intellectual activities by students including potentially killer apps (through the mobile app competition) and breakthrough research (through the student research competition, and the S3 workshop). Furthermore, the conference offers several opportunities for intellectually stimulating discussions between&lt;br/&gt;the students and researchers from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation of students in MobiCom can have an important impact on their development as a junior researcher. The grant will also promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other underrepresented minorities to participate.</AbstractNarration>
