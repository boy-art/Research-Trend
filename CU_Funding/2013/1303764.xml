    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports Professor Yan Zhao of Iowa State University to study synthetic molecules made of amphiphilic building blocks. These molecules fold and unfold cooperatively, mimicking proteins in their conformational change and molecular binding. Different functionalization of the foldamers makes them soluble in either nonpolar media or aqueous solutions. Their conformation and molecular recognition are studied by UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The research aims to advance fundamental understanding of conformationally mobile supramolecular hosts and enable chemists to design synthetic hosts with protein-like binding capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include training students in biomimetic research, outreaching to underrepresented students and middle-school students interested in scientific careers, and familiarizing graduate students with industrial research. Because molecular recognition is at the heart of biology, the project is expected to impact a number of important fields including enzyme catalysis, drug development, chemical analysis, and supramolecular chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
