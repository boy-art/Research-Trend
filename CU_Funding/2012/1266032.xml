    <AbstractNarration>Prof. Timothy K. Minton (Montana State University) is supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) as the Principal Investigator of joint USA-UK team of investigators who represent a unique combination of established expertise in the chemical synthesis and catalytic applications of ionic liquids (ILs) and liquid-crystalline materials (Dr. John M. Slattery and Prof. Duncan W. Bruce; York, UK), experimental measurements of scattering dynamics using laser-based (Prof. Kenneth G. McKendrick and Dr. Matthew L. Costen; Heriot-Watt, UK) or molecular-beam scattering (Minton) methods, and theoretical modeling of gas-liquid interactions (Prof. George C. Schatz; Northwestern, USA). The UK researchers are supported through a parallel grant issued by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and Prof. Schatz is an unfunded collaborator. This proposal aims to enhance the fundamental understanding of IL surface structure and to relate this new insight to key sustainable applications of ILs. Inelastic and reactive scattering of atoms and molecules from liquid surfaces will be developed as a new, chemically specific analytical probe. Two distinct and complementary experimental approaches will be pursued, based on laser-photolysis, laser-spectroscopic probing and molecular-beam scattering. The laser-based method is well matched to higher-throughput screening of surface composition of a range of samples, while molecular-beam scattering will provide additional information on surface structure for selected liquids. In combination, they will probe the degree of surface segregation in custom-synthesized, high-purity ILs of recognized practical interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental new insight that will be generated is most likely to be exploited for societal benefit through its enabling role in the design and optimization of IL materials for numerous environmentally friendly applications. The most direct impact will be on processes involving transport through the gas-liquid interface, including various forms of catalysis. The students and post-docs involved will receive diverse training in modern research methods. They will have ample opportunities to develop broader, transferable skills and enjoy the cultural benefits of international exchange, equipping them to contribute to the future growth or creation of high-technology companies. Outreach will be actively promoted through the creation of a new website and associated YouTube channels. These new resources will promote both the results of the proposed research on ILs and their broader uses in general. Downloadable objects will be suitable for tutorials and other teaching tools, with the goal of enriching researchers, teachers, students, and the lay public.</AbstractNarration>
