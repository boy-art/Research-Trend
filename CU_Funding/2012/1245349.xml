    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates the use of pencil puzzles as a rich and varied source of problems that are interesting to all types of students and can be applied to a wide range of topics throughout the introductory computer science curriculum. Pencil puzzles are puzzles that have been created to be solved on paper by humans through a deductive process. By their very nature, these puzzles have been created to appeal to a wide audience and to be easily understood - the most well-know is Sudoku but there are a plethora of other, less well-known but equally engaging, pencil puzzles. Since they are designed to be solved deductively, they draw solvers in and induce them to think algorithmically. This project studies the use of pencil puzzles to excite freshman computer science students and lead them to an understanding of specific computing content.</AbstractNarration>
