    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM) Program supports Professor Claudia Turro at the Ohio State University to carry out fundamental/basic studies on the dynamics of excited states of ruthenium complexes, including their ligand-exchange photochemistry. The main goal of the research is to understand the principles that govern efficient excited state ligand-dissociation, its kinetics, and how this excited state process can be enhanced and controlled. One area of interest is the investigation of new metal complexes that can undergo ligand exchange with water molecules with low energy visible light. The resulting photoproducts bind to DNA, ultimately resulting in the death of cancer cells. The primary focus of the proposed work is to gain understanding how the properties of the leaving ligand and the electronic and structural characteristics of the ground state and the lowest energy excited state affect the photochemistry. This research will provide the basic knowledge that can later be applied to the discovery of new photodynamic therapy agents. This work will also result in understanding of the initial steps following photon absorption, and important point in areas that include solar energy conversion and photovoltaic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers are committed to the education of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as members of underrepresented groups. Professor Turro is the faculty advisor for the student chapter of the National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers at OSU, is a member of the department's Diversity Committee, and attended national and regional meetings of societies geared to promote and retain underrepresented minorities and women in science. These efforts will aid in the training of highly qualified, diverse scientists at the undergraduate and graduate levels. An important aspect of the research is the potential for the understanding of the excited state reactivity of the complexes proposed, which has the potential to impact the areas of medicine and solar energy, thus providing a clear benefit to society.</AbstractNarration>
