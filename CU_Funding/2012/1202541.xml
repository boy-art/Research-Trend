    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to develop a cost-efficient approach to harvesting sun radiative energy in infrared spectral range, which constitutes almost half of all solar energy received by the Earth but remains wasted by conventional photovoltaic solar cells. The approach is to implement carbon nanotubes, which have excellent absorption strength in the infrared range, in the form of thin films and highly-ordered planar arrays, either alone or in combination with established high-ZT materials for infrared-radiation harvesting and electrical power generation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses the fundamental difficulties in harvesting a significant portion of sun radiation and will help realize novel low-cost technologies for engineering spectrally-complementary infrared photovoltaic systems that can also operate in the dark. The study will engage design, synthesis, characterization, and performance modeling of low-cost photovoltaic systems for power generation based on a photo-thermo-electrical conversion principle. Performance assessment models will be built to validate the physical mechanisms underlying nanoscale thermo-electric phenomena and to help better understand the performance bottleneck of electrical power generation in nanostructured, highly complex media. Optimization studies will investigate the role of competing heat transport channels and many floating device parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The study will enhance energy recycling and conservation efforts, including recovering low-grade heat in household and office heating systems, furnaces, and automobiles, that are critical for reducing dependence on non-renewable and environmentally unsafe energy sources. The project will engage graduate, undergraduate, and underrepresented students in nanomaterials and nanodevice engineering for energy-harvesting applications.</AbstractNarration>
