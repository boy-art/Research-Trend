    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jon T. Njardarson of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at The University of Arizona will develop useful new heterocyclic reactions. The proposed new reactions fall into two reaction classes: 1) new catalytic ring expansions and 2) new anionic cascades. Asymmetric variations of the most significant reactions will also be studied. In addition to delivering useful new methods, the proposed research will make contributions to the emerging field of chiral counterion catalysis as well as expanding the knowledge of what makes an ideal anionic hopping group and how to most effectively use it for anionic cascades. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heterocyclic compounds are one of the more important structural scaffolds found in pharmaceuticals while also playing key roles in numerous other material applications. The proposed new heterocyclic methods will provide researchers in the pharmaceutical industry and other fields as well as academia with new and complementary approaches for building important structures. In addition, this project will provide excellent training of undergraduate and graduate students. Particularly noteworthy deliverables, which the students associated with these projects are involved in, are unique freely accessible educational/research tools such as Disease Focused Pharmaceutical posters, Top200 Drug posters and the free app/website Chemistry By Design. These new internet tools provide access to learning about organic chemistry and its importance to society.</AbstractNarration>
