    <AbstractNarration>The primary objective of this CAREER proposal is to establish a strong interdisciplinary program in micro/nanofluidic systems and biochemical/analytical technologies. A novel microfluidic screening platform integrated with multiple functional components for various biochemical and analytical processes will be developed based on electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic (DMF) principle. &lt;br/&gt;Multiplexing (e.g. fluidic circuit) capability of EWOD DMF is a unique and attractive feature to enable high throughput screening (HTS) platform. With this capability, HTS platform for 3D cell/tissue based bioassay processes will be developed and investigated. Various functions of EWOD DMF that never have been explored yet will be investigated and enabled. Such novel attempts include on-chip 3D cell and tissue culture solely by EWOD DMF, unit functions of bio-separation including on-chip aqueous two-phase system extraction, and novel detection/sensing methods enabled by EWOD DMF such as cut-off frequency sensor and ion-selective sensor array. This CAREER project also aims to tackle current limitations of EWOD DMF such as the volume accuracy and consistency in drop dispensing, and operation of non-aqueous fluids. &lt;br/&gt;With a successful integration of the proposed HTS, following important outcomes are expected. First, various bioassay data can be analyzed in a single cell and tissue sample with high reproducibility. Second, high-throughput of the bio-molecule separation will be ensured. Third, the kinetic study of fast bio-reaction process such as metabolomic reaction of metabolites will be enabled. In addition, one can easily optimize the cell specific extraction/drug efficacy conditions. The platform will enable a large number of samples in one analytical run, which will remove the problems that arise when comparing data within different batches of samples.&lt;br/&gt;Impacts of a successful result in the proposed research will not be limited to bioassay optimization. These results could bring transformations into wide range of chemical synthesis and analytical techniques based on cells and tissues. Immediate applications are expected in the field of drug discovery, catalyst development, disease biomarker identifications and point-of-care devices but not limited. Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of this project, educational endeavors will focus to nurture and train graduate and undergraduate students as future work forces with abundant experiences in bio- and nano- technology on top of solid foundation of conventional mechanical and electrical engineering knowledge. Research outcomes will be incorporated into the multi-disciplinary courses. Separate efforts will be made to bridge K-12 students and teachers with microscale science and engineering knowledge through outreach programs to inspire K-12 students to pursue higher education in engineering. Disseminating research outcome through various ways including interactive website/blog, peer-reviewed articles, conferences, public media are proposed.</AbstractNarration>
