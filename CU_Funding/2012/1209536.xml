    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to understand how ongoing conflict between selfish DNA ?parasites? and control by their host may result in reproductive isolation between species. Transposable elements (TEs) are short fragments of DNA that have the ability to insert, and perpetuate themselves, throughout a host genome. TE insertions can be deleterious for the host when they disrupt the function of the host genes. Small-RNA molecules called piRNAs have recently been shown to be an important way for the host to control the proliferation of TEs during the formation of egg and sperm cells. This research will characterize the rate of joint evolution of piRNAs and TEs in three closely-related species species of fruit flies. The project aims to: (1) determine the sequence of piRNAs in these species, (2) measure TE diversity, and (3) identify the rapidly evolving proteins that are known to be important for the piRNA suppression system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several human genetic diseases, including cancer are associated with TE mobilization. Understanding the evolution of piRNA-mediated TE defense may aid in the effective treatment for human genetic diseases. Additionally, this research will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and high school students in the emerging areas of genomics and bioinformatics.</AbstractNarration>
