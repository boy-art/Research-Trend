    <AbstractNarration>1230166&lt;br/&gt;Dillen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this symposium is to discuss materials, engineering, chemistry and physics aspects related to the synthesis, fabrication, and assembly of functional particles and capsules and their use in energy and biomedical applications. There is no better opportunity to achieve this than at the MRS meeting. This symposium will bring together researchers, students, and industrial scientists from multiple disciplines to share their results and insight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that being able to partially support travel and to cover the costs of attending the meeting will allow a wider, more representative population to attend and participate in the symposium and to strengthen representation in the area of materials fabrication via the syn-thesis and assembly of functional particles and capsules. We have encouraged research groups across the country to support participation of graduate and undergraduate students in the poster sessions, as a means of exposing students to a high level of research at an early age, and through these means, enhancing accessibility to research.</AbstractNarration>
