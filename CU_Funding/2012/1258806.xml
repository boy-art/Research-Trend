    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the support of student travel to the Winter Simulation Conference 2012, Berlin, Germany, 9-12 December 2012. Specifically, the students will be attending the PhD Colloquium (workshop) followed by the technical conference. The abstracts of the students' work will be published in the WSC2012 proceeding, which has wide distribution. The WSC PhD colloquia have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars; many of today's leading simulation researchers participated as students in earlier colloquia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant will encourage the interaction of the US emerging scholars with their counterparts and senior researchers from Europe and elsewhere, increasing the international awareness of the participating US students. The PIs will work with the conference organizers to identify and include the broadest possible group of highly qualified PhD students, especially those coming from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
