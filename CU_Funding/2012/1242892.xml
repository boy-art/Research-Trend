    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Capstone Institute at Howard University uses four partially overlapping tiers of activities aimed at systematically addressing the complex challenges HBCUs face in providing a high-quality STEM education for undergraduate and graduate students. In tier 1, the goal is to develop dynamic networking structures to establish, expand, and sustain connections among research participants and connections to human and informational resources to enhance prowess at conducting high quality scientific research. In tier 2, selected research participants will gain specific in-depth support, in collaboration with colleagues and mentors, to craft a concrete, high quality research product. Tier 2 will also target recursive problem-solving tasks using a Collaboratory Notebook for accomplishing these types of tasks. In tier 3, two cohorts of 30 educators (60 in total) from HBCUs who teach gatekeeper STEM or STEM education courses will participate in a continuous improvement intervention focused on a professional development model with follow-up support structures and opportunities for collaboration. In tier 4, the complexity of the various institutional structures across HBCUs and the need for organizational exchanges will be facilitated by a Networked Improvement Communities vehicle within this tier. Tier 4 will target top administrators (e.g. provost, dean, department chair) at HBCUs that have consented to be a part of an organizational change networked improvement community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this intervention entail a primary focus on expanding the participation of underrepresented minority researchers, educators and students in STEM fields through networking, training opportunities, and advanced frameworks to undergird research and high quality STEM teaching and learning. By improving STEM classroom instruction at the faculty level, this intervention will strengthen STEM education for minority students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The core focus of the proposed project is broader participation of under-represented groups and the institutions that serve them in STEM-based research activities. A variety of resources, innovative approaches, engaging activities, and highly appropriate instruments will be used to advance the goals and objectives of the project. The project addresses a true need in the academic community to develop and prepare future STEM talent at the undergraduate and graduate levels relative to research opportunities that propose innovation and technological advancement. Enhancement of the infrastructure for STEM research and instruction is a direct benefit and anticipated outcome of the project in regards to networks and collaborative partnership development. The core outcomes speak to STEM-based innovation in the broader society.</AbstractNarration>
