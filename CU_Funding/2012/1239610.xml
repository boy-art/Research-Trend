    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1239610&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chesapeake Community Modeling Program (CCMP) seeks to improve modeling tools and related resources specific to the Chesapeake Bay, its watershed, and connected environmental systems by fostering collaborative open source research. Toward this end, the CCMP is convening the third bi-annual Chesapeake Modeling Symposium as a venue to identify and showcase existing modeling efforts as well as communicate how models are used as decision support tools by different developer and user groups. Environmental models are increasingly taking on higher profile roles in the management process. The 2012 Chesapeake Modeling Symposium will attempt to shed light on emerging concerns and conflicts as they relate to regulatory thresholds and the environmental models that are used to set them, focusing on topics such as understanding, communication, and credibility. By bringing together modelers, managers, scientists, and stakeholders for a series of plenary talks, panel discussions, and special sessions, they hope to highlight the unique issues and concerns of each of these groups and provide a venue for open dialogue that will hopefully lead to greater understanding and adoption of these and other models.</AbstractNarration>
