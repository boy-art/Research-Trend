    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Huw M. Davies of the Department of Chemistry at Emory University will explore the development of new synthetic methods using donor/acceptor carbenoids as the key intermediates. While rhodium catalysts are well established for this type of chemistry, this study will define the new synthetic opportunities that exist when silver and gold are used as catalysts. The project will also expand the range of viable donor groups that can be employed in this chemistry with a particular emphasis on the stereoselective synthesis of novel amino acids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new synthetic methodologies developed during these studies could become enabling technologies that will impact other fields of science such as pharmaceutical and materials science. The program will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as the key reactions can be conducted with extremely low catalyst loadings and nitrogen gas is the only by-product. In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
