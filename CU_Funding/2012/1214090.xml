    <AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Young-Shin Jun at Washington University who will investigate important nucleation processes at complex environmental interfaces. Through both in situ real-time and ex situ observations, the investigator will articulate the transformation of hematite and cerium oxide nanophases due to the presence of ferric ions. The nanoparticle-nanoparticle and nanoparticle-mineral surface relationships will be investigated with and without natural organic matter coatings. The project's reaction system will be both novel and advantageous in elucidating crucial information about the physical and chemical evolution of environmental and engineered NPs and biofilm in natural and engineered aquatic systems, such as wastewater treatment plants. In addition, transport studies and effluent analysis will allow connecting the degree of transverse mixing of the nanoparticles-humic acid-contaminant system in simulated groundwater and wastewater with the rate of system aggregation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Professor Jun will develop an educational kit for teaching water quality concepts with support from Washington University's Science Outreach Office and collaboration with teachers from local K-12 schools in Missouri. Through collaboration with the Students and Teachers as Research Scientists program (STARS), the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program at Washington University, and the Undergraduate Research Office at Washington University, the investigator will recruit high school and undergraduate students for early involvement in scientific research projects, cultivating their creativity and curiosity via a project-based approach.</AbstractNarration>
