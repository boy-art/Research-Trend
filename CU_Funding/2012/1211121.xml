    <AbstractNarration>The project will support travel for Students and Postdocs to attend the 12th Congress of the International Society for Developmental and Comparative Immunology (ISDCI), in Fukuoka, Japan, July 9-13, 2012. Attendance at this congress will provide a rich learning experience in the field of Developmental and Comparative Immunology for developing scientists by enabling them to interact directly with international leaders in the field. The society will benefit from the influx of new talent and new ideas. Broader impacts include the following training benefits for students and postdoctoral fellows: 1) the experience of presenting their data at an international meeting for the first time; 2) the opportunity to meet and talk to other scientists with common interests in comparative immunology and the veterinary sciences; 3) the opportunity to receive feedback on their research from leaders in the field; 4) the opportunity to meet possible future mentors and collaborators; 5) the opportunity to experience an important function of the Society and to participate in this collegial and supportive community of scientists. While much scientific communication now occurs via electronic media, there is no substitute for one-on-one interactive communication made possible at an international meeting of this kind. It will foster future collaborations between young scientists based in Asia, Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world.</AbstractNarration>
