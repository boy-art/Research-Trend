    <AbstractNarration>This project is to award 30 scholarships annually to financially needy, academically talented students for five years in Biotechnology, Computer Information Systems, Pre-Engineering, and Natural Resources at Mount Wachusett Community College (MWCC). Programs and services designed to enhance student learning, academic performance, retention to graduation, and career or higher education placement in the project include: 1) support and mentoring of students by faculty and other professionals; 2) academic support services such as tutoring, study-groups, or supplemental instruction; 3) industry experiences, internship opportunities, and research opportunities; 4) community building and support among S-STEM scholars within the institution; 5) local or regional professional, industrial or scientific meetings and conferences; 6) career counseling and job placement services; and 7) adaptation of existing support services to meet objectives of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful results of the project and lessons learned will be shared with other faculty, staff, students, colleagues, and agencies in north central Massachusetts through the MWCC monthly newsletter, its website, presentations, and discussions of the program by staff across the region and at professional meetings. Similarly, results will be shared with student aid professionals by MWCC staff at national conferences such as the National Association for Student Financial Aid Administrators and the Massachusetts branch. The project has the potential to inform the larger STEM education community about the best practices for student success.</AbstractNarration>
