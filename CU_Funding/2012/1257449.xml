    <AbstractNarration>Understanding how neurons build an axon is central to understanding how cell-cell communication is established in the developing nervous system. This project focuses on how neurons coordinate the synthesis of the many structural proteins needed to make an axon with the signals that stimulate axon outgrowth. Whereas this coordination was once thought mainly to occur by regulating the transcription of genes into RNAs, new information indicates that much of it happens afterward by directing the trafficking of these RNAs for translation into proteins. In neurons of newly developing frog (Xenopus laevis) embryos, suppressing expression of the RNA-binding protein, hnRNP K, disrupts this trafficking, leading to the loss of both key axonal structural proteins and the axon itself. Building on preliminary data indicating that hnRNP K initially assembles into protein-RNA complexes within the nucleus as the targeted RNAs are being made, experiments of the first objective use reverse genetic approaches to characterize how this assembly occurs in developing neurons within the intact embryo. Experiments of the remaining two objectives use mutant forms of hnRNP K introduced into frog embryos, along with biochemical and histochemical assays, to characterize the cell-signaling pathways that govern hnRNP K?s activity during axon outgrowth. By providing new information about how neurons coordinate axon outgrowth with synthesis of the necessary structural proteins, this work has the potential to provide fundamentally new insights into how cells in general use RNA-binding proteins to jointly regulate the fates of functionally inter-related RNAs. The broader impacts of this work will be to provide research training for PhD students and undergraduates at a public university with a culturally diverse student body, and spinoffs from this work will impact courses in molecular and developmental biology and in neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>
