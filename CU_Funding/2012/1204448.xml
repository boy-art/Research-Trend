    <AbstractNarration>This conference project features two gatherings of scientists, science educators, and other experts, as well as the development of a web site, list-serv, and related activities. During the gatherings, participants will explore how to build state-based programs that can engage people who are incarcerated in sustainability science programming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work builds off of the success of the Sustainable Prisons Project, which has connected people who are incarcerated in Washington State with science through direct involvement in conservation research, and responds to calls from scientists and corrections staff interested in implementing similar programming in other states. The project will help advance the informal science education (ISE) field by potentially leading to high impact activities for a truly underserved population; building capacity among ISE professionals; and building knowledge and a replicable model of supporting non-traditional collaborations that serve the needs of people underrepresented in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
