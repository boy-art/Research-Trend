    <AbstractNarration>The collaborative research to be conducted under this award is directed toward a more fundamental understanding of an atomized-based cutting fluid and carbon dioxide spray cooling and lubrication application system for machining of titanium alloys. The specific objectives are to: (i) establish an understanding of the film formation behavior on a stationary surface from the atomized cutting fluids, and its penetration characteristics at the cutting interface during titanium machining; (ii) better understand the temperature distribution and the heat removal characteristics throughout the cutting interface; (iii) study the effects of spray parameters, spray unit orientation angle, and fluid properties (for example, surface tension and viscosity) and the application of carbon dioxide as a droplet carrier gas on the machining performances including tool wear, cutting temperature, and chip formation. These objectives will be realized through the execution of three principal tasks: (1) model the film formation behavior of the atomized cutting fluid droplets and their penetration to the tool-chip interface; (2) predict the temperature distribution at the cutting interface under the atomized cutting fluid spray conditions; and (3) develop a process plan for an effective lubrication and cooling application during machining of titanium alloys. The validation of model predictions of the fluid film characteristics including film thickness and film pressure will be accomplished by employing the probe pressure sensors, and a high resolution camera. A hardware testbed will be developed at the site of collaborative partner, TechSolve, Inc., for the technology capability testing and evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enhanced understanding of the tribological behavior of the atomized droplets at the tool/chip/work-piece interfaces will drive advances in tool design and manufacturing and improvement in other processes such as "minimum quantity lubricant" in grinding, machining and rolling. As the atomized-based cutting fluid spray system uses significantly small amount of electrical energy, this cooling system will help in saving electrical energy for those existing cooling techniques that operate a large fluid pump. Further, the use of carbon dioxide in this cutting fluid spray system can lead to developing many environmentally-friendly manufacturing processes. Efforts will be made to boost the participation of members from under-represented groups in this research by proactively participating in several on-campus/off-campus programs, including Women in Engineering Program and Minority Engineering Program.</AbstractNarration>
