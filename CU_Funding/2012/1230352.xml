    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop the next-generation DNA test kits for forensic DNA testing. DNA profiling has developed significantly over the past 20 years and is routinely used to solve crime. Despite improvements in DNA testing technologies and equipment, a significant number of investigative biological samples do not yield informative results, due to excessive degradation of DNA. A significant number of crime scene and mass disaster samples are still unable to produce useful profiles due to current technology limitations. This research project utilizes a proprietary primer design approach in to analyze a significant number of degraded DNA samples. This project will also contribute to a basic understanding of human populations and their ancestral origins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this proposed project, if successful, will allow society to obtain answers to identification questions that could not previously be obtained, due to the limitations of current technology. Some of the benefits that can be expected from the development of this technology include: Solving more crimes using next generation DNA tests, including cases that were previously not testable, due to excessively degraded samples; assisting in the resolution of missing persons cases; provide closure to families of mass disaster victims such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina as well as identifying human remains of soldiers who lost their lives on foreign soil; provide ancestral origin information for individuals seeking information regarding their genealogy; provide a powerful intelligence tool that can be used for national security, military and in-combat efforts; and provide data for the educational and research studies of human anthropology. Overall, the resulting commercial impact of this transformational technology and the positive contribution it will have to society is immeasurable.</AbstractNarration>
