    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the workshops "Workshop in Analysis and Probability" that will be held on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University during the period, July 2 - August 10, 2012, and the summers of 2013 and 2014. The ongoing Workshop in Analysis and Probability at Texas A&amp;M University brings together senior and junior researchers and graduate students in several areas of analysis and probability as well as researchers in other fields (such as geometry and theoretical computer science) in order to broaden the education of the younger participants and to promote interaction among researchers in various fields. The Workshop also sponsors three day conferences (SUMIRFAS-Informal Regional Functional Analysis Seminar), Concentration Weeks, and mini-conferences. These conferences include introductory lectures designed to acquaint junior researchers and non experts with the basics of an area as well as advanced lectures for experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop activities have a wide impact by providing intellectual stimulation for all participants as well as giving an opportunity to a diverse group of junior participants to increase the breadth and depth of knowledge and to interact with senior researchers in several areas of mathematics. There is also significant outreach to applied mathematics and computer science. Indeed, a very important aspect of the Workshop is to promote cooperation among researchers in different fields, and every Concentration Week involves participants from experts in two or more research areas.</AbstractNarration>
