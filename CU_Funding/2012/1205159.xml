    <AbstractNarration>The Mid-Pacific Information and Communication Technology (MPICT) Center is working toward, and has already made some progress toward, harmonization of information and communications technology (ICT) related course nomenclature, frameworks, programs, and academic credentials in the California Community College System (CCCS) through student learning objectives tied to employer workplace demands for, at least, a common core of ICT related programs. The Center also works with industry to develop a more common set of job titles and descriptions. ICT encompasses 1) Hardware (electrical and computer engineering), 2) Software (computer science and software engineering), 3) Web (web design and development), 4) IT Operations (networking/telecom/ system administration/storage), 5) Digital Media, 6) Database and Information Systems, and 7) Security. MPICT continues its current mission of coordinating, improving, and promoting ICT education, with a focus on community colleges, but changing its regional focus to all of California, Nevada, Hawai'i and the Pacific Territories. MPICT continues to develop and sustain collaborations to leverage, expand, improve, and enhance the region's ICT education capacity. These collaborations help create a diverse ICT workforce that can meet the economic needs of the region for a wide range of industries, not only for information technology employers. Regional, national, and global best practices in ICT education are identified and disseminated to encourage implementation of these best practices throughout the region, working towards a harmonization of ICT competencies, skills, and education approaches. MPICT advocates for the development of core ICT student learning outcomes that serve as a framework for articulated, comprehensive ICT education pathways throughout the region. MPICT staff work closely with the external evaluator to develop evaluation plans, methods and vehicles that are administered by an internal evaluator. The evaluation documents the value and implementation use of professional development, the framework for core ICT competencies and also tracks students into jobs and further education.</AbstractNarration>
