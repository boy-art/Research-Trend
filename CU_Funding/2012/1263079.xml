    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Michigan (UM) that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013-2015. The program will expose students to the nature of interdisciplinary research. Participants will be engaged in hands-on experimental training and independent investigation in the areas of biochemistry, biophysics, cheminformatics, enzymology, molecular biology and plant biology. The research projects featured in this program all involve studies of the structure and function of proteins and are representative of seven departments at UM, which further emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the training offered. In addition to the research experience, students will participate in a series of weekly enrichment seminars focusing on ethics and scientific integrity, scientific communication, graduate school admissions and scientific career options. Opportunities for integration into the UM research community will be provided through periodic meetings with REU faculty mentors, graduate students, and undergraduate students from other UM summer research programs. It is hoped that the REU experience will promote persistence in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels. Students will be recruited from across the nation via email postings, website listings and announcements at local/national conferences. Undergraduate students, who are US Citizens or Permanent Residents, majoring in a STEM discipline will be considered eligible for participation. Applicants will be selected based on their potential for research and their interest in obtaining a graduate degree in a STEM discipline. Special consideration will be given to individuals who are from underrepresented ethnic/racial groups or from institutions with limited resources for research. Students from community colleges and those with no previous research experience will also be given special consideration. All participants will receive housing, meal and travel allowances and a stipend. The Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA), available to BIO-funded REU PIs, will be the primary summative evaluation tool. Electronic tracking surveys will be sent to program alumni annually to determine their current level of engagement in the STEM disciplines.
