    <AbstractNarration>This award to the Quality Education for Minorities will provide technical assistance to junior science and engineering faculty at minority-serving institutions and eligible underrepresented minority faculty to facilitate successful participation in the NSF's Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program, underscoring the NSF?s Career-Life Balance initiative. Under-represented faculty in STEM have an essential role in the production of baccalaureate degree recipients of under-represented groups in STEM disciplines as well as in the disproportionate production of minority college graduates who pursue graduate degrees. In addition, the project will assist in the promotion of the NSF's Career-Life Balance Initiative in an effort to retain, advance and support the early careers of women of color in the STEM workforce. Consequently there will be the broadening of participation, and enhancing diversity within the Foundation's programs as well as address key quality of life issues to aid in the recruitment and retention of early career faculty.</AbstractNarration>
