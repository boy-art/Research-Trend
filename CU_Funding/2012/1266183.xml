    <AbstractNarration>Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1266183 SUNY at Buffalo; Venugopal Govindaraju &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site, SUNY at Buffalo, requests funding to establish a partner site of the Center for Identification Research (CITeR) currently comprised of the Clarkson University (lead institution), West Virginia University and the University of Arizona as research partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site will advance the science of biometric technologies for both civilian and homeland security applications by integrating pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms with sensors technology. SUNY at Buffalo site will bring together faculty expertise, not only in core biometric modalities such as fingerprints and face recognition, and soft biometrics such as gender, age, mannerisms, and emotion, but also in related areas such as advanced computer vision, robotics, cryptography, and theoretical computer science that will allow CITeR to pursue research in the development of innovative biometric applications. CITeR affiliates will also benefit from being able to benchmark and assess the effectiveness of various hard and soft biometric technologies in real applications. The proposed site's faculty strength in Chemistry, Physics and Optics will also help CITeR pursue novel modulaties such as odor biometrics and better sensors to assist in identification technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site will further CITeR's objective to serve as a comprehensive academic center serving the growing identification technology research, undergraduate and graduate education, and outreach needs of the public and private sectors. This will be accomplished by providing a mechanism for the funding of pooled interdisciplinary faculty and student talent to address the challenges in identification technology. Under the auspices of BEAM (Buffalo Area Engineering Awareness for Minorities) the proposed site plans to attract the participation of local high school and undergraduate students using innovative events built around biometrics applications that incorporate treasure hunts and other fun elements to educate and interest them in STEM areas. The faculty at SUNY Buffalo are members of the NSF-AGEP (The Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate) program whose goal is to significantly increase the number of underrepresented minorities obtaining graduate degrees in STEM areas. CITeR meetings will also serve as an excellent opportunity for students to interact with potential employers to understand challenges in the field.</AbstractNarration>
