    <AbstractNarration>This research involves theoretical and applied research on learning and representation of high-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional data. The term high dimensionality refers to the property that the number of variables&lt;br/&gt;or ?unknowns? is typically much larger than the number of observations available at hand. A key&lt;br/&gt;challenge is being able to represent and learn such phenomena with sample and computational&lt;br/&gt;requirements scaling favorably in the number of dimensions. This project addresses these challenges&lt;br/&gt;through a graphical approach by exploiting the inherent graphical structure present in many large&lt;br/&gt;data-sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research considers modeling high-dimensional data through probabilistic graphical models,&lt;br/&gt;also known as Markov random fields. An important research thrust of this proposal is to develop&lt;br/&gt;novel algorithms for learning and inference under the framework of graphical models. Another&lt;br/&gt;important thrust of this proposal is to develop efficient scalable models for representing high-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional data beyond the traditional framework of graphical models. This research establishes&lt;br/&gt;strong theoretical guarantees for the developed methods, as well as applies them to real data in&lt;br/&gt;various domains, including genetic and financial data, and data from large online social networks&lt;br/&gt;such as Facebook and Twitter.</AbstractNarration>
