    <AbstractNarration>In this REESE medium empirical research study, being conducted by Education Development Center, Inc.'s Center for Children and Technology (EDC/CCT), the PIs are systematically testing comparative advantages of different design features of digital games in support of science learning. Their hypothesis is that experience in a domain learners are already familiar with and that is analogous to a targeted science domain can aid learning in the science domain if practice in the analogous domain is aimed towards helping learners better make sense of those aspects of the familiar domain that are difficult to understand in the targeted science domain. They are exploring this representational hypothesis in three science domains: electricity, photosynthesis, and heat transfer. In a first phase, they are comparing practice and experiences in preparation for learning in each domain, comparing, for each, preparation for learning in the context of a game that is mimetic (gives learners a chance to practice making sense of the science domain itself) and one that is non-mimetic (gives learners a chance to make better sense of an analogous domain they are already familiar with). In later phases of the work, they are investigating the role of and best practices for explicit analogy guidance by teachers as they help learners transfer what they are learning in the games to solving real-world problems in the science domain. The aim is to identify good practices for helping middle-grade science learners consolidate and transfer conceptual understanding beyond the problems they are practicing on. In addition to drawing out lessons about how non-mimetic practice can make contributions to students? understanding of difficult science concepts, the study also explores questions about making intuitive experiences in a game world accessible for consolidation and application and the roles of explicit analogical mapping during instruction as a method for supporting sense-making and consolidation of emergent conceptual models of the target science concepts. They are identifying the interrelationship of these features of game play as steps in coming to deep understanding of science concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some kinds of electronic games have the potential to provide learners with engaging environments for making sense of and practicing use of new science concepts. Yet there is little known right now about how to design and implement educational games to support deep conceptual understanding of targeted science. This project has the potential to transform approaches to developing games for science learning that support sustained sense making and consolidation around difficult science concepts and that promote transfer of conceptual understanding beyond the problems learners are practicing with. This project is generating critical new knowledge to guide development of learning experiences and pedagogy in support of middle-grade science learning, especially addressing the needs of struggling students who require more engaging and playful approaches in order to deeply learn.</AbstractNarration>
