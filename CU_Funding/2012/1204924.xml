    <AbstractNarration>Technical Description: Two-dimensional nanomaterials have potential for novel electronics. However the materials science of fabricating and merging of different two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials into a device has not yet been established. This project aims at understanding fundamental materials science problems of 2D-nanomaterial interfaces using atomic-scale surface science characterization techniques. The research consists of three thrust areas: (i) Investigation and tuning of metal- graphene interfaces: Electrical contacts with graphene are important for any device. New strategies are devised on how to disperse metal-atoms on the surface of graphene by utilizing two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks supported on graphene. (ii) Developing methods for synthesizing heterostructures of 2D materials and characterizing their properties: To achieve heterolayers of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on graphene on a wafer-sized scale vapor growth of h-BN on a metal support is combined with graphene formation by carbon segregation from the metal bulk. (iii) Synthesizing and characterizing novel 2D man-made nanomaterials with no structural analogy in bulk materials: Most 2D nanomaterials are based on van-der-Waals bulk materials that can be exfoliated into individual atomic (molecular) sheets. In this project the possibility of synthesizing entirely new materials that do not have any bulk counterparts is explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: This project addresses fundamental materials science issues of graphene and related two-dimensional materials. Growth of various two-dimensional materials and characterization their interfaces are carried out using surface science techniques. Research results from this project will be included in the curriculum of courses on Materials Physics/Surface Science and Solid State Physics taught by the PI. In addition, this project offers graduate projects for two PhD students and research experience for undergraduate students. It also facilitates the continuation of a recently implemented cooperation between researchers at the University of South Florida and the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
