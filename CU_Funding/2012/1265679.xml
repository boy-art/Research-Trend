    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis and Chemistry of Life Processes Programs of the Chemistry Division of NSF, Professor Eric Block of the Department of Chemistry at the University at Albany, SUNY, will conduct basic research on several areas of organo-sulfur and -selenium chemistry, e.g., 1) Research on low molecular weight organoselenium compounds related to methaneselenol, a central player in human Se metabolism and the anticancer activity of dietary Se; 2) Research on olfaction, following up on the discovery of the role of copper in smelling volatile sulfur compounds; 3) Research on thiacorannulenes, unusual, bowl-shaped compounds with potential utility in design of metal catalysts and materials for energy storage; 4) Research on the chemistry of garlic and onion, emphasizing discovery of novel, biologically active sulfur containing, natural-products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to answer fundamental questions on the chemistry of these important elements in synthetic organic and pharmaceutical chemistry, and biochemistry. Each aim was chosen because of the broad intellectual challenge presented in the execution of the work, the paucity of knowledge in each area (e.g., metabolism of small organoselenium compounds; olfactory receptors for volatile sulfur-containing molecules; metal-coordination to unusual ligands; garlic-inspired drugs), and the likelihood of significant discoveries resulting from work in each area. In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
