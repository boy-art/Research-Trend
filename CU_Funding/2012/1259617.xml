    <AbstractNarration>The S-STEM program at Western Kentucky University (WKU) provides financial, academic, and career assistance for twenty financially needy and academically talented students (freshmen and transfers), with an interest in the broadly defined area of biotechnology. Retention and success are supported through early development of a structured cohort, targeted academic and career assistance, and encouragement of engagement opportunities including research training in biotechnology. Established partnerships with 20 regional high schools and regional community colleges in underrepresented counties with significant educational and/or economic needs support recruitment efforts to specifically target underrepresented groups. Regional biotechnology industrial partners are also providing internships to promote workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potentially transformative strategies such as a common advising day for incoming S-STEM students, courses to develop early research and laboratory skills, faculty research and career mentors, and workshops for first year students are unique features of this program. Program objectives include an increase in retention and graduation of the S-STEM students versus the university average, participation of the students in biotechnology training and undergraduate research, and development of introductory research courses. Formative and summative evaluation measures from the program inform recruitment and retention efforts at WKU. Successful practices are disseminated through regional and national presentations and publications.</AbstractNarration>
