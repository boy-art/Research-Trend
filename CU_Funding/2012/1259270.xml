    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing scholarships and support to 40 students over five years in order to (1) increase annual full-time enrollment in targeted engineering technology and applied technology fields, (2) increase retention of participating STEM majors from the first to second year, (3) increase the number of participating students who complete their degree within two years, and (4) increase the number of graduating Bridgemont STEM Scholars who become employed in their field or continue their education in their field. The project is investigating the combination of proven retention models and industry interactive activities on student performance, particularly those who are the first in their family to attend college. Students are learning sought-after workplace skills including interpersonal relations, project management, and workplace ethics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project promotes higher STEM education in rural West Virginia through an outreach campaign that is informing a broad audience about high-demand positions available for engineering and applied technology graduates, which is particularly important given the high number of first generation college students in the region. These activities are helping to create a more educated workforce in West Virginia. The program model strengthens the partnerships between community colleges and industry to improve student preparation for STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>
