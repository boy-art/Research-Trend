    <AbstractNarration>How do institutions organize to perform the many functions that they seek to perform, such as education, health, infrastructure, market regulation, or policing? How do they interact internally and with other organizations in the society at large to execute these functions and gain feedback on their performance, and what are the implications of these patterns of activity and connectivity? This project proposes that institutions are complex systems that self-organize so as to provide a range of essential products, services, rules, and regulations for the economy and society. It will use the growing presence of institutions on the Internet to gather and analyze the first comprehensive, objective dataset on the functions institutions perform and the connectivity of individual institutions with each other and with different parts of society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop novel methods for community discovery, graph mining, and analytical web crawling to transform the information in the websites of U.S. institutions, and the linkages of these websites with each other and with societal organizations, into a pilot dataset on the activity and connectivity of institutions in the United States. These data will then be used to investigate the nature and evolution of the activity and connectivity of U.S. institutions, and their implications for public policy, relations with business and society, and economic productivity and performance. The project will open new avenues for analysis of variation in the activity and connectivity of institutions, including a range of new indicators of institutional linkages and connectivity, as well as new techniques for web crawling, data mining, and data analysis of complex networks. The project will also form the basis for new techniques and collaborations between computer scientists and economists.</AbstractNarration>
