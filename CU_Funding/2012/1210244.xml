    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Richard Ruiz of The University of Wisconsin - Madison to conduct a research project, entitled "New techniques to measure dark matter at the Large Hadron Collider," during the summer of 2012 at The University of Tokyo's Institute for Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU) in Kashiwa, Japan. The host scientists are Prof. Hitoshi Murayama and Prof. Mihoko Nojiri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to investiage the properties of dark matter, a curious substance believed to make up almost 25% of the Universe but has yet to be definitively observed in a controlled, laboratory setting. By exploiting the unique features of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a European-based proton collider possessing record-breaking beam energy and beam intensity, a new, novel technique is being used to detect dark matter and measure its properties at the LHC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include: providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture, and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
