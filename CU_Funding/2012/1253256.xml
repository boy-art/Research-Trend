    <AbstractNarration>Gray leaf spot of corn, caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis, is one of the most important diseases of corn in the U.S. and other regions of the world. The fungus infects corn through natural pores (stomata) of leaves, although the infection process is poorly understood. Recent discoveries indicate that infection by the fungus is governed by daily cycles of light and darkness, which provide an important clue for genetic analyses. In this project, the genetic and molecular basis of gray leaf spot will be investigated, with emphasis on understanding how the fungus utilizes environmental cues (including daily light/dark cycles) to coordinate its attack on corn. A blend of genetic, molecular, biochemical, and computational techniques will be used to determine how the fungus causes disease. Ultimately, this information will be used to model genetic interactions linking the molecular clock of the fungus and other environmental cues with infection and colonization of corn leaves. By providing a genetic blueprint explaining how C. zeae-maydis causes gray leaf spot, this project will provide important new information to a broad community of researchers working to understand and control fungal diseases of corn and other crops. Additionally, this project will provide training opportunities for students in the U.S. and Africa who belong to groups underrepresented in science research. Finally, participants in this project will work closely with growers and producers in educational efforts to explain the crucial roles basic research plays in U.S. agriculture.</AbstractNarration>
