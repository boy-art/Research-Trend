    <AbstractNarration>The San Jose State University (SJSU) Science Research and Teaching Scholars program is providing an average of fifteen $8,700/year scholarships over this four-year project to students majoring in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Geology, Meterology or Physics/Astronomy. The primary objective being achieved is the preparation of strong scientists capable of becoming high school teachers, scientists in the workforce, or students pursuing graduate degrees in STEM, each after completing their baccalaureate degree. The well-designed program is improving the STEM workforce by enabling strong academic performance of Scholars and by providing experiences that allow each Scholar to identify the best career path appropriate to them. Vigorous campus recruiting efforts are leading to a robust applicant pool from which Scholars are selected based on their GPA, documented financial need, their commitment to a career as a scientist, and letters of recommendation. Scholars are supported with Academic Excellence Workshops, Summer Preparation Courses, a Graduate School Preparation Seminar, Research Techniques Workshops, on-campus research opportunities, teaching apprenticeships, and faculty mentoring. Close involvement with local industry includes seminars and workplace tours. SJSU has a diverse undergraduate student population and serves Silicon Valley. As undergraduate researchers the Scholars are enhancing research productivity at SJSU while enjoying their first scientific work experience. Scholars are also gaining teaching experience by service as facilitators for Academic Excellence Workshops, Summer Preparation courses, teaching lab courses, or through service learning programs like Tutor-to-Teach. Successful Scholars are serving as role models for future STEM majors.</AbstractNarration>
