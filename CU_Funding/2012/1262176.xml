    <AbstractNarration>1262176&lt;br/&gt;Moeller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microelectrode arrays are potentially powerful tools for monitoring interactions between small molecule libraries and biological receptors. They hold two main advantages over current state-of-the-art methods. First, they can be used to detect binding events as they occur without the need for a labeled receptor or immunological assay. The result is a cost effective, rapid method for analysis that enables the use of biological data to interactively guide the design and synthesis of new receptor ligands. Second, the microelectrodes in an array can be used to reclaim molecules from the surface of the electrodes. Hence, molecules in a library that give rise to a biological signal can be isolated and characterized. This allows for quality control of the library. With these advances in mind, new chemistry for the site-selective placement, manipulation, and monitoring of molecules on the surface of a microelectrode array have been developed. In this project we will further build up the repertoire of tools by developing chemistry for direct synthesis of molecular libraries, porous membranes that will cover electrodes to minimize nonspecific binding and will demonstrate proof of concept use of novel electrode arrays for screening small molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General public statement:&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop technologies based on electrode arrays to enable creation and testing of drug candidate molecules. This technology is interesting in that it can be used at all stages from biomolecule synthesis to its release to screening of biomolecule-target interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded by the Nano-Biosensing Program in the CBET Division of the ENG directorate, with co-funding from both the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program and the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) Program in the CHE Division of the MPS directorate.</AbstractNarration>
