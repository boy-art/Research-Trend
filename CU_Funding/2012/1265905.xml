    <AbstractNarration>This experimental physics research program explores the underlying structure and interactions of molecular matter in new, unexplored regimes. This award will support the continuation of research investigating helium-based diatomic molecules. Helium is the most chemically inert of all the atoms, but not so inert that it cannot form molecules. Very few measurements have been made of the properties of these elusive "van der Waals" molecules. Their structure and formation will be studied spectroscopically, providing an understanding of matter in this extreme weakly-bound limit. In addition, the award will support a continuation of research investigating molecular collisions and chemical reactions at a temperature of one degree above absolute zero. This "cold chemistry" is important for understanding the fundamental physics underlying chemical reactions, and provides more sensitive tests of theory than traditional "hot" chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will improve our understanding of the structure and chemical reactions of molecular matter, the primary form of all matter on earth. As such, it may one day lead to new methods of controlling chemical reactions and chemical synthesis. In addition, the study of reactions at cold temperatures will improve our understanding of the interstellar medium. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art optical techniques, as well as cryogenics, vacuum, electronics, and computer-based data acquisition and analysis.</AbstractNarration>
