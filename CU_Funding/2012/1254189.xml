    <AbstractNarration>This award is designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering. This project, managed by researchers from Pepperdine University, describes the effort to create a knowledge network linking a series of small projects related to the SAVI theme that involve collaboration between U.S. and Finnish researchers. The collaborations include leading STEM educational researchers from both countries and focus on technology-enhanced learning, educational innovation, and learning analytics. On such projects, the pairing of researchers from the U.S. with those from Finland, a nation whose students regularly rank at the top in international measures of STEM learning, holds great promise as these scientific communities with complementary strengths come together. The goal is to spur innovative at the frontiers of our knowledge of STEM learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER will aim to hasten discovery and knowledge sharing and to facilitate the broader impact of the teams findings in educational enterprises in both the United States and Finland. It is the glue, or mechanism, for linking a set of disparate U.S.-Finnish research efforts, allowing for greater communication among the projects and making connections through common intellectual themes and practical innovations. The project will attempt to do so through eight sets of activities, including an active web presence, exchanges of early career and teacher researchers, a webinar for researchers, educators, and policy makers, the development of research toolkits, virtual and in-person SAVI research meetings, short courses, and contributions to research literatures and conferences that reflect the cross-disciplinary nature of the SAVI.</AbstractNarration>
