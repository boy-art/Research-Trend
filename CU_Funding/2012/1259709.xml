    <AbstractNarration>This scholars program at the Ohio State University offers talented students the opportunity to live and study in a community as they participate in career-themed activities and take advantage of carefully-architected support structures. Scholars have specialized advising, attend first year classes together as a cohort and have a host of thematically related activities available that contribute to their success as students and in securing employment. These scholars are selected because of their desire to utilize engineering talent for the betterment of marginalized peoples and underserved communities. Using engineering to obtain direct positive effects on humanity is often called "humanitarian engineering" and this humanitarian engineering program is enrolling 144 scholars. The program has two primary goals: 1) Positively impact retention and graduation rate of engineering students with financial need and 2) Improve academic performance relative to a control group. The program is sustainable in that it will not create new programs, curricula or degree requirements; its financial support will facilitate degree completion and career placement for a group of students who have financial need and are academically talented. The project has three secondary goals 3) Incorporate humanitarian engineering ideas more broadly across campus, 4) Increase diversity, and 5) Develop well-rounded engineers and problem-solvers who are able to think globally.</AbstractNarration>
