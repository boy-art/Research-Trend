    <AbstractNarration>To increase the number of faculty teaching cybersecurity content, the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas Tech University in partnership with the Center of Security Studies and Criminal Justice at Angelo State University are offering a professional development program in cybersecurity to community college faculty scholars across West Texas. Thirty faculty scholars from community and private colleges across West Texas are participating in a cyber-security education workshop and are mentored in the establishment of cybersecurity associate degrees and certification programs in their home institutions. The project provides a holistic approach to cybersecurity education by integrating the science and engineering aspects of cybersecurity issues with the management, ethical, and practical aspects as they relate to national defense and homeland security. It also introduces recent advances in cybersecurity research to improve cyber security education and explores various technical research and educational challenges. The project is increasing the number of educators knowledgeable in cybersecurity, resulting in a multiplying effect to students including minority groups that contribute to the workforce in the region.</AbstractNarration>
