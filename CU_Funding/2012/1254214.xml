    <AbstractNarration>Biologists have long hypothesized that insects and pathogens are directly involved in the origin and maintenance of plant diversity, especially in the extraordinarily diverse tropical rainforests. The evolution of novel chemical defenses that deter insects and pathogens has been thought to allow plants to expand their geographic ranges, thereby promoting the formation of new species. Very little is known about the identity or distribution of the enemies that attack tropical plants or how host-specific they are. In this research, populations of 45 species from a common, diverse genus of tropical rainforest trees (Protium) in Peru, Brazil and French Guiana will be studied to learn about which insects and pathogens attack the plants and how the plants defend themselves. By simultaneously studying natural enemies, plant defenses, and the evolutionary history of plants, insects, and soil pathogens the investigators will gain new insights on the processes that generate high biodiversity in the Amazon basin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will train scientists both in Peru and the United States, with a focus on promoting opportunities for students from underrepresented socioeconomic groups. A summer field course in Peru will be developed for Peruvian and US students at the University of California at Berkeley, that will teach ecology, evolutionary biology, taxonomy of plants and insects, experimental design and research methods. This project will integrate research and education with international field biology and involve minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students will be recruited from an existing program at Berkeley that mentors first-generation college students, providing critical field biology opportunities for students who are generally offered only lab-based research positions.</AbstractNarration>
