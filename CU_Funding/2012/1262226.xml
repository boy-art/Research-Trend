    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research program, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, is to explore dynamic component exchange (DCE) in metal-organic framework (MOF) materials. While many studies suggest that some MOFs are 'inert' to certain solvents and reagents (e.g. acids), it has been discovered that such materials can undergo ligand exchange reactions (i.e. DCE) even under mild conditions. This discovery was initially made by utilizing aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS) to analyze the composition of individual MOF microcrystals. These studies were the first use of ATOFMS in materials science (including nanomaterials) and are part of a unique collaboration between synthetic inorganic and analytical environmental chemistry at the U.C. San Diego. This research program will study DCE in detail, to identify which MOFs readily undergo DCE and to understand the mechanism of the DCE process. This program will also utilize DCE as a methodology for functionalization of MOFs and to determine whether DCE can involve both ligand and metal ion exchange. Finally, this project will further develop ATOFMS methods to quantify DCE and to broaden the analytical use of this method for nanomaterials. The preliminary findings to date demonstrate that DCE is an important phenomenon that is more common among MOFs and other nanomaterials than previously recognized. The discoveries made in this research program will have important implications for the use of MOFs in technological applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;New materials are essential for the advancement of many technological fields including medicine, renewable energy, aerospace engineering, and others. This research program is investigating a new class of porous materials and how they can be tailored for specific applications. These new porous materials act as high-tech 'sponges' that can 'soak up' other ions or molecules. As such, they may find use in fuel cells, batteries, and other important applications. As part of a broader outreach and educational mission, this proposal will support the Science Policy Internship Program (SPIP), a unique internship program, which sends STEM undergraduate students to Washington D.C. to learn about the interface of science and public policy.</AbstractNarration>
