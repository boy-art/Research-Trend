    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of the research are to: 1) improve the understanding of dynamics of orographic and environmental influences on tropical cyclone (TC) track deflection over the Appalachians and other mesoscale mountain ranges; 2) determine major control parameters and moist flow regimes for orographic precipitation associated with TCs over mesoscale mountains; and 3) understand the interaction of microphysical and dynamical processes in enhancing precipitation associated with TCs over mesoscale mountains. To accomplish the above objectives, both idealized and real-case numerical simulations using the research version of Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF version 3) developed at National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will be performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The research will improve the fundamental understanding of the dynamics of orographic influences on TC track deflection over the Appalachians and other mesoscale mountain ranges, which, in turn, will improve the prediction of rainfall distribution. The studies of major control parameters, moist flow regimes, and interaction of microphysical and dynamical processes associated with TCs over mesoscale mountains will help improve the microphysics and planetary boundary-layer parameterization schemes, which, in turn, will help improve quantitative precipitation forecasts over the Appalachians as well as other mountains that share similar environments. All these research efforts are consistent with one of the major initiatives of the U.S. Weather Research Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;A fundamental understanding of heavy orographic precipitation associated with the passage of tropical cyclones should lead to improvements in the quantitative forecasts of precipitation and hydrological prediction of flooding and, thus, advance the protection of life and property in areas near mountains. The project will educate and train two graduate students and two undergraduate students at North Carolina A&amp;T State University. Most of the students in the university come from underrepresented populations and the Co-PI is a female scientist. The students and faculty worked on the project will contribute information to local high-school teachers and students through various science programs. The research results derived from the project will be used to develop a new graduate course that fills the gap between mountain meteorology and hurricane dynamics. Offering of the course through UCAR's COMET virtual education program will be attempted to allow a large number of students and scientists to be impacted by it. Existing University-Government and international collaborations will be strengthened as students supported by the project will have opportunities to interact with atmospheric scientists in NCAR, NOAA, Taiwan, and Madagascar.</AbstractNarration>
