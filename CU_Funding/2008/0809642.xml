    <AbstractNarration>With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Frieder Jaekle of the Chemistry Department at the Rutgers University- Newark will develop synthetic routes that will provide highly selective and controlled access to new classes of conjugated organoboron oligomers, macrocycles, and polymers ? all from the same set of precursor molecules. The modular approach that is being developed is expected to allow for facile optimization of the desired materials properties, photophysical characteristics, electronic behavior, and sensing ability. To evaluate and fine-tune the degree of extended conjugation through p-pi overlap will be of critical importance. It is anticipated that this project will generate new fundamental knowledge in the field of main group chemistry and in the areas of conjugated organic and hybrid materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research by Professor Jaekle at Rutgers University- Newark will in the longer term contribute to the development of novel and more efficient conjugated materials that can be used in applications such as plastic electronics and sensors. The project will effectively contribute to the training of a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students in a highly interdisciplinary area that involves aspects of physical organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, polymer chemistry, and materials science. The experience gained through this research is of direct relevance to the chemical industry in the US. Another important aspect is to build bridges between undergraduate education and research. As part of this award, a new experiment on luminescent sensor materials will be added to a senior laboratory course. Professor Jaekle will also continue to involve ACS Project SEED high school students in the research and continue the very successful outreach programs with local high schools that were established as part of the prior award.</AbstractNarration>
