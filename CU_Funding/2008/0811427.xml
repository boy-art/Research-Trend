    <AbstractNarration>In modern computers with multiple CPUs per chip, multiple levels of&lt;br/&gt;computer memory are shared among the CPUs. This sharing may cause&lt;br/&gt;varying response times for computer applications, potentially&lt;br/&gt;affecting their usability. For instance, a video streaming&lt;br/&gt;application that has unpredictable response times due to interference&lt;br/&gt;from other applications may be essentially unusable. Thus, the&lt;br/&gt;computer system must attempt to allocate shared memory resources&lt;br/&gt;equitably to increase response consistency. Virtual Private Machines&lt;br/&gt;(VPMs), in which shared computer resources are partitioned to give&lt;br/&gt;the illusion that a program is running on a single physical CPU&lt;br/&gt;running in isolation, are one method to provide response&lt;br/&gt;consistency. This research involves the development of software&lt;br/&gt;modeling techniques to predict the memory requirements of applications&lt;br/&gt;run on modern computers and using those predictions to guide memory&lt;br/&gt;resource allocation to provide consistent, predictable performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research consists of the development of&lt;br/&gt;reuse-distance-based memory locality analysis for multi-threaded&lt;br/&gt;applications to predict the resource requirements of those&lt;br/&gt;applications. This research will apply the new memory locality models&lt;br/&gt;to manage the cache and bandwidth requirements for multi-threaded&lt;br/&gt;applications run on a VPM within a multi-programmed&lt;br/&gt;environment. Specifically, this research will examine reuse distance&lt;br/&gt;for Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) applications written in&lt;br/&gt;Unified Parallel C (UPC). The research will investigate the effects of&lt;br/&gt;the number of threads used per application on per-thread data size and&lt;br/&gt;the effect on reuse distance of shared data caused by thread&lt;br/&gt;interaction. The result will be novel solutions to memory locality&lt;br/&gt;analysis for multi-threaded applications while allowing the compiler&lt;br/&gt;to predict and specify the resources needed to give multi-threaded&lt;br/&gt;applications targeted performance.</AbstractNarration>
