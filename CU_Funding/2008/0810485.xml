    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I research project will demonstrate the feasibility of inexpensive high-resolution tunable terahertz (THz) receivers based on electron-heating in semiconductor nanodevices. The nanosensor will be composed of a low-mobility channel shaped from a Aluminum Gallium Arsenide/Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs/GaAs) two-dimensional electron gas. The proposed tunable inexpensive heterodyne detector (mixer) will operate at moderate cooling temperatures (~77K) within the 0.3-30 THz range. The proposed device will have the advantages of low noise, broad spectral coverage, technological compatibility of the detector with available solid-state local oscillators. The proposed system will provide critical information on the status of atmosphere, aid in the demarcation of pollutions, and monitor the progress of cleanup efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the concept of the proposed system is that it is very flexible and could be applied to a variety of chemical and biological contaminants. Besides environmental monitoring, the proposed receiver can be used for screening of personnel and handheld materials. THz screening is non-invasive and non-destructive for living beings. Explosives and biological agents can be detected and identified even if concealed in clothing and suitcases because the THz radiation is transmitted through clothing and luggage.</AbstractNarration>
