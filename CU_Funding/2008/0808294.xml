    <AbstractNarration>Psiguria is a genus of Neotropical vines in the cucumber family with a distribution between Central and South America, including two species endemic to the geologically complex Caribbean islands. These islands have strikingly high levels of biotic diversity, but studies on the classification, evolution, and geographic history of the biota are seriously deficient in those focusing on plants. Psiguria has a mutualistic association with its pollinators, Heliconius butterflies, making it a model system for investigating co-evolution. An evolutionary history of the butterflies has been proposed, but is lacking for the plants. This study will provide a phylogeny for Psiguria and then test hypotheses of co-evolution. This study will provide a basis for resolving biogeographic history and a phylogenetic framework for ecologists and evolutionary biologists to address important questions about plant-insect interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will provide important scientific contributions beyond the systematics of Psiguria. The phylogenetic framework will provide a basis for ecologists and evolutionary biologists to ask questions about the multitude of associated organisms in the biological network including interactions with insect species in agricultural pest families. Knowledge gained from studying these interactions will add to our understanding of the related negative insect interactions with agriculturally important members of the cucumber family. Training of undergraduate students and interaction with a K-12 education program will expose students to research on evolution and conservation in tropical America.</AbstractNarration>
