    <AbstractNarration>It is common for similar anatomical structures and physiological processes to evolve independently in different species of animals and plants. This phenomenon (known as convergent evolution) reflects the fact that similar ecological pressures impose similar functional requirements; in other words, each task calls for a specific tool. What is not clear is whether convergently evolved traits share the same genetic and molecular basis. It is possible that different molecular pathways can be co-opted in different evolutionary lineages to produce superficially similar structures and adaptations.&lt;br/&gt; This hypothesis will be tested by identifying the genes responsible for evolutionary changes in color patterns in several species of fruit flies (Drosophila). Drosophila has been chosen as a model for this research due to the ease and low cost of genetic and molecular experimentation in this insect. If different genes are found to produce similar color patterns in different species, it will indicate that natural selection can utilize different sources of variation to achieve the same functional outcome. An opposite finding will suggest that the action of natural selection is constrained by the inherent structure of genetic pathways that control animal development. Given the increasing importance of understanding adaptive processes in human pathogens, agricultural pests, and other biological species that affect human society and economy, resolving this interplay between chance and necessity in evolution will help in the development of biological and chemical control strategies.&lt;br/&gt; An additional goal of this project is to train young scientists prepared to take the lead in analyzing molecular variation on genome-wide scales, and relating it to anatomical and physiological traits and environmental factors. Such training is essential for further advances in human medicine, agriculture, forestry, and biotechnology. This project will provide an opportunity for students to acquire first-hand research experience and expand their career options by complementing theoretical education with a practical application of the latest concepts and techniques.</AbstractNarration>
