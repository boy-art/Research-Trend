    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a sensor for the detection of multiple biomarkers with specific application to early detection and monitoring of ovarian cancer. The approach is based on a surface acoustic wave (SAW) transducer that integrates two critical functions, namely, removal of interfering proteins, and sensing of multiple biomarkers, on a single device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project is the first to propose and demonstrate removal of non-specifically bound (NSB) proteins from sensor surfaces using SAWs. NSB is a confounding factor for sensor response utilizing any sensing principle, optical, electrochemical or mass change. The proposed sensor is the first to integrate this removal function with the sensing function of any device. This is the first attempt at differential removal of bound proteins, one at a time, to achieve detection and quantification of multiple moieties on a single device surface. Many diseases, such as ovarian cancer, are characterized by elevated levels of select proteins in bodily fluids. Hence, this sensor will have wide applicability in medical diagnostics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;This work will allow for more wide-spread and easy testing than current practice and is also applicable to detection of multiple moieties for environmental and chemical detection applications. The proposed pilot testing of an interdisciplinary senior design project can lead to a sustainable model for engineering education. Proposed hands-on sensor units and associated experiments will lead to awareness of basic sensor principles and concepts among the participating school children. The proposed minority mentoring program can lead to recruitment into science and engineering programs.</AbstractNarration>
