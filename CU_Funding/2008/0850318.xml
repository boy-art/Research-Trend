    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing scholarships and support services in a program that especially targets under-served populations that major in the sciences at a rate far below the rest of the student population. The project emphasizes cohort formation, trust, and community. This faculty-driven Cohorts program focuses on talented students on the threshold of success in STEM areas. Building on a successful pilot project, the project has a dual structure of cohort support: the first comprises academic-year students in their first and second years (FOCUS), followed by the research-oriented Summer Science Fellows (SSF). The cohorts receive coordinated academic support, advising, mentoring, and career exploration opportunities. Each FOCUS cohort includes up to sixteen students, each of whom is receiving S-STEM scholarships and loan reduction. The SSF cohorts of four to six students each year also receive S-STEM academic-year scholarships and two years of summer-research funding from other sources. Over four years the initiative is supporting up to eighty-four unique FOCUS and eighteen SSF students, assuming some overlap between the cohorts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regarding broader impact, this project affects, especially through assessment and dissemination by the college's Science Education Resource Center, the college's HHMI-linked alliances and regional and national organizations via NSF-funded LSAMP MN North Star Alliance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's intellectual merit stems from the strength of the science programs and an overall strategy adapted to the college's environment after a systematic national investigation of successful programs. As the student population becomes increasingly diverse, the college's future success in the sciences hinges on increased engagement of traditionally under-served students.</AbstractNarration>
