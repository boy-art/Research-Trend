    <AbstractNarration>This project proposes to use magnetostratigraphy and single crystal argon dating methodologies to more precisely constrain the age of floras in the Warner Mountains in northeastern California. These floras are believed to record climatic deterioration from the late Eocene to early Oligocene. A refined geochronology of the Warner Mountains will help resolve whether or not Late Eocene/Early Oligocene boundary cooling was abrupt and synchronous both within the North American continent and globally, and whether it correlates with the Early Oligocene cooling seen in marine oxygen isotope curves. This, in turn, will help the community to better understand the nature of climatic change across North America during the transition from the greenhouse climates of the Eocene to the icehouse climates of the early Oligocene, and should be of broad interest to a wide spectrum of paleontologists, geologists, biologists, and paleoclimatologists. Outreach efforts by the PI continue to be extensive and will include training undergraduate students in both field and laboratory geology. The PI has, to date, published peer-reviewed scientific papers with more than 30 of his undergraduate students. Many of these students have gone on to successfully pursue the PhD at graduate institutions.</AbstractNarration>
