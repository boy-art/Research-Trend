    <AbstractNarration>Proposal SBE 0836012: PSLC&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to renew PSLC, the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center for an additional and final five year term. PSLC is situated at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, with the University of Pittsburgh as the principle partner institution. Like all Science of Learning Centers, PSLC is a multi-university, multi-year, interdisciplinary project to address the theoretical and practical issues involved in conducting rigorous laboratory-quality studies of learning in real-world classrooms enhanced with intelligent tutoring systems. Central to the vision of investigators is a focus on the conditions that enable "robust learning", learning that transfers to new situations, lasts for a long time and accelerates future learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the data generated is collected in large data-bases for mining by the broad community of learning researchers, not just by those associated with PSLC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than just a research center, PSLC is also committed to the education of undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral students; to increasing diversity among faculty, students and future scientists, and to the transfer of research results to educational practice.</AbstractNarration>
