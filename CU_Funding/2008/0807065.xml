    <AbstractNarration>This is a joint research project between The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) and the University of Alicante (UA) in Spain to study unexpected or emergent magnetism in metal nanocrystals. Magnetism has been observed in a variety of materials that are not expected to be magnetic, including the metal nanocrystals that will be studied in this research program. This research team will examine the underlying physics of emergent magnetic properties in gold and bismuth nanocrystals through a joint theoretical and experimental effort. The team at UT Austin will synthesize and measure the magnetic properties of gold and bismuth nanocrystals. The team at UA will perform model calculations of the electronic and magnetic properties of the nanocrystals, as well as experimental scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) measurements to measure the electronic properties of individual nanocrystals and to search for a definitive signature of ferromagnetism in these materials, if it exists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole group, including students and post-docs involved in the project, meets twice a month by videoconference to discuss the project. These regular group meetings provide students with a significant amount of interaction during the course of the project. In addition, students from UT Austin spend one month in Alicante every year, learning the theory and how the STS and AMR measurements are performed and, vice-versa, students from UA visit Austin for one month to learn about the nanocrystal synthesis and magnetic measurements. This international research program provides exposure to a combination of theory and experiment?both synthesis and property measurement?that offers students an outstanding training opportunity in interdisciplinary materials science and engineering. This research project also provides a unique and exciting environment for students to learn how to cooperate scientifically across political, social and geographical borders.</AbstractNarration>
