    <AbstractNarration>Project title: Collaborative Research: Joint influences of host genetics and community context on eco-evolutionary host-parasite dynamics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Why are some epidemics devastating to host populations, while others have only small effects? This question is particularly timely given that epidemics of infectious disease in wildlife populations have increased worldwide. In this project, Duffy and Hall will study links between the severity of fungal parasite epidemics in zooplankton host populations and interactions between evolutionary and ecological processes. One key factor that may shape disease severity is rapid evolution of disease resistance, fueled by genetic variation within host populations. If true, genetic variation in resistance could potentially dictate the severity of epidemics. If genetically diverse host populations can better withstand disease, results from this project might then suggest worrisome, causal links between worldwide increase in disease and the recent, widespread loss of biodiversity. A second key factor that may shape disease severity is predation. In particular, Duffy and Hall will consider the role of predators which selectively prey on infected hosts (a common occurrence in nature). They are particularly interested in whether predation and genetic variation in resistance interact to determine epidemic severity.&lt;br/&gt; This project will use a three-pronged approach to tackle these questions. It will combine intensive studies of natural epidemics in lake plankton, laboratory experiments manipulating host diversity and predation, and development of epidemiological models that incorporate both rapid evolution and selective predation. The processes examined and the modeling work naturally extend to many other disease systems. Therefore, this work will ultimately produce theoretical guidance for efforts seeking to understand and control the severity of wildlife disease.</AbstractNarration>
