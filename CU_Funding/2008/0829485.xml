    <AbstractNarration>The SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry has been awarded a grant to establish high-speed Internet capacity at the Adirondack Ecological Center, a field station in the central Adirondack Mountains of northern New York State. The enhancement will provide T-1 access to the dining center, student quarters and faculty/scientist housing via fiber-optic cable and wireless nodes. The station has seen a dramatic expansion in station use, data sharing, research and educational outreach programs over recent years. The new capabilities afforded by the improved Internet connectivity will lead to increased research productivity and enhancement of the existing extensive undergraduate and graduate educational programs. People working at the station will have immediate access to critical scientific resources including geographic information systems, literature and research data available throughout the world. The station staff will also have much improved capacity to disseminate data and information about research projects. The new network will also facilitate collaboration through improved communication within the Forest and with collaborators throughout the world including LTER, OBFS and NEON. The improved communication will also advance strategic goals of developing onsite residential programs for graduate students during the academic year by enabling greater distance learning via course offered on the main campus in Syracuse. Finally, improved communications will further the station's goal of engaging business leaders and policy makers for educational experiences.</AbstractNarration>
