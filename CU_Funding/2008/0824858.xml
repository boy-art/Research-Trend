    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Beanland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to continue the yearly meeting, Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting (VOTCAM), which has been held almost continuously since 1992. The intention is to move the conference from the University of Richmond to Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) for the next three years, continuing the tradition of this extremely successful conference while encouraging an up-and-coming academic research institution (and now the largest university in Virginia), VCU, to engage analysts from across Virginia and beyond. The broader impact of the proposed meeting is in establishing a forum where researchers and graduate students can come together in a supporting environment to share ideas and establish research contacts. VOTCAM allows people from a variety of different areas of analysis - from traditional operator theory and complex analysis to non-traditional applications such as quantum computing - to learn more about the field outside of their own research area. VCU is an open enrollment university dedicated to educating students of diverse backgrounds, with a particular emphasis on first generation college students. This diversity is reflected in the makeup of the undergraduate and graduate mathematics students, many of whom will be invited to participate in the meeting as student attendees.</AbstractNarration>
