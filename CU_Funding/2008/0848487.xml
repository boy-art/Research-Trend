    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Robert Compton of the University of Tennessee will continue and expand his research on negative ions. Studies of dipole and quadrupole bound anions will focus on photodetachment of these weakly bound anions in the difficult energy region near threshold (millielectron volts). Measurements of the photodetachment threshold will provide accurate electron affinities of these anions which can be compared to less accurate values obtained by Rydberg electron transfer and electric field detachment methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resonantly-enhanced multiphoton dissociation experiments will be conducted at the Netherlands free electron facility (FELIX) on vibrational spectroscopy of multiply charged anions. Collisional dissociation studies of multiply-charged anions are being carried out at the ELISA ion storage ring in Aarhus, Denmark. Another goal is to record the first photodetachment circular dichroism cross section for a chiral negative ion such as the tartaric acid anion and dianion. All of these studies will have a strong theoretical component This research will be conducted with the assistance of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as with collaborators within and outside the United States. Through their participation in this research and the collaborations with other American and international groups the students will gain valuable experience that will prepare them for advanced studies or employment in the academic, government or industrial sectors of the economy.</AbstractNarration>
