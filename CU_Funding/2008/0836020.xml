    <AbstractNarration>This exploratory project will develop Success Partnership for Increasing Recruitment into Technology (SPIRIT), which will integrate and build upon ongoing effective programs at secondary schools, community colleges, and the University of California, Riverside (UCR). San Bernardino and Riverside counties in Southern California together are larger than 10 states and home to more than 4 million people, but the region lags behind much of California in college matriculation rates and economic opportunity. This project will build on a year-old initiative from the Alliance for Education, operated by the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools, to establish pre-engineering curricula in high schools throughout the county. UCR will integrate outreach activities, mentoring, tutoring, design experiences, and teacher workshops into this initiative. The project will raise awareness of engineering and highlight the relevance of math and science instruction, increase student readiness to succeed in college engineering studies by strengthening their math and science preparation, and establish ongoing dialog among school teachers, school administrators, district administrators, community colleges, and four-year institutions? faculty and administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will emphasize fundamental engineering skills necessary for success in engineering which will help to secure our continuing leadership in technology by encouraging more students to enter engineering. The project will reach a large number of underrepresented minority students, and recruiting more of these students will increase and diversify the pipeline from K-12 to university engineering programs. UCR is one of America?s most diverse research-intensive universities. Approximately 35% of undergraduates are underrepresented minorities, and it is an accredited Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). In addition, the schools involved in this project are also highly diverse. Having UCR college students tutor high school students in math and science will demonstrate to these students that people from neighborhoods and cultural backgrounds similar to their own can succeed in college and go on to careers in engineering. The activities also will build a sense of community and commitment on the part of the college students.</AbstractNarration>
