    <AbstractNarration>Kohn&lt;br/&gt;0807347&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The first two thrusts of this project are topics at the&lt;br/&gt;interface between mathematics, physics, and materials science,&lt;br/&gt;namely (a) modeling the evolution of a crystal surface below the&lt;br/&gt;roughening temperature, and (b) designing new schemes for&lt;br/&gt;"cloaking" regions of space from electromagnetic measurements. A&lt;br/&gt;third thrust lies at the boundary between mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;finance, namely (c) examining the impact on markets of&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous beliefs or "irrational investors." Concerning (a):&lt;br/&gt;the PI seeks a unification of two widely-used but apparently&lt;br/&gt;distinct approaches -- one based on step dynamics, the other&lt;br/&gt;using a fourth-order partial differential equation. Concerning&lt;br/&gt;(b): the PI continues his recent work on a&lt;br/&gt;change-of-variable-based cloaking scheme; in particular he&lt;br/&gt;explores the design of "near-cloaks," obtained using regular&lt;br/&gt;rather than singular changes of variables, at finite frequency. &lt;br/&gt;Concerning (c): the PI explores how the heterogeneity of&lt;br/&gt;investors' beliefs can lead in some settings to speculation and&lt;br/&gt;market "bubbles."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project addresses topics where mathematics can have&lt;br/&gt;great impact on other areas of science. Thrust (a) -- involving&lt;br/&gt;the evolution of a crystal surface -- addresses a core topic in&lt;br/&gt;materials science, of great importance for the design and&lt;br/&gt;manufacture of electronic devices. Moreover, its goal is the&lt;br/&gt;linkage of models with different length and time scales -- a&lt;br/&gt;recurring issue in many areas of modern science. Successful&lt;br/&gt;treatment of this example establishes a paradigm that could also&lt;br/&gt;be useful in other settings. Thrust (b) -- involving schemes for&lt;br/&gt;"cloaking" regions of space -- addresses a current frontier in&lt;br/&gt;optics. If the proposed cloaking schemes can be realized in&lt;br/&gt;practice, they will provide a means for making objects difficult&lt;br/&gt;to "see" using, for example, radar. But the PI's focus is not on&lt;br/&gt;device design; rather it is on the fundamental correctness of a&lt;br/&gt;specific "cloaking" scheme recently proposed by other&lt;br/&gt;investigators. Thrust (c) -- involving of heterogeneous beliefs&lt;br/&gt;or "irrational investors" -- addresses a central problem of&lt;br/&gt;modern economics. Real-world markets are complicated, but many&lt;br/&gt;of their key features can be understood using simple models. The&lt;br/&gt;recent "internet bubble" is a reminder that, even in the most&lt;br/&gt;efficient markets, the market price of an asset can greatly&lt;br/&gt;exceed its intrinsic value. The PI explores models in which this&lt;br/&gt;type of behavior is explained by the heterogeneity of investors'&lt;br/&gt;beliefs.</AbstractNarration>
