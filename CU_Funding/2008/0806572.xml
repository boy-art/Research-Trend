    <AbstractNarration>Semiconductor nanowires have emerged as a new class of materials with significant potential to reveal new fundamental physics and to propel new applications. This international collaborative research project brings together research teams from USA (University of Cincinnati, and Miami University) and Australia (Australian National University and University of Queensland) with expertise in state-of-the-art semiconductor nanowire heterostructure growth, high resolution electron microscopy, and high resolution optical spectroscopy, to advance the understanding of the electronic landscapes of these unique nanostructures. The overall goal is to understand how nanowire heterostructures affect the physics of electronic states and their interactions. The synergistic, collaborative research of this team will explore three significant research thrusts: (1) Achieving high quality growth of III-V nanowires and radial, axial and hybrid nanowire heterostructures (2) Understanding the physics of these novel nanowire heterostructures (3) Measuring and understanding p- and n- type doping of these structures. These studies are expected to advance the understanding of the nature of quantum confinement in tailored radial and axial heterostructures, how quantum confinement affects the localized and continuum electronic states and their coupling, spins, scattering mechanisms with other elementary excitations in nanowires, as well as interactions with external electric and magnetic fields. This research will directly involve the interaction among and the training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate students in multi-disciplinary area in an international setting. All participants in this research will be involved in an annual "Saturday International Nano Science and Engineering Day" for area middle school students where potential young scientists and engineers can explore nanoscience in an exciting hands-on environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a fundamental understanding of the 0- and 1-dimensional physics of nanowire heterostructures will have strong societal benefits, influencing the development of new thrusts in optoelectronic device technology and ultimately making possible new varieties of sensors and other compact devices. This project will also train our nation?s future workforce in the critical areas of nanoscience and engineering. The exposure of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows, to an international interdisciplinary scientific environment will deepen their understanding of the science involved and inform a more sophisticated perspective on the challenges and effectiveness of international collaboration, a signature of successful 21st research in nanoscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Materials World Network award makes possible a coherent integrated research and education effort among four universities in the US and Australia, on the growth and characterization of semiconductor nanowires as well as the understanding of the physics of their electronic states. This award is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
