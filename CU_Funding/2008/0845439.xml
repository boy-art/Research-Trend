    <AbstractNarration>Unlike most bioinformatics data, such as DNA sequences and protein&lt;br/&gt;structures, pathways show the interactions of different bio-chemical&lt;br/&gt;entities. Thus, each entity or subpathway can have a function in its&lt;br/&gt;pathway that the pathway can not realize without it. Formulating these&lt;br/&gt;functions presents exciting computational challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops algorithms for efficient and accurate&lt;br/&gt;computational analysis of pathways. The first step in achieving this&lt;br/&gt;goal is to build a mathematical model for functions of pathways and&lt;br/&gt;subpathways. This proposal defines the function of a subpathway as its&lt;br/&gt;contribution to the steady state of the entire pathway. Computing this&lt;br/&gt;contribution is a difficult problem especially for gene regulatory&lt;br/&gt;pathways. Existing methods can compute this for metabolic pathways,&lt;br/&gt;but they do not scale to even medium sized gene regulatory&lt;br/&gt;pathways. This proposal develops efficient methods for computing&lt;br/&gt;function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding the subpathway that has a desired function is a challenging&lt;br/&gt;problem. There is no clear way of searching for subpathways with&lt;br/&gt;desired functions using existing tools. This proposal develops&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for searching subpathways with desired function.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal takes this one step further, and develops mathematically&lt;br/&gt;sound algorithms for comparing two pathways so that the entities that&lt;br/&gt;map are functionally, homologically and topologically similar. This&lt;br/&gt;proposal also explores feature and reference-based index structures&lt;br/&gt;for biological pathway databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on the project can be found at the project web&lt;br/&gt;page:&lt;br/&gt; http://bioinformatics.cise.ufl.edu/</AbstractNarration>
