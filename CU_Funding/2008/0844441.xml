    <AbstractNarration>The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Amar Flood of Indiana University for the synthesis and characterization of modular anion-binding receptors, called triazolophanes. Surprisingly, these triazolophanes incorporate only weak CH hydrogen bond donors. Therefore, the structural and electronic parameters that enforce strong anion affinities in these receptors will be determined by thermodynamic analyses. As a consequence of these investigations, the strengths of the two types of CH donors will be addressed. The effects of electronics, size and shape, flexibility, charge, axial ligation and dimerization will be evaluated. Secondly, template-directed approaches will be developed to effect more efficient syntheses of the triazolophanes by conducting kinetics studies in a step-wise manner on the individual reaction steps involved in the overall one-pot preparation. The proposed research will answer questions about how triazolophanes bind anions, how strong the C-H H-bonding interactions are, and about the templating effect of anions in macrocyclization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Dr. Flood is developing inquiry-based learning modules using nanoscience and nanotechnology as a hook for non-science majors at local high schools and at the undergraduate level in order to engage students with science. The PI wants to introduce high school students to real scientific inquiry in the lecture hall versus canned discourse in which individuals can choose their particular level of involvement. He is going to use the chemical technology and the nanoscience involved in producing the iPod to attract students. For the younger people who are interested in playing video games, the PI is going to involve game theory in education. To help with this project, he is collaborating with the Indiana University College of Education to use virtual worlds (Quest Atlantis) and gaming strategies to attract the younger students.</AbstractNarration>
