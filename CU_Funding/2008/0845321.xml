    <AbstractNarration>The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the research efforts of Professor H. V. Rasika Dias of the University of Texas at Arlington to obtain and study thermally-stable gold and mercury complexes of carbon monoxide, ethylene, acetylene, and other small alkenes and alkynes. Novel, metal-catalyzed, carbon-halogen bond activation processes are also under investigation. Complexes with mercury(II) and gold(I) bonds to small carbon-based, unsaturated molecules are difficult to isolate. Professor Dias uses certain weakly coordinating anions as supporting ligands or counter anions for the stabilization of such species. The crystalline solids of these complexes display unusually high thermal and air stability. They serve as useful catalysts for various transformations, including carbon-halogen bond activation chemistry. Professor Dias and his group are involved in developing web-based methods for the exchange and dissemination of research results and for the live-delivery of online courses on various aspects of chemistry. The lecture materials are especially intended for students in foreign academic institutions with faculty shortages. Professor Dias is active in mentoring K-12 teachers, high school students, and undergraduate researchers with diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
