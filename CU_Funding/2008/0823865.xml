    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop a modeling and control framework for control and information exchange of power systems with alternative energy distributed generation (AEDG)sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research approach is to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) develop hybrid models for power systems containing AEDG sources; &lt;br/&gt;(2) develop a systematic way to achieve optimal information exchange among&lt;br/&gt;distributed controllers; &lt;br/&gt;(3) design local control units and supervisory controllers that control a&lt;br/&gt;microgrid or a power system with multiple microgrids in a distributed fashion; &lt;br/&gt;(4) implement a benchmark system with multiple AEDG sources to verify the modeling and control framework and methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Power systems with AEDG sources are modeled as hybrid systems. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Overall control is achieved through the combination of local control and supervisory control. &lt;br/&gt;(3) A formal and systematic way to design optimal information exchanges among distributed supervisors is proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Alternative energy sources are well-known for the capability of being used forclean electricity generation and for improving energy security. Tremendous challenges are introduced in the system operation strategy, protection, communication, stability and reliability by deploying AEDG systems at a large scale. The success of this project will help us to achieve clean and sustainable electricity generation using alternative energy sources. The results of this project will also provide a systematic approach to optimal design of control and communication among distributed systems. At least one female and under-represented minority student will be involved in this project. International collaboration will be pursued to broaden the impact.</AbstractNarration>
