    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project strives for fundamental innovations including: (i) a growth approach to make 3D spiral PBG materials by a glancing-angle-deposition method; (ii) a new design architecture to realize a photonic equivalent of a semiconductor heterostructure using PBG materials; (iii) control of the flow of light at microscopic scales by a photonic heterostructure; (iv) a new scheme of conformal metallic coating to modify the optical properties of a PBG material. A potential outcome of the spiral PBG and photonic heterostructures is diffraction-less control of the flow of light on-chip. The approach is based on thin-film growth of slanted rods at a pre-designed sequence that produces desirable lattice symmetry. This approach is expected to lead to a spatially coherent 3D spiral PBG material without using extensive fabrication tools and it may be scaleable, e.g., up to 6-8 inches. The heterostructure desired has a 3D-2D-3D design that consists of a 2D PBG sandwiched on both sides by 3D PBGs. This combination provides the high photon confinement of a 3D PBG while offering the flexibility and ease of creating functional optical devices (waveguides, bends, filters, cavities) in a 2D PBG material. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science with high technological relevance, and the project represents a balanced research and educational effort. The investigators have an established track record of involving undergraduates and graduates in research, and this will be continued. Such exposure to cutting-edge research instills confidence, creativity and motivation in students. The PI and Co-PIs also have a strong partnership with high school outreach as well as interacting with RPI?s Center for Initiatives in Pre-College Education (CIPCE).</AbstractNarration>
