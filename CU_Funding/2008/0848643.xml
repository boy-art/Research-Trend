    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jingsong Zhang of the University of California at Riverside will investigate the photochemistry of prototypical polyatomic free radicals in molecular beams. High resolution high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight spectrometry (HRTOF) will be utilized to study spectroscopy and state-resolved photodissociation dynamics of reactive intermediates important in combustion and atmospheric chemistry. The systems to be studied include vinyl radical and vinylidene, formyl radical, and HOCO radical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific issues to be examined include: (a) open-shell electronic states and potential energy surfaces, and their nonadiabatic interactions and influences on photodissociation dynamics; (b) detailed mechanisms involving complex nuclear rearrangements and competitive dissociation pathways of free radicals; and (c) free radical electronic structures, thermodynamics, and energetics. The research will also provide high-quality benchmarks for the theoretical chemistry and physics communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A diversified group of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of California at Riverside will participate in this research. They will acquire knowledge and skills through the multi-disciplinary research activities. Faculty members and undergraduate students from California State University and local community colleges will participate in the research during the summer.</AbstractNarration>
