    <AbstractNarration>The exchange of carbon between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is a critical component of the global carbon cycle. Movement of terrestrial carbon from land to water represents a loss of carbon from the former and a gain for the latter, and these changes must be taken into account when determining the net carbon balance of either system. In most terrestrial carbon cycle studies, the magnitude of this loss has not been determined, possibly resulting in an over-estimation of carbon storage in the terrestrial system. If the carbon that enters the aquatic system is eventually respired, or lost to the atmosphere, then this is a potentially serious error in calculations of regional and global carbon cycling. The specific goal of this project is to determine the age of terrestrially-derived carbon from forests in Massachusetts and the subsequent metabolic fate of this carbon in adjacent aquatic systems over seasonal and annual cycles. A multi-disciplinary approach will employ a variety of biochemical and analytical techniques to determine the age and fate of soil carbon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will have important implications for decision makes and managers who are interested in maximizing net carbon storage within particular regions. Outreach efforts will focus on the concept of connectivity between inland ecosystems and downstream estuaries and the coastal zone. The focus will be on improving the coverage of concepts and topics in aquatic ecology in curricula for K-12 education. The principle investigator is partnered with the Math and Science Center of Virginia. Three teacher-student teams consisting of one high school biology or earth science teacher and four 10th grade students, with priority given to students from under-represented groups, will participate in a two-week, field-oriented institute to educate and provide research experiences.</AbstractNarration>
