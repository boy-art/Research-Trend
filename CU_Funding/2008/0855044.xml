    <AbstractNarration>This award will support research in the area of coherent network analysis --- detection and reconstruction of gravitational wave (GW) signals with multiple GW detectors (detector networks). Work will be done on development of the coherent network algorithms and their applications to burst searches which target detection of GW transients from the most violent events in the Universe. Coherent algorithms will enable not only a detection of gravitational waves, but also the astrophysical analyses of GW signals and measurements of source properties. Such measurements will lead to understanding of the underlying physics and the dynamics of GW sources, may reveal the origin of known cosmic events (such as short duration gamma-ray bursts), probe the equations of state of neutron stars and allow a thorough test of General Relativity. Work will be done on inclusion of source models into the coherent analysis in order to improve the confidence of detection, perform characterization of sources and confirm or rule out the models. This will be particularly important for the enhanced and advanced GW detectors which target the first detection and study of gravitational wave signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interferometric gravitational wave detectors are among the most advanced instruments ever built to explore the Universe. Their complex design and sophisticated data analysis provide unique educational and research opportunities for students in all areas of physics. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved with sophisticated methods for extraction of signals from noise, computational schemes for manipulation of large data sets, data processing on large computing clusters and modern astrophysical theories. The proposed research addresses problems of GW detection with the worldwide network of gravitational wave detectors. Participation in the joint data analysis conducted in collaboration with multinational teams will give students a rich research experience and exposure to diverse cultural approaches in conducting research and pursuing science to prepare them for a wide spectrum of career opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
