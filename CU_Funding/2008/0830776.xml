    <AbstractNarration>Steganographic and Steganalytic Methods&lt;br/&gt;for Timing Channels with Side Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses dual problems of steganography (design of&lt;br/&gt;coding techniques for covert communications) and steganalysis&lt;br/&gt;(design of statistical methods for detection of covert communications)&lt;br/&gt;applied to timing channels on asynchronous networks. Hidden messages&lt;br/&gt;are embedded by modulating the timings of a cover packet stream&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., SSH file transfer data; keystroke data for instant messaging&lt;br/&gt;or other interactive session) which plays the role of side information&lt;br/&gt;for the encoder. The encoder is also subject to causality and latency constraints.&lt;br/&gt;Hence the objective of this research is to construct and analyze novel methods&lt;br/&gt;for covert communications over timing channels with side information,&lt;br/&gt;as well as novel methods for detecting them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is organized around four research thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;1) Develop mathematical formulations and research the information-theoretic&lt;br/&gt; limits of timing codes with side information. The problem formulation&lt;br/&gt; includes a statistical model for the input packet process (e.g., &lt;br/&gt; a renewal process, or a Markov process), steganographic constraints&lt;br/&gt; (to guarantee statistical undetectability of the embedded messages),&lt;br/&gt; causality constraints, and latency constraints.&lt;br/&gt;2) Develop and analyze a family of practical codes that satisfy the above&lt;br/&gt; constraints. These codes are nonlinear and stochastic (they inject&lt;br/&gt; an optimized amount of ``noise'' via a queue) and&lt;br/&gt; we refer to them as queue-based steganographic codes.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop an efficient computational framework for optimizing&lt;br/&gt; information-theoretic functionals associated with queueing processes.&lt;br/&gt;4) Construct a steganalysis learning machine (based on empirical data&lt;br/&gt; and various timing codes) which returns a binary decision about&lt;br/&gt; the presence of hidden data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact and Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project is highly multidisciplinary and involves a synergy between&lt;br/&gt;research and educational activities in random processes, communications,&lt;br/&gt;coding, queueing theory, information theory, statistics, and learning&lt;br/&gt;theory. The project addresses fundamental questions with applications&lt;br/&gt;to information protection and cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;Other impact includes computational methods for queueing processs,&lt;br/&gt;steganographic methods for signal processing and other timing channels, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Many graduate students are interested in moving into such an&lt;br/&gt;attractive research area, which combines breadth and strong emphasis&lt;br/&gt;on fundamentals with practical relevance. We intend to train these&lt;br/&gt;students for leadership roles in information technology.</AbstractNarration>
