    <AbstractNarration>Dr. John Wisniewski is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Washington. Dr. Wisniewski will address two questions fundamental to advancing our understanding of the formation and early evolution of exoplanets: 1) How do dust grains grow and evolve in protoplanetary disks?; and 2) What is the architecture of long- and short-period exoplanets in debris-disk systems? He will use ground- and space-based multi-wavelength high-contrast imaging techniques to map the spatial and size distribution of dust in protoplanetary disks to enable him to investigate how dust evolves from particle-size grains to planetesimals, the building blocks of planets. Dr. Wisniewski will also use high-contrast imaging techniques and high-precision astrometry to search for evidence of long- and short-period exoplanets in debris-disk systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, Dr. Wisniewski will integrate his exoplanet research into two core education and public outreach activities. He will develop a suite of exoplanet-related active-learning exercises for use in introductory college courses, develop corresponding assessment tools to measure quantitatively the effectiveness of these exercises, and site-test them via courses he will teach as a Fellow. Dr. Wisniewski will also develop a "Diversity in Exoplanets: Diversity in Astronomy" planetarium outreach program, targeted at middle- through high-school students, which highlights both the diverse nature of exoplanets and exoplanetary systems detected to date and the diverse nature of the astronomers making these discoveries.</AbstractNarration>
