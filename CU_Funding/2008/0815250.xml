    <AbstractNarration>Intelligent Merit: This study will examine and clarify for policymakers and researchers the impact of statewide policy changes that increased the availability of advanced STEM courses for a greater number of schools and students. The proposer will analyze the extent to which the policy changes affect outcomes for all students, particularly students who are underrepresented in STEM areas. This study, then, will provide critical information about the effectiveness of policy changes for stakeholders who have a vested interest in understanding the effects of advanced curricular programs on student enrollment in STEM courses during high school and early college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address two key research questions: &lt;br/&gt;1. Who enrolls in accelerated academic programs? What are the factors (the student and school) that influence enrollment in different accelerated and non-accelerated curricular programs? &lt;br/&gt;2. Do accelerated academic programs increase students? STEM coursetaking in high school and during their first year of postsecondary school (Grade 13)? Do some programs increase STEM coursetaking more than others? Do these programs reduce gaps in STEM coursetaking among historically underrepresented students and their peers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will use a mixed method approach to address the research questions that includes a quantitative analysis of extant longitudinal data in the state of Florida and a qualitative assessment of non-statistical factors through site visits to schools. Ten years of quantitative data from the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) will serve as the main source of information the proposer will use to study the characteristics of both students and schools. The FLDOE dataset includes a rich array of high school and postsecondary data (e.g. transcripts; dual enrollment and achievement data in these courses; regular 1-12 grades school test scores; demographic data; poverty index information). Two sets of school site visits will be conducted in the state?s major urban centers as well as small suburban high schools to provide insights not captured through quantitative analysis. During the initial visits, data will be collected via course catalogs and interviews with school personnel. For follow-up visits, data will be collected through student focus groups about all aspects of course offerings and course taking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Contribution to the field of knowledge about student enrollment in advanced STEM coursework will likely advance discovery in this area. The extensiveness of the work (examination of student and school factors from high school to college in mathematics and science) increases the importance of results to local and national policymakers and researchers. The wide range of expertise (individuals and institutions) adds significantly to the strength of the proposal and increases the credibility of expected outcomes. Lessons-learned from prior work will serve as the foundation for the development of some of the study?s data collection instruments. The dissemination plan is strong and the Urban Institute appears well positioned to carry out this component of the scope of work.</AbstractNarration>
