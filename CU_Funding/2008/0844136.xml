    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0844136&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Philip L. Boyland, Louis S. Block,&lt;br/&gt;Alexander N. Dranishnikov, James E. Keesling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Florida Department of Mathematics will host a&lt;br/&gt;joint Ulam Centennial and 43rd Annual Spring Topology and&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical Systems Conference (Ulam Centennial STDC-2009) from&lt;br/&gt;Saturday, March 7 through Thursday, March 12, 2009. The Annual&lt;br/&gt;Spring STDC's are among the nation's most successful series of&lt;br/&gt;topology/dynamics conferences. Stanislaw Ulam would turn 100 in&lt;br/&gt;Spring, 2009. He was one of the preeminent mathematical&lt;br/&gt;scientists of the 20th century and a Graduate Research Professor&lt;br/&gt;at the University of Florida. In light of Ulam's many&lt;br/&gt;contributions to topology, dynamics, and related fields, it is&lt;br/&gt;very fitting that the annual STDC be combined with an Ulam&lt;br/&gt;Centennial. The joint conference will maintain the basic&lt;br/&gt;structure and sessions of the STDC, but will be extended by 3&lt;br/&gt;days to allow additional special sessions and plenary lectures in&lt;br/&gt;the areas of Ulam's many contributions to mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology studies generalized notions of spatial structure;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical Systems studies the topological and analytic nature of&lt;br/&gt;time evolution. Each is a fundamental part of modern mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and has applications as far ranging as robotics, fluid mixing,&lt;br/&gt;computer networks and cardiac rhythms. Conferences are&lt;br/&gt;fundamental to the strength and development of mathematics, and&lt;br/&gt;as such are a fundamental part of the national scientific&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure. This conference will combine the latest results&lt;br/&gt;in Topology and Dynamical Systems with many applied topics&lt;br/&gt;associated with Stan Ulam. While Ulam is perhaps best remembered&lt;br/&gt;by the public for his participation in the Manhattan Project, his&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and scientific contributions were wide and&lt;br/&gt;deep. They include significant work in numerical methods,&lt;br/&gt;classical mechanics, dynamical systems, number theory, graph&lt;br/&gt;theory, set theory, and ergodic theory. Inspired by Ulam's&lt;br/&gt;example, the conference will advance top quality research in&lt;br/&gt;Topology and Dynamical Systems while facilitating broad and deep&lt;br/&gt;interaction among adjacent mathematical research areas and&lt;br/&gt;between abstract and applied research.</AbstractNarration>
