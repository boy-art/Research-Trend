    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Mietek Jaroniec of Kent State University. Prof. Jaroniec and his students will investigate ways to tailor the surface properties of periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) by employing a novel strategy, which involves the self assembly of reactive organosilicas and block copolymers accompanied by chemical reactions that lead to the formation of desired bridging and pendant organic groups. The study will result in new mesoporous materials with tailored surface and framework properties. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to graduate students who will be involved in this largely interdisciplinary project in the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Prof. Jaroniec and his students will also prepare and deliver a series of lectures to promote nanoscience and nanotechnology to students in area high schools.</AbstractNarration>
