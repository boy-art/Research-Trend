    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to develop multifunctional nanosensors for biomedical applications based on single nanocomposite nanowires (NWs) (nanomaterial-embedded single-conducting polymer NWs). The approach is to build highly efficient biomarker sensors using electrochemically grown NWs that are easily constructed and reproducible because of the unique nature of the proposed NW fabrication with process controllability and site-specific method. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: NW sensor technology will be developed using single nanocomposite NWs in the proposed work. In order to demonstrate a single nanocomposite NW biomedical sensor, a cardiac sensor is selected to detect myoglobin, one of the very commonly used biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). During the proposed work, the relationship between single NW lengths and diameters will be studied both theoretically and experimentally for optimizing sensor performances. The proposed research will provide information about the coupling effects of conducting polymers with carbon nanotubes or nanoparticles in addition to the properties of the individual components with synergistic effects such as mechanical stability, easy fabrication, and conductivity controllability.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research will find applications of nanocomposite NWs for biomedical industries, which will benefit our society and advance future technology. The proposed single nanocomposite NW technique could lead to the possibility of diagnosing biomarkers that cannot be diagnosed with conventional technology. For educational efforts, participation in an existing outreach program such as Pittsburgh Junior Academy of Science (PJAS) in connection with course development will be incorporated.</AbstractNarration>
