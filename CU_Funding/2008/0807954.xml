    <AbstractNarration>Zheng&lt;br/&gt;DMS-08-7954&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies two important areas in&lt;br/&gt;nanocomposites: (1) homogenized effective dielectric constant of&lt;br/&gt;nanocomposites; and (2) percolation-dominated electrical&lt;br/&gt;conductivity of nanocomposites. This project is focused on&lt;br/&gt;anisotropic systems with orientationally ordered nanoparticles,&lt;br/&gt;and is based on an accurate description of the nanoparticle&lt;br/&gt;orientational probability distribution function from&lt;br/&gt;flow-processing databases, which we then map to effective&lt;br/&gt;properties through volume averaging and percolation phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;In the first part, the effective dielectric tensor is considered&lt;br/&gt;in two explicit systems of current interests: high dielectric&lt;br/&gt;constant nanoparticles dispersed in polymers, and conducting&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticles dispersed in polymers. Both systems are observed&lt;br/&gt;to lead to enhanced effective dielectric properties. This&lt;br/&gt;requires careful preparation, because the properties are&lt;br/&gt;extremely sensitive to details of composition and processing. In&lt;br/&gt;the second part, key aspects of salient electric properties are&lt;br/&gt;considered, such as percolation threshold modification by&lt;br/&gt;mechanical loading, multiscale homogenization method, and a&lt;br/&gt;molecular-scale electron hopping model. Numerical and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical homogenization and non-equilibrium percolation&lt;br/&gt;techniques need to be developed to address these challenges. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed projects modify, apply, test, and extend existing&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory and numerical approaches for two-phase (or&lt;br/&gt;three phase, if interphase is considered) composites, where the&lt;br/&gt;number of particles and new surface area simply overwhelm&lt;br/&gt;existing tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The aspirations for extreme property enhancements through&lt;br/&gt;designer nanoparticles mixed into traditional materials are based&lt;br/&gt;on prototype experiments. However, there are new challenges&lt;br/&gt;unique to nanocomposites for which there are no predictive&lt;br/&gt;mathematical or computational tools. This project is a response&lt;br/&gt;to these needs, through a coordinated combination of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;analysis and scientific computation, ranging in scale from&lt;br/&gt;individual particles to bulk properties. Today, limitations&lt;br/&gt;imposed by particle numbers only allow low moments of the&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticle distributions to be measured, and the inherent&lt;br/&gt;material sensitivity to the details of the distribution observed&lt;br/&gt;in experiments is unknown. This project gives insight into the&lt;br/&gt;mechanism underlying extreme property gains, and thus provides&lt;br/&gt;key input into design and control strategies.</AbstractNarration>
