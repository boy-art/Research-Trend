    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Training and Research Experiences in Nonlinear Dynamics (TREND) REU Site at the University of Maryland. The main goal of the program is to involve undergraduate students in frontier research on nonlinear dynamics. The program is also aimed at helping undergraduate students prepare for graduate school, and for research and teaching positions throughout industry and academia. The program will involve approximately 10 students who will spend 11 weeks in the summer on campus involved in research. Examples of possible theoretical and experimental research topics include: nanophotonic devices, spatio-temporal chaos and synchronism of chaotic systems, chaotic microwave circuits, granular media, development of singularities in fluids and solids, nonlinear dynamics in optical systems and charged particle beams, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence and nonlinear phenomena in plasmas. Seminar series will complement and reinforce the learning experience. Student projects and presentations will be judged on the final day of the program, and winners will be funded to present their work at a national conference.</AbstractNarration>
