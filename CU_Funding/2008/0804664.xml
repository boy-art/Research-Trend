    <AbstractNarration>Project ASK: Applying Student Knowledge (ASK) for Success in Computer Science is an S-STEM project that increases the number of academically talented and financially needy students graduating with undergraduate degrees in Computer Science. A cohort of 20 students, composed of incumbent sophomores and transfer students, are identified and selected to be ASK Scholars. The acronym, "ASK", refers to the use of shared student insight into problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership. The ASK Scholars participate in weekly workshops, seminar series, and closely interact with the co-PIs, senior personnel and other faculty members who provide academic advising, general guidance, leadership, professional and research experience. The student leadership experience comes from participation in professional student organizations as well as local and regional programming contests. Coupled with research experience from participation in faculty research programs and/or professional experience gathered from participation in the existing cooperative education program, these experiences provide a basis for overall intellectual growth and promote increased student confidence for post-graduate employment or continued education. The use of teamwork, small class sizes, collaboration and student-motivated question and answer sessions positively supports recent research in the field of computer science regarding educational impact and effective retention strategies. The effects are professionally evaluated and disseminated to the public through academic venues. Additionally, ASK Scholars are prepared to enter the scientific workforce or graduate school as competent, highly trained individuals with a background in teamwork and research.</AbstractNarration>
