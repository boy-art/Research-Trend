    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematical Sciences at George Mason University will host a multidisciplinary REU program in computational mathematics and nonlinear dynamics of biological, bio-inspired and engineering systems. This nine-week summer program will expose eight qualified undergraduate students and a K-12 teacher to advanced topics in mathematics, problem-solving techniques and multidisciplinary applications. This summer research program will provide the participants with a unique experience of how mathematics can be applied to understand the qualitative and quantitative behavior of biological, bio-inspired and engineering systems. Selected problems range from Reconstruction of protein networks and Aneurysm mechanics to Modeling of Micro Air Vehicles, Neuronal field models, Porous substrates and Materials engineering applications. Through these research problems, we hope to encourage students and teachers to learn by discovery and enhance their understanding of the multidisciplinary role of mathematics in engineering, science and medicine. This nine-week summer program will also include the following activities: lecture series on topics; graduate mentoring club; guest colloquiums; student seminars; computational laboratory and; scientific &amp; social tours. The REU site will involve eight qualified faculty who have excelled in their research accomplishments, have guided graduate and undergraduate research, and have been involved in K-12 outreach activities. The site will also involve two graduate students each year who will serve as mentors for the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-disciplinary research program will greatly enhance the awareness of the ever-increasing utility of mathematical and computational approaches in understanding biological, bio-inspired and engineering systems; contribute to the scientific development of undergraduate students and K-12 teachers and; will nurture the intellectual growth and development of graduate students providing them with a valuable experience of mentoring. This program will also integrate and complement the existing Undergraduate Research in Computational Mathematics program at George Mason University which is an NSF funded CSUMS program. The symbiotic relationship between the existing CSUMS and the REU program will provide opportunities for targeted students to prepare for success in the mathematical and engineering fields and assist them from college to graduate school. The REU program will provide a valuable experience to two K-12 teachers in problem-solving and open-ended exploration in high-school mathematics classrooms. This program will also greatly encourage women and underrepresented minorities to pursue multidisciplinary careers that bridge mathematical, computational and biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
