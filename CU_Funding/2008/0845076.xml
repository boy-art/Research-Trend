    <AbstractNarration>This project includes the development of theory and algorithms, the design of a system architecture, and the prototyping, testing and large-scale deployment of two mobile sensing platforms. The two applications are highway traffic estimation and river flow estimation using GPS-equipped smartphones. The algorithms run online, gather mobile data and send it to a server, which uses inverse modeling to estimate the state of the system. It broadcasts information back to the smartphones and to the internet. A field operational test, called Mobile Millennium is aimed at reaching thousands of users in California. The river flow monitoring project is aimed at deploying a hundred drifters in the Sacramento Delta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contributions are in the field of Lagrangian sensing in large-scale cyber-physical infrastructure systems. "Lagrangian" refers to a form of sensing in which sensors measure quantities along their trajectories; "cyber-physical" refers to the flow of information and computing in a system governed by physical phenomena. The project investigates the following question: how to reconstruct the state of a distributed system from mobile sensors which cannot control their motion? The mathematical techniques used include inverse modeling, applied to partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses some important issues related to transportation and clean water. With the free downloadable smartphone software, commuters have real-time traffic information to increase their travel efficiency. By involving students from underrepresented minorities, the UC Berkeley Disabled Student Program, and the Berkeley High School, this research provides a valuable opportunity for students to develop their interest in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
