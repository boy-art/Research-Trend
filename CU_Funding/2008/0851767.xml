    <AbstractNarration>Mammalian reproduction is associated with high metabolic and physiological requirements for females. Animals living in degraded habitats may not be able to support these heightened needs; thus, reproduction may be compromised. Using the endangered red colobus monkey (Procolobus rufomitratus) of Kibale National Park, Uganda as a model, this study investigates the relationship between habitat quality and female reproductive function by comparing groups living in previously logged areas of the forest with groups living in unlogged areas. There are three main objectives to this study: 1) to investigate the relationship between habitat quality and ovarian function using estrogens and progestins as indicators; 2) to determine the mechanisms for changes in reproductive function due to habitat quality by examining intermediary indicators such as cortisol (a stress hormone) and ketones (an indicator of nutritional intake); and 3) to investigate female behavioral differences between habitats, especially regarding feeding and mating. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urine will be collected from adult females and analyzed for hormone concentrations and ketone levels. Hormone concentrations will be measured with radioimmunoassays (reproductive hormones) and enzymeimmunoassays (stress hormones). A combination of Geographic Information System, Remote Sensing technologies, and food tree measurements will be used for habitat classifications. Finally, behavioral observations will be recorded for adult females. By integrating reproductive hormones, stress hormones, ketones, behavioral observations, and habitat characteristics, this study will clarify the physiological and behavioral connections between habitat quality and female reproductive function. Additionally, this study will examine what physiological mechanisms red colobus may use to cope with degrading habitats and will consider evidence for phenotypic plasticity and developmental reaction norms. Overall, this research will provide important theoretical and methodological considerations for future studies of primate reproduction, and results of this study will be incorporated into the larger conservation and monitoring project at Kibale National Park. This research will provide crucial information for future conservation strategies and for understanding the response of nonhuman primates to their greatest threat, habitat disturbance.</AbstractNarration>
