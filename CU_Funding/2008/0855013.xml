    <AbstractNarration>The origin of the elements remains one of the largest unanswered questions in nuclear physics today. In particular, nucleosynthesis processes involving nuclei far from stability (i.e., the rp- and r-processes) remain largely untested. This award will fund the participation of this group in an initial experiment that has been approved for a direct mass measurement of proton drip-line nuclei relevant to the astrophysical rp-process. This work involves an international collaboration in nuclear astrophysics at the RIKEN Radioactive Ion Beam Factory (RIBF). Future experiments are planned to directly measure the masses of neutron-rich nuclei relevant to the r-process of nucleosynthesis, as well as experiments to measure nuclear structure far from stability. Experiments involving very exotic nuclei are made possible by the high intensities of the RIBF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As broader impacts of the program, both graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the program, providing exposure to science at an international level. An international collaboration will be engaged in the proposed work, and an American presence will be established at what is currently the most powerful heavy ion accelerator on the planet.</AbstractNarration>
