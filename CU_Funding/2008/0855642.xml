    <AbstractNarration>Many technological marvels in modern society rely upon our ability to&lt;br/&gt;understand and control the properties of materials on a microscopic&lt;br/&gt;level, such as tuning the electrical conductivity in semiconductors that&lt;br/&gt;are used to make computer chips. In the last decade, there have been&lt;br/&gt;great advances in the creation and study of ultracold clouds of gaseous&lt;br/&gt;atoms, which are cooled by lasers to temperatures around a millionth of&lt;br/&gt;a degree above absolute zero. Ultracold atoms made in this way have the&lt;br/&gt;amazing property that their interactions can be arbitrarily controlled,&lt;br/&gt;which opens the possibility of using them to make designer materials or&lt;br/&gt;test models of complex and important phenomena such as high temperature&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity. The tool currently used to control these interactions&lt;br/&gt;is the application of a strong magnetic field, but magnetic fields have&lt;br/&gt;disadvantages; it is difficult to quickly change large magnetic fields&lt;br/&gt;or vary fields on small length scales. Prof. Killian's research group at&lt;br/&gt;Rice University in Houston, Texas will develop new techniques for&lt;br/&gt;manipulating atom-atom interactions using lasers, which are much more&lt;br/&gt;flexible and may open the way to new applications such as laser beams&lt;br/&gt;made of atoms instead of light, or the ability to make new states of matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will also involve at least two graduate students and one&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate student, and it will train them for high-technology&lt;br/&gt;careers in optics or materials. The ultracold atomic physics laboratory&lt;br/&gt;at Rice also has a partnership with the Houston campus of Yes Prep High&lt;br/&gt;School, a highly successful charter school targeting disadvantaged&lt;br/&gt;youth. This collaboration brings high school students into the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory for term-time visits and summer camps, and introduces them to&lt;br/&gt;the excitement of science at the frontiers of discovery in hopes of&lt;br/&gt;inspiring them to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math&lt;br/&gt;careers. Basic atomic physics experiments such as these are laying the&lt;br/&gt;scientific and human resources foundation today for the technological&lt;br/&gt;marvels of tomorrow.</AbstractNarration>
