    <AbstractNarration>This award establishes a new Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) Site in Soft Materials at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering of Pennsylvania State University. The program aims to train undergraduate students with knowledge, perspective, and teamwork experience to inspire them to pursue advanced degrees and careers in Engineering and Science disciplines. Each year, eleven undergraduate students are recruited nationally to work closely with faculty mentors across Materials Science, Chemical Engineering and Chemistry departments in computational and experimental research projects. Research is organized around polymers, biological macromolecules and self-assembled bio-structures which have potential use in pharmaceutical, agricultural and other industries. In addition to student research projects, the program includes seminars on research topics, guidance on career development, informal social activities to promote interaction among peers and with mentors, and final symposium where REU students present their research results. This REU site is envisioned as nucleating a "center-of-excellence for undergraduate research" in the field of soft materials while strengthening the education and research experience of future science and engineering workforce.&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site is funded by the NSF Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
