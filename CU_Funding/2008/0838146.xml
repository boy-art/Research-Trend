    <AbstractNarration>Recent models suggest that the middle crust beneath the high Tibetan &lt;br/&gt;Plateau flows southward toward India because of the difference in &lt;br/&gt;topography between Tibet and India; the models further suggest that this &lt;br/&gt;extruding material emerges at Earths surface in the high-erosion area &lt;br/&gt;of the Himalaya. These models make specific predictions about how the &lt;br/&gt;flow varies in magnitude and direction with depth. This project uses &lt;br/&gt;structural geology and geochronology to test these predictions to see &lt;br/&gt;whether the models are correct, and if they are not, how the models &lt;br/&gt;might be refined. This is an important test to conduct because the &lt;br/&gt;India?Asia collision is Earths largest ongoing continent collision and &lt;br/&gt;serves as an important lens for viewing older continental collisions that &lt;br/&gt;happened throughout Earths history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers Jeff Lee of Central Washington University, Bradley Hacker&lt;br/&gt; from the University of California Santa Barbara, and their students will &lt;br/&gt;investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of kinematics, &lt;br/&gt;vorticity, finite strain, and deformation temperature in strongly &lt;br/&gt;deformed middle crustal rocks exposed in the North Himalayan gneiss &lt;br/&gt;domes, southern Tibet, using structural petrology, finite-strain &lt;br/&gt;analysis, electron-backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and metamorphic &lt;br/&gt;monazite geochronology. This research is motivated by recently &lt;br/&gt;formulated thermal, mechanical channel flow/extrusion models that &lt;br/&gt;postulate that the middle crust exposed in the high Himalaya and &lt;br/&gt;southern Tibet was a low-viscosity, ductile material, bounded above and &lt;br/&gt;below by coeval normal- and thrust-sense shear zones, respectively, that &lt;br/&gt;flowed and extruded to the south. Flow within a channel can range from &lt;br/&gt;pure Couette flow to Poiseuille flow, or be a combination of the two. &lt;br/&gt;The investigators and their students will document the deformation and &lt;br/&gt;timing during ductile flow to provide a comprehensive spatial, thermal, &lt;br/&gt;and temporal history of deformation and flow in middle crustal rocks &lt;br/&gt;in southern Tibet. These studies, combined with similar published and &lt;br/&gt;ongoing studies in the high Himalaya, will provide an unprecedented &lt;br/&gt;view of middle crustal flow parallel to the transport direction over &lt;br/&gt;a distance of 50 to 100 km.</AbstractNarration>
