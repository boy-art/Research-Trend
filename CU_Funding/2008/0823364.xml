    <AbstractNarration>Epigenetics (inherited changes in phenotype not due to changes in DNA sequence) is a critical mode of gene control recently realized to have far reaching effects. It is caused by modification of the chromatin (DNA plus associated proteins) and acts at a level above normal gene control. How changes in chromatin cause changes in gene expression is a major area of research activity in both animals and plants. Understanding epigenetic control of genes will elucidate gene control of development, response to climatic stresses such as drought and heat and interaction with disease causing organisms. Several plant genomes have now been sequenced so it is feasible to examine the epigenetic changes occurring during development or in response to the environment in these organisms. The goal is to determine, as part of an international collaboration, the epigenetic marks on chromatin at particular genes in different tissues, at different stages of development and in response to biotic and abiotic challenges and to see how they differ, potentially leading to ways of manipulating the expression of these genes. This workshop, to be jointly sponsored by NSF and science funding agencies in the UK and Australia, will bring together approximately 40 scientists, both leading experts and early career, to participate in a forum for discussion of cutting edge research in this area and the setting up of an international Plant Epigenome Consortium. The 'state-of-play' internationally will be reviewed and then the 'nuts and bolts' of setting up a collaboration will be worked out. In addition, early career stage invitees will have the opportunity to visit nniversities and institutes in Australia after the meeting to further these international collaborative goals.</AbstractNarration>
