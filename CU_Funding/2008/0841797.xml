    <AbstractNarration>0841797&lt;br/&gt;Rubin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the PIs request $300K for technician support to cover partial salary for a new hire full-time ICP-MS facility technician. This technician will support a new ICP-MS purchased through GEO/EAR and GEO/OCE funds. The technician will serve several key duties. He/She will obviously have a major roll in keeping the instrument running and well maintained. In addition, the technician will be responsible for student training and integration. Another major responsibility (and a driver for hiring a PhD-level applicant) is in method development. The instrument will be incorporated into a multi-user facility and will be an open-access and work under a cost recharge model. This request is responsive to the solicitation in that the new hire will be partially-funded through the University and after the term of the proposed grant, will be fully funded through UH, recharge and grant support. The PIs have a strong research footprint in NSF-EAR and OCE projects. The new MC-ICP-MS was associated with a EAR-IF grant. General research efforts revolve around U-series, Pb, Nd, and Sr isotope measurement s for volcanology, mantle geochemistry, environmental science and marine research. Applications include U-series measurements to link volcanic conditions to eruption style, development of 231Pa isotope dilution analysis to elucidate biogenic sediment geochronology, U-series measurements to reconstruct Hawaiian and other regional sea level histories and determine munitions contaminant biogeochemistry, and Ra isotope measurements in hydrothermal fluids in order to proxy rock ages and water-rock exchange processes. The new MC-ICP-MS will allow Sr, Nd, Pb and Hf isotope analyses as Earth history proxies - however, much development work is needed to convert existing TIMS methodologies to more sensitive laser ablation and wet-chemical ICP-MS analyses. These isotopes will serve as provenance tracers and be used to elucidate deposits, weathering and paleoclimatology. Adding Os isotopes will help elucidate pelagic carbonate and chert sequences. Additional efforts will involve tracking volcanic and anthropogenic isotopes during basaltic lava volatilization and condensation - Se, Cd, Tl, Te, Zn and Cu isotope fractionation will serve as the analytical proxy. Finally, Mg isotope analysis will be used to better understand oceanic Mg cycling through hydrothermal systems. The new analytical capabilities will allow additional synergies amongst faculty, students and outside users. The new technician will assist in training new users ? thus helping to produce tomorrow?s geoscientists. The facility will support a diverse researcher and student population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
