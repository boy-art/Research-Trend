    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy and water are major constraints to global prosperity and directly pertinent to global climate change. Their interface is of particular relevance to Wyoming as the leading US state in the exportation of energy but having major water limitations. As a model for illustrating principles of complexity and uncertainty in science, the energy-water interface presents a relevant framework to enhance STEM learning outcomes. In addition, like many rural, frontier states, Wyoming faces distinct challenges with respect to STEM awareness, education, and career opportunities. And a significant proportion of the state population can be categorized as at-risk relative to socio-economic status and educational achievement. These challenges will be addressed through a partnership between schools, the University, and the private sector using a diverse portfolio of activities designed to increase learning outcomes of doctoral fellows, 7-10 grade students and teachers, to inform career choice through motivating STEM experiences, and to institutionalize GK12 goals in the graduate education infrastructure of UW. Specific deliverables from this project include: inquiry based curricular units, summer research experiences, diverse workshops, multiple training events, sustained cyberinfrastructure interactions, and global research opportunities. This program will promote the competitive success of the future STEM workforce by providing training in leadership, communication and project management skills for graduate fellows, by enhancing the educational pipeline through motivational awareness units, through sustained professional development of teachers, and by development of new interdisciplinary graduate programs focused on GK12 objectives.</AbstractNarration>
