    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portals of Discovery, a partnership between the University of Wisconsin-Manitowoc and the University of Wisconsin-Stout, engages and retains students in STEM fields through collaborative research. Students move through a pipeline of STEM education from high school to a two year, associate degree-granting institution and then to degree completion at the baccalaureate institution. The goals of the project are to recruit new populations of STEM students, retain STEM students during the crucial early stages of their education, and see those students through to the completion of their baccalaureate degrees. The project includes 1) summer research workshops and research-based curriculum development at the high school level, 2) financial support, peer tutoring, faculty and peer mentoring circles, curriculum development, and participation in undergraduate research at the two year campus, and 3) a 10-week research immersion program for transferring students, continued faculty mentoring, participation in undergraduate research, and student opportunities to serve as peer mentors at the 4-year campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complete integration of research, coursework, and mentorship across institutions ensures that STEM students have a persistent support network throughout their undergraduate career. Research activities develop critical thinking, technical skills, and confidence. Outreach and mentor support networks reach students of diverse demographic backgrounds who otherwise would be unlikely to pursue or persist in STEM education. The model is being developed for expansion across all twenty six UW-System two and four year campuses, resulting in a comprehensive effort to alleviate Wisconsin's need to increase the technology workforce.</AbstractNarration>
