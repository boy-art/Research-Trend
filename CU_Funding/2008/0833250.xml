    <AbstractNarration>Improving Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry Teaching (IMPACT), a Phase II Noyce proposal, is a partnership of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities College of Education and Human Development (CEHD) and the Institute of Technology (Departments of Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics), St. Paul Public Schools and Anoka-Hennepin Public Schools. IMPACT is designed to recruit, prepare, and retain highly qualified teachers of physical science and mathematics. U.S. and Minnesota schools report extreme teacher shortages in these areas and demand is expected to increase in Minnesota with new high school graduation requirements requiring mathematics coursework up to and including algebra II and a full year of physics or chemistry. IMPACT provides scholarships of up to $10,000 for approximately forty undergraduates and graduates seeking certification in mathematics or physical sciences. Recruitment occurs through the PhysTEC program, a new initiative designed to promote physics teaching as a career path for undergraduates. PhysTEC students have opportunities to teach in non-major physics classes as learning assistants and attend physics teaching seminars. Undergraduate IMPACT scholars are enrolled in the CEHD DirecTrack program which offers early coursework in education and school-based field experiences. Preparation occurs through the CEHD M.Ed. Initial Licensure Program. Students enter the 15-month program as a cohort, taking coursework in educational theory, a nine-credit science or mathematics methods sequence, educational technology, and working with English-Language-Learners. Students participate in extensive practicum and student teaching experiences in high-needs partner schools at both middle and high school level. Retention is addressed through the Science and Mathematics Teacher Induction Network (TIN), an online induction program developed in partnership with the Minnesota Department of Education, to provide mentoring and professional development to secondary science and mathematics teachers throughout Minnesota. IMPACT scholars receive on-going professional development and mentoring through TIN. Evaluation studies, which include longitudinal studies of previous cohorts of Noyce Scholars, are focusing on the effectiveness of IMPACT to recruit highly qualified students into the teacher preparation program, effectively prepare students to work in high need schools, and retain and support the professional growth of these teachers in the schools.</AbstractNarration>
