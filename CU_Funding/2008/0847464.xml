    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: &lt;br/&gt;The project is designed to aid in the development of the hydrogen economy and to stimulate public discourse on the topic of on-board vehicular hydrogen storage for fuel cells and electric motors by implementing research and educational outreach activities. The research projects will study important unanswered questions which limit the implementation of hydrogen as a practical and viable fuel source. Specifically, the role of catalysts in metal hydrides will be studied using state-of-the-art instrumentation located at synchrotron x-ray and neutron facilities within the U.S. and abroad. Investigations will surround the questions: ?How do catalysts facilitate the removal and uptake of H2 gas in metal hydride powders (e.g. NaAlH4 or LiBH4)?? and ?Do the same catalysts act to enhance or decrease long range atomic movement in the hydride powders?? Other projects instituted by this funding will include a high school design challenge project to be instituted annually with a team of students. The high school program will be called Project ENERGY (Exploring New Energy-alternatives Relevant to Generation Y) (see projectEnerG.com for updates).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to understand the influence of catalytic additives in enhancing atomic mobility and desorption rates in metal hydrides (specifically, NaAlH4 and LiBH4). The adaptation of sintering models to a new class of materials will be investigated, while incorporating x-ray and neutron scattering studies to understand local lattice changes in these hydrides during desorption. Prior experimental investigations to understand the role of catalysts have been limited to single-experiments such as x-ray absorption spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, or direct imaging to understand the local structure around the catalysts. Alternatively, the proposed project approaches this problem by applying an entire paradigm. In order to build concepts in understanding the role of the transition metals in hydrides, ideas are taken from a well-developed field of study (i.e., ceramic sintering and densification) wherein it is understood how dopants effect diffusion and mass transport. Studies will investigate the effect of transition metal catalytic additives on atomic mobility at various stages of the H2 desorption process. Synchrotron x-ray scattering data aid in understanding the relative roles of mass transport and H2 desorption on microstructure remediation. Concentration and type of point defects formed as a result of catalytic additions will be determined using positron annihilation studies. As well, in situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction, neutron diffuse scattering studies with atomic pair distribution function analysis, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy will enable examination of local lattice strains, lattice amorphization and catalyst local structure upon hydrogen desorption and uptake. The PI has a history of mentoring student researchers at synchrotron x-ray studies ? many from underrepresented groups, through her joint faculty position between Grambling State University, a historically Black university, and Louisiana Tech University. This program will support both undergraduate and graduate students. Educational activities include new courses on synchrotron x-ray studies and alternative energy, and a high school outreach program.</AbstractNarration>
