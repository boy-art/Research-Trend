    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: 0851716&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Anderson, Kimberly W.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three year REU Site program at the University of Kentucky Research Foundation will provide undergraduate students with a multidisciplinary research and education experience in the area of Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices. The students will learn about three cross-disciplinary research themes that form the foundation of research in this area. These include: 1) Novel Bioactive Architectures; 2) Cell/Protein interactions at Interfaces; and 3) Integration into Therapeutic and Diagnostic Devices. The specific objectives of this program include: 1) providing the students with interdisciplinary mentoring and research training; 2) stimulating the students' interests in Ph.D. careers in science and engineering through seminars, field trips, and interactions with both graduate students and faculty; and 3) developing the students' independence and confidence through participation in research, journal clubs, in-house presentations and scientific meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be recruited from various undergraduate disciplines including engineering, biology, chemistry and physics. The PI will make special efforts to attract women and minorities to this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;?This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.?</AbstractNarration>
