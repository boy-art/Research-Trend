    <AbstractNarration>This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor John Arnold at the University of California, Berkeley, to carry out fundamental studies in synthetic chemistry aimed at uncovering new reaction pathways for the important greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. The Arnold group explores the use of nitrous oxide as an oxygen source for catalytic oxidation reactions, with the green house friendly dinitrogen as the only by-product. The first stage of their approach is the development of an understanding of both the nature of nitrous oxide binding to transition metal centers and the mechanism of N-O bond cleavage. The second stage involves development of selective oxygen atom transfer reactions based on the nitrous oxide cleavage product. Oxidation reactions are essential to the chemicals industry, and the fundamental technologies developed in this program could lead to new processes to prepare commodity chemicals using inexpensive feedstocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers trained under this program receive extensive education in cutting-edge synthetic chemistry, learning how to prepare and handle highly sensitive and reactive compounds. They become highly skilled in modern characterization techniques and apply the results of computational studies to further their research. As part of UC Berkeley's strong tradition of outreach, the researchers interact with students in local schools to engage them in questions relating to the environment and energy.</AbstractNarration>
