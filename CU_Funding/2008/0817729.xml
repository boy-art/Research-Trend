    <AbstractNarration>Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of mind and intelligence. Since its birth around 1960, cognitive science has produced an extensive body of principles, representations, and algorithms, as well as many successful applications. This research discipline is advancing rapidly in much of the world, with some surprising exceptions, including China. A workshop will be held in China to report and discuss cognitive science research on topics ranging from cellular circuitry to computational cognition. The workshop has several related aims: (1) promote interchanges within and between countries across multiple sub-disciplines of cognitive science that investigate cognition at different levels and using different tools, (2) disseminate quantitative methods, successes, and the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science, and (3) establish channels for collaborative research and initiate exchange programs for training the next generation of cognitive scientists. This will be the first workshop/conference on cognitive science in China that brings researchers from a broad spectrum of distinct but connected sub-disciplines together to seek cross-disciplinary interactions and collaborations and joint training programs for graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
