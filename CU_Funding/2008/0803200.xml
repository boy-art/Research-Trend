    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education at the interface between quantum many-body physics and quantum information science. A major thrust of the research is to advance the understanding of the relationship between correlations in quantum many-body systems, emergence, and entanglement. Concepts in quantum information theory will be used to investigate how condensed matter systems are entangled. The PI aims to develop measures of entanglement in Kondo impurity and spin systems, as well as systems of itinerant fermions and bosons. The PI will also investigate the connections among entanglement, topological order, and fractional quasiparticles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the research is to provide both qualitative and quantitative measures of entanglement in many-body quantum systems and to discuss its feasible control in cold atomic systems and in nanostructures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports training students in advanced theoretical methods and involving undergraduates in research at the frontiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education that will elucidate connections among two rapidly evolving areas: one concerned with how to use quantum mechanical states for computation, and the other concerned with understanding quantum mechanical systems with many interacting particles, like the electrons that conduct electricity in a metal. Quantum mechanical systems of interacting electrons can exhibit emergent phenomena, including new states of matter. Notable among these are magnetism and superconductivity in which a material is able to conduct electricity without losses. The research enables a cross-fertilization of ideas that are developed in two contexts, quantum computation and condensed matter theory, and may lead to advances in both areas. This research is fundamental and contributes to the intellectual foundations of new technologies for electronic devices, information technology, and communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports training students in advanced theoretical methods and involving undergraduates in research at the frontiers.</AbstractNarration>
