    <AbstractNarration>Trapping and cooling of atoms in the gas phase has been a major area of research for many years, dominated by the method of laser cooling. Although very successful, laser cooling has been limited to a small set of atoms in the periodic table. In a recent breakthrough, a general two-step approach to trapping and cooling was developed. These new methods will be further optimized, and applied towards trapping and cooling of atomic hydrogen and deuterium in a simple room temperature apparatus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of general methods for trapping and cooling of almost any atom in the periodic table will open new directions in physics. In particular, trapping and cooling of hydrogenic atoms will enable in the future more precise spectroscopy, important for atomic and nuclear physics. The same methods can be applied to cooling of anti-hydrogen, enabling a more precise test of fundamental symmetries. This work will enable in the future precision measurement of beta decay of trapped ultracold atomic tritium, relevant to the question of neutrino mass. The broader impact on education and diversity is training and support of two graduate students from underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
