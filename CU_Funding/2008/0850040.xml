    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this project are to improve the attraction, recruitment, retention, professional preparation, and graduation of economically disadvantaged science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students. The methods are threefold: aggressively recruit students from two local school systems in the metropolitan area of Indianapolis; offer personalized support of those STEM students financially, academically, and socially; and provide exclusive programs for their scientific professional development through on-campus research and off-campus internships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first cohort of five students is funded for their four years by the scholarship program. Butler University intends to fund the scholarships for the last fifteen students at the annual amount beyond the duration of the granting period. Scholarship recipients have a support network in place to insure their academic success. This support includes a community of specially trained academic advisors/mentors, orientation and special programs for scholarship recipients, targeted assistance from student support services, peer mentors, and a common housing unit for scholarship recipients. The scholarship recipients have opportunities for development as professional scientists through on-campus research as well as a STEM internship with a local industrial or government partner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The scholarship recipients gain a liberal arts education reinforced by scientific rigor so that they are prepared for graduate study or direct entry into the work force. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The project affects two communities: the community of students in Indianapolis from which participants eligible for these scholarships are drawn and the local scientific industry that stands to benefit from a scientifically trained workforce. Scholarship recipients graduate possessing the technical knowledge of their science major and have experience with the local STEM industry to help advance the objectives.</AbstractNarration>
