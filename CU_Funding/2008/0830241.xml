    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project builds and develops information assurance education capacity. Critical to the success of this partnership is extensive classroom teaching by the PI and the co-PIs at the partner university as well as a hands-on personal mentoring of potential and awarded SFS students at both schools. This project consists of four distinct objectives: (1) Increasing the number and improve the skills of information assurance (IA) faculty at both schools through professional development and team-taught courses at the partner university campuses; (2) developing a multi-disciplinary information assurance educational program with the ultimate goal of qualifying the non-CAEIAE university as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance NSA (CAEIAE); (3) providing quality IA education to Scholarship for Service students; and (4) facilitating joint faculty development activities via joint workshops, joint publication and conference attendance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key elements of this proposal are extensive personal contact between the faculty and students at both schools, and team teaching and joint publication efforts between the universities. This proposal is all about developing and expanding information assurance capacity at both schools.</AbstractNarration>
