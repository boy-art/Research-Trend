    <AbstractNarration>Fatkullin&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807332&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies free energy functionals associated&lt;br/&gt;with liquid-crystalline systems and gradient flow evolutions (and&lt;br/&gt;more general dynamics) associated with these functionals. The&lt;br/&gt;study of critical points of the free energy functionals provides&lt;br/&gt;information about the equilibrium states of the corresponding&lt;br/&gt;systems, whereas the gradient flows provide insights into the&lt;br/&gt;out-of-equilibrium phenomena. In particular, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;applies the methods recently developed for the Onsager model of&lt;br/&gt;spatially homogeneous nematic liquid crystals to a more general&lt;br/&gt;setting. Employing a novel approach based on the combination of&lt;br/&gt;Oseen-Frank, Landau-de Gennes, and Onsager's theories, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator obtains an analytically tractable theory explaining&lt;br/&gt;the spatial variations of orientational ordering. Further on,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator exploits the fact that a particular case of&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional nematics is closely related to complex&lt;br/&gt;Ginzburg-Landau-type models and the problem of harmonic mapping&lt;br/&gt;of a domain into a unit circle. This connection allows him to&lt;br/&gt;establish rigorous asymptotics for various patterns (twisters,&lt;br/&gt;vortices, domain walls, etc.,) arising in this particular setting&lt;br/&gt;using the tools from Ginzburg-Landau theory. The dynamical part&lt;br/&gt;of this project concentrates on the extent to which the kinetic&lt;br/&gt;equations for evolution of orientation probability densities and&lt;br/&gt;correlation functions (described via gradient flows in&lt;br/&gt;Wasserstein spaces of probability measures or more general&lt;br/&gt;mass-transportation dynamics) are reducible to the commonly used&lt;br/&gt;Ginsburg-Landau-type dynamics of the order parameters. A&lt;br/&gt;systematic analysis of such reductions is requisite for a&lt;br/&gt;complete understanding of dynamics of liquid-crystalline systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Liquid crystals are substances that share characteristics&lt;br/&gt;with conventional liquids and crystalline solids. Such an exotic&lt;br/&gt;combination of material properties allows for a high degree of&lt;br/&gt;dynamic control, which in turn allows for a wide range of useful&lt;br/&gt;applications. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) technology is,&lt;br/&gt;undoubtedly, the prime example. Modern applications employ the&lt;br/&gt;fact that optical properties of liquid crystals change under&lt;br/&gt;external influences such as applied electric or magnetic fields,&lt;br/&gt;stresses, etc. By manipulating the latter in an appropriate&lt;br/&gt;manner one can achieve the desired effects. The theory of liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals has been developing since the middle of twentieth&lt;br/&gt;century. Its success has been recognized by a Nobel Prize&lt;br/&gt;awarded in 1991 to P.-G. de Gennes for fundamental contributions&lt;br/&gt;to our understanding of order phenomena in complex systems. &lt;br/&gt;Still, due to enormous growth in applicability of liquid crystals&lt;br/&gt;and rapid development of the associated technologies, it has&lt;br/&gt;become even more important to go beyond the general principles&lt;br/&gt;and to further expand our understanding. Although computer&lt;br/&gt;simulations provide valuable insights, for precise control over&lt;br/&gt;liquid-crystalline materials it is essential to support the&lt;br/&gt;experimental findings and computer simulations with a rigorous&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory. Development of such a theory is the primary&lt;br/&gt;goal of the investigator's work. His particular interest is&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis of patterns, their formation and evolution,&lt;br/&gt;and dynamics of phase transitions in liquid crystals.</AbstractNarration>
