    <AbstractNarration>The MVZ Genetic Resources Collection currently is maintained in electrically powered ultra-cold freezers, but will be transitioned in this project to liquid nitrogen freezers. Liquid nitrogen freezers are superior to ultra-cold freezers in several respects, including (1) lack of dependence on electricity to maintain temperature (a critical safeguard should there be an extended loss of electricity following an earthquake on the nearby Hayward Fault), and (2) samples are maintained at -150 degrees C (eliminating tissue degradation that persists at -80 C ultra-cold temperatures). The entire collection (encompassing ~100,000 tissue vials) also will be inventoried and bar-coded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genetic resources collection is among the largest tissue collections in the world, with worldwide geographical coverage. It is a resource for researchers throughout the world who undertake genetic studies of vertebrate species, and includes samples representing extinct species, as well as populations extirpated by anthropogenic habitat modification and infectious disease. This project will substantially reduce the energy usage and carbon footprint of the Berkeley campus. The UC Berkeley Office of Sustainability, the Campus Climate Action Partnership (Cal CAP), and the Strategic Energy Plan will showcase it as an example of how careful management of energy emissions can be undertaken without compromising academic research.</AbstractNarration>
