    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop next-generation ultra-low-cost phased arrays for various applications including radar, broadcasting, cellular communications, satellite communications, and weather forecasting. The approach is to investigate an innovative concept termed electronically steerable passive array radiator (ESPAR) and develop BST varactors on organic substrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the design of low-cost, simple yet efficient phased array systems. The proposed novel BST varactor integration technique will have a broad impact on a variety of applications which require high-density integrated capacitors and varactors. Conformal designs of the proposed ESPAR phased arrays help increase the function and reduce the power consumption of wireless sensor nodes, with a significantly reduced cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research will enable next-generation ultra-low-cost phased arrays to be affordable in a variety of applications. One important application that can take advantage of this technology is automotive collision avoidance radar or adaptive cruise control technology. Another application is in the rear seat entertainment and mobile high-speed internet access. The ultra-low-cost phased arrays also help the much wider deployment of inexpensive high-performance phased arrays for homeland security to increase the communication success rate and save lives of personnel. Biomedical and wireless sensor applications will also benefit from the ultra-low-cost ESPAR phased arrays. The education plan includes a revitalization of existing electromagnetics and microwave engineering curriculum, integration of research and education, supervision of undergraduate research, outreach for K-12 and underrepresented groups, and university-industry collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
