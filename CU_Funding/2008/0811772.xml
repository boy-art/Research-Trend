    <AbstractNarration>Very precise measurements of ground motion are being used to study the distribution and magnitude of slow creep along faults of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) system. Measuring and modelling fault creep is improving our understanding of both earthquake hazard and earthquake physics. Much of the creep signal is close to the fault and therefore, best observed by a space-based technique called Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) because of its complete 50-m spatial resolution. The new aspect of this research is the use of L-band InSAR data from the recently launched ALOS spacecraft (JAXA). L-band interferogram remain coherent over longer time intervals than the previously available C-band interferograms. These new data are especially important in central and northern California where C-band permanent scattering methods are only partially successful in measuring slow crustal deformation. &lt;br/&gt;The three-year investigation includes the following tasks: (1) Participate in the Western North America InSAR consortium (WInSAR) to assemble the data needed for this investigation as well as to prepare for future seismic events in California. (2) Analyze InSAR data from ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, and ALOS to recover slow inter-seismic creep signals along the SAF system. The investigators are refining methods for stacking ERS and ENVISAT interferograms, as well developing new software for the analysis of L-band ALOS data. (3) Use the measurements of fault creep to improve our understanding of physical models for fault friction at shallow depth. In particular the analysis is revealing the relationship between creep rate, shallow stress accumulation rate, and major earthquake recurrence intervals.&lt;br/&gt;These proposed research activities are contributing to the objectives of NSF?s EarthScope Initiative by providing insight into fault mechanics and earthquake hazard. Funding will primarily be used to support graduate student research and training. This research has significant international collaboration with scientists at the Japanese and European Space Agencies. The researchers are also collaborating with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) Visualization Center in cataloging and distributing images, animations, and 3-D visualizations. Educational activities include development of graduate and undergraduate courses at UCSD and presentations to local school groups on earthquake topics.</AbstractNarration>
