    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Chemistry at Carnegie-Mellon University will acquire a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument, an isothermal titration calorimeter and a differential scanning calorimeter with this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. These instruments will be used to address questions in fundamental biology, biotechnology and nanotechnology, unified by the theme of molecular recognition and bonding based on noncovalent interactions. Some of the projects to be investigated include developing new compounds that bind to specific sequences of DNA and RNA with high affinity; how enzyme dynamics and function are coupled with thermodynamics in the context of glutathione S-transferases, an important class of detoxification enzymes; developing fluorescent biosensors that rely on RNA and protein recognition elements that bind to specific targets and fluorogenic indicator dyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These instruments are used to study how molecules, especially biologically important ones, bind to one another. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) allows both kinetic and equilibrium constants to be determined at low nanomolar concentrations where biological activity is most desirable. Isothermal titration and differential scanning calorimetry provide detailed insight into the thermodynamics of these noncovalent interactions. These instruments will be used by graduate and undergraduate students in their research and in laboratory courses. They will receive sophisticated training using modern instruments basic to understanding biochemical systems.</AbstractNarration>
