    <AbstractNarration>The National Plant Genome Initiative (NPGI) was established in 1998 as a coordinated national plant genome research program by the Interagency Working Group on Plant Genomes (IWG-PG). In the 10 years since the program started, the field of plant genomics has made tremendous progress, changing the way that plant research is conducted, attracting a new generation of scientists to the field and contributing a wealth of new information and knowledge with potential application to agriculture. The purpose of this workshop is to discuss the status of plant genome research in the U.S. after 10 years of the NPGI and to consider the challenges and opportunities for the next decade. The workshop will bring together stakeholders with broad range of expertise in high-throughput genomics, plant biology, bioinformatics and databases drawn from the academic, private and international sectors. Workshop outcomes will be captured in the form of a paper to be developed by the workshop participants and circulated to the broader community. The paper will be accessible through http://pbio.salk.edu/pbioe/ and TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org).</AbstractNarration>
