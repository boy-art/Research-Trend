    <AbstractNarration>This research project (GEOPOD) focuses on the development of a software module that implements an interactive, intuitive interface - the "GEOpod", that allows users to probe a 3D immersion world of authentic geophysical data, actuate virtual devices to collect data and record observations, while guided by instructional design strategies that are customized for undergraduate learners. Because the data will consist of real observations and imagery, and simulated data from numerical models based on actual physics, the exploration environment naturally exhibits technical accuracy, scientific soundness, physical consistency, authenticity, and high fidelity; attributes that are otherwise enormously challenging and costly for synthetic simulations targeted for education. GEOpod will enable a user to pilot a vessel to simultaneously probe, the eye of a hurricane for example, and experience points of interest while immersed in an authentic storm simulation. The software module will extend Unidata's Integrated Data Viewer (IDV), and utilize its collaborative utility to allow simultaneous users to engage in group learning activities and share information in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed project include the delivery of a free, open-source IDV extension; development of learning modules with instructional strategies informed and improved by assessment rubrics, critical external evaluation, and experts in instructional technology; and engagement of students and university educators from the geosciences and computer science communities. GEOPOD?s Web-accessible, Java-based software will operate across operating systems. NSF investments in Unidata and Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD) will be heavily leveraged. Finally, the products of this effort will be widely disseminated through conferences on geosciences technology and education, graphics, and virtual reality; Unidata's established community portal and workshops; and national scientific venues such as the American Meteorological Society, American Geophysical Union, and the Association for Computing Machinery. It is estimated that GEOPOD has the potential to enrich the learning environment for 20,000 undergraduates in the nearly 200 higher education institutions in the U.S. and other countries through course integrations for geosciences majors and large-enrollment introductory courses for non-majors.</AbstractNarration>
