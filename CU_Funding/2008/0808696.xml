    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the University of Cincinnati (UC) entitled, Sustainable Engineering for Urban Needs: Research Experiences for Middle and High School Teachers", under the direction of Dr. Anant Kukreti. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site is a renewal of a successful RET Site program hosted by the UC College of Engineering which annually supports, 12 in-service and 6 pre-service middle and high school math and science teachers from Cincinnati public schools, who will participate in a six-week summer research program and academic year follow-on activities. The primary goals of this RET site are three fold: (1) To educate, cultivate, and enrich experiences for science and math teachers by exploring the scientific methods of inquiry and the critical research skills used by engineers to solve open-ended real-world problems. (2) The participating teachers will become role models by applying their research experiences in their classrooms with colleagues. (3) The teachers' new skills will enable their students to directly link their education to current events and the needs of their community and encourage them to become effective citizens in a technology-driven society.</AbstractNarration>
