    <AbstractNarration>0826105/0825617&lt;br/&gt;Montanez/Isbell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) will support Isabel P. Montanez of the University of California ? Davis and John L. Isbell of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in a research collaboration with Carlos Oscar Limarino and Sergio Marenssi of Buenos Aires University in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The researchers intend to facilitate the integrated research and educational training of geoscience students in deep-time paleoclimatology in western South America. This research will produce the first geo-chronologically (U-Pb) calibrated, high-resolution data sets for the high latitudes of western Gondwana.Gondwana was the southern continent that existed 500 to 200 millions years ago and included most of today?s South America. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborators will bring complementary skills to the project with a program that includes various components: (a) an integrated stratigraphic, sedimentologic, paleontologic, and geochemical study in western Argentina, (b) research training for undergraduate and graduate students prior to and after the field study, and (c) mentoring activities to promote career-building. The IRES will train 4 U.S. graduate and up to 9 undergraduate students in student-faculty team based projects. The PIs will integrate traditionally underrepresented students into the program through their current NSF-funded ?Geodiversity initiatives.? Results will be disseminated through public presentations, research publications, and educational materials for undergraduates and high school students.</AbstractNarration>
