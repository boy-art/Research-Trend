    <AbstractNarration>0853692&lt;br/&gt;Petty &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigate how small silver clusters interact with DNA. The overall goal is to control the fluorescence spectra of these strongly emitting metal species by altering the DNA sequence. These chromophores are innovative in several respects. First, chromophores with different emission spectra are straightforward and inexpensive to prepare because the nucleobases control cluster formation. Second, the DNA-clusters complexes are biocompatible due to their encapsulation by DNA and due to their small size. Third, the clusters have favorable spectroscopic properties for imaging in biological environments. The expertise of Professor Dickson in the areas of high-sensitivity spectroscopy and DNA arrays will be critical for identifying the optimal sequences via high-throughput parallel screening of a comprehensive range of sequences. Professor Petty's background in DNA thermodynamics and structure will be the basis of the further scrutiny of the effect of reaction conditions on the formation and spectra of the clusters. The fluorescence photophysical parameters of the silver-DNA conjugates will show how both the base sequence and the solution environment influence the DNA-silver cluster adducts. This project will develop undergraduate and graduate students by conducting novel research related to biophotonics. The established and productive collaboration between the undergraduate program at Furman and the graduate program at Georgia Tech will provide multiple opportunities for learning and teaching. The students will learn to organize and disseminate the outcomes of their research activities through presentations at professional meetings and through publication in the primary literature. A wider impact will be in the classroom, as the new instruments and experiments will be integrated into the physical chemistry and nanoscience laboratories. A postdoctoral associate will be mentored for a future faculty career at an undergraduate-focused institution.</AbstractNarration>
