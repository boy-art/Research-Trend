    <AbstractNarration>This award will support an international conference entitled&lt;br/&gt; "New directions in Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization". &lt;br/&gt;The central theme of this conference will be combinatorics and its applications &lt;br/&gt;in theoretical computer science and operations research. The conference will take &lt;br/&gt;place in May 2008 on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in midtown &lt;br/&gt;Atlanta, and will honor the 65th birthday of William T. Trotter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main reasons for holding the conference in Atlanta, namely direct &lt;br/&gt;flights from most of the world's major airports, and the presence of the PhD program &lt;br/&gt;in Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization (ACO) at Georgia Tech, with its more &lt;br/&gt;than 45 affiliated faculty and 40 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference program will consist of approximately 30 invited lectures, a poster &lt;br/&gt;session and a problem session. The conference is expected to attract 200-300 &lt;br/&gt;attendees, including local, regional, national and international delegates. A &lt;br/&gt;conference proceedings will be published as a special issue of the journal &lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics, Probability and Computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The list of invited speakers includes only the leading experts and fine expositors. &lt;br/&gt;The organizing committee consists of experienced senior researchers who will uphold &lt;br/&gt;very high standards. Georgia Tech has excellent facilities to accommodate a &lt;br/&gt;conference of this type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using federal support the organizers will be able to offer financial assistance to &lt;br/&gt;attendees with no outside funding, including students, postdoctoral associates, junior &lt;br/&gt;faculty, women, and underrepresented minorities, with priority given to young people &lt;br/&gt;and members of underrepresented groups. While the main lectures will be by invitation &lt;br/&gt;only, junior scientists will be able to present in the poster session and participate &lt;br/&gt;in the scientific discussions throughout the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A further aspect of broader impact is the interplay of mathematics, computer science &lt;br/&gt;and operations research, that is already present in the ACO program at Georgia Tech. &lt;br/&gt;This conference will further promote the fruitful interactions of these disciplines, &lt;br/&gt;drawing upon the successful experience at Georgia Tech, and in doing so will further &lt;br/&gt;strengthen the ACO program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference proceedings will be stringently refereed subject to the standards of &lt;br/&gt;premier combinatorics journals. Thus the conference will have lasting impact not limited &lt;br/&gt;to its attendees.</AbstractNarration>
