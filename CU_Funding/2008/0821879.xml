    <AbstractNarration>The research and education community faces a pressing need for effective and efficient strategies for securing its IT infrastructure. This requirement is particularly important in large, federally sponsored research facilities that operate very substantial, interconnected networks of diverse resources including computers, information stores, and special instrumentation. For this reason, the National Science Foundation and its partner agencies are hosting a forum to bring together stakeholders to establish and maintain collaborative efforts to advance cybersecurity among the university and government research community. Along with leading experts in cybersecurity, the attendees will work to identify major threats, strategies, and solutions for a class of very difficult problems of technology, policy, and practice that increasingly threaten the successful operations of large facilities in support of distributed scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
