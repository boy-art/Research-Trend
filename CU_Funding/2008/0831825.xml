    <AbstractNarration>Mobility is central to various applications, from the classical&lt;br/&gt;problems of searching for a moving target and rescue mission in&lt;br/&gt;military and disaster settings, to deploying mobile ad-hoc/sensor&lt;br/&gt;networks for surveillance and data communication over hostile&lt;br/&gt;terrain and underwater. While the random mobility pattern of nodes in&lt;br/&gt;these networks has been considered as the main source of uncertainty and&lt;br/&gt;disruption of communication links, it can also facilitate reliable and&lt;br/&gt;predictable performance, if properly controlled and actively exploited.&lt;br/&gt;Most existing approaches have taken advantage of nodes' mobility only as&lt;br/&gt;passive vehicles for data forwarding upon contact by chance, with an&lt;br/&gt;over-simplifying assumption that every pair of nodes is making contacts&lt;br/&gt;with each other according to a Poisson process, which is recently&lt;br/&gt;contradicted by empirically observed non-Poisson nature with high degree&lt;br/&gt;of heterogeneity in various mobile networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this research is to develop a unified methodology&lt;br/&gt;for efficient protocol design and control of nodes in heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;mobile ad-hoc networks and delay/disruption-tolerant networks under&lt;br/&gt;non-Poisson contacts. The goal further extends to the use of mobile&lt;br/&gt;nodes with controllable mobility that can autonomously exploit the&lt;br/&gt;changing diversity. The broader impact of this research lies in its&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary nature in addressing the analysis and design of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms running on mobility with heterogeneous non-Poisson contacts,&lt;br/&gt;which is also central to other scientific areas such as epidemiology,&lt;br/&gt;foraging ecology and biology, all driven by contacts among living&lt;br/&gt;organisms. This tight relationship between mobile ad-hoc networks&lt;br/&gt;and various phenomena in nature will serve as a vivid example for&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students at a freshmen level or even to general public.</AbstractNarration>
