    <AbstractNarration>The study of bijections between combinatorial objects&lt;br/&gt;has always remained an attractive part of Enumerative&lt;br/&gt;and Algebraic Combinatorics. Despite their wide&lt;br/&gt;applicability, their remains a complete lack of formal&lt;br/&gt;understanding as to which bijections are equivalent,&lt;br/&gt;and which one are "good" in a sense that they preserve&lt;br/&gt;the natural structure of the combinatorial objects.&lt;br/&gt;We initiate the study of asymptotic properties of&lt;br/&gt;partition bijections and claim that a large class of&lt;br/&gt;well known bijections are in fact "asymptotically stable".&lt;br/&gt;Using CS-style reduction ideas we propose the first&lt;br/&gt;formal way to formulate that all classical Young tableau&lt;br/&gt;bijections are in fact linear tie equivalent. Other&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial objects and several new directions&lt;br/&gt;are also discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the early days of mathematics, combinatorial objects&lt;br/&gt;have played an important role. These objects, which&lt;br/&gt;include various sets of graphs, trees, partitions of&lt;br/&gt;integers, tilings of regions with smaller shapes, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Finding or estimating the number of such objects is a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problem which has been resolved in some&lt;br/&gt;instances and remains open in many other case. Sometimes&lt;br/&gt;one is able to relate the number of such objects to the&lt;br/&gt;number of other objects by means of a direct combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;argument (a bijection). We propose an in-depth study of&lt;br/&gt;the nature of these bijection, as to whether (and how)&lt;br/&gt;they reveal not just the number, but structural results&lt;br/&gt;on these combinatorial objects.</AbstractNarration>
