    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is the discovery, investigation, and application of low loss, high dielectric constant artificial electromagnetic materials at high frequencies. Of particular interest are materials that can be printed with low temperature methods enabling their direct integration into a wide range of electromagnetic devices. The approach is based on a comprehensive plan of theory, simulation, fabrication and measurement of these materials to prove their properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The main focus of this research is on multi-scale artificial dielectric materials. Potentially transformative properties of this new class of materials for RF/microwave circuits are obtained through simultaneous incorporation of multiple dielectric enhancement effects on different length scales resulting in a very large effective dielectric constant with small loss tangent. The key attributes of these multi-scale artificial dielectrics that distinguish them from others are low loss and printability. Using these properties and their spatial tailorability, the new artificial materials will be applied to (1) planar antenna miniaturization and gain enhancement, and (2) microwave filter performance enhancement and miniaturization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: It is anticipated that this new technology will have broad engineering application with special benefit to society. Wide utilization of this technology is foreseen in industrial and academic labs that can benefit from such artificial materials but have been prevented by complexities in designing, manufacturing, and integrating these materials into their devices and subsystems. The research will include both graduate and undergraduate student participation. The research findings will be integrated into two graduate courses and parts disseminated via the internet.</AbstractNarration>
