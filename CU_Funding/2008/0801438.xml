    <AbstractNarration>Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems&lt;br/&gt;SUNY at Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt;Yuanyuan Yang&lt;br/&gt;A Framework for Mobile Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor-Actuator Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop an integrated data gathering mechanism that utilizes new physical layer techniques and a non-conventional energy model for data gathering in wireless sensor-actuator networks. The project combines protocol and algorithm design with test bed implementation and evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research addresses several closely coupled issues in data gathering in wireless sensor-actuator networks. First, the research considers how to plan the moving path of a mobile actuator based on the distribution of sensors and load balancing among sensors to prolong network lifetime. Second, the research considers how to utilize special properties of sensor node batteries to improve energy-efficiency. Third, the research considers how the new physical layer techniques, in particular multiple packet transmission, can be applied to improve data throughput and reduce energy consumption in sensor-actuator networks. The project seeks to develop novel cross-layer algorithms that have the potential to greatly increase data throughput and network lifetime. A wireless sensor test bed is used to further validate feasibility and performance of the algorithms that are developed. The research hopes to impact fundamental design principles and infrastructure considerations for future sensor-actuator networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The outcome of this research has the potential to be applicable to a wide spectrum of applications, including environmental, military, space, health care, home and other commercial areas. A project goal is to promote the participation of female engineering students. The test bed developed as part of the project is an important facility for related projects. The important findings of this project are to be disseminated to the research community via conference and journal publications, a web site, and industry-university partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
