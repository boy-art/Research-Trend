    <AbstractNarration>For many vertebrate animals, the capacity to learn certain skills is greatly enhanced during a time in juvenile life referred to as a sensitive period. What happens to the juvenile brain as the young animal learns a new skill? Conversely, what properties of the juvenile's brain favor learning? This project seeks answers to these questions. The goal of this project is to use a high resolution, laser-powered microscope to visualize individual nerve cells in the brain of a living songbird. The nerve cells to be imaged play an important role in singing, a vocal behavior that resembles human speech in that both are products of imitative learning. By re-imaging the same nerve cell over hours, days and even weeks, and precisely monitoring the vocal learning process, the investigator will examine whether vocal learning involves structural changes at the connections, or synapses, linking together these nerve cells. The investigator predicts that synapses will be less stable at the onset of the sensitive period but that they will rapidly stabilize as the bird begins to imitate the song of another bird. The significance of this project is three-fold. First, it can assess whether enhanced structural plasticity characterizes sensitive periods for learning. Second, it can identify the structural changes that occur during the learning of a complex vocal behavior. Third, it will train young scientists in cutting edge experimental methods at the high school, doctoral and postdoctoral level.</AbstractNarration>
