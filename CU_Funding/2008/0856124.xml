    <AbstractNarration>In the study of local rings of equicharacteristic p, the tight closure&lt;br/&gt;has proved very useful. This closure also extends nicely to local rings&lt;br/&gt;of equicharacteristic zero. Unfortunately this closure does not&lt;br/&gt;naturally extend to mixed characteristic rings. This project is designed&lt;br/&gt;to fill this void. In earlier work, the principal investigator defined&lt;br/&gt;several variants of an extended plus closure. As the name suggests,&lt;br/&gt;these closures, which coincide with tight closure in equicharacteristic&lt;br/&gt;p, are based upon the plus closure of an ideal, the set of elements&lt;br/&gt;which are in the extension of the ideal in some integral extension of&lt;br/&gt;the original ring. In the earlier work, a number of properties of these&lt;br/&gt;closures were demonstrated. Most notably, the principal investigator has&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated that the colon-capturing property implies that ideals in&lt;br/&gt;regular rings are closed and also that the colon-capturing property does&lt;br/&gt;in fact hold in dimension three. Hence the Direct Summand Conjecture is&lt;br/&gt;a theorem in dimension three. A key objective of the current project is&lt;br/&gt;to extend these results to dimension four and above. A completely&lt;br/&gt;successful program would establish that one of these extended plus&lt;br/&gt;closures - or a close relative - satisfies all of the requirements&lt;br/&gt;suggested by Huneke for a mixed characteristic analog of tight closure.&lt;br/&gt;It would also determine whether or not three particular rings of&lt;br/&gt;interest are Cohen-Macaulay. The most compelling of the three is the&lt;br/&gt;absolute integral closure of a complete mixed characteristic local&lt;br/&gt;domain of dimension three. For equicharacteristic complete local domains&lt;br/&gt;and all complete local domains of dimension not equal to three, the&lt;br/&gt;answer is already known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most fundamental subjects in algebra is the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the concepts of ideals and modules in local rings. For those local&lt;br/&gt;rings which contain a field, the notion of tight closure has evolved as&lt;br/&gt;a way to give a unified presentation - and a simplified one - for many&lt;br/&gt;of the known properties of these objects. As a natural byproduct, it has&lt;br/&gt;led to the discovery of new properties. Understanding of local rings&lt;br/&gt;which do not contain a field has always lagged behind. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator has proposed several closely related and promising&lt;br/&gt;candidates to play the role of tight closure in the alternate setting.&lt;br/&gt;These candidates have already led to one significant new result. In this&lt;br/&gt;project, the investigator will continue his efforts to determine which&lt;br/&gt;is the best candidate and to what extent the new closures fill the void.</AbstractNarration>
