    <AbstractNarration>The University of Connecticut?s preserved plant collection is a valuable resource of scientific information, particularly for the Northeastern United States. Through this project, information on the more than 175,000 plant records will be made available to researchers, educators and students using an electronic database to provide written information and high-quality, digital images for each plant specimen, which then will be made available worldwide to anyone with internet access. By compiling historic and contemporary plant records, this project will allow for unprecedented studies of topics ranging from global climate change to urban plant geography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Graduate and undergraduate students will work on the project, gaining experience in database management, specimen-handling procedures and other elements of plant biology research. The database will be linked to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, which is a worldwide data-sharing initiative designed to widely disseminate scientific knowledge. The easy access to specimen information will facilitate research by state agencies, conservation organizations and academic scientists who study such issues as endangered species, economically important species, and weedy, invasive species. The database also will be used to develop lesson plans for Connecticut?s K-12 science curriculum, providing hands-on experience in scientific research, particularly to underrepresented students in the state?s urban areas.</AbstractNarration>
