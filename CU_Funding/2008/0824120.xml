    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop a framework for anytime, anywhere collaborative virtual observation of events occurring in dynamic environments. The approach is to enhance recently developed virtual observation concepts by adapting software service composition mechanisms developed for pervasive computing systems. The observations, made at different points in time and space, are stitched together based on location, query, device, and other variables. Protocols for soft-real time delivery of data packets in heterogeneous networks comprising a combination of continuous and disruption tolerant communication channels are being developed. Middleware tools are being created to perform reactive and proactive query processing, matching, and synthesis of integrative panoramic views.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in the launching of the virtual observers, in retrospect, in soft real-time, on any device in a mobile environment and the concatenation of successive virtual observers to create virtual tours. Development of an integrated framework for video acquisition, stream processing, video synthesis, opportunistic networking, and integrated pervasive services in dynamic and heterogeneous environments are contributions of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, the research has the potential to provide new insights in the areas of video surveillance and security of public places. In general, outcomes of this project have broad applicability in such areas as science manufacturing, education, homeland defense, and entertainment. International collaboration with the Curtin University enables graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, to interact with students and researchers in Australia, thus broadening their knowledge and skills.</AbstractNarration>
