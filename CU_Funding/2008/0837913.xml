    <AbstractNarration>This work aims to improve understanding of how chemical complexity within the organic fraction of aerosols can directly influence the interaction of particles with light. A cavity ring-down aerosol extinction spectrometer and a photoacoustic spectrometer will be developed and used in the project. The extent to which heterogeneous processing of primary organic aerosol by hydroxyl (OH) radicals modulates the aerosol optical properties will be investigated, with an eye toward the role played by chemical composition and variability. Aerosols play a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate as well as providing surfaces for heterogeneous chemical reactions in the atmosphere. The direct effect of aerosols on climate is determined by their ability to scatter or absorb light, which depends critically on both their size and chemical composition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project will be directly transferable to climate models by providing much needed new information on the optical properties of organic aerosol. Other broader impacts of this project will include the training of female graduate students and the participation of undergraduates in research. In addition, this project involves collaboration with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and will bring University of California, Davis students into contact with researchers at a non-academic institution.</AbstractNarration>
