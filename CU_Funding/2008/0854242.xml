    <AbstractNarration>0854242&lt;br/&gt;Agah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the 1950s, gas chromatography (GC) has been a common approach for analysis of volatile mixtures. The use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology for GC development (ìGC) is a promising approach for developing micro-instruments having lower cost, smaller size, lower power consumption, faster analysis, and greatly increased portability for in-field use compared to their conventional counterparts. These instruments have applications in homeland security, industrial process control, bio-monitoring, and in improving environment quality. Due to the low concentration of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOC) in ìGCs, a preconcentration step prior to real-time chemical sensor measurement is needed. The ideal preconcentrator would automatically sample the ambient gas and improve the measurement sensitivity by 10-1000 fold while having low power consumption. We will address this challenge by combining and bridging the gap between top-down miniaturized processing (MEMs) and bottom-up self-assembly approaches (nanotechnology). The objective of this work is to employ MEMS technology to develop VOC preconcentrator chips with integrated thermal desorption capability and high surface-to-volume-ratio and to utilize nanotechnology to coat them with nano-structured adsorbents. Four specific goals are proposed: 1) fabricate low-mass (low-power) preconcentrators with on-chip heaters and temperature sensors using high-aspect-ratio silicon etching techniques and a silicon-on-glass wafer process, 2) deposit ionic self-assembled multilayers (ISAM) or alkane functionalized gold nanoparticles on all surfaces of the MEMS-based preconcentrators with nanometer resolutions, 3) coat MEMS preconcentrators with conventional adsorbents such as OV-1 and Tenax and evaluate their performance against those coated with nano-structured materials in terms of desorption width, breakthrough volume, and temperature profile as well as develop new models to predict the behavior of such preconcentrators, and 4) characterize the performance of ìPCs and their corresponding adsorbents for monitoring bioanalytes present in breath and compare the performance of the microchips with conventional industry-standard preconcentrators through collaboration with Convergent Engineering Inc. (CE). We expect to demonstrate the concentration and desorption of n-alkanes (C5-C16) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons as well as breath analytes that vary in ring-size by achieving a concentration factor of &gt;200, desorption widths &lt;0.2s, and power consumptions &lt;1W at 50°C/sec temperature ramps. The ability to self-assemble both polar and non-polar adsorbent materials will enable us to have selective concentration of analytes in a wide range of applications, namely environmental monitoring, homeland security, and biomedicine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this project will set an outstanding example of how MEMS and Nanotechnology can become highly complementary methodologies for developing low-cost, low-power, high-performance devices that impact industries across the globe, considering that the worldwide market for GC instruments is estimated to be around $1 billion annually. This research will also advance discovery while promoting teaching and learning at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. This includes: 1) development of gas chromatographic demonstrations using the MEMS-based preconcentrators with nano-structured adsorbents for Virginia Tech?s Society of Physics Students outreach programs to rural, southwestern Virginia high school students, 2) research opportunities for undergraduates at Virginia Tech (VT) and the College of William and Mary (W&amp;M), 3) recruiting of graduate students from under-represented groups into a highly interdisciplinary research program, and 4) incorporation of the project results in the courses taught by the PIs in different departments/institutions, namely VT?s MEMS: from fabrication to application and Nanotechnology, and W&amp;M?s Instrumental Analysis and Advanced Analytical Chemistry and 4) annual joint seminars by VT, W&amp;M, and CE on microsystems applications in biomedicine. Additionally, the outcome of this research will be widely disseminated to the engineering and scientific communities in peer-reviewed journals and in presentation at multidisciplinary conferences, to CE and other industries that use or develop gas chromatography and VOC preconcentrators (microtraps), and in web pages that will serve as resources for off-campus faculty who are teaching undergraduate and graduate analytical chemistry courses that deal with separation science</AbstractNarration>
