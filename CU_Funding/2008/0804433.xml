    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims for greater understanding, development, and optical characterization of new metallodielectric nano-composite materials. Dispersion of the dielectric permittivity, as arising from composition, structure and symmetry is a primary issue of concern, because it enables control, creation and detection of optical information, since new dispersive phenomena are now known to arise in micro and nanostructured materials. The approach addresses such dispersive response in selection of nanostructured metallodielectric composite materials, referred to as metamaterials, and study of linear optical response of metallodielectric composites in the context of three fundamentally distinct dispersion management protocols: (i) Starting with nanostructured composites, effective material permittivities will be measured, delineating their dependence on symmetry, scale and order. (ii) At the meso-scale, plasmon mode-coupling in quasi two-dimensional metallodielectric photonic crystals will be studied in the context of a coherently-induced transparency. (iii) At the material level, coupling of the metallodielectric structures to a resonant gain medium will allow active control over metamaterial dispersion. The integrated results of this study are expected to result in a more comprehensive and fundamental understanding of dispersion management in both active and passive metamaterials. Since the project addresses fundamental questions of light-matter interactions in nanoscale plasmonic systems, results and knowledge gained will be relevant to understanding signal manipulation in sub-diffraction volumes in the presence of strong dispersion. Such understanding is expected to have impact in fields such as light harvesting, nanoscale signal routing and storage, high-resolution imaging systems and active plasmonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science with high technological relevance. Current development of photonic devices capable of manipulating optical information may substantially impact advancement of present and future optical technologies. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature, offering collaborative opportunities for all participating students. A goal is to make known the many fascinating aspects of materials science by exposing university students of all levels to research and multi-disciplinary scientific work. At the undergraduate level the aim is to expand avenues for learning by offering a variety of course and research opportunities. At the graduate level the project addresses involvement and development of existing educational and internship programs, both in materials science and optics.</AbstractNarration>
