    <AbstractNarration>This project will aid the theoretical program on the interaction of radiation with free and confined atoms and ions at Georgia State University. The PI will continue to develop theoretical methodologies and perform a series of calculations that explore ionizing collisions of electromagnetic radiation and charged particles with matter and investigate the details of their deposition of energy. The PI will develop/enhance theoretical methodologies and apply them to investigations of electromagnetic radiation impinging on free atoms and ions, with emphasis on breakdowns in fundamental approximations and processes for which many-body interactions dominate, e.g., negative ion photodetachment. In addition, the PI will study the collisions of atoms and ions with atoms with particular emphases on the role of projectile electrons and higher order contributions. All of these investigations shall be carried out in close collaboration with experimental groups in an effort to insure the quantitative accuracy of the theoretical methodologies developed. In addition, the PI will continue to study the interaction of radiation with confined atoms and ions, e.g., confined in fullerenes. Of great importance will be the realistic handling of the confining potential, e.g., treating all 60 carbon atoms of C60. The results will provide further insight into the nature of these fundamental atomic processes that are of importance in plasma physics and controlled thermonuclear research, atmospheric, solar, and astrophysics, radiation and radiological physics and therapy, and for studies of x-ray laser mechanics. In addition, understanding the properties of confined atoms will lead to insight into the qualitatively new physics of a largely unexplored area. The project will bring more minorities in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
