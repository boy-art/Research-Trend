    <AbstractNarration>The Chemistry Department at the University of Wyoming (UW) offers a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site focused on "Chemistry Research in Energy Science" to enable undergraduates to work in research groups on outstanding problems in energy science and energy resource management. The program targets students from small colleges without graduate programs, students from the six community colleges in Wyoming, and students from underrepresented groups in science. The 10-week summer program not only involves hands-on research but is a fully integrated program to educate and train students in the scientific issues related to the development of clean and sustainable energy resources. Each summer ten undergraduates from neighboring colleges will come to UW and perform guided research in one of the ten participating faculty mentors research groups. The research opportunities offered in this program cover a wide variety of fundamental and applied research projects associated with new methods of using existing carbon-based fuels more efficiently and cleaner as well as the development of new carbon-neutral energy. Educational and social activities include participation in weekly REU group meetings, field trips to coal and wind power plants in Wyoming, a 4-day camping trip to Yellowstone National Park, group dinners and weekend activities, ethics training, and an REU student mini-symposium culminating the summer program. The results of the research will be disseminated at professional meetings and in journal articles and the broader learning experiences will be communicated on the UW REU website. The site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
