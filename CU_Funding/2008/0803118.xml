    <AbstractNarration>Rodney J. Bartlett of the University of Florida is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to partially defray the cost of a workshop on parallelization of coupled cluster methods in quantum chemistry. The workshop is being held in conjunction with the 2008 Sanibel Symposium and will bring together a diverse group of investigators to discuss several current topics including efficiency, benchmarking studies and the development of petascale algorithms. Any recommendations and conclusions resulting from the workshop will be posted on the Sanibel website a month after the end of the workshop which is planned for Feb. 23-24, 2008. The results of the workshop are expected to have a broad impact through the participation of young investigators from Jackson State University and Florida A &amp; M who have been invited to the meeting and whose travel costs will be partially defrayed by this award.</AbstractNarration>
