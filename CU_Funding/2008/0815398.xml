    <AbstractNarration>Coastal ecosystems are experiencing changes in nutrient loading and species composition much higher than previously measured, undoubtedly affecting productivity and sustainability of coastal regions. Predicting the impacts of these changes is important in salt marshes because marshes are among the most biologically productive areas in the world and provide critical ecosystem services, such as nursery areas for fisheries, removal of nitrogen, and shoreline storm buffering. This project addresses a critical question: What are the effects of increased nutrients and species change on ecosystem services provided by salt marsh ecosystems? The project is the first to use whole-ecosystem experiments that alter nutrient loading and reduce fish populations to understand the effects on nutrient cycling, species diversity, food webs and the long-term sustainability of salt marshes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The damage by Hurricane Katrina due to degradation of coastal wetlands is one example of the importance of salt marshes to society. A growing appreciation of this role for marshes has led to estuaries becoming the focus of large-scale restoration programs. This project will provide information essential for developing water quality standards and providing perspective for multi-million dollar coastal management decisions, such as construction of sewage treatment facilities, regulation of fishing, or rebuilding of lost marshes.</AbstractNarration>
