    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to explore novel embedded processor architectures for electronic textiles (e-textiles). E-textiles are intelligent fabrics where sensors and computation are intrinsic to the cloth, with applications in medicine, entertainment, and sports. E-textiles occupy an extremely constrained point in the embedded system design space, having a large number of networked sensors and processors distributed throughout the fabric and tight requirements on performance, energy consumption, and reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research at the Virginia Tech E-textiles Lab has shown that a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach allows designers to effectively manage the complexity of the e-textile design space, which includes issues such as fiber selection, the weave pattern, the physical topology of the electrical/communication network in the fabric, the number/type/location of sensor/actuator nodes, the number and type of computational nodes, the system software organization, and the application algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, an MDE approach does not yield an implementation that is easily portable while being power- and performance-efficient, due to a fundamental mismatch between the MDE design specification and the target microprocessors. The approach in this project is to develop an event-driven computer architecture family that presents an abstraction that is well-matched to the MDE design specification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential benefits of this project include using the architecture family to improve the reliability, design cost, and energy efficiency of embedded systems besides e-textiles. The broader impacts of the project include e-textile applications in medical monitoring, wearable computing, and pervasive computing. Educational benefits include providing undergraduate and graduate students with multidisciplinary research experience.</AbstractNarration>
