    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiferroics are compounds which can be simultaneously magnetized (are&lt;br/&gt;ferromagnetic) and electrically charged (are ferroelectric). Such&lt;br/&gt;compounds hold promise for applications in devices and lead to&lt;br/&gt;unprecedented data-storage capacity. However, the underlying mechanism&lt;br/&gt;which leads to such unique properties is poorly understood and needs to be&lt;br/&gt;resolved before practical devices can be fabricated. This individual&lt;br/&gt;investigator award supports the study of a family of multiferroic&lt;br/&gt;manganese oxide compounds known as manganites. The properties of&lt;br/&gt;manganites are intimately linked to their crystal structure. The theme of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to quantify the role played by crystal structure in&lt;br/&gt;multiferroic manganites and suggest methods to design materials better&lt;br/&gt;suited for device applications. High quality manganite thin films will be&lt;br/&gt;grown using laser ablation. These thin films' response to strain (change&lt;br/&gt;in the crystal structure) will be studied by measuring the change in their&lt;br/&gt;electrical resistance and magnetism. The microscopic effect of strain will&lt;br/&gt;be studied using techniques such as a microscope capable of mapping the&lt;br/&gt;local magnetism of the material. Since the research and training program&lt;br/&gt;includes both sample preparation and measurement, this award will help&lt;br/&gt;train undergraduate and graduate students in various aspects of condensed&lt;br/&gt;matter physics research and give them a broad based experience, which will&lt;br/&gt;enhance their future career options in the industry or academe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perovskite manganese oxides (manganites) display unique properties such as&lt;br/&gt;micrometer scale phase separation and multiferroism, which are intimately&lt;br/&gt;linked to their crystal structure. Hence, the electrical and magnetic&lt;br/&gt;properties of manganites are sensitive to strain. This individual&lt;br/&gt;investigator award supports an experimental program to directly measure&lt;br/&gt;the effect of strain on the properties of manganites and by comparing the&lt;br/&gt;results to the predictions of theoretical models, determine the origin of&lt;br/&gt;phase separation and multiferroism in manganites. The experimental results&lt;br/&gt;are also expected to reveal methods of enhancing the magnetoelectric&lt;br/&gt;coupling in multiferroic manganites and controlling the nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;properties of phase separated manganites. High quality manganite thin&lt;br/&gt;films will be grown using pulsed laser deposition. The thin films will&lt;br/&gt;then be subjected to direct external stress using a three point&lt;br/&gt;beam-bending apparatus to induce uniaxial strain in the material. Using a&lt;br/&gt;complementary suite of local and bulk measurement techniques such as&lt;br/&gt;magnetotransport, magnetization, scanning probe microscopy, and neutron&lt;br/&gt;reflectometry, the phase diagram of the thin films will be mapped as a&lt;br/&gt;function of strain, magnetic field, electric field, and temperature. Since&lt;br/&gt;the research and training program includes both sample preparation and&lt;br/&gt;measurement, undergraduate and graduate students will be able to learn&lt;br/&gt;about a wide variety of materials and experimental techniques, which will&lt;br/&gt;prepare them for academic and industrial careers.</AbstractNarration>
