    <AbstractNarration>This collaboration is building upon a successful biotechnology program and an experienced team at Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) by adding Utah Valley University (UVU) and numerous high schools in the region in order to enhance matriculation and success in biotechnology and other STEM disciplines. Using a 2+2+2 pipeline approach, the collaboration is creating an integrated network of activities that encourages and supports students as they move from the junior year of high school through two- and four-year institutions. This includes strengthening the secondary programs by providing high school teachers and students with research-based learning opportunities, increasing the number of biology and chemistry courses at SLCC, creating learning communities in gateway courses, expanding biotechnology courses and laboratories at UVU, establishing service learning and community outreach activities, and assisting with child care support for working parents at SLCC. The strong support from secondary and post-secondary institutions, industry, and the state of Utah increases the broader impact of this project by establishing networks, providing support mechanisms, and building capacity among institutions in the entire northern and central region of Utah.</AbstractNarration>
