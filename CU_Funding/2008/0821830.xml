    <AbstractNarration>IEEE DySPAN is a high quality conference in the area of dynamic spectrum access. Current radio technology trends promise to enable "Dynamic Spectrum Access" (DSA) networks, using wide-band spectrum sensing, real-time spectrum allocation and acquisition, and infrastructure-less mesh networks. Not only do these trends challenge the existing technologies, they challenge the traditional "command and control" methods of allocating and licensing spectrum by government fiat. In 2005, the first DySPAN conference was held to promote analysis, discussion and development of new DSA technologies. Built upon the momentum of the first DySPAN conference, the second DySPAN was held in Apr. 2007. Both conferences succeeded on all accounts, bringing the technologists who design and build these devices together with the spectrum policy experts charged with re-architecting spectrum policy in a manner that accommodates the technologies. The results included substantial and important contributions on technical and policy issues facing this emerging area of research. The third conference will be held in Chicago, IL, USA, in Oct. 2008. Since the travel support in most of the NSF awards is quite limited to students (who are authors), this fund will enable the awardees not to divert research funding for travel.</AbstractNarration>
