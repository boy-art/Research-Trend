    <AbstractNarration>In this research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the organization and dynamics of supported lipid bilayer films are investigated. Lipid bilayers are essential to life and supported bilayer structures are of critical importance in biosensing applications. These molecular layers have been studied widely but the connection between molecular interactions within these films and their macroscopic behavior remains to be established. Prof. Blanchard and his group at Michigan State University focus in this research on understanding the structure, dynamics and phase separation behavior in unilamellar vesicles and supported lipid bilayers as a function of layer composition and substrate chemical structure. The group evaluates, including with fluorescent probe molecules, the molecular interactions within model bilayers and between the bilayer and substrate that are responsible for bilayer organization and dynamics. A common thread to all of these efforts is the hypothesis that bilayer dynamics and organization are mediated by structural defect sites within the bilayers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The larger purpose of this research program, beyond understanding lipid bilayer organization and dynamics, is to educate students at the cutting edge of interfacial science to train a globally competitive cohort of students that reflects the demographic of the Nation for careers in science. This research serves as a vehicle in that effort. Results from this work will form undergraduate research reports, MS theses, PhD dissertations and will be reported in the peer-reviewed literature. This research program is geared for participation by undergraduate and graduate students, and the PI's home institution is strongly supportive of the inclusion of undergraduates in research, ensuring early exposure to multidisciplinary science. The MSU Graduate Program in Chemistry and the Institution as a whole has a long-standing commitment to the inclusion of under-represented groups, and for the past seven years the Blanchard research group has been more than 50% female. The group has an ongoing International collaboration with Professor Pawel Krysiñski (University of Warsaw) that focuses on the use of biological and biomimetic interfaces for chemical sensing. The Krysiñski group expertise dovetails with the Blanchard group, and this collaboration enhances the breadth of both labs. Students from both groups work regularly in the collaborator labs, fostering a global scientific outlook for both US and Polish students and accelerating the movement of fundamental knowledge.</AbstractNarration>
