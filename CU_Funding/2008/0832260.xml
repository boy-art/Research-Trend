    <AbstractNarration>The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network is requesting three years of support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to further the professional development of STEM faculty, staff, and students at Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) that have received grants from the NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP). The project is designed to strengthen the financial management, assessment, and evaluation of TCUP-funded projects; improve the capabilities of STEM faculty to better integrate culture into the curriculum as well as improve their mentoring/advising skills; and provide professional development opportunities in Washington, DC, for STEM faculty and students at TCUP grantees. To facilitate achieving these goals, QEM will conduct two workshops for STEM faculty, two workshops for TCUP Project staff, offer an annual nine-month fellowship for a STEM faculty who would be based at NSF, and provide ten-week summer internships for five students each year.</AbstractNarration>
