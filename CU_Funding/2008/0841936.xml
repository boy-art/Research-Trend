    <AbstractNarration>Wheat, oats, rice, and other cereal grains are key pillars of human societies worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;Along with other members of the grass family, these plants provide the majority of the&lt;br/&gt;calories humans eat, either directly as grains or indirectly as meat and milk produced by&lt;br/&gt;grazing animals. Unfortunately, these important grasses are plagued by several families&lt;br/&gt;of plant viruses, including the barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses, which damage&lt;br/&gt;cereal grain production worldwide. These viruses also harm wild grasses and can&lt;br/&gt;advance the spread of invasive species in nature. How have influential viruses like&lt;br/&gt;these emerged and what factors have contributed to their spread and diversification? To&lt;br/&gt;find clues about virus history, the project team will recover and analyze genetic&lt;br/&gt;sequences of old viruses preserved within historical collections of dried plants around&lt;br/&gt;the world. Phylogenetic analysis of the viruses will reveal how these viruses have&lt;br/&gt;spread over time and permit estimates of dates of key events in their history. The&lt;br/&gt;research will also provide information on the influence of humans on the spread of plant&lt;br/&gt;viruses.&lt;br/&gt;Human development of agriculture and global trade are two factors that have likely&lt;br/&gt;influenced the emergence and spread of potent viruses. This research will provide&lt;br/&gt;missing information about virus dynamics in the past and produce new insight into the&lt;br/&gt;ways by which human activities influence the development of virus threats. The&lt;br/&gt;project's broader impact will include training of educators and students from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups, contributions to microbial ecology outreach efforts through a&lt;br/&gt;science museum, and the addition of information about virus relationships to curated&lt;br/&gt;plant collections.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0843140 PI Name:Malmstrom, Carolyn&lt;br/&gt;Printed</AbstractNarration>
