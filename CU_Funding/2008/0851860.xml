    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston (TAMUG). The program will support ten students during a ten week summer research program over a three year period (2009-2011). The program will include independent research projects by the students, participation in a weekly summer lecture series on scientific and career-related topics. It will conclude with a written report and student poster and oral presentations. Students will also participate in a variety of field trips and laboratory tours. Funding supports student stipends, room and board, travel, and some field trip expenses. Students will be encouraged to publish in peer-reviewed journals and participate in national conferences following the summer research program. TAMUG will conduct a national recruiting effort and will focus local recruiting efforts on four Hispanic Serving Institutions, including UT Brownsville, UT Pan America, TAMU Kingsville, and TAMU Corpus-Christi, in support of OCE's efforts to increase the diversity of students and faculty in ocean sciences. As required by NSF REU program, most of the students will be selected from schools other than TAMUG.</AbstractNarration>
