    <AbstractNarration>Abstract - DMS - 0805143&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two classes of problems on which this project is&lt;br/&gt;focused. The first is about the geometric and analytic&lt;br/&gt;properties of the Ricci flow equation and their applications to&lt;br/&gt;the study of geometry and the topology of manifolds. Secondly,&lt;br/&gt;there are a couple of nonlinear partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;appeared in the applied science, to which some techniques and&lt;br/&gt;results obtained by the PI are related and can be applied. The&lt;br/&gt;first part of project consists of the classifications of&lt;br/&gt;self-similar solutions, namely gradient solitons, and the&lt;br/&gt;convexity type estimates for Ricci flow solution in high&lt;br/&gt;dimensions. Such results have far-reaching consequences in the&lt;br/&gt;applications of Ricci flow in the study of&lt;br/&gt;geometric-topological structure of the manifolds. The second&lt;br/&gt;theme of the project is about the sharp gradient estimates of&lt;br/&gt;Li-Yau-Hamilton type, related monotonicity formulae and their&lt;br/&gt;applications in geometric nonlinear PDEs. Their relations to&lt;br/&gt;physics, statistical mechanics in particular, shall be studied&lt;br/&gt;too. The aim is to discover a fundamental physical/geometric&lt;br/&gt;principle to unify various sharp estimates and monotonicity&lt;br/&gt;formulae. It will also provide the guideline for further&lt;br/&gt;discovery of the new monotonicity formulae in other geometric&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is on the geometric and analytic properties of&lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow, one of the most important geometric partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equation in mathematics and physics. The&lt;br/&gt;completion of the project will enhance the current&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the singularity formation of the Ricci flow&lt;br/&gt;equation and its relation with several branches of applied&lt;br/&gt;science and theoretic physics. By giving lectures for general&lt;br/&gt;audience including high school students, writing several&lt;br/&gt;monographs and survey articles, the project contributes to the&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of enhancing the scientific understanding of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical community as well as the general publics.</AbstractNarration>
