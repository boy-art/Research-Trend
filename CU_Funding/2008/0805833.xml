    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0805833&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Tyler D. Lawson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to relate the theory of formal group&lt;br/&gt;laws to phenomena in stable homotopy theory and K-theory. In&lt;br/&gt;stable homotopy theory, the objective is to begin making&lt;br/&gt;fundamental computations in the theory of topological automorphic&lt;br/&gt;forms developed in joint work with Behrens. This will first&lt;br/&gt;proceed by examining and computing the homotopy of spectra&lt;br/&gt;associated to certain moduli of abelian surfaces such as Shimura&lt;br/&gt;curves, and then by working towards higher chromatic filtrations.&lt;br/&gt;In algebraic K-theory, the objective is to make systematic use of&lt;br/&gt;the relationship between formal group laws and complex cobordism&lt;br/&gt;to systematize computations in algebraic K-theory and relate them&lt;br/&gt;to the chromatic filtration, with the hope of gaining&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the "chromatic redshift" phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of homotopy theory arose as a method to answer&lt;br/&gt;concrete questions in geometry by way of algebra. In the&lt;br/&gt;process, a strange connection was discovered with formal group&lt;br/&gt;laws, which themselves are intimately related to quite different&lt;br/&gt;subjects such as number theory and elliptic curves. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, there is a surprising connection between elliptic&lt;br/&gt;curves and mathematical physics. This research focuses on&lt;br/&gt;applying very recent developments in homotopy theory to study&lt;br/&gt;connections such as these, with the hope that our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of number theory and our understanding of homotopy theory can&lt;br/&gt;benefit each other.</AbstractNarration>
