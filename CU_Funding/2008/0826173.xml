    <AbstractNarration>Over the last two decades, stochastic resonance, a nonlinear phenomenon in which the addition of noise to a stochastic system leads to a coherently amplified response, has been explored to explain the dynamics of systems ranging from the Earth?s climate to sensory neurons in a monkey?s ear. Although considerable work has been carried out in the context of physical and biological systems, the use of noise for the benefit of nonlinear mechanical and structural systems, in particular, their transduction properties, has not been widely explored. This is to be addressed here by developing a fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in coupled, nonlinear mechanical and structural systems, and use this understanding to develop novel mechanical and structural design methodologies that incorporate the advantages of stochastic resonance for enhancement of the mechanical transduction capabilities and signal detection capabilities of these systems. It is expected that this understanding will help use noise in a constructive manner in the design of nonlinear systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a fundamental standpoint, as stochastic resonance is relevant to physical systems (periodic recurrences of ice ages, ring lasers, Schmitt triggers, optical devices, magnetic systems), chemical systems, and biological systems (sensory neurons), the findings of this study are expected to be important for a wide range of nonlinear systems including many outside mechanical and structural systems. For example, certain aspects of the study will carry implications for frontier research areas such as quantum metrology and quantum computation. From an application standpoint, the extension of the advantages of stochastic resonance in resonator arrays to the micro-scale and nano-scale can produce commercial benefits in the areas of sensing technologies and nanodevices. Finally, the application of stochastic resonance in nano-scale science to specific problems in a systematic manner is expected to be important for the education of future generations of students.</AbstractNarration>
