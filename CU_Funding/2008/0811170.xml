    <AbstractNarration>The Northeastern University ADVANCE Institutional Transformation project will systematically integrate concerns about interdisciplinary and international research into the project model for change. The Advancing Women within Interdisciplinary and International Networks (AWIIN) model for change will transform recruitment practices; strengthen professional networks for women; and develop a forum for comprehensive engagement of leadership to increase accountability and to instill long-lasting changes in institutional policies and practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific interventions target the isolation of women due to their solo status and the challenge to succeed in interdisciplinary and international research environments at Northeastern and beyond. Efforts to improve retention include Interdisciplinary Recruitment Workshops integrated with campus research center conferences and a new Dual Career Network Committee through the New England Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC). Women?s mixed gender networks are strengthened with External Career Mentoring Teams, the improved existing faculty mentoring program, grants to stimulate interdisciplinary and international collaborations, campus-wide networks, and Greater Boston Area Faculty Seminars. The new Leadership Academy is a forum to engage institutional leaders, influential faculty, and rising women leaders in changing institutional policy and organizational practices. The Academy will also be a forum to enhance intercultural gender competence. A comprehensive research and evaluation program will accompany the interventions to guide design, possible modifications, and to disseminate findings and best practices. The interdisciplinary AWIIN team includes social scientists, faculty, and administrators from science and engineering. All activities are aligned in the current changing environment guided by the new 2007 Academic Plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The two original research projects will provide new insights about the skills of individuals, the tools and organizational practices and policies that allow women and men faculty to succeed in and contribute to an increasing interdisciplinary, global enterprise of science and technology. The project on gender and globalization of the academy will identify gender-specific barriers and strategies to international networks and collaboration. The project on gender and social networks will provide insights into gender differences in the involvement of faculty in professional, interdisciplinary, and international networks. These findings will be of interest to individual faculty, researchers, and institutions that are interested in promoting women scientists and engineers in interdisciplinary and international universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWINN?s broader impacts include the entire institution as interventions will be rolled out to all colleges in the long-term affecting the climate for all students and faculty at Northeastern University. The Leadership Academy will result in a general improvement of management practices and skills across the institution. Regional workshops will be held to disseminate best practices into colleges and universities in New England. A national conference on gender and internationalization of science in academia will raise national awareness. In addition, Northeastern University will create a Dual Career Network committee as part of the New England Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC) that facilitates dual career needs in the broader Boston academic community. The AWIIN website will provide guides and tools for individuals and other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
