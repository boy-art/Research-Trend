    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics at the University of Wyoming will purchase&lt;br/&gt;computer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several&lt;br/&gt;research projects, including in particular: the numerical simulation of&lt;br/&gt;three-phase porous-media flows, the investigation of the the scale-up&lt;br/&gt;problem for such flows, the development of particle tracking schemes for&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear conservation laws and of parallel adaptive multi-scale finite&lt;br/&gt;element methods that can be applied to them. The projects aim&lt;br/&gt;at advancing the state-of-the-art in modeling and simulation of fluid&lt;br/&gt;flow in porous media such as oil reservoirs and aquifers. They will&lt;br/&gt;explore new computational algorithms, both for sequential and parallel&lt;br/&gt;computers, the incorporation of complex fluid physics, and eventually&lt;br/&gt;will apply these methods to the study of enhanced oil recovery&lt;br/&gt;techniques which are already used in the state of Wyoming as well as&lt;br/&gt;elsewhere in the United States. Thus, the projects will have a large&lt;br/&gt;social impact on the state of Wyoming, due to its concentration of&lt;br/&gt;natural resources in gas, coal and oil reservoirs, and ultimately on the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. maintaining its leadership role in applied computational science in&lt;br/&gt;a field of high importance to today's world economy. On a different&lt;br/&gt;scale, the projects span several disciplines and are tuned to the&lt;br/&gt;University of Wyoming mission of interdisciplinary computational science&lt;br/&gt;in its academic plan. Existing research links between the Departments of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, Statistics, Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, Chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;Computer Science, as well as the Institute for Enhanced Oil Recovery and&lt;br/&gt;the School for Energy Resources will be stimulated, and will result in&lt;br/&gt;attracting additional students in the existing programs. The project is&lt;br/&gt;coupled tightly with an on-going education plan aimed at developing both&lt;br/&gt;an undergraduate and a graduate curriculum in Computational Science, to&lt;br/&gt;be offered through some of the above departments above as a minor. This&lt;br/&gt;minor has already been approved at the College of Arts level for the&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics Department where the emphasis will be on training students&lt;br/&gt;in high-performance computing and its use in the study of complex&lt;br/&gt;physics, with first undergraduate students expected this Fall. Other&lt;br/&gt;departments and the graduate program are expected to follow gradually&lt;br/&gt;over the next couple of years.</AbstractNarration>
