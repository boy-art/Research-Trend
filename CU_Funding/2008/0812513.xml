    <AbstractNarration>Most of this proposal lies under the umbrella of a vast program proposed &lt;br/&gt;by Gromov: classify finitely generated groups by their quasi-isometric &lt;br/&gt;geometry. One way to study the geometry of a group is via a space called &lt;br/&gt;the asymptotic cone; in several important cases, interesting algebraic &lt;br/&gt;structure of groups has been found encoded by the topology of their &lt;br/&gt;asymptotic cones. Through a study of asymptotic cones, the PI will work &lt;br/&gt;towards understanding the geometry of several particular classes of &lt;br/&gt;groups, including mapping class groups, relatively hyperbolic groups, and &lt;br/&gt;three-manifold groups. In particular, the goal of the project is to &lt;br/&gt;develop new geometric invariants with an eye towards proving one of the &lt;br/&gt;main geometric conjectures concerning mapping class groups, namely &lt;br/&gt;quasi-isometric rigidity. This conjecture asserts that no other groups &lt;br/&gt;geometrically look like mapping class groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are an algebraic way of encoding the symmetries of a space. It &lt;br/&gt;turns out that an important class of groups (the finitely generated ones) &lt;br/&gt;are themselves associated with a certain geometric object. This object is &lt;br/&gt;built by taking each symmetry to be a point and declaring the distance &lt;br/&gt;between a pair of points to be the number of simple symmetries one has to &lt;br/&gt;apply to get from one to the other. In the study of finitely generated &lt;br/&gt;groups, insight into their geometry can often be gained by looking at the &lt;br/&gt;group from ``infinitely far away'' -- this notion can be made &lt;br/&gt;mathematically precise and yields what is called an asymptotic cone of the &lt;br/&gt;group. The PI proposes certain ways to study groups from this asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;viewpoint.</AbstractNarration>
