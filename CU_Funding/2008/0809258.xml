    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kit H. Bowen of the Johns Hopkins University, together with his undergraduate, graduate and high school student researchers, will investigate a broad range of chemical topics using gas-phase photoelectron spectroscopy. Some of the systems and topics to be studied include biomolecule anions and clusters, electron-induced proton transfer, diffuse (Rydberg) electron systems, and circular dichroism effects in chiral anions. These are wide-ranging experiments that probe fundamental questions in chemistry. Data from these studies will be of interest to theorists as well as other experimentalists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies conducted in the Bowen laboratory are aimed primarily at understanding the ways in which electrons interact with molecules. By studying these interactions in well-controlled gas-phase systems, experimentalists like Bowen provide useful data to understand the chemistry and physics of more complex systems. The acid-base studies that are one of the key components of the present work will shed new light on this simple and ubiquitous form of chemical reaction. In addition to the broad scientific impact of the work in the Bowen laboratory, this project will enable a broad range of young scientists -- from high-school to graduate student researchers -- to pursue cutting-edge physical chemistry research. In addition, Prof. Bowen has a long record of outreach to underrepresented groups and this work will continue.</AbstractNarration>
