    <AbstractNarration>0853572&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: IRES: U.S.-China Collaboration on Fluid and Thermal Transport in Fuel Cells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The award is made to Professor Xia Wang in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. The participating U.S. graduate and undergraduate students will collaborate with researchers in the Department of Power Engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University in China which has built a state-of-the-art fuel cell testing facility to study the dynamic behavior of fuel cells. Their foreign collaborator at the University is Professor Li Jia. The students? research will focus on fuel cell-related problems that have a direct impact on U.S. energy consumption and related national security issues. Their particular emphasis will be on the critical issues of the thermal and water management of fuel cells. Students will be introduced to current problems, potential solutions, modern numerical and experimental methods, and will be given the opportunities to explore under a close-coupled mentorship. They will also receive Chinese language and culture training. Visiting industrial and historic sites are also part of the planned activities. The students will have expectations and opportunities to contribute to on-going research programs. Results of their projects will provide a fundamental understanding of the thermal and fluid transport in fuel cells and contribute positively to current energy and environmental issues. These results will be disseminated in conferences and through peer-reviewed journal articles. The program activities will be placed on dedicated websites and made available to the community at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major emphasis of the project is to engage U.S. students in meaningful projects with international students and faculty. Students will work closely with researchers with different scientific backgrounds and will learn field and laboratory techniques that will enhance their research skills. Altogether, these experiences will increase the networking and international competitiveness of the student participants. By intentionally creating opportunities for first-generation, minority, and female students, the research program will have broad impacts on geological education and research.</AbstractNarration>
