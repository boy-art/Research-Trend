    <AbstractNarration>There have been attempts in the literature to derive the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimate (mle) of a change-point for offline change-point models under the abrupt change formulation. These attempts, thus far, have yielded results that are either of analytical interest only, or they are available only in the form of bounds and approximations. Here, the investigators develop exact computable expressions for the asymptotic distribution of the change-point mle when an abrupt change occurs in the parameters of some of the most basic and commonly encountered change-point models. Specific models considered include: (i) change in the parameter of a univariate exponential distribution; (ii) change in the parameters of a multivariate exponential distribution; (iii) change in the mean only of a univariate normal distribution; (iv) change in the variance only of a univariate normal distribution; (v) change in both mean and variance of a univariate distribution; (vi) the extensions of problems (iii)-(v) for the multivariate normal distribution; and (vii) extensions to situations such as Poisson mixtures of generalized inverse Gaussian distributions. Depending upon the model, the derived distributions for the change-point mle may be either symmetric or possibly asymmetric. On the other hand, distributions derived in the literature under the additional assumption of smoothing are known to be always symmetric under all modeling scenarios.&lt;br/&gt; Change-point methods are important scientific tools for the detection and estimation of changes that occur in variables monitored over time. Such methods are at the forefront of identifying changes in variables related to issues of contemporary significance such as climate change, ozone depletion, water pollution, air pollution, and nuclear waste monitoring programs. For example, on the basis of various scientific theories, claims are made that global warming has begun some years ago. The question is whether relevant data collected overtime support such claims. If so, when did such a change happen? In their attempts to monitor air quality and water quality, scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collect data upon a number of hydrological and atmospheric variables on a regular basis. The scientists are then confronted with identifying changes that may have occurred in the variables being monitored. Answers to such questions require studied application of change-point methods to the collected data. Thus, the investigators make advances to change-point methods mainly related to the problem of estimating the time of change. Since practical data from different sources give raise to different probability models, the developed methods are broad enough that they are applicable to a wide range of practical scenarios.</AbstractNarration>
