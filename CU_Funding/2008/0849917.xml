    <AbstractNarration>This West Virginia University?s REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Ten students will be selected to participate in a 10-week research program. Students will receive hands-on research experience in one of twelve laboratories under the guidance of an experienced faculty mentor. This REU program focuses on research in environmental biology with projects ranging from genomics to ecosystem ecology. Students will receive a $4,500 stipend, on-campus housing, and support for travel to and from the lab. In addition, health insurance and several social activities are provided at no cost to participants. Research will be coordinated with seminars, career guidance, group activities, and a research symposium. Students have opportunities for training in ecology, environmental biology, geography, molecular biology or genomics. Upon completion of the REU program, students will be better prepared for future opportunities as graduate students and researchers in environmental biology. The program is open to all undergraduate students enrolled in biology, geography, plant science or related fields. Underrepresented minorities, women, first generation students and students from colleges with limited research opportunities are encouraged to apply. Morgantown is a safe and diverse college town with interesting entertainment, extensive outdoor recreation, and access to the beautiful Appalachian Mountains. More information is available at http://reu.as.wvu.edu, or by contacting the Program Director, Dr. Richard Thomas (rthomas@wvu.edu; Tel 304-293-5201 ext. 31516).</AbstractNarration>
