    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to extend a recently developed Quasiparticle self-consistent GW&lt;br/&gt;method (QSGW) to study quantum transport in molecular and nanoscale devices. Because QSGW&lt;br/&gt;is very accurate, it is uniquely situated as a framework around which a reliable ab initio theory&lt;br/&gt;can be constructed. The full QSGW theory, however, is too expensive to be a practical engine&lt;br/&gt;for device design?at least as originally implemented. The major focus of this work will threefold&lt;br/&gt;first, to redesign a real-space version of QSGW theory, that should execute far more efficiently&lt;br/&gt;than the standard implementation with essentially the same reliability; second to design physically&lt;br/&gt;sound approximations to QSGW that are suitable for larger-scale applications, such as transport&lt;br/&gt;graphene, and new metal/insulator/metal spintronic designs.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: It is a significant accomplishment to develop an accurate, universal method&lt;br/&gt;which can predict many properties for a wide variety of systems in a unified way. This proposal&lt;br/&gt;extends QSGW in two directions: to calculate quantities of importance to quantum transport,&lt;br/&gt;e.g. phonons, the electron-phonon interaction, Auger recombination, and to find simplifications to&lt;br/&gt;enable practical study of many interesting materials problems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This work can significantly extend both the type of materials properties, the&lt;br/&gt;precision to which they can be calculated, and the complexity of the materials systems accessible. It&lt;br/&gt;lays the groundwork to enable realistic prediction of the performance of several future generations&lt;br/&gt;of electron devices.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
