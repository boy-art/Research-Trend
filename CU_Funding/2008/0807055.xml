    <AbstractNarration>The S-STEM program at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) is increasing the number of under-represented minorities in the science and technology workforce, with particular focus on the NCCU departments of Physics and Environmental, Earth and Geospatial Sciences. With scholarships available to sophomores through graduate students, NCCU's program is improving retention, matriculation, graduation rates, and acceptance into graduate programs or careers in the STEM fields. In addition to scholarship funds, each S-STEM scholar receives extensive support to ensure success, including the assignment of a faculty mentor who works with the students and also provides feedback to the management team on student performance. S-STEM scholars also benefit from the rich local research capacity that includes NCCU's STEM departments, the Research Triangle Institute, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Through this research environment, scholarship recipients are provided the opportunity to participate in research programs and interact with researchers; attend seminar series in their STEM areas; and participate in local and national research conferences. Other services provided to S-STEM scholarship recipients include tutorials and career development. The S-STEM program provides scholarships of approximately $7100.00 per year to each of seventeen students, including at least one graduate student in each of the five NCCU STEM departments.</AbstractNarration>
