    <AbstractNarration>Professor Murray Johnston of the University of Delaware is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry and by the Atmospheric Chemistry Program in the Division of Atmospheric Sciences to develop a nanoparticle inlet for use with aerosol mass spectrometry, and to use it for characterization of airborne nanoparticles in laboratory and field studies. At present, on-line sampling of nanoparticles from ambient air into the vacuum of a mass spectrometer is inefficient, making it difficult to study nanoparticle formation and reactivity. The inlet being developed in this work will aim to transmit nanoparticles over a broad size range, especially particles smaller than 10 nm, so that their composition can be determined. This analytical methodology will be used to study the formation and growth of nanoparticles in a coastal marine environment, and to study the formation of secondary organic aerosols. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide important information on the source and fate of nanoparticles in the environment so that their impacts on human health and the environment can be assessed. The methodology is relevant to the study of human exposure to nanoparticles in the workplace and to the study of large molecules and macromolecular assemblies in biological systems. A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students will be educated in this interdisciplinary area involving chemistry and atmospheric science. The results of field measurements will be used as case studies for environmental chemistry coursework at the University of Delaware, and the general public will be engaged at University sponsored science outreach events.</AbstractNarration>
