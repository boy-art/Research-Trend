    <AbstractNarration>This project will support the travel of researchers to participate in the US-India Workshop on ?Enhancing the Resilience of Built Infrastructure? to be held in India in 2009. The workshop will be organized around the four theme topics of: (1) extreme load definitions and combinations, (2) material performance, (3) retrofitting strategies, and (4) long-term strategies and plans for continuing US-India collaboration in these areas. The objectives of the workshop are to assess the state of the art in the three areas in the two countries and then identify future research agenda and research and educational cooperative opportunities in these areas. The proposed activity will bring together international researchers working in the areas of the workshop theme topics for the exchange of scientific information and ideas. The workshop topic is of strong research interest to both countries currently. USA has a strong research base and expertise in these areas and India is now aggressively pursuing research in these areas. However, we certainly can learn more from each other about the problems of common research interest, and benefit from a synergistically formulated collaborative research plan. This workshop will provide an excellent opportunity to the participants, especially the young researchers, for mutual appreciation of the cultural synergies that now exist between the scientific communities of the two countries for further advancement of science through joint research, faculty exchange opportunities, sabbatical opportunities, student exchange opportunities, and information technology and web-based collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
