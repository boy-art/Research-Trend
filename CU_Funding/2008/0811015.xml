    <AbstractNarration>Modern software systems involve millions of lines of code. In many&lt;br/&gt;systems, many of these lines are repetitions, with some variations, of&lt;br/&gt;a few patterns. This repetition is necessary because current&lt;br/&gt;programming languages require the programmer to spell out many details&lt;br/&gt;over and over again. Such repetition is error-prone and increases the&lt;br/&gt;cost and time-to-market of software systems. This research studies&lt;br/&gt;syntactic abstraction, a technique to eliminate much of the repetition&lt;br/&gt;in such systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to develop the theory of syntactic abstractions&lt;br/&gt;(also called "macros") to put it on a par with procedural or data&lt;br/&gt;abstraction. Its goal is to develop theories and tools that will make&lt;br/&gt;syntactic abstraction easy. Its results are intended to make it&lt;br/&gt;easier to write complex syntactic abstractions and that will allow a&lt;br/&gt;language designer to make rational choices when designing a syntactic&lt;br/&gt;abstraction facility. The main technical innovation is the inclusion&lt;br/&gt;of binding patterns as part of the public interface of a macro.</AbstractNarration>
