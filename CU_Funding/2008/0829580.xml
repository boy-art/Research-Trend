    <AbstractNarration>This research involves the development of automated negotiation protocols &lt;br/&gt;for autonomous agents in negotiation networks, where each agent can only &lt;br/&gt;negotiate with few selected neighbors. That is, we develop agents that can &lt;br/&gt;carry out any number of simultaneous negotiations with other selfish agents. &lt;br/&gt;For example, they could be routers in the Internet negotiating over which &lt;br/&gt;packets to route and which to drop, or purchasing agents in a supply chain &lt;br/&gt;deciding what to buy and at what price, or web services deciding who to &lt;br/&gt;provide services for and at what price, or sensors in a sensor network &lt;br/&gt;deciding which measurements to make and who to forward the results. Our &lt;br/&gt;research involves building the negotiation strategies for selfish rational &lt;br/&gt;agents that individuals and companies will want to use, along with the &lt;br/&gt;negotiation protocols that ensure the agents'&lt;br/&gt;interactions result in efficient global resource allocations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of negotiation networks combines features of characteristic &lt;br/&gt;form games and bargaining games from game theory, combinatorial auctions &lt;br/&gt;and distributed mechanism design from Economics, network exchange theory &lt;br/&gt;from Sociology, and distributed algorithm design from computer science. &lt;br/&gt;Our research brings together results from these disparate fields into &lt;br/&gt;one framework and provides algorithmic solutions for the dynamic, &lt;br/&gt;distributed problem of resource allocation among self-interested parties, &lt;br/&gt;in contrast with game theory and Economics' solutions which are typically &lt;br/&gt;steady-state axiomatic solutions. Success in this research is potentially &lt;br/&gt;transformative as it will provide the foundation for the engineering of &lt;br/&gt;protocols and efficient algorithms for distributed resource allocation, &lt;br/&gt;which is a pervasive problem in our ever-growing highly-interconnected &lt;br/&gt;society.</AbstractNarration>
