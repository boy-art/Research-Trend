    <AbstractNarration>This is a travel grant to support approximately a US delegation of approximately 12 specialists to the 2nd International Conference on Smart Materials and Nanotechnology in Engineering (SMNE2009) in Weihai, China. The international conference consists of sessions in bio-inspired materials and structures, shape-memory alloys and polymer, electro-active polymer, piezo-materials, electro and magneto restrictive materials and fluids, fiber optic sensor, MEMS sensors and actuators. The proposed group travel support would promote the international collaboration in research and education in this very rich interdisciplinary research area, in developing complementary approaches that are mutually beneficial, and accessible to the growing community, and contribute to the progress of nano science and engineering related to mechanics, materials and sensors.</AbstractNarration>
