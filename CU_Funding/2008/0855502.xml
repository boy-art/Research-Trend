    <AbstractNarration>This project bridges three traditionally separated research areas: molecular spectroscopy, quantum optics and coherent control. The frequency domain quantum control tool used here differs from the time domain control schemes used in coherent control. Recently this tool has been used to demonstrate molecular angular momentum control and to measure with high accuracy the absolute magnitude of the molecular transition dipole moment matrix element, which plays a critical role in absorption and emission of light by molecules. The goal of this project is to develop molecular dynamics applications for the frequency domain control scheme. In addition to the ongoing research on quantum control, this project will attempt control of pre-dissociation of molecules, and study the role of valence electron spin in reactive collisions. This project also involves research on molecular structure of interest for ultracold molecular physics. The frequency domain control scheme, combined with a four color excitation scheme, can be used for state selective transfer of molecular population to the lowest vibrational levels of the electronic ground state, a process that is critical for applications involving ultracold molecules in optical lattices. In addition, the project includes an experimental determination of the triplet ground state and first excited states potentials of alkali dimers. These data will be important for research on ultracold molecule formation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the connection with work on ultracold molecules and providing research opportunities and mentoring for students in molecular quantum optics. The project will also continue to contribute strongly to broadening the participation of underrepresented students, both graduate and undergraduate.</AbstractNarration>
