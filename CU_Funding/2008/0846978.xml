    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0846978&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Aleksey Zinger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invention of pseudo-holomorphic curves techniques in the&lt;br/&gt;1980s revolutionized symplectic topology, profoundly impacted&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, and led to astounding connections with string&lt;br/&gt;theory. This project has three distinct directions, motivated by&lt;br/&gt;this interplay between different fields. The primary one is a&lt;br/&gt;detailed study of deformations of such curves, for arbitrary as&lt;br/&gt;well as generic complex structures. It aims at the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;understanding of properties of pseudo-holomorphic curves,&lt;br/&gt;including Gromov-Witten invariants (counts of such curves) and&lt;br/&gt;more qualititative aspects of their behavior (e.g. existence,&lt;br/&gt;uniruledness, etc.). The aim of another direction is to apply&lt;br/&gt;techniques employed in the PI's proof of the string theory&lt;br/&gt;prediction for the genus 1 GW-invariants of a quintic threefold&lt;br/&gt;in many other setting, testing additional mirror predictions and&lt;br/&gt;going beyond them. The third direction would further develop the&lt;br/&gt;PI's local excess intersection approach and its applications to&lt;br/&gt;classical enumerative geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory is a physical model that represents elementary&lt;br/&gt;particles by vibrating strings with the aim of unifying the four&lt;br/&gt;fundamental forces of nature. As such srings move in space, they&lt;br/&gt;sweep out Riemann surfaces, also called holomorphic curves. While&lt;br/&gt;string theory is one of the main paradigms in physics today, it&lt;br/&gt;has yet to make any experimentally testable predictions. However,&lt;br/&gt;it has generated plenty of mathematical predictions and led to&lt;br/&gt;fundamental developments in symplectic topology and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, especially in relation to (pseudo-) holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;curves. This proposal aims to further test string theory&lt;br/&gt;mathematically, while deepening the mathematical understanding of&lt;br/&gt;such curves with an eye toward applications to more classical&lt;br/&gt;problems in geometry. Some of the projects in this proposal will&lt;br/&gt;pursued by graduate students under the PI's supervision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly supported by the programs in Geometric Analysis and in Algebra, Number Theory, and Combinatorics.</AbstractNarration>
