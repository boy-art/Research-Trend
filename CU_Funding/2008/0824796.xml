    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports US-participation in the "The 3rd SCAR Open Science Conference" to be held in St. Petersburg, Russia in July 2008. The SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) Conference is an international meeting covering all aspects of current polar research, and this conference includes both the Antarctic and Arctic. Recent results and opportunities for future cooperation are highlighted, which is timely for projects for the current International Polar Year 2007-2009. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this workshop promotes international collaboration, broadens the perspective of U.S. scientists, and provides an opportunity for the next generation of scientists to interact with leaders in the field. This award also provides support for applicants from underrepresented groups, as well as early career scientists and students. Outcomes have societal relevance in understanding global climate change, and the opening day's plenary session will bring the meeting to the attention of the media and general public.</AbstractNarration>
