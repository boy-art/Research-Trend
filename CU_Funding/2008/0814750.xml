    <AbstractNarration>This project would use a sample of Wisconsin families to study the role parents play in increasing students' perception of the utility of science as a means for increasing student participation in high school science courses. The researchers are collecting survey data on high school students and their parents in a sample of students ages 11, 13, and 15. These survey data will be used with prior information from the families in a longitudinal survey to examine some hypotheses about the use of parents? knowledge of the value of high school math and science courses on student choices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous research by the investigators has demonstrated that programs that focus on the value of a course leads to increased interest and enhanced performance for students in high school and college. The research would to study parent?s knowledge of the utility value of high school M&amp;S courses and their ability to convey it. It is a three-year longitudinal study and an experimental study on parent?s information. The study would be made of 166 families with a child who completed data collection at 9th grade. A random assignment will be made so that some parents receive professional training on how to discuss course taking with their students. Parents and students will be followed up in 9 months and in 2 years to assess the impact on course taking.</AbstractNarration>
