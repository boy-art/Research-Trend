    <AbstractNarration>This project supports a workshop that brings together members of the research, education, and data management communities that have shared interests in the effective educational use and delivery of geoscience data and discoveries. The workshop topic reflects an important need to bring together and foster greater interactions between the producers of high quality observational data collected by observatories and instruments supported by Earth systems research programs and the end-users of those data. While there are a number of educators that are motivated to integrate real time and near real time data into the K-16 curriculum, this group could be better served if the data were presented in more user-friendly accessible ways. The number of educators using Earth systems data might also increase if data were more accessible and in formats that facilitated their use in a variety of educational settings. The workshop and post-workshop activities address these important issues and seeks to improve the networking and interactions among the research, education, and data management communities. An outcome from the workshop will be the preparation of a report with findings and recommendations that will guide future education and outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
