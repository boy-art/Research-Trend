    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Dor Ben-Amotz of Purdue University and his graduate research students will study the interactions between water and other molecules using multivariate vibrational spectroscopy, computer simulations and liquid theory. The aim of this program is to obtain a molecularly detailed view of changes in water hydrogen bonding, as well as the formation of dangling OH bonds, induced by non-polar, polar and ionic solutes. This work will contribute to the fundamental understanding and utilization of water in driving important biological, geological and environmental processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the broad impact of the research on several areas of science, Prof. Ben-Amotz will continue to provide his research students with excellent training in experimental as well as theoretical methods.</AbstractNarration>
