    <AbstractNarration>Spirocycles formed from formal oxidative cyclization onto indole or imidazole cores comprise a diverse family of naturally occurring alkaloids that exhibit a wide range of promising biological properties, including anticancer and antibiotic activity. Consequently, total synthesis studies may impact on these larger health concerns by providing the natural products in macroscopic quantities along with structural analogues for lead development as pharmaceutical agents. In this continuing project, the application of a new approach to these stereochemically challenging types of targets will be explored. This chemistry stems from recent advances in Pummerer oxidation chemistry developed during the former grant period. Targets include dibromoagelaspongin, palau'amine, and the axinellamines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award through the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program of the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Ken Feldman in the Department of Chemistry at the Pennsylvania State University. Professor Feldman's research efforts focus on the development of new strategies and new chemical reactions for the efficient construction of complex, biologically active natural products. Successful prosecution of these research objectives may lead to new drug leads, which in turn will impact favorably on the pharmaceutical enterprise in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
