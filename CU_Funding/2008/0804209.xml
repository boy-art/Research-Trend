    <AbstractNarration>This renewal award by the Solid State Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research to University of South Carolina addresses the discovery and the crystal growth of new materials by utilizing hydroxide fluxes as a synthetic strategy in preparing new complex oxides in single crystal form. Many important physical properties that enable the functioning of new electronic devices, data storage materials, battery components and superconductors are found in oxide materials containing transition metal elements. This is a versatile group of chemical compounds that can be selectively modified to exhibit desirable physical properties that will lay the groundwork for new devices and applications of the future. With this award, Professor zur Loye will be developing advanced methods for synthesizing new oxides to determine the atomic structure of these materials, to investigate their electronic and magnetic properties, and to enable their utilization in a variety of applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on the discovery of new materials and the training of the next generation researcher in the US. These two goals will be accomplished by using crystal growth in hydroxide fluxes as a synthetic strategy to prepare complex oxides, to discover new materials, and to provide a valuable educational experience for students from undergraduate to graduate and postdoctorate. The scientific goals focus on expanding and improving the approach of single crystal growth as a means of exploring phase space for materials discovery, while the teaching goals will assure the education of a wide range of individuals, including those from underrepresented groups, in the area of solid state and materials chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
