    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most objects in the universe radiate electromagnetic energy that we call blackbody radiation. The objects are in equilibrium with their surroundings and therefore continually emit and absorb this type of energy. By studying the energy, we can learn about the properties of the objects. When nuclear scientists use the so-called atom smashers to force atomic nuclei together at impressively high energies, highly excited subatomic furnaces are briefly created. The furnaces do not live long enough to leisurely emit blackbody radiation. Instead they emit bursts of thermal and non-thermal electromagnetic radiation, similar to visible light, but at much higher energy. Safe and careful study of the properties of the radiation provides precious clues to help scientists understand how nature works within atomic nuclei, within even protons and neutrons, even down to the very quarks that rattle around inside the nucleons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to support experimental endeavors which seek to produce and study these subatomic furnaces. Advances in material science and computer technology allow nuclear scientists to basically take pictures of the particle dynamics using these bursts of electromagnetic radiation. Studying theoretical models for these tiny nuclear systems provides education and research training through meaningful mentoring of beginning students. Public presentations and technical presentations will be offered discussing the results of the research to stimulate more young people toward science, especially presentations to high-school students in the region through a local (senior-to-sophomore) program which encourages interaction between university faculty and high-school teachers and students.</AbstractNarration>
