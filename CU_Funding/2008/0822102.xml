    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CBET- 0822102&lt;br/&gt;Johnson, William P.&lt;br/&gt;University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New filtration theory via incorporation of pore scale mechanisms operating in the presence of an energy barrier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal objective of this proposal is to develop mechanistic models which accurately predict the retention of colloids in granular aquifer media under environmental conditions, where energy barrier (repulsion) exists between colloids and surfaces. The proposed research activities are to build on the platform previously developed for mechanistic description of colloid retention in the absence of an energy barrier (colloid filtration theory - CFT). The primary research hypothesis is that simulated values of colloid retention will match trends and values from experiments by using an innovative pore domain that incorporates the correct retention mechanisms operating in the presence of an energy barrier. This hypothesis will be tested using an adaptive strategy that prioritizes the work according to findings. The success of the approaches will be measured by comparison to trends and values quantifying colloid retention observed in pore- to continuum-scale experiments. The flow field will be solved in the pore domains using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Simulated and experimental trends and magnitudes of colloid retention parameters will be compared across a range of colloid-collector size ratios, fluid velocities, and colloid-collector interaction energies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists, practitioners, regulators, and the general public will benefit from an accurate method of prediction of collector efficiencies under conditions where repulsion exists. Two Ph.D. candidacies will be initiated with this project, and the career prospects of a Research Associate who also happens to be a single mom will be furthered by this project. Outreach to elementary school children will occur in the form of boat trips on the Great Salt Lake to provide hands-on inquiry-based exploration in partnership with scientists to explore the roles of particulates of all kinds in the stratified waters of the lake, e.g. from photosynthesis to contaminant scavenging and sedimentation.</AbstractNarration>
