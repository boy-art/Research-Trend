    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0804541&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Gloria Mari-Beffa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the PI proposes to research the existence of&lt;br/&gt;geometric realizations for nonlinear biHamiltonian PDEs and the&lt;br/&gt;implications of this existence for the biHamiltonian system and&lt;br/&gt;for the realizing manifold alike. In particular she intends to&lt;br/&gt;describe possible realizing manifolds and to link their geometry&lt;br/&gt;to the type of system they realize. In the past the PI has&lt;br/&gt;studied how biHamiltonian structures are generated by the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of curves in realizing manifolds. She also studied&lt;br/&gt;geometric realizations of equations of KdV type in Hermitian&lt;br/&gt;Symmetric manifolds, linking the projective character of&lt;br/&gt;differential invariants to equations of KdV-type. In this project&lt;br/&gt;she proposes to deepen this relation and to expand it to&lt;br/&gt;parabolic manifolds. In joint work with M. Eastwood she will be&lt;br/&gt;using tools in classical differential geometry to find projective&lt;br/&gt;structures on flows. Resolving this differential geometry problem&lt;br/&gt;will very likely create geometric realizations of KdV-type in&lt;br/&gt;parabolic manifolds. She will also investigate the possibility of&lt;br/&gt;a similar connection in other geometries, for example that of&lt;br/&gt;Schr√∂dinger, mKdV and sine-Gordon flows to Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Finally, in joint work with Calini and Ivey, the PI&lt;br/&gt;will study geometric and topological properties of solutions to&lt;br/&gt;realizations of soliton equations, in particular those&lt;br/&gt;corresponding to finite-gap solutions (periodic case). The study&lt;br/&gt;will try to link properties of these solutions to their spectral&lt;br/&gt;parameter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting an appropriate geometric background is often a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental step in the resolution of a problem. A choice of&lt;br/&gt;geometry establishes the properties and laws we wish to keep&lt;br/&gt;unchanged: Relativity (with Lorentzian geometry setting the&lt;br/&gt;interaction between space and time) and computer imaging (using&lt;br/&gt;projective geometry when 3D perspective needs to be preserved)&lt;br/&gt;are some of the best-known examples. But nowadays many engineers&lt;br/&gt;and physicists, including some groups working on data collection,&lt;br/&gt;consider a basic knowledge of differential geometry to be&lt;br/&gt;fundamental. Geometric thought is commonplace, as often finding&lt;br/&gt;the right choice of geometry for a problem is an initial step in&lt;br/&gt;its resolution - it all depends on how (or with which geometric&lt;br/&gt;eyes) you look at it -. BiHamiltonian nonlinear equations are&lt;br/&gt;very rich in structure and they are often used to model different&lt;br/&gt;types of phenomena. Their rich structure allows us to find a&lt;br/&gt;great deal of information about the system they model and to&lt;br/&gt;predict behavior. The best-known completely integrable systems&lt;br/&gt;are bi-Hamiltonian, and their solutions predict the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;fluids, from water waves in shallow water to the trailing&lt;br/&gt;vortices behind the wing tips of an airplane. These phenomena do&lt;br/&gt;not, in principle, exist within any given geometric&lt;br/&gt;background. When we find geometric realizations for a completely&lt;br/&gt;integrable system we gain information in two different ways: 1)&lt;br/&gt;We learn that the behavior of these phenomena can be visualized&lt;br/&gt;within a certain geometry, and we learn how to visualize it. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the same phenomena can be described in more than one&lt;br/&gt;geometry; 2) We learn that some geometries are hosts to phenomena&lt;br/&gt;that were not known to exist in that context before. For example,&lt;br/&gt;by linking projective and centro-equi-affine geometries, we can&lt;br/&gt;find evolutions of star-shaped curves that behave like solitary&lt;br/&gt;waves. The better we understand the relation between these two&lt;br/&gt;apparently unrelated subjects, the more we can transfer our&lt;br/&gt;extensive geometric knowledge, their connections and properties,&lt;br/&gt;to the understanding of completely integrable systems. And&lt;br/&gt;vice-versa.</AbstractNarration>
