    <AbstractNarration>This project involves a formal partnership to improve and positively impact the education of engineering technicians in an underdeveloped service area where recently announced economic development opportunities are creating 5,500-8,000 new jobs through a billion dollar industrial project. The partnership is a formal alliance of ten school districts; industry; a predominately minority technical college, a private Historically Black College or University (HBCU); and a publicly funded HBCU. The project also includes a State Department of Education (SDE) and the State Board for Technical and Comprehensive Education (SBTCE). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stated goal of the partnership is to increase both the number and diversity of students who enter and complete associate degrees in existing and emerging science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) cluster disciplines. It accomplishes the following objectives: (1) Increasing both the number and diversity of students entering associate degree programs in the computer engineering, instrumentation, and other engineering technology disciplines through the implementation and articulation of high school STEM cluster majors (programs of study); (2) Improving success rates and professional advancement opportunities for transitioning students from both high schools and industry through a formal articulated K-16 STEM career pathway and Bridge Program designed to provide transition courses in science, mathematics and engineering technology; (3) Improving postsecondary delivery of science, mathematics, and technology workplace skills, focusing on Mechatronics, Advanced Manufacturing, and Computer Technology; and (4) Improving employer satisfaction with graduates in core competencies and workplace skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is promoting access to STEM careers and provides courses for under prepared students, especially women and under represented minorities. Strategies include high school STEM career majors and STEM College Academies that build on national models, such as Project Lead the Way; middle school STEM exploration activities and summer camps, high school Individual Graduation Plans; program revision that includes secondary and postsecondary faculty and student cooperative projects and mentoring using a technology platform for remote equipment and process diagnostics and collaboration; faculty development; and broad industry involvement in curriculum development, internships and co-op opportunities, scholarships, and Foundation support.</AbstractNarration>
