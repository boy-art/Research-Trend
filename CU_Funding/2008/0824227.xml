    <AbstractNarration>After recent high profile failures, the spotlight has settled on the nation's aging infrastructure. The prevalent means of damage evaluation is a qualitative visual inspection which can identify some external but no internal damage. The goal of structural health monitoring is the determination of damage state, or "health," at any given time. Any damage increases local stresses as well as overall motion such that a structure is less likely to resist another abnormal event. Experimental studies can contribute to understanding progressive collapse resulting from this damage accumulation. The goal is to limit the total damage caused by all abnormal events as well as aging throughout the structure's lifetime, allowing more effective condition-based maintenance and increasing public safety. Longer term goals include in-field testing and required reinforcements. Future expansion areas include hazard resistance, non-destructive testing, and design revisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective is to synthesize research and educational activities through an experimental structural health program. The three project objectives are initiation of research on structural health management, creation of unique laboratory experiences for a diverse population, and further development of the PI as a role model for underrepresented groups. Through a laboratory-based research and educational plan, a cross-disciplinary vision exists for a practical research facility that doubles as an innovative classroom. Five currently active outreach programs will incorporate this project's activities to produce a positive scholastic impact on pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as educators and professionals. Considering diverse perspectives, every student can benefit from an experimental encounter with dynamics: the excitement of demolishing a structure is unfailing.</AbstractNarration>
