    <AbstractNarration>This project represents the final phase of a decade-long effort to experimentally determine if electrons have a non-spherical distribution of their electric charge. Such a charge asymmetry (known as an electric dipole moment) can arise from the same fundamental mechanisms responsible for the universe being composed of matter rather than antimatter. This project provides one of the few means to test theories of particle physics that can explain this basic fact of existence. The goal is to achieve sensitivity to the electron's electric dipole moment a factor of 2-3 better than previous experiments, and hence possibly observe this effect for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are primarily related to research training of the participants. Over its lifetime, this experiment has supported training of three postdoctoral researchers, four Ph.D. students, and ten undergraduate researchers, most of whom have remained active in research. This phase will support the final year of research for the last Ph.D. student on the project.</AbstractNarration>
