    <AbstractNarration>The project establishes scholarships for beginning undergraduate students with financial need who are majoring in biology, biochemistry, or chemistry. This project provides scholarships for the first two years of undergraduate study to three cohorts of 24 students each, serving a total of 72 individuals over four years. Recruitment is targeting matriculating high school students, with selection based on a combination of academic preparedness, including mathematics proficiency, and eligibility for need-based financial aid. Scholarship amounts range from $1,000 to $7,000 per academic year dependent upon the financial need of the recipient, with an average award of approximately $3,600 per year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cohort building includes having recipients co-enroll in class sections in each semester and attend a special "careers in sciences" seminar course during their sophomore year. In the careers course, students are given direction on career building activities, including connecting with academic support services, selection of research mentors, applying for internships, and exploring ethical issues in science. Students in the program meet regularly with graduate student mentors from their major area of study, who are available as tutors and role models, and they associate with research faculty through a mentoring program, organized lab tours, and social events. During their second year, FOCUS cohort members are assisted in connecting to opportunities available to juniors or seniors, such as scholarship opportunities, research experiences, and the UNT McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement program. The peer and mentor community connections extend beyond the scholarship period to provide continued academic and social support throughout the undergraduate degree program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed project includes bringing together a team of experienced educators and student service professionals to foster a cohort of undergraduate science majors. By building on existing programs at the university, the investigators are developing a sustainable program for the purpose of creating a peer community that encourages students to explore research opportunities and continue into a successful science career. This project is evaluating the effectiveness of cohort-building and mentoring activities on retention of participants in the biology, biochemistry, and chemistry majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this program include the development of a cohort model for student success that can be exported to other institutions. This scholarship program assists students from a wide variety of backgrounds in obtaining their bachelor's degree by providing needs-based financial assistance along with academic and social support in their first two years. An increase in recruitment and retention of science majors from diverse backgrounds benefits society by providing critical personnel for the advancement of science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
