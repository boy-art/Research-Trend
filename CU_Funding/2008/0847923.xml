    <AbstractNarration>The Harvard University Herbaria (HUH) is one of the largest and most active in the country. The vascular plant herbaria, containing over 3.6 million specimens, represent an exceptionally rich scientific resource. This project will focus on the reorganization and compactorization of these collections. Through the purchase and installation of compactorized storage units, the HUH will optimize its use of space and accommodate future growth, as well as reorganize its vascular collections. &lt;br/&gt;The HUH?s collection is heavily used by the scientific community, as documented by its many visitors, the high frequency of loan requests, and the large number of research publications that make use of HUH specimens. This project will improve both physical and intellectual access to the collections. With the collection near capacity, new compactorized shelving will improve storage conditions for the specimens and will facilitate future growth of the collection. These upgrades will improve the physical accessibility of the collections for faculty, students, and visiting scholars and will permit the creation of upgraded workspace. Reorganizing the collection based on the most up-to-date angiosperm classification will enable researchers to use the collections more meaningfully. Students will be employed in the project and will be trained in the practice of botanical curation. Outreach efforts will feature a museum exhibit highlighting the ways in which HUH collections are being used to study the pattern of species loss to climate change in New England.</AbstractNarration>
