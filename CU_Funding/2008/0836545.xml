    <AbstractNarration>The conference "Constitutive Properties of Biomaterials" at the University of Pittsburgh will be held under the auspices of the Society for Natural Philosophy in September 2008. Mechanics plays an important role in biology at every length scale, from molecular to tissue level. The complexity of cell microstructure and organic nature of living materials require new theoretical frameworks for design and interpretation of new classes of experiments. Behavior of biomaterials results from interactions of constituents on multiple length and time scales which cannot be treated by theories developed with traditional materials in mind. Recent advances in this field include development of more general continuum theories and derivation of average properties of structured materials from microscopic and molecular level considerations. The goal of this conference is to facilitate a fruitful interaction between the experts in experimental study of biomaterials on one hand and mathematical modeling and nonlinear continuum mechanics on the other. Particular emphasis will be placed on characterizing the response of biomaterials at the continuum level within the framework of finite elasticity and related theories and the development of new theories of mechanics of living matter that account for growth, aging and adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomechanics is a highly interdisciplinary scientific field that has already provided crucial contributions to understanding of human health, diseases, injuries and their treatment. Continued progress in this area will make it an integral part of health care delivery in the future. This conference contributes towards this goal by promoting the exchange of ideas in this important field and enabling new interdisciplinary collaborations that will advance understanding of the role of mechanics in biology. The conference also serves a vital educational purpose by promoting participation of students and junior researchers and exposing them to an exciting and rapidly developing interdisciplinary field that will become even more important in the future.</AbstractNarration>
