    <AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Electromagnetic Compatibility &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0855878 Missouri University of Science and Technology; Richard DuBroff&lt;br/&gt;0856085 University of Houston; Ji Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal concerns the formation of a new I/UCRC "Electromagnetic Compatibility" consisting of the Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST) and the University of Houston (UH). MST is the lead institution of the proposed Center, and proposes to add two additional sites (University of Oklahoma and Clemson University) in the next review cycle. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is an essential feature of virtually all high speed digital electronic assistants and home entertainment centers to essential control and information processing systems. EMC is the ability of these electronic systems to function reliably without causing interference to other electronic systems, being overly sensitive to weak signals generated by other electronic systems, and generating signals in one part of the system interfering with the operation of another part of the same system. The Center and its research activities will involve faculty, students and industrial representatives; and the industrial-focused research program will enhance the scientific understanding and help address a potentially significant health and environmental problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will encourage collaboration amongst the four institutions, and is committed to providing a skilled and diverse workforce in the area of EMC as required by industry. The research will expose students and faculty to state-of-the-art research projects of value to the industry. The close collaboration with various industry partners will help establish a strong research base to enable development of consumer electronics and control and information systems. The proposing institutions have a track record of increasing the participation of under-represented groups in research and education. In addition, the proposal emphasizes increased recruitment of students from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
