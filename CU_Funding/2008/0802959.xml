    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0802959&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project features a year-long, combined educational and&lt;br/&gt;research experience for a cohort of 9 to 12 students during each&lt;br/&gt;of the five project years. Participants are recruited from the&lt;br/&gt;institutions of the Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities (ACTC)&lt;br/&gt;and perform their coursework and research under the mentorship of&lt;br/&gt;faculty at the University of St. Thomas (UST) in St. Paul, MN and&lt;br/&gt;faculty at other ACTC institutions. Participants benefit from a&lt;br/&gt;course developed to support the learning and use of&lt;br/&gt;computationally intensive methods in mathematics and statistics. &lt;br/&gt;The cohort participates in a variety of workshops, seminars,&lt;br/&gt;conferences, and field trips. In small groups, cohort students&lt;br/&gt;contribute to research projects requiring the computational&lt;br/&gt;skills acquired in the course and share their progress with&lt;br/&gt;fellow students and project faculty. Students periodically&lt;br/&gt;present their results in the larger professional community. The&lt;br/&gt;intellectual merit of the project is the result of the following&lt;br/&gt;achievements. Students become proficient using computational&lt;br/&gt;methods and learn to apply this knowledge to perform research on&lt;br/&gt;problems whose solutions require the use of these methods. &lt;br/&gt;Through interaction with local academicians and industrialists,&lt;br/&gt;students see how their computation research methods are used in&lt;br/&gt;other areas of research and in real-world problems. The broader&lt;br/&gt;impact of the project is felt at four levels. At UST, students&lt;br/&gt;learn how to perform research using computational methods and&lt;br/&gt;faculty gain experience teaching a new course that emphasizes&lt;br/&gt;computational methods. On a larger level, these same impacts are&lt;br/&gt;realized by students and faculty at other ACTC institutions. &lt;br/&gt;Local industries that utilize computational methods benefit from&lt;br/&gt;graduates of ACTC schools who enjoy a high level of proficiency&lt;br/&gt;in scientific computation. Finally, student presentations and&lt;br/&gt;sponsored conferences promote to a national audience the&lt;br/&gt;innovative curricular elements developed and research&lt;br/&gt;advancements made by cohort members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Computing power continues to grow at an incredible rate. As&lt;br/&gt;a result, scientists can use the computer to create highly&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated models for use in solving complicated mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems. In addition, computational methods developed decades&lt;br/&gt;ago that were once intractable in practice due to the lack of&lt;br/&gt;computing facilities can now be employed to model and solve&lt;br/&gt;problems. It is imperative that undergraduate mathematics&lt;br/&gt;students at universities in the United States receive the&lt;br/&gt;training they need in order to make the utmost advantage of the&lt;br/&gt;world's ever-increasing computing resources and remain&lt;br/&gt;technologically competitive with scientists on a global level. &lt;br/&gt;Towards this end, mathematics and engineering faculty from the&lt;br/&gt;University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN and mathematics faculty&lt;br/&gt;from other institutions in the Associated Colleges of the Twin&lt;br/&gt;Cities engage undergraduate students in research groups under the&lt;br/&gt;auspices of the National Science Foundation's Computational&lt;br/&gt;Science Training for Undergraduates in the Mathematical Sciences&lt;br/&gt;program. For each of the next five years, a group of 9 to 12&lt;br/&gt;mathematics majors forms a cohort and participates in a year-long&lt;br/&gt;program to learn about computational methods used in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research and put the knowledge they have accrued to work as they&lt;br/&gt;join with faculty mentors to perform research on problems with&lt;br/&gt;applications to areas such as cancer treatment, image compression&lt;br/&gt;and analysis, tornadic storm detection, the behavior of thin&lt;br/&gt;films, and directed cell movement. Students visit local&lt;br/&gt;industries in the Twin Cities to further learn how scientific&lt;br/&gt;computing is used to solve real-world problems and present&lt;br/&gt;results of their work at national conferences. Students leave&lt;br/&gt;the program armed with both the tools required and experience&lt;br/&gt;necessary to continue work at a high level either in industry or&lt;br/&gt;graduate school on problems requiring an expertise in scientific&lt;br/&gt;computation. The project is supported by the MPS Division of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;Activities, and the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>
