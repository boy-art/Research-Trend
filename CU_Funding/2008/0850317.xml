    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing (a) scholarships to low-income, academically talented students in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discipline and (b) a robust student support system to ensure success. The program builds on the successful strategies and components of a prior Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEMS) supported program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: STEM scholarships allow students to reduce time devoted to employment and increase time available for studying. This translates into improved academic success and increased student retention, and transfer of a greater number of students to four-year institutions. Integrating scholarship recipients into the academic and professional development activities of the District's Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) programs provides opportunities for mentoring by faculty and academic counselors, as well as working professionals in the scientific and engineering disciplines. It also exposes scholarship recipients to opportunities to engage in mentored research and intern programs locally throughout the year and nationally during summers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The state has a high concentration of science and engineering jobs, and this project is providing students with skills to help fill those jobs. Financial support and professional development allow scholarship recipients to join the workforce in a timely manner as fully prepared scientists and engineers who can directly contribute to the American and global society. In addition, this project supports a large number of first-generation students and students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields and thus helps to increase the diversity of the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
