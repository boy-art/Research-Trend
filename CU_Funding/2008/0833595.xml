    <AbstractNarration>The Inland Northwest Community Access Network (TINCAN), the Puget Sound Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology (PSCTLT), and Reel Grrls (a community media center) are partnering to involve 6th and 7th grade middle school girls in science-focused after-school club activities in 10 schools in Seattle and Spokane, Washington. The Science Journalism Pathways to STEM Careers project is engaging girls in science journalism through information and communication technologies (ICT) to investigate and publish information about local science issues of interest to their communities. The ICT focus is video, multimedia, and the Internet. Girls are also conducting hands-on activities and interviewing STEM professionals to learn issue-related science content. The goals of the project are to (1) increase girls' ICT fluency, (2) increase girls' science literacy, (3) increase girls' interest in STEM careers, and (4) increase STEM content in non-science courses taught by social studies teachers who manage the after-school clubs.</AbstractNarration>
