    <AbstractNarration>The project will support the annual CEDAR workshop for the next three summers. Each year, approximately 300 scientists and students attend the CEDAR (Coupling, Energetic, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) workshop, a week-long meeting which features morning plenary sessions, individual workshops in the afternoons, and two poster sessions. Typically, about 100 students attend; the majority are graduate students but a small number of undergraduates (usually around 20) also participate. The CEDAR meeting begins with a day-long student workshop, organized by the two student members of the CEDAR Science Steering Committee. Subsequent days are devoted to the plenary sessions, afternoon workshops, and poster sessions. The plenary sessions include tutorial lectures and the CEDAR Prize Lecture which are videotaped for wide distribution. The afternoon workshops are organized and convened by members of the community: anyone can request a workshop several months before the meeting. The CEDAR Science Steering Committee receives the requests and allocates the meeting times and places. The afternoon workshops are one of the primary mechanisms for the community to initiate, plan, and undertake collaborative activities. An associated activity is the maintenance and operation of the CEDAR wiki, which provides access to the CEDAR database, community information, data services, documents, tools and models, and a forum. Overall, CEDAR is one of the primary means by which the aeronomy community educates and involves students, organizes its activities, and plans for its future.</AbstractNarration>
