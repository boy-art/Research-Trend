    <AbstractNarration>RE: Proposal 0824017&lt;br/&gt;Use of Novel Excitation Schemes for Resonant Microcantilevers in Liquid-Phase Sensing Applications.&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop efficient and highly sensitive resonant microcantilever sensors for liquid-phase (bio)chemical sensing applications by reducing fluid damping and effective fluid mass through proper design and, thus, improving the sensitivity and resolution of the sensor. The approach is to utilize optimal cantilever geometries and more general excitation characteristics. Specifically, the lateral bending mode will be investigated. The use of in-plane rather than out-of-plane forces demonstrates how the intelligent control of electromechanical load characteristics may be used to drastically enhance performance, even in liquids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies in a more fundamental understanding of the coupling between a vibrating microstructure (cantilever beam) and the surrounding fluid. The developed analytical models will ultimately guide the design of more efficient microsensors, not only for the bio-chemical sensing applications targeted here, but for resonant sensors operating in a non-vacuum environment in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact stems from the availability of the improved cantilever-based sensing platforms as a sensing platform for liquid-phase (bio)chemical sensing and as an educational tool coupling device physics, state-of-the-art microfabrication, sensor technology and systems engineering. On the sensing system side, a performance improvement of up to two orders of magnitude in the liquid phase could be truly transformative, enabling the development of novel handheld sensing systems for applications spanning environmental monitoring, detection of hazardous compounds, and medical diagnosis. On the educational side, cantilevers represent one of the simplest microstructures and are thus ideally suited for graduate and undergraduate student training and K-12 outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>
