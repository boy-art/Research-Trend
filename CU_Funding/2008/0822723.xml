    <AbstractNarration>This STTR Phase II research project develops a circular chemical separation system on a small (~1 inch x 1 inch) chip. This chip and the associated instrument will separate complex mixtures for biological, chemical, medical, and industrial applications. Based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)-driven liquid flow, liquid chromatographic (LC) separations will be accomplished in a circular, closed-loop format. Typically, LC separations require a sample containing multiple analytes to flow in a single direction along a fixed-length, linear column with detection performed after the analytes elute from the column. In the circular LC system, miniaturization is possible because samples are instead circulated around a closed-loop chromatographic column thus, the effective column length is not limited to small chip dimensions. Very few methods can provide the mobile-phase pumping in a closed-loop that is required for practical application of circular LC. The MHD-based circular LC system envisioned will be small, portable, and designed for laboratory as well as field use. The sealed LC chip will contain the stationary phase, mobile phase, and all in situ MHD pumps needed to conduct the separation of complex samples. This prototype LC instrument will be designed and fabricated with a built-in fluorescence detector for monitoring analyte separation directly on the chromatographic column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are highlighted by the ability of the proposed circular separation system to miniaturize a valuable analytical tool, liquid chromatography (LC). Samples of interest include human blood serum, saliva, and urine, with component analytes of interest that are equally diverse (e.g. proteins, pharmaceuticals, and small molecular biomarkers). Many analytes in these complex mixtures have similar properties and cannot be separated and analyzed using a very short chromatographic column, which has limited the miniaturization of this important analytical tool. This limitation is overcome using circular LC, where the effective column length is not limited by the small chip sizes that are essential for portable LC instrumentation. SFC Fluidics' core technology makes possible the miniaturized, closed-loop pumping required for implementation. This method has broad implications for the portable LC systems for field deployment or point-of-care applications. The market opportunity is expected to be significant, particularly when considering that applicability extends beyond the traditional instrumentation market into the worldwide point-of-care diagnostics market.</AbstractNarration>
