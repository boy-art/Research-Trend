    <AbstractNarration>PI Wagner&lt;br/&gt;Proposal IOS # 0818116&lt;br/&gt;Effects of predation by a phonotactic parasitoid on male and female&lt;br/&gt;reproductive behavior in a field cricket&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Females often prefer to mate with males that produce extravagant signals. Signals that increase a male's probability of attracting a female, however, can also increase the probability of attracting predators. Relatively little is know about the effect of predation on the evolution of male and female mating behavior. In the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, females prefer male songs that contain faster and longer chirps. These song types, however, are also more likely to attract phonotactic parasitoid flies (Ormia ochracea). The flies deposit larvae on singing males, the larvae burrow into the cricket and feed for ten days, then the larvae emerge from the cricket and pupate, killing the cricket. Because the flies prefer the same song types as female crickets, preferred males have a higher risk of fly predation. In addition, females experience a greater risk of fly predation when they are near preferred males, and they likely experience a greater risk of fly predation when they mate with multiple males. This project will examine the effect of fly predation on the evolution of male and female reproductive behavior. Specifically, it will compare seven cricket populations attacked by the flies and seven cricket populations that are not attacked by the flies. Behavioral measures in the two populations will include male singing behavior, female responses to male song, female repeated and multiple mating, male-provided direct benefits, and the reliability of male signals of benefit quality. All crickets tested will be reared in the common environment of the laboratory, which will ensure that any detected differences between parasitized and non-parasitized populations are genetically based. This study will provide unique information on the factors that affect the evolution of male and female reproductive behavior. Broader impacts: Field work will be conducted at several protected reserves and biological field stations. The project will provide research training for at least four undergraduate students per year.</AbstractNarration>
