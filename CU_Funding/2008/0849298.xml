    <AbstractNarration>The plant specific transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) is a master regulator of the vital switch from vegetative to reproductive development. It has a second role in patterning of the reproductive structures, the flowers. Despite its central role in the organism, the direct events set in motion by this transcription factor are as yet poorly understood. Two general approaches will be taken to address this problem. One is a genetic analysis of the biological role of direct LFY targets the investigators previously identified using expression arrays. This study will reveal the regulatory logic connecting known components of the network downstream of LFY. The second approach will use sensitive genomic LFY binding studies to identify missing targets of LFY during the switch to reproductive development and in flower patterning. In addition to advancing our understanding of the events set in motion by LFY in these two processes, this approach will define the binding motif of this master transcription factor with great precision and thus may reveal new roles of LFY. Finally, by comparing LFY binding and activity at two developmental stages (during the switch to reproduction and during flower patterning), this study will provide first evidence as to how LFY activity is regulated during development. Conclusions derived from these experiments will provide much needed insight into a fundamental developmental switch and key patterning events in Arabidopsis. Based on the conserved role of LFY, these findings will likely also contribute to understanding of the onset of reproduction in other flowering plants. This knowledge is of high potential importance for agriculture, plant breeding, and biofuel production. In addition, an important aspect of this project is mentoring and training of students as well as outreach to local schools.</AbstractNarration>
