    <AbstractNarration>The 2009 ACS Stimuli-Responsive Polymeric Materials Symposium will be held August 16-20, 2009, in Washington D.C. during the 238th ACS National Meeting &amp; Exposition. Stimuli-responsive polymeric materials is a multidisciplinary research field involving chemistry, material science, physics, biological science, and engineering. The purpose of this symposium is to bring together scientists working in this diverse and fast-growing research field to share their important and exciting research advances through oral presentations, posters, and face-to-face communication. This symposium will emphasize new chemistry to synthesize, new strategies to formulate, new tools to characterize, and new theories/models to understand the stimuli-responsive polymeric materials, as well as new devices made of such materials including sensors, actuators, and smart drug delivery systems. A number of prominent researchers worldwide from academia and industry will be invited to present their cutting-edge research topics and discuss the potential opportunities and grand challenges in this field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation of young researchers, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, as well as women and those from underrepresented minority groups, will be strongly encouraged. If successful, this symposium will help to (1) identify various new strategies to develop novel stimuli-responsive polymers; (2) stimulate new applications of such materials; (3) strengthen interdisciplinary research; and (4) train the new-generation researchers in this diverse field.</AbstractNarration>
