    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to Professor Bradford B. Wayland of Temple University focuses on the development of organo-metal mediated living radical polymerization (LRP), the preparation of new classes of homo and block copolymer materials, and the self assembly of block copolymers into nanostructured materials. Organo-cobalt porphyrin complexes mediate the highly precise LRP of monomers to form low polydispersity homo-polymers and block copolymers. The self-assembly of block copolymers in both solution and the solid state is utilized in forming nanoscale, structured materials with uses in electronics, photonics, and drug delivery. These applications have the potential to impact the economy, the environment, and society. Graduate and undergraduate students participate in the research and their experiences vary from the fundamental design and synthesis of catalysts and polymer materials to the evaluation of practical applications in collaboration with material scientists, engineers, and technologists.</AbstractNarration>
