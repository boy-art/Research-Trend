    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Romeel Dave' (University of Arizona) will carry out a theoretical study of feedback tomography using state of the art hydrodynamic simulations that dynamically incorporate outflows and sophisticated chemical evolution. Building on highly successful models of cosmic-scale galactic outflows, this program will focus on the environs of galaxies to better understand the complex interplay between inflows, outflows, and ambient gas in and around galactic halos. A primary goal will be to connect observable absorption-line tracers with physical properties of the gas such as kinematics, density, temperature, and metallicity. Through careful comparisons of models with available and forthcoming data, a cosmologically framed scenario will be developed for how mass, metals, and energy cycle in and out of galaxies. Implications will be investigated for how such cycling jointly establishes key properties of the inter-galactic medium and galaxies across cosmic time. Additionally, avenues will be explored for improving and optimizing the modeling of outflows on large scales within current codes, using carefully constrained test problems. Through this multi-faceted effort, the understanding of galactic outflows and their impact on galaxy properties will be greatly advanced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a part of this work Dr. Dave' will produce an educational movie on the principles of galaxy formation, with a focus on how observations and simulations work together to increase our understanding of galaxy formation. This pedagogical tool, which will be designed to be used in classrooms or viewed as a stand-alone film, will be used to help spur interest in the increasingly important subfield of extragalactic astronomy, both among teachers and the general public. In addition, Dr. Dave' will help develop and conduct an astronomy study abroad program in Ghana for advanced undergraduates from the United States and Africa. The program will teach basic concepts of extragalactic astronomy in the first week, and then teach students to utilize online observational and simulation databases to ask and answer questions about current problems in galaxy formation.</AbstractNarration>
