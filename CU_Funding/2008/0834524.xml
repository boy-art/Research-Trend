    <AbstractNarration>Modern medical devices are often complex distributed systems. They require substantial embedded software and exhibit feedback loops between their components that involve multiple humans, such as caregivers, doctors, and patients. Such systems need to be flexible enough to accommodate significant uncertainty in their environments, such as varying and often unpredictable reactions of patients to treatments and medications. As with many other complex systems, the increasingly prominent trend is to assemble medical devices from independently developed hardware and software components. To accommodate this trend and simultaneously maintain the high degree of confidence that is required of medical systems, research is needed in the area of active components.&lt;br/&gt;The idea of an active component extends traditional components with novel capabilities that support compositional reasoning to improve interoperability. The basic concept of an active component is that the component carries a self-model that can be used by its peers, which specifies the intended and failure behaviors that peers can expect and the behavior it assumes from peers.&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing active components as a compositional framework for medical device software and systems (MDSS), and applies active components to model and analyze the environmental aspects of MDSS, to anticipate expected and unexpected interactions, and to compare mental models and systems models to detect and prevent potential user errors. In particular, the active component framework will be applied to establish high confidence in MD PnP (Medical Device Plug-and-Play) interoperability, an on-going effort targeting dynamic integration of medical devices. The project also seeks to apply, evaluate, and refine the notion of active components by using them for new advanced medical device systems where compositionality and interoperability are essential, such as medical devices based on sensor networks.</AbstractNarration>
