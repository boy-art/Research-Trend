    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to investigate methods of thermal packaging of electronic circuits that will provide an improved thermal path for heat removal from a power semiconductor device, thermal isolation between heat-generating components and other components on the circuit that may be heat-sensitive, and will perform these tasks at a lower cost than all-metal packages which are in common use. The approach is to use a 3-D printer in conjunction with metal inserts to fabricate a structure that will provide a metal heat path surrounded by a plastic enclosure. The plastic will provide thermal insulation between components and the mechanical structure to mount the circuit and provide the I/O connections to the outside. The proposed structure is directly translatable to production be using injection molding to form the structure at a much lower cost than forming a metal package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to devise a package that will provide a low-cost package for power devices with improved thermal characteristics and to learn from a practical standpoint how heat flows in an electronic circuit and how it affects the performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposal is both for direct and indirect reasons. There will be a direct cost impact on many high-volume and commonly used products. For example, automobiles and household products use power electronic circuits. Indirectly, engineering students will receive cross-training that will translate to other applications outside the realm of this project. This is a very practical project with almost immediate results. The relationship between research and application will become evident to the students.</AbstractNarration>
