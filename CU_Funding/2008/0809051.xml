    <AbstractNarration>The mission of the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) is to provide independent assistance to Federal agencies and the Nation on issues in the atmospheric and climate sciences. The BASC strives to advance understanding of atmospheric science, meteorology, and climate; foster application of this knowledge to benefit the public; help ensure that U.S. research programs are responsive to scientific opportunities and the needs of the Nation; and help make scientific information more useful in government planning and decision-making. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BASC has worked extensively to ensure discussion of climate issues remained visible. For 2008-2011, it will continue to plan activities where objective, independent discussion and analysis are needed. Areas include severe weather, scientific understanding of climate change and impacts (especially at different scales), observation systems, and additional topics as requested. The BASC will seek opportunities to use its role as a neutral, independent body to encourage open discussion of issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an extensive network of volunteers, the BASC brings diverse scientific perspectives together in service to national needs. BASC strives to enhance understanding of atmosphere and climate, provide independent views on U.S. research efforts, and ensure that experts are involved in government decision-making. The Board is able to ask the "best and brightest" to volunteer their time and these volunteers are the intellectual force behind all the Board's work. Participants are selected to bring a diversity of expertise and experience; they are broad thinkers who can both react to requests for assistance and look ahead to anticipate issues. The Board has a reputation for objectivity, careful analysis, and commitment to our fields of science. Based on the rigorous processes of the National Academies, the BASC provides information of value to both the science community and government decision makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BASC does not conduct primary research, but works instead to ensure that the atmospheric and climate sciences have broad impact on society. Through its work, the BASC increases understanding of issues at the forefront of national discussion. Understanding of these issues directly affects the Nation's environmental policies, energy choices, manufacturing decisions, construction codes, agricultural methods, and even human health. The BASC activities serve the science community, federal and state decision makers, educators, and the public and are disseminated widely. Activities involve a diverse range of people, with thought given to gender, ethnicity, age, geography, and institutional diversity.</AbstractNarration>
