    <AbstractNarration>This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented but financially needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures and programs. Student scholars are enrolled in one of three disciplines that support the minerals industry, namely geological engineering, metallurgical engineering, or mining engineering. The students are being recruited through a network of secondary teachers previously established by the university, the Bright Prisms. The teachers are working in low-income districts and a significant number of these districts are tribal schools. The three main student support components of the project are a summer bridge program designed to demonstrate careers in the minerals industry, establishment of learning communities on campus for the scholars, and faculty mentoring. Students are also being strongly encouraged to participate in summer internships in the minerals industry during their undergraduate years.</AbstractNarration>
