    <AbstractNarration>Quantum Control of Impurity States in a Semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;Brage Golding and Mark Dykman&lt;br/&gt;Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;E. Lansing, MI 48824&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information is a new and rapidly developing interdisciplinary area of research&lt;br/&gt;that resides at the interface between quantum physics and information science. It&lt;br/&gt;addresses some of the most challenging fundamental problems in science and technology&lt;br/&gt;while seeking to advance our understanding of the unique properties of the quantum&lt;br/&gt;world. Among the predictions in this field is that of an exponential speedup of computers&lt;br/&gt;that operate on purely quantum principles. If quantum properties are to be exploited for&lt;br/&gt;qualitatively new capabilities, it is necessary to build systems that exhibit long-lived,&lt;br/&gt;controllable quantum states. In addition, the devices should be compatible with&lt;br/&gt;conventional electronics and photonics. The devices based on controlled impurity states&lt;br/&gt;in semiconductors stand out as particularly attractive, since they should be scalable,&lt;br/&gt;operate at high speed, and take advantage of existing semiconductor technology.&lt;br/&gt;The quantum systems studied in this experimental and theoretical research are based on&lt;br/&gt;acceptors in a semiconductor such as silicon. These are substitutional dopants, whose&lt;br/&gt;atomic-like properties are well-known and invariant. The two states of a qubit are the&lt;br/&gt;lowest orbital states of the acceptor, a result of splitting of the ground state by strain and&lt;br/&gt;electric field. The distance between the energy levels is in the range of a few GHz and&lt;br/&gt;each qubit is individually controlled by a gate electrode. Single-qubit operations can be&lt;br/&gt;performed with short microwave pulses whereas two-qubit operations are enabled by the&lt;br/&gt;long-range dipolar interaction between the acceptors, which allows the qubit-qubit&lt;br/&gt;distance to be more than 100 nm. The readout of the final state of the system is based on&lt;br/&gt;quantum nondemolition optical measurement of light scattering by an exciton bound to&lt;br/&gt;the acceptor.</AbstractNarration>
