    <AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Minimum Sobolev Norm Methods&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this research project is to design fast and accurate&lt;br/&gt;numerical algorithms for the solution of large classes of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;equations that arise in engineering and science. In particular, the&lt;br/&gt;main concerns are the solution of integro-differential equations on&lt;br/&gt;complex domains and of signal and image processing problems. The&lt;br/&gt;approach is based on formulating the estimate of the solution of the&lt;br/&gt;equation at a point as the value of the smoothest solution (on&lt;br/&gt;average) at that point based on the given data. The resulting discrete&lt;br/&gt;equations can be shown to have specially structured matrices, which&lt;br/&gt;can be exploited to create fast solvers for these equations. The&lt;br/&gt;resulting methods have two main computational advantages. First, they&lt;br/&gt;can be designed to avoid gridding or triangulation of the complex&lt;br/&gt;domain. Second, these methods exhibit local convergence; that is, the&lt;br/&gt;rate at which the approximant converges to the solution at a point&lt;br/&gt;depends only on the local smoothness of the solution. These advantages&lt;br/&gt;enable the method to tackle equations with complicated singularity&lt;br/&gt;structures with relative ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let Hs denote a Sobolev Hilbert space whose elements have s &gt; 1&lt;br/&gt;fractional derivatives. Suppose an unknown function f in Hs satisfies&lt;br/&gt;the equation L(F) = g, where L is a linear operator and g is a known&lt;br/&gt;function. Let Ln denote n linear functionals on Hr. Let q denote a&lt;br/&gt;linear functional on Hs. Then the best minmax estimate for q(f) can be&lt;br/&gt;computed from the minimum Sobolev norm function p in Hs that satisfies&lt;br/&gt;the constraints Ln(L(p)) = Ln(g). This p can be computed very rapidly&lt;br/&gt;since the optimal p is given by a nice set of equations that has Fast&lt;br/&gt;Multipole Method (FMM) structure when written in the proper&lt;br/&gt;representation. Also, it is possible to work with Lp Sobolev spaces&lt;br/&gt;with p = 1. In these cases the optimization problem is more&lt;br/&gt;complicated and can be reduced to linear programming problems, for&lt;br/&gt;which fast solvers are being developed that exploit the underlying FMM&lt;br/&gt;structure of the constraint matrix. The theoretical work consists of&lt;br/&gt;studying the convergence of the solution as n gets bigger, and also in&lt;br/&gt;proving the FMM structure of the resulting discrete equations. The&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic work consists of designing fast algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;constructing the FMM representation and then designing fast algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for the direct (non-iterative) solution of these equations. The&lt;br/&gt;application work consists of applying these ideas to image&lt;br/&gt;segmentation and multi-rate signal processing. Also, mesh free,&lt;br/&gt;locally convergent schemes are being developed for the solution of&lt;br/&gt;integral equations and elliptic partial differential equations on&lt;br/&gt;complex domains in two dimensions.</AbstractNarration>
