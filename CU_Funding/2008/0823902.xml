    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop novel pathogen diagnostic systems by integrating biomolecular self-assembly, capacitance spectroscopy, and microfluidics into single lab-on-chip. The approach is that the array of antibody nanotubes, incorporating antibodies for target pathogens on nanotubes, captures pathogens and the capacitance change of the nanotube between electrodes will detect and identify the strain of pathogen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed lab-on-chip system could enable rapid detection of contaminating microorganisms with small sample volume utilizing the protein nanotube technology combined with antibodies specific for targeted organisms. The effort will contribute to advances in pathogen sensing and diagnostics by the development of a highly sensitive, selective, reproducible, and false-positive-free detection platform of pathogens in the detection limit of a single cell level. This ultra-compact lab-on-chip diagnostic tool could also be useful for point-of-care applications in remote clinical laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This research has broader social impact on health care and homeland security since harmful pathogens can be detected and identified by the proposed lab-on-chip instantaneously with fewer false-positive signals. The educational broader impact is extends to local high school students in New York City, many of them are from underrepresented groups, to prepare for serious scientific carrier through the proposed educational outreach program. The investigators will also engage in educating local school teachers and K-12 students by leveraging an existing program.</AbstractNarration>
