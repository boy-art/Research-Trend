    <AbstractNarration>Symbolic Software for Conservation Laws of Multi-Dimensional &lt;br/&gt;Continuous and Discrete Nonlinear Equations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Willy Hereman and Michael Colagrosso&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the project is to create mathematical methods, algorithms, &lt;br/&gt;and symbolic software for the computation of conservation laws of nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;models from the applied sciences and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research concerns nonlinear partial differential equations &lt;br/&gt;in multi-dimensions, nonlinear differential-difference equations and &lt;br/&gt;fully-discretized lattices.&lt;br/&gt;Using differential-geometric tools and techniques from the calculus of &lt;br/&gt;variations, the algorithms are straightforward to implement in computer &lt;br/&gt;algebra languages and the software will be easy to use by non-experts. &lt;br/&gt;Potential users are researchers concerned with conserved quantities and&lt;br/&gt;integrability of nonlinear equations that arise in soliton theory, &lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems, control theory, and mathematical physics. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, the software will gain insight in reaction-diffusion&lt;br/&gt;models, population and molecular dynamics, nonlinear networks, and &lt;br/&gt;chemical reactions.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to its use in research, the software will serve as an educational&lt;br/&gt;tool for courses in nonlinear wave phenomena in fluid dynamics, &lt;br/&gt;plasma physics, electrical circuits, quantum chemistry, bio-genetics, &lt;br/&gt;and nonlinear optics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An essential part of the project is the development of homotopy operator&lt;br/&gt;methods to handle the needed integration and summation by parts on jet &lt;br/&gt;spaces.&lt;br/&gt;In view of their versatile applicability, fast algorithms and stand-alone &lt;br/&gt;packages will be developed for continuous and discrete homotopy operators.&lt;br/&gt;Adhering to a calculus-based approach, the generalization of the algorithms &lt;br/&gt;to integro-differential equations and delay differential equations will be &lt;br/&gt;pursued. &lt;br/&gt;New mathematical techniques are expected to come from these explorations in &lt;br/&gt;uncharted terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research fosters collaboration between mathematicians and computer&lt;br/&gt;scientists, creating novel mathematics and quality software, as well as&lt;br/&gt;producing students with good software engineering skills. &lt;br/&gt;The software development process, including design, development, and testing,&lt;br/&gt;combines the strengths of undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty. &lt;br/&gt;The comprehensive software packages are envisioned to have a wide impact &lt;br/&gt;with pure and applied mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and others &lt;br/&gt;interested in the analysis of nonlinear equations, enhancing the &lt;br/&gt;productivity of researchers in several domains.</AbstractNarration>
