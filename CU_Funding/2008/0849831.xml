    <AbstractNarration>The S-STATSMODEL (Scholarships in Statistics and Stochastic Modeling) program is designed to increase the number of academically talented but financially disadvantaged students who complete graduate degrees in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics. Need-based scholarships are awarded each year for up to two years to a cohort of three to four students who would otherwise be unable to attend graduate school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The graduate program in Statistics and Stochastic Modeling is a relatively new program that has been extremely successful academically and also in attracting and retaining financially disadvantaged students, particularly those from minority groups such as Hispanics and Latinos. At least 50% of the current graduate student body belongs to financially disadvantaged groups, and about 60% of these students are from minority groups. This project contributes to increasing the number of highly qualified professionals with degrees in the areas of Statistics and Applied Mathematical Modeling. The excellence of the teaching and research done by the faculty and students is evidenced by several facts. First, all of the graduate students who have received SSM degrees in the past have been very successful in securing well recognized academic, government or industry positions. In addition, faculty members have received awards for their excellent teaching and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project attracts academically talented and financially disadvantaged students from minority groups that represent a largely untapped source of talent in the areas of Statistics and Applied Mathematics. Such students bring ideas and perspectives that are not well represented by the current population of professionals. For example, statisticians belonging to minority, underrepresented or financially disadvantaged groups can help improve the design, analysis and disclosure of critical research, as well as lend credibility to scientific studies that directly relate to their communities of origin.</AbstractNarration>
