    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is the understanding and development of a novel three-dimensional (3D) quantized semiconductor laser active layer design called the nanopore. The approach is to create the inverse of a quantum dot structure using a layer of lower energy material "a quantum well" that is perforated and has imbedded in it bits of higher bandgap material that are small enough and close enough together to introduce 3D quantization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;While conventional quantum dots can show very strong quantization effects, the dots are often sparse, weakly coupled, irregularly distributed, and variable in size. The nanopore structure addresses all of these issues and introduces additional intermediate design freedom "pore pattern and geometry" unavailable in other approaches. There is also evidence of some unexpected behavior in these structures, including a forbidden energy gap within the conduction and valence bands, which will be explored. The presence of an energy gap offers intriguing potential for terahertz frequency generation and emission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Carefully controlled 3D quantized behavior in semiconductor structures is critical to future nanoscale electronic and photonic devices. Therefore the success of this program can have transformative impact on the critical fields of electronic and photonic integrated circuits and systems. There is substantial involvement of undergraduates in this work, targeted toward the participation of underrepresented groups and a plan to "teach the teacher" involving at least one middle school teacher in this program each year to learn about research and develop lesson plans for their students.</AbstractNarration>
