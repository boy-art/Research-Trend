    <AbstractNarration>Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been extensively researched as a promising alternative to single atoms for the study of quantum physics and development of quantum technology. In this research program the PI will use photonic crystal structures to modify and enhance QD properties, allowing coherent interactions between a QD and a photon field. Such interactions are essential elements of photonic quantum information processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The PI aims to design, fabricate, and optically characterize nanophotonic devices to coherently control and probe the quantum mechanical wavefunction of quantum dots on ultra-fast timescales. The devices will be composed of photonic crystal cavity-waveguide structures that have the ability to localize light to within a cubic wavelength. This localization creates strong interactions between a QD and an optical field, which will be used to investigate opto-electronic devices with improved performance, study basic physical properties of QDs, and create entanglement between QDs and photons. In addition, QD-photon entanglement will be studied as a method for creating optical interconnects between spatially separated QDs to develop integrated quantum devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The proposed research will help develop new fundamental concepts in the control of semiconductor nanostructures at the quantum level, as well as coherent light-matter interactions. The proposal also includes an extensive educational outreach effort. The PI has recently developed an undergraduate summer internship program which enables University of Maryland students to participate in leading research. He will expand this program to include local high school students.</AbstractNarration>
