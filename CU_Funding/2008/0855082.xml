    <AbstractNarration>The supported program of research is in the area of theoretical physics with an emphasis on nuclear physics, neutrino physics, and astrophysics. Theoretical research in these areas is chosen to have a close coupling with the ongoing experimental programs in the United States and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutrinos, very weakly interacting particles, are produced copiously in certain nuclear reactions, including some taking place in astrophysical sites. Many unanswered questions of contemporary science such as the origin of elements, lack of antimatter in the Universe, and the nature of the dark matter, invisible to direct optical observations, may find answers through a better understanding of neutrinos. The proposed work aims at a better understanding the properties of neutrinos and the role they play in the Cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research contributes to the support of national priorities in nuclear science such as the proposed Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams. The principal investigator participates in multidisciplinary research activities that connect particle, nuclear, condensed-matter physics and astrophysics. He is also involved in exposing physics to broader audiences and in a large number of outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
