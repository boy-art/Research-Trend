    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act&lt;br/&gt;of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Earth's climate is warming at a pace and &lt;br/&gt;magnitude unprecedented in recent times, with profound (but not easily&lt;br/&gt;predicted) consequences for terrestrial ecology and hydrology. Carbon&lt;br/&gt;isotopic signatures are an important tool for geologists studying&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial environmental change on long time scales. However, carbon&lt;br/&gt;isotopic signatures can vary widely and work on modern plants reveals &lt;br/&gt;both environment and community composition can be equally significant&lt;br/&gt;influences. Although secular carbon isotope variations of atmospheric &lt;br/&gt;carbon dioxide are certainly transferred into ancient plant carbon, &lt;br/&gt;and thus soil carbon, so also are ecophysiological differences (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;phylogeny, leaf habit, water use)that modulate carbon isotope &lt;br/&gt;fractionation between plant biomass and carbon dioxide and as well &lt;br/&gt;as carbon from other inputs such as microbes or weathered carbon. Work&lt;br/&gt;supported by this grant will evaluate the relative importance of &lt;br/&gt;environment versus community composition as major mechanisms controlling &lt;br/&gt;carbon isotope values and molecular signatures of terrestrial plant &lt;br/&gt;inputs in the ancient soils and terrestrial sediments in the Paleocene&lt;br/&gt;and Eocene of the Bighorn Basin (WY, USA) across both short term (PETM) &lt;br/&gt;and more protracted (Eocene) global warming.</AbstractNarration>
