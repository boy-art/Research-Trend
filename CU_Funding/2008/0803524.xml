    <AbstractNarration>Data provenance is a fundamental issue in the processing of scientific &lt;br/&gt;information and beyond. Two lines of research have been pursued in &lt;br/&gt;recent years with direct bearing on the issues of data provenance. In &lt;br/&gt;one of them, provenance in workflows, the emphasis is on extracting &lt;br/&gt;provenance from logs of events marking the execution of different &lt;br/&gt;modules to various intial and derived datasets. In the other line of &lt;br/&gt;research, provenance in databases, the emphasis is on the propagation of &lt;br/&gt;provenance through the operators that make up database views, or on &lt;br/&gt;propagation of provenance through copy/cut-and-paste operations within &lt;br/&gt;and among databases. These two bodies of work employ different &lt;br/&gt;techniques and at first glance their results appear quite different. &lt;br/&gt;However, in many scientific applications, database manipulations &lt;br/&gt;co-exist with the execution of workflow modules, and the provenance of &lt;br/&gt;the resulting data should integrate both kinds of processing into a &lt;br/&gt;usable paradigm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By analyzing the work on data provenance in workflows and in databases, &lt;br/&gt;the PIs identify what they believe are the main difficulties in unifying &lt;br/&gt;and integrating these two different kinds of data provenance:&lt;br/&gt;(1) the lack of a data model that is rich enough to capture the &lt;br/&gt;interaction between the structure of the data and the structure of the &lt;br/&gt;workflow; and&lt;br/&gt;(2) the lack of a high-level specification framework in which database &lt;br/&gt;operators and workflow modules can be treated uniformly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PIs aim to overcome these difficulties and thus &lt;br/&gt;provide concepts and tools that allow a truly comprehensive approach to &lt;br/&gt;the provenace of scientific data. The project's approach relies on a &lt;br/&gt;data model that supports nested collections and on a functional language &lt;br/&gt;approach to workflow specification. Based on this, the project aims to &lt;br/&gt;deliver a framework and tools for defining, managing and querying data &lt;br/&gt;provenance in complex&lt;br/&gt;scientific workflows that include database manipulations. The project is &lt;br/&gt;expected to impact bioinformatics (through interdisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;collaborations in the Penn Center for Bioinformatics and the Penn Genome &lt;br/&gt;Frontiers Institute) and phyloinformatics (through contributions to the &lt;br/&gt;NSF AToL program) as well as ongoing standardization work on provenance &lt;br/&gt;in workflows and in the business processes (eg., BPEL) community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project are disseminated as publications, through &lt;br/&gt;direct collaborations and through the project website: &lt;br/&gt;http://db.cis.upenn.edu/research/UNIPROVE.html.</AbstractNarration>
