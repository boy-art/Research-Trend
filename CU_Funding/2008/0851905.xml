    <AbstractNarration>The Duke University REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2012. Ten students will be selected each year to participate in an intensive 10-week research program in "Mechanisms of Behavior". The program provides an emphasis on integrative, systems, and behavioral neuroscience. The focus on the study of animal learning and behavior unifies faculty research interests within this interdisciplinary field and serves as the common theme for the individual projects available to student participants in the program. The program is designed to provide opportunities for highly qualified individuals, including women, minority, and disabled undergraduate students who would like to expand their laboratory skills. Each summer, undergraduate students will participate in the research program that includes a one-on-one mentorship with a participating faculty member. In addition, three weekly seminar series including "Research in the Neurosciences", "Science Basics", and "Science Ethics and Practice" will serve to integrate the individual laboratory experience. The primary goal of the program is to provide opportunities for undergraduates to receive training in the cutting-edge methodologies of behavioral neuroscience and genomics. Mentors for the program are prominent researchers in their fields and have substantial experience in supervising and training undergraduates. The students will work on research projects that are within their grasp, and which present real opportunities for new discoveries that will be of value to the neuroscience community. Additional information can be found at http://unp.aas.duke.edu/research/mob.php, or by containing the Program Director, Dr. Warren H. Meck at 919-660-5765 or meck@psych.duke.edu.</AbstractNarration>
