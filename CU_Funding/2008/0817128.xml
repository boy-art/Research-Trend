    <AbstractNarration>A central form of human knowledge is generic knowledge, that is, general information about categories, from animals to numbers, from celestial objects to machines, from economic systems to social systems. Human progress is marked by a search for understanding principles that apply broadly across varying instances within a category. A fundamental means of expressing general knowledge to children is via language, and in particular generic noun phrases (e.g., "Insects are 6-legged"). Prior work has demonstrated that generic noun phrases are frequent in parental speech to children, used in diverse cultural and linguistic contexts (U.S., China, Peru), produced by children exposed to minimal linguistic input (deaf children not exposed to sign language), understood appropriately by preschool-aged children, and stored by children in long-term memory. These component pieces all suggest that generics are important, meaningful, acquired early, and have the potential to influence children's world knowledge. However, prior work on generics leaves two major questions unanswered: (1) Does generic language affect and guide children's concepts, or does generic language merely reflect children's concepts? (2) What is the process by which generic language is acquired in childhood? The project will investigate both these core issues. An in-depth training study will teach young children a new concept under varied wording conditions to chart the effects of generics and labeling on children's categorical reasoning. Furthermore, a set of experiments will test competing claims regarding the process by which generics are learned. These studies will make use of experimental research and naturalistic language analyses to provide converging and precise evidence regarding the links among concepts and language in children between 2 and 5 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will promote more effective learning strategies by providing much-needed information on how the language that parents and teachers use (generic vs. specific) affects how children acquire and generalize new information. These findings will help us understand better how children learn language, and have implications for science education. Furthermore, understanding how and when children form generalizations within categories informs the development of stereotyping, as well as how children come to understand human diversity. Finally, the work will benefit society at large, by providing scientists, educators, and parents with an understanding of children's early cognitive processes and the effects of language on such processes. Understanding how these basic processes unfold in normally developing children also provides a framework for eventually understanding how they can go awry, for example, in children with specific language impairment.</AbstractNarration>
