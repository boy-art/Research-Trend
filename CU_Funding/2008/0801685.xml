    <AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project is directed at training graduate students in the science and technology surrounding quantum coherent optical and matter systems and related photonic structures and sources. Such studies intimately relate to the emerging field of quantum information processing including quantum encrypted communications. Objectives include training a different kind professional who is cross-trained, flexible, and better prepared for the evolving needs of information technology, with an eye toward increasing underrepresented and female students. The latter will be enhanced through vigorous recruiting and partnering with minority serving institutions. A central educational feature is that the participating students take courses in at least three of the four participating departments: Physics, Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, and Materials Science. Due to the advanced nature of the targeted research topics, much of the required theory and practice are not presently taught and thus the faculty advisors will create new courses that fill the gaps. A new laboratory course featuring modern fiber-optics-based instrumentation is a central feature of the program. The scientific questions posed have great potential for revolutionizing information technology based on the quantum coherence of light and matter fields. Graduate students trained under this program are expected to lead the next generation of information technology research and development, which will increasingly involve quantum coherence. The interaction with U. S. firms and National Laboratories will enhance the students? ability to compete in the global market place. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
