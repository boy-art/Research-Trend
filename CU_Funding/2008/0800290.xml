    <AbstractNarration>0800290&lt;br/&gt;Renaud&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is the development of a crashworthy hybrid cellular automata (crasHCA) method for nonlinear-dynamic transient topology and topography optimization. Crashworthiness design methods are used to synthesize vehicle structures to protect occupants against injury. Currently, the HCA approach for structural design is limited to linear static analysis for structural synthesis. In addition, competing topology optimization approaches require sensitivity calculations and are therefore limited to linear static analysis. Because analytic expressions for sensitivities or numerical approaches for sensitivity calculation in nonlinear transient problems are not available, current practice is limited to the use of surrogate models for design optimization. The results of this research will provide users with a convergent nonlinear transient topology and topography optimization approach for crashworthiness design. The HCA framework to date has been limited by the ability to use only brick elements for topology optimization. In this investigation the HCA methodology will include the use of shell elements within a framework referred to as topography optimization for the design of stamped sheet metal components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful this proposal will facilitate novel, new designs that will lead to increased levels of protection for both drivers and passengers in automotive vehicles. In the automotive industry the use of topology optimization for structural component design is increasingly popular. The development of a topology optimization capability that facilitates nonlinear transient topology and topography optimization (crasHCA) will allow vehicle designers to significantly improve vehicle safety in reduced product development cycle times. CrasHCA topology optimization will allow designers to move beyond surrogate models and to facilitate structural synthesis under nonlinear transient dynamic loading. In this GOALI investigation the PI and students will interact with Honda R&amp;D Americas to insure technology transfer to industry. The crasHCA methodology for nonlinear transient topology optimization will be validated using real application test problems provided by Honda. Fabrication and mechanical testing of the synthesized designs at Honda?s research facility will further contribute to verification and validation.</AbstractNarration>
