    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Virginia Commonwealth University for the summers of 2009-2011. The program director is Suzanne Ruder who is assisted by co-PI Sally Hunnicutt. Eight students will participate in the REU program that begins with a three-day training period teaching basic skills common to all scientific research, and developing the perspectives and career planning components. Full-time research begins after this three-day period. Development of the perspectives component continues with regular meetings and presentations from faculty and from local industrial collaborators. The students' oral and written communication skills are developed throughout the program by completing a written proposal, revising their personal statements submitted as part of their application and preparing and presenting a poster of their work at the halfway point and an oral presentation for the final symposium. Written reports of the students research results are also submitted at the conclusion of the program. Student participants are encouraged to present their research results at their home institutions and/or at local high schools to encourage other students to develop research interests. Students are also encouraged to present their work at a professional meeting such as an ACS regional or national meeting.</AbstractNarration>
