    <AbstractNarration>One of the last frontiers of high energy astrophysics is the exploration of the sky with TeV photons. Very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray measurements probe astrophysics involving extreme conditions of electromagnetic or gravitational potential and highly efficient particle acceleration. VHE gamma rays could also be signatures for new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. This award provides funding for scientists at Barnard College to carry out particle astrophysics studies with VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System), located in southern Arizona. VERITAS is an array of four large imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes that has been fully operational since spring 2007. It is the most sensitive gamma-ray telescope in the northern hemisphere and will complement the science from the four-telescope H.E.S.S. array in the southern hemisphere. The PI will focus on the study of extragalactic sources such as active galactic nuclei as well as Galactic unidentified TeV sources discovered by VERITAS. Blazars constitute one of the most extreme classes of active galaxies, distinguished by their high luminosity and rapid variability. Blazars, therefore, represent the ideal class for study to further our understanding of non-thermal emission in compact sources. In addition, the PI will carry out multiwavelength studies of unidentified TeV sources, crucial for resolving the nature of these objects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI continues to play a strong role in outreach efforts to K-12 students. Activities have included student mentorships at local public schools, and public lectures. The PI's research at Barnard College, a 4-year liberal arts school for women, has significant impact in influencing women in the physical sciences, and the PI will continue to be a mentor to undergraduate women in astrophysics research. The education and outreach program for VERITAS is being led by the Adler Planetarium, and the PI will support these efforts.</AbstractNarration>
