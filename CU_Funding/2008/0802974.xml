    <AbstractNarration>Gottlieb&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0802974&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The overall goal of this project is to prepare undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;mathematics students for, and engage them in, a sustained&lt;br/&gt;research experience in computational mathematics. The PI and her&lt;br/&gt;colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth integrate&lt;br/&gt;research in scientific computing into the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;curriculum by designing research-based courses from the Freshman&lt;br/&gt;level upwards, and engaging upper-level students in a sustained&lt;br/&gt;and significant research experience. The project creates an&lt;br/&gt;integrated undergraduate research experience by engaging students&lt;br/&gt;in research from the introductory level through graduation,&lt;br/&gt;completely embedding research into the undergraduate curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;The essence of this approach is to mentor students into genuine&lt;br/&gt;research problems and research methods in computational science,&lt;br/&gt;beginning with senior high school students for recruitment&lt;br/&gt;purposes, freshman and sophomore students for orientation to&lt;br/&gt;research in computational science through carefully selected&lt;br/&gt;research topics, and culminating in major senior undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;research projects where an expected outcome is professional&lt;br/&gt;presentation at a SIAM, AMS or MAA meeting, and preparation of a&lt;br/&gt;publishable research paper. An integral part of this project&lt;br/&gt;involves the identification, training, and support of students&lt;br/&gt;from groups not normally well-represented in scientific&lt;br/&gt;computing, to encourage and support diversity in this field. &lt;br/&gt;This project engages students in an integrated program that leads&lt;br/&gt;them from the use of computational tools in course work to the&lt;br/&gt;development and use of computational tools in research projects. &lt;br/&gt;It serves as a model for a curriculum that stimulates research&lt;br/&gt;activity in computational science as an integral part of a&lt;br/&gt;mathematics degree program, from the freshman year onwards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The overriding goal of this project is to include and&lt;br/&gt;integrate research activities into the undergraduate mathematics&lt;br/&gt;curriculum. This program revolutionizes the teaching of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth by&lt;br/&gt;including research-based activities in courses across the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate mathematics curriculum. This project has a&lt;br/&gt;significant impact on the structure of undergraduate courses by&lt;br/&gt;introducing research seminars from the freshman year, linking&lt;br/&gt;students across year levels in common goals and cohorts, and&lt;br/&gt;stimulating new research-based courses in computational science. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, outreach to high school students and their&lt;br/&gt;mathematics teachers has an impact on awareness of the field of&lt;br/&gt;computational mathematics and careers in computational science. &lt;br/&gt;The approach of this project recognizes that students can be&lt;br/&gt;attracted to and prepared for a career in scientific computing by&lt;br/&gt;engaging in genuine research-based activities throughout their&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate education. The benefit of this approach is that it&lt;br/&gt;builds a stronger and more diverse population of computational&lt;br/&gt;scientists by attracting talented students to the field of&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing and training them in the tools and analysis&lt;br/&gt;of numerical methods for solution of various real-world problems. &lt;br/&gt;The project is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical&lt;br/&gt;Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the&lt;br/&gt;EHR Division of Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>
