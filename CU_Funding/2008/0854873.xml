    <AbstractNarration>Understanding the variety of properties exhibited by atomic nuclei from the underlying forces between their constituent nucleons, and understanding how these features evolve with the number of neutrons and protons, represents one of the key challenges of nuclear physics. The central theme of this proposal is to develop a new method for obtaining a reliable microscopic description of nuclei across the nuclear landscape. This method, which is called the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, has proven very successful in the treatment of many other complex many-body quantum systems, and seems very well suited for application to atomic nuclei as well. The goal of the proposal is to build the Density Matrix Renormalization Group into a practical approach for the microscopic description of atomic nuclei and to apply it systematically across the periodic table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in achieving the goals of this project should have broad impact extending well beyond the nuclear domain. Having a reliable description of the detailed structure of atomic nuclei makes it possible to address fundamental issues in nuclear astrophysics, including how the elements in the universe are synthesized, as well as issues related to fundamental symmetries of nature. The method being developed is computationally very intensive, requiring the development of new computational algorithms that should also have broad application across felds. Finally, the scientific research that is proposed will involve the active participation of several Ph.D. students, helping to train them in forefront scientific research and in cutting edge computational methodologies.</AbstractNarration>
