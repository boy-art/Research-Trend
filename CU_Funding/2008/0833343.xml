    <AbstractNarration>This project is certifying new teachers who are qualified and competent to teach in the Dallas, Arlington, and Fort Worth Independent School Districts. This is a collaborative effort among the University of Texas-Arlington's (UTA) Colleges of Education and Science and these surrounding urban school districts. Together, the leadership team is providing a program of campus courses, online courses, and classroom teaching experiences to certify 37 new mathematics and science teachers for the three school districts. The program objectives are to: 1) recruit mathematics and science teacher candidates from baccalaureate programs and career changers from local industry, 2) provide a quality two-track teacher certification program for the candidates, and 3) induct, monitor, and mentor the teacher candidates through the program and their early years of teaching. This project is actively recruiting teacher candidates of underrepresented groups, and those in science and mathematics areas where there is greatest teaching need, specifically the physical sciences and higher-level mathematics. Undergraduate candidates are introduced to teaching by placing them in partner school districts with Mentor Teachers two days a month in year one; and in year two, two days a week in fall, and in full time residency in spring. Career changers are placed in classrooms throughout their one-year programs: two days a week in the fall and in full time residency during the spring semester. All candidates are engaged in standards-based inquiry teaching, problem-based teaching experiences, action research, curriculum development, and reflective practice, and in the sharing of findings, curricula, and reflections via website postings, online interactions, and professional-style presentations.</AbstractNarration>
