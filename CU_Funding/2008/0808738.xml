    <AbstractNarration>0808738&lt;br/&gt;Bischof&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support for the Nano and Multiscale Frontiers in Biological Heat and Mass Transfer Symposium, which will be held as part of the ASME Summer Bioengineering Meeting on Marco Island, Florida, June 25 - 27, 2008. The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate the biotransport research community, which has traditionally focused on macroscale problems such as blood perfusion and thermal biology, to explore new areas involving challenging problems over multiple length scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the intellectual merit of the conference, a number of diverse speakers will appear at this symposium. These speakers include international experts in lipid-protein interactions, biomass transfer, biophotonics, and cellular- and tissue-level transport. The attendees will be exposed to these and other topics that are not often addressed at bioengineering meetings. This symposium builds on a 2004 NSF/NIH biotransport workshop that has had a great impact on this community, and it is expected that further collaborations and advances will result from this meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the conference include bringing together junior and senior researchers in the emerging field of biotransport, which has the potential to bring about improved fundamental understanding of biological transport mechanisms that could lead to improved human health and quality of life. An educational component will be provided, and dissemination will be enabled by a special issue of the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering. The NSF funds will be used to support both junior and/or underrepresented faculty, and to partially offset the expenses of the invited speakers.</AbstractNarration>
