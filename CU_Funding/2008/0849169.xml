    <AbstractNarration>The biotechnology and life sciences industry has become one of the primary economic forces in Pittsburgh, projecting 20% growth in the need for qualified technicians in the next ten years. If the frontiers of knowledge in Pittsburgh's biotechnology research and development community are to be advanced and scientific breakthroughs are to occur, trained biotechnicians must be available to meet the demand. The aim of the Biotechnology Workforce Collaborative (BWC) is to widen the spectrum of available, skilled workers in the region by enhancing ongoing partnerships with local stakeholders to a burgeoning program for the training of biotechnology/life sciences laboratory technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives and methods include: &lt;br/&gt;(a) Academic training at the college resulting in the associate degree.&lt;br/&gt;(b) A laboratory internship in the laboratories of Allegheny General Hospital, Allegheny Singer Research Institute (ASRI), the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative (PTEI); and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine.&lt;br/&gt;(c) Career development support for individual students starting at the early stages of participant preparation for college work and continuing in assistance for those students upon employment at various research laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;(d) Workgroup meetings to further develop and refine the training approach for laboratory technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Recruitment efforts focus on developing three staggered cohorts of students. Both academic and employment criteria used in the field are being applied to the selection of promising candidates. Economically and educationally disadvantaged students are being supported by the project that integrates the associate degree for biotechnology technician with the workforce needs of research laboratories that specialize in molecular genetics, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and innovation in the application of research results for health care. The collaborative effort includes an internship and long term support for career development of biotechnology/life sciences laboratory technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Based on gender, ethnicity, and geography, the cohorts broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the biotechnology field, predominantly serving the biological sciences. As the BWC continues to become a major player in the Pittsburgh region, this project has an important role in advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning between the academic and industry partners. It enhances the infrastructure for research and education as a feeder to meet employment needs and as a critical link to industry.</AbstractNarration>
