    <AbstractNarration>Today, the Android operating systems (OS) running on mobile systems such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables, is increasingly diverse. This is mainly because Android is heavily customized at multiple layers by many vendors and even mobile carriers, largely due to the difference in hardware and also the brand-specific value-added applications and services. This diversity of Android OS creates important challenges for testing, debugging, and analyzing software running on these mobile systems, including testing for consistent functionality and performance across different systems, finding crash bugs, analyzing malware, and identifying security vulnerabilities. The goal of this project is to make testing and analyzing the entire software stack of mobile systems running Android affordable and fast while requiring a low engineering effort and despite the diversity of mobile software and hardware. Successful completion of the project will enable developers and researchers to test, debug, and analyze customized Android systems with high fidelity, at a low cost and help improve the quality and security of software on mobile systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be implemented through a cloud-based mobile farm service, which provides virtual mobile instances, or virtual instances for short. Each virtual instance is a virtual machine that runs on powerful servers and that fully resembles the hardware and software configurations of a particular mobile system. By leveraging virtual machines running in servers, the proposed solution should be low cost generating lower cost to users. Critical challenges will be approached in two research thrusts. The first thrust investigates techniques to consolidate the real mobile systems in the cloud to reduce the overall infrastructure cost. The second research thrust targets enhancing the performance of virtual instances by leveraging software and hardware techniques such as speculation, record and replay, dynamic boundary, and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA).</AbstractNarration>
