    <AbstractNarration>The basic research program of the nuclear structure group at the University of Kentucky (UK) is focused on timely topics in nuclear spectroscopy, neutron-induced reactions, and neutron scattering. Most of this work will utilize fast neutrons produced at UK's accelerator laboratory and the radiation detection capabilities developed in this laboratory. The broad-based research program will include selected studies of nuclei undergoing shape oscillations and transitions, the roles of protons and neutrons in nuclear excitations, nuclear shell structure, and data relevant to rare decay modes. Nuclear level lifetime measurements, for which the methodology has been developed over many years in our laboratory, provide crucial information in many of these investigations. Additional projects that are particularly appropriate to the capabilities available at the UK accelerator laboratory will be pursued, and collaborative research with colleagues from other institutions is emphasized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education at the graduate and post-graduate levels is an integral part of all activities in our laboratory, and graduates of this program are trained nuclear scientists who are important in meeting our national needs. Providing a supportive professional experience for students is an ongoing, vital component of our program, and these students enthusiastically participate in experiments at other facilities, scientific conferences, and the activities of professional societies. Research at a small accelerator laboratory, such as ours, permits the mentoring of young scientists on a daily basis. For many years, the research facilities of our laboratory have been made available to students and faculty from non-doctoral-granting institutions, as well as scientists from other research universities, national laboratories, and nuclear-related industry. Research performed in our laboratory has contributed directly to national interests, such as homeland security and the design of advanced nuclear reactors, and will continue to do so. These applications are well represented by the activities of government and industrial partners who utilize our accelerator and research equipment. For example, collaborative studies with colleagues from industry have led to improved neutron-detection-based methods for the inspection of luggage for explosives and illegal drugs, and data obtained in our laboratory has been used to evaluate direct energy-storage devices. In each case, the unique capabilities of our laboratory were important considerations in the selection of our facility for this work.</AbstractNarration>
