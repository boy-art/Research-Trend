    <AbstractNarration>Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation-Senior Alliance&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (H-LSAMP) is comprised of the University of Houston, University of Houston-Downtown, Texas Southern University,Texas State University, Houston Community College, San Jacinto College, Rice University, and the Houston Independent School District. During this proposal, the senior alliance will work to institutionalize the Collaborative Learning Community system while enhancing the alliance through 1) recruiting and retaining well-qualified minority Science, Engineering, Technology, and Mathematics majors in an effort to graduate nearly 1,300&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority STEM majors annually, 2) developing a mechanism to&lt;br/&gt;increase community college transfer to 75% of level one students, 3) increasing student research and internship participation to over 90% of level one students, 4) sending 10 or more students overseas on meaningful international experiences.&lt;br/&gt;Student Scholars will receive stipends to support their efforts in the collaborative learning community including facilitating workshops, conducting research, providing tutor support, and assisting in enrichment workshops. Scholars will be mentored by a combination of faculty, staff, and peers; have access to student support services such as career centers, writing centers, tutor labs, and academic excellence workshops.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The H-LSAMP proposal is based on strong student support&lt;br/&gt;systems developed from current research and best practices, a proven record of&lt;br/&gt;success, and a demonstrated record of institutionalization. The H-LSAMP program&lt;br/&gt;recruits and supports a large at-risk and financially disadvantaged minority student population in the Southeast Texas region. This alliance works because of a balanced and thorough management plan, with input from all levels of the universities and school systems it serves. A comprehensive collaborative learning community is being institutionalized on all campuses. The alliance expects to contribute to the broader knowledge base by disseminating important new knowledge about the factors that contribute to retention and recruitment of underrepresented minorities, primarily Hispanic and African-Americans pursuing STEM degrees.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Texas has a growing economy; while the US lost over 279,000 jobs from August 2007-August 2008, Texas gained 252,000. This growth further outlines the need for a diversified STEM workforce, making programs such as LSAMP even more important, as economically disadvantaged students have a harder time making inroads into technology driven economies. The H-LSAMP affects over 550 level one students and an estimated 5,500-6,000 level two students annually in a comprehensive STEM program. Along with career guidance, and effective career path counseling programs, the alliance sends nearly 40% of its graduates into graduate or professional education post graduation, while placing students in the workforce nationally. With the increasing trend toward globalization in the STEM fields, the alliance is seeking to significantly increase the international exposure and cultural literacy of its&lt;br/&gt;scholars in order to better position them to take up leadership roles in a globalized workforce. Each round of funding has provided the resources required to institutionalize parts of the program, now averaging around $1 million annually. This proposal includes a strong and balanced diversity program, with numerous points of dissemination, and a multifaceted evaluation plan.</AbstractNarration>
