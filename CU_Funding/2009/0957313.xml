    <AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Mirkin and his research team at the City University of New York, Queens College will utilize nanoelectrode and nanopipet technologies developed in the Mirkin laboratory to explore the dynamics of charge transfers in thin layer cells and at the interface of two immiscible liquids. These studies are focused on interfacial charge transfer in situations where the system dimensions are smaller than or comparable to the thickness of the electrical double layer?a largely unexplored area of dynamics at interfaces. The research project will also involve the development of nanoelectrode based methods for the characterization of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated within living cells. The aforementioned projects will be done in collaboration with US and international scientists (Prof. Shigeru Amemiya at the University of Pittsburgh and Prof. Christian Amatore at the Ecole Normale Superieure, France). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is directly relevant to various areas of science and engineering beyond the field of chemistry?from nanoscience and molecular electronics to alternative energy systems and life sciences. The studies of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in activated macrophages can lead to advances in immunology and contribute to the prevention/treatment of metabolic diseases related to oxidative stress. The graduate students and postdoctoral fellows involved in this project will get multidisciplinary research experience in interfacial electrochemistry, bioanalytical chemistry and nanoscience. They will benefit from extensive national and international collaborations. The results of this research will be broadly disseminated through publications and professional presentations. The requested funds with enable the PI to contribute to ongoing CUNY efforts to recruit underrepresented minority STEM students and participate in its diversity initiatives.</AbstractNarration>
