    <AbstractNarration>The PI requests funding to partially support two activities related to the effects of noise. The first is The Second International Conference on the Effects of Noise on Aquatic Life workshop which will take place in the city of Cork, in the Republic of Ireland August 15-20, 2010. The second is a Working Group on the Effects of Noise on Fish and Turtles. The Working is in the final stages of completing a draft manuscript that lays out the data in the literature and research recommendations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the conference is to draw together new knowledge on the importance of underwater sound to animals and to the effects of sounds upon them, whether those sounds occur naturally, are made by the animals themselves, or result from human activities. The product of the Working Group will provide the first consensus document, produced by the scientists who have been doing much of the work on fish and turtle noise effects and fish and turtle bioacoustics, on the value of the data collected to date, and on their usefulness in setting criteria.</AbstractNarration>
