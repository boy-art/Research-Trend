    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For nearly every major topic in an elementary science course, student assignments include many practice problems. Repeated practice helps students hone their skills. The project explores if software can simulate authentic interaction giving students a more effective experience than traditional rote drill-and-practice. Investigators are developing courseware, called Syrus, to help computer science students develop their skills with predicate logic and proof argument. Syrus allows student interactions that are more flexible than can be achieved with practice problems from a textbook. Students are not given a selection of answers to choose from and are not simply told if their answers are right or wrong. Instead, open-ended responses to practice problems are checked by sophisticated mathematical software in real-time. The system generates an almost endless supply of problems meeting instructor-specified criteria. Syrus is a web application available to anyone, anywhere, using a standard web browser.</AbstractNarration>
