    <AbstractNarration>The PI requests funding to develop an ultra-compact mass for high-endurance operation onboard an AUV glider. The mass spectrometer will be optimized for operation aboard an AUV glider and will be capable of identifying and quantifying atmospheric, geologic, and biologically derived gases (methane, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, sulfides, etc.) as well as many anthropogenic pollutants at levels down to parts-per-billion. It will fit within a glider payload volume and operate at low. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-situ operation of these mass spectrometers onboard multiple AUV gliders will enable synoptic assessment of transient chemical phenomena such as deep-water upwelling, greenhouse gas cycling, red tides, and pulsed releases of chemicals caused by seismic events, storms, or human activity. As proof-of-concept the PI will integrate this mass spectrometer aboard a Slocum electric glider to characterize and persistently monitor water column chemistry in Massachusetts coastal waters and near the New England Shelf Break. This work will leverage the PI?s ongoing research in instrumentation development, autonomous robotics, and real-time environmental monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop a cost-effective MS-glider technology for measuring dissolved gas variability relating to biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon in the subsurface marine water column; 2) Demonstrate this technology via deployments in coastal New England environments, then in long-range transects off the Atlantic shelf break, thereby validating a new means of observation for NSF?s OOI and other ocean observation programs; and 3) Integrate this research program into broad-based student curricula to promote engineering and science literacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed education program will provide exciting learning experiences for students from Middle school ages to graduate school. Today's students are often turned on by hands-on engineering projects and opportunities to analyze near-realtime data streams. This project offers both, plus avenues to introduce students to field work and sea expeditions. The PI is well situated to integrate his research into broad-based educational programs. The PI intends to provide broad-based exposure to STEM curricula and active learning experiences for students ranging from 8th graders, to high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. One of the most notable aspects of the proposal, in terms of the broader impacts, is Camilli's plan to work closely with schools that serve economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students at the middle or high school level. By supporting the 'teach the teacher' approach for the high school program, the PI will extend his reach to bring high quality STEM education to more students more consistently than he can do on his own. The PI will also provide education and training activities for undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
