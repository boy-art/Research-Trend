    <AbstractNarration>This award continues an ongoing program to develop fundamental theories of many-particle systems, ranging from nuclei and nuclear matter to cold atoms, with applications to astrophysical and condensed matter systems. A major focus is on understanding new states of matter formed under extreme conditions, especially quark gluon plasmas produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. The program applies nuclear theory to neutron stars and supernovae, with the aim of understanding observations and, conversely, using observations to learn the properties of matter. The research on atomic Bose-Einstein and superfluid Fermi systems, a vital facet of the study of unusual states of matter, focusses on atomic states at low temperature, as well as under extreme rotation. This research also makes important interdisciplinary connections between ultracold atomic systems and dense nuclear matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The nuclear and atomic systems being studied are very unusual many-particle systems which provide broad intellectual insights. By working across the boundaries between nuclear and atomic physics this program enables the building of bridges and cross-fertilization between the hottest and coldest many-particle systems in the universe. A vital component of this research program is the education of young scientists who, through the broad training they receive and their intimate involvement in the research of the PI's and colleagues, develop the ability to combine nuclear, particle, astro, condensed matter and cold atom physics research on forefront problems. The scientists trained in this program have generally gone on to have significant impact in research at U.S. universities and national laboratories, as well as abroad.</AbstractNarration>
