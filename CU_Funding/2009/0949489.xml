    <AbstractNarration>Complex organisms such as animals and plants are made up of many different types of cells. Different types of cells organize together to form organs (like the heart or kidney), where the cells must work together to function. The genes and molecules that cells use to coordinate their development and make these complex structures are not well understood. This project uses a simple, microscopic animal (the worm, C. elegans) to identify genes important for organ development, and to study how these genes work during organ formation. The research findings will identify how the complexity of multicellular organisms is achieved. They will also decode the DNA sequence information that results in a gene turning 'on' in certain cells, or 'off' in others. Because of the simple research organism and the straightforward experimental methods, the research project is integrated into a training program for future research scientists and innovators. Undergraduate research teams will learn current techniques in molecular and cellular biology, participate in experimental design and discovery, practice scientific communication skills, and develop team-building and leadership abilities, as they complete the research objectives.</AbstractNarration>
