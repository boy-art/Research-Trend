    <AbstractNarration>Quantum computing is a rapidly developing area of both theoretical and experimental research in physics and computer science. Several important computational tasks would execute much faster on a quantum computer; additionally, complex systems of great importance to physics, material science, chemistry and biosciences can be modeled efficiently on a quantum computer, where a regular computer fails. Of the many possible realizations of a quantum computer, the system of trapped, laser-cooled atomic ions has so far shown the greatest promise. Here, the information is stored in the energy levels of individual ions localized in free space by means of radiofrequency traps, while the logic operations ("gates") are performed by shining properly tuned lasers on the ions. In this project we will investigate a new type of logic gates with trapped ion enabled by the very short-pulsed ("ultrafast") laser technology. We expect these new gates to be 100 to 1000 times faster than the types of gates used to date, thus dramatically increasing the computational speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demonstration of ultrafast quantum logic gates with trapped ions will pave way to more robust quantum computation with trapped atomic ions. The potential of applying the fast-pulsed lasers to a large number of ions is promising for efficient quantum simulations of complex systems, as well as for the alternative quantum computation schemes - the "cluster state" and the "topological" models. Ultrafast excitation of cold, trapped ions has important applications to basic spectroscopic measurements, searches for time variations of fundamental constants and to precision metrology. The educational part of this program includes further developing and establishing undergraduate and graduate curriculum in quantum information and quantum computation while actively involving women and minorities in cutting edge physics research and reaching out to the broader society through public and guest lectures in the Seattle area liberal arts colleges.</AbstractNarration>
