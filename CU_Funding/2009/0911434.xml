    <AbstractNarration>This proposal concerns the development and analysis of new numerical &lt;br/&gt;methods for Navier-Stokes equations involving discontinuities,&lt;br/&gt;free boundaries, moving interfaces, and problems on irregular domains. &lt;br/&gt;The new methods will be applied to several important applications in&lt;br/&gt;multi-phase flows, fluid structure interactions with interfaces, fluids, &lt;br/&gt;or solids. In the proposal, augmented immersed interface methods are proposed&lt;br/&gt;to tackle those difficulty problems. The new methods are based on sharp &lt;br/&gt;interface models (no smearing), second order and implicit discretization. &lt;br/&gt;The new methods are proposed to be implemented to simulate several &lt;br/&gt;important applications such as the moving contact line problem using one &lt;br/&gt;and two phase flow models; non-extensible interfaces in incompressible flows, &lt;br/&gt;open-ended interfaces, and moving interfaces with masses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects described in the proposal have wide applications in mathematical &lt;br/&gt;biology, material science, aerodynamic and mechanical engineering. The &lt;br/&gt;non-extensible interfaces have been used to model the motion of red blood &lt;br/&gt;cells in the life science. Efficient numerical simulations will have positive &lt;br/&gt;impact on early detection of illness related to the red-blood cells. The moving&lt;br/&gt;contact line problem has direct applications in the material science. Efficient &lt;br/&gt;numerical simulations using computers may avoid expensive experiments. This&lt;br/&gt;is true for other projects in the proposal as well. This proposal will also &lt;br/&gt;have positive effect on education by attracting under and graduate &lt;br/&gt;students to conduct research in this area. Some components of the&lt;br/&gt;projects will be designed as undergraduate projects. Furthermore, the research &lt;br/&gt;results can lead to a computer software package that would be useful to the&lt;br/&gt;computational science involving free boundary and moving interface, and &lt;br/&gt;problems defined on complicated domain.</AbstractNarration>
