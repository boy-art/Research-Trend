    <AbstractNarration>Humans recognize visual objects so effortlessly that is easy to overlook what an impressive computational feat this represents. At present, little is known about how the brain achieves robust visual object recognition, and reproducing this ability remains a major stumbling block in the construction of useful computer vision systems. In neurobiological research, rodent models have long been valued for their superior accessibility, with a wide range of powerful experimental techniques in widespread use. While rodents have not traditionally been used as a model system for object vision, recent behavioral evidence suggests that rats possess surprisingly advanced visual object recognition abilities. Building on these findings, the present project seeks to fill gaps in our knowledge of the neuronal mechanisms of vision using microelectrodes to record directly from neurons in the rat visual system. This work holds great potential to establish rodents as a new and powerful model for studying the neurophysiology of object recognition. The availability of a simpler, more accessible model can greatly accelerate progress in deciphering the computational underpinnings of high-level vision in the brain, which can, in turn, inform the construction of artificial vision systems for robotics and machine understanding of images. The project will also provide training opportunities for one postdoctoral fellow, and two undergraduate students, who will be directly involved in the data collection and analysis.</AbstractNarration>
