    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal ID: 0903432 &lt;br/&gt;PI name: Xie, Yuan&lt;br/&gt;Inst: PA St U University Park &lt;br/&gt;Title: ADAMS: Architecture and Design Automation for 3D Multi-core Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) are envisioned as a promising solution for future multi-core architecture design. This project will investigate two cross-cutting research thrusts related to architectural exploration and design-automation tools for future 3D multi-core systems. The stacking of memory components and the relationship between memory stacking and interconnect will be explored. The stacking of logic layers that provide distinct service to the system such as improved reliability and efficient power management will also be investigated. The PI will consider the interplay between different constraints such as thermal profiles, performance, and cost in these explorations. To facilitate such explorations, a set of design automation toolsets will be developed. In addition to validation using simulation and emulation environments, the project will fabricate and test some of these designs to demonstrate the feasibility of the ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in collaboration with industrial partners enabling direct transfer of technology to industry. The outcome of this research will, therefore, have a direct impact on future multi-core designs. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in this research will get versatile training. The tools and techniques developed in this research will be used in developing a new course on multi-core design. The PIs will also organize tutorials along with major conferences to disseminate the results from this work.</AbstractNarration>
