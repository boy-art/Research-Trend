    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to build an algorithmic foundation&lt;br/&gt;for the analysis of complex self-organizing systems.&lt;br/&gt;Computing theory has been successful at&lt;br/&gt;pinning down the computational power of&lt;br/&gt;common dynamical systems, but less so&lt;br/&gt;at analyzing their behavior and functionality.&lt;br/&gt;Recent research points to the potential benefits&lt;br/&gt;of viewing these systems as "natural algorithms."&lt;br/&gt;The approach is premised on the belief that&lt;br/&gt;the algorithm itself is at least as important&lt;br/&gt;as the data it generates and that&lt;br/&gt;the current reliance on simulations and statistics&lt;br/&gt;must be supplemented with analytical tools,&lt;br/&gt;something akin to an ``algorithms calculus.''&lt;br/&gt;The research will be oriented along the following lines:&lt;br/&gt;new proof techniques and analytical tools;&lt;br/&gt;communication-based algorithmic renormalization;&lt;br/&gt;geometry, topology, and approximation of complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ambition of this project is to lay&lt;br/&gt;the foundations of an algorithmic theory of&lt;br/&gt;complex adaptive systems. Algorithm design&lt;br/&gt;has been one of the most fruitful&lt;br/&gt;areas of computer science in the past few decades.&lt;br/&gt;Building a bridge between this intellectual discipline&lt;br/&gt;and the ever-growing area of complex systems&lt;br/&gt;could potentially have a major impact on science as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;Accordingly, the present project will involve&lt;br/&gt;collaborations with computer scientists, control theorists,&lt;br/&gt;physicists, and systems biologists.</AbstractNarration>
