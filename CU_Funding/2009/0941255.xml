    <AbstractNarration>Geology (42)&lt;br/&gt;This CCLI Type 1 is a collaborative approach to the acquisition and sharing of geophysical equipment (ground-penetrating radar, electromagnetic induction, seismic refraction, and sub-meter Global Positioning Satellite technology) that is enhancing field-based curricula at the University of Vermont (UVM) and Norwich University (NU). &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The geophysical instruments are increasing curricular and research opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in geological investigations pertaining to real-world problems with geological, environmental and archeological implications. Both universities are partnering with the Vermont Geological Survey. Because the main field-based courses using this equipment are offered in alternating years at UVM and NU, the cooperative sharing of key equipment maximizes its impact and efficient use. Through inquiry-based learning, students are gaining experience in experiment design and deployment of geophysical equipment to collect subsurface data that are being integrated with geological constraints to solve real-world geological and environmental problems deemed as priorities by the State of Vermont. Additional users of the equipment include the UVM Department of Anthropology and its Consulting Archaeology Program.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. This project is improving STEM teaching and learning through the use of technology at both UVM and NU. New opportunities for undergraduate students in the form of group projects and individual research are being created. The results of these new student opportunities are having direct applications to environmental issues, such as groundwater resources in the State of Vermont, and are providing a powerful mechanism for STEM-related educational outreach to the public.</AbstractNarration>
