    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed project is to study the feasibility of a new variable stiffness isolator and to understand its behavior. The proposed system can function in passive and active modes, is fail-safe, and is very similar to the conventional passive elastomeric bearings. The power requirement is very low, and the system can be battery operated. The new system offers both passive and controllable components. The objective of this research is to understand the performance of the proposed variable stiffness isolation bearing. Prototypes of this system will be designed, fabricated and tested. For the proof-of-concept of its effectiveness under seismic motions, the proposed isolator will be examined on a scaled model building. Theoretical analysis will be carried out to model and predict the performance of the proposed system. Materials development will be focused on elevated working temperature, moisture resistance, and enhanced durability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed project will contribute to the advancement of passive-active protective systems for the control of large structures. Research in hazard mitigation of large structures is of high importance because it can significantly contribute to saving lives and resources. In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to enhancing the protection of civil infrastructure elements by taking advantage of new materials, high-tech devices, and advanced control methods. The activity will also provide advanced training in testing and analysis to the graduate student working on this project.</AbstractNarration>
