    <AbstractNarration>Coherent control of chemical reactions has been a driving force in laser physics since the invention of the laser itself. The group will use this full arsenal of control techniques on molecules to answer basic questions about the interaction of molecules with intense laser fields. The broadest goal is to understand the transition from molecular to atomic behavior in molecules as a function of internuclear separation. In addition, over the past several years, an entirely new concept has evolved from studies of molecules in intense laser fields that we call "incoherent" or "dissipative" control. Unlike traditional coherent control, this new method actually works better at higher temperatures and may lead to methods for controlling chemical reactions at room temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interest in high-harmonic generation (HHG), attosecond physics, and short-pulse x-ray free electron lasers has exploded over the past decade. However, research in these fields requires huge investments of time and money. We can study and test many aspects underlying the physics of these processes more quickly and inexpensively at a small University-based lab to support projects at large facilities. In addition, the experiments require state-of-the-art laser systems, giving students hands-on experience with the latest laser and optical technologies and preparing them for a variety of research-based academic or high-tech industrial career paths.</AbstractNarration>
