    <AbstractNarration>This project will continue work on the development of methods for the development of solid-phase motifs (disks, monoliths) for reusable and regenerable main-group and transition-metal reagents/catalysts as well as the development of practical asymmetric routes to optically active targets using resin-bound asymmetric pyrrolidine catalysts in enamine-mediated reactions. Adaptation of organometallic mediated processes to the solid state can provide physical segregation of products from reagents, regeneration and reuse of reagents, and the development of flow-through methodologies. Development of resin-bound asymmetric pyrrolidine catalysts which facilitate recoverability and reusability as well as expedite syntheses through microwave-assisted reactions will address a growing need for effective and versatile applications of organocatalysis. These specific aims fit squarely into and are united by the monikers 'reactive polymer' and 'green chemistry'. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professors Mark J. Kurth and Neil E. Schore of the Department of Chemistry at University of California-Davis. Professors Kurth and Schore's research efforts revolve around the investigation of reactive polymers in organic synthesis. Their research could expand the scope of solid-phase strategies in multi-step organic synthesis and solve problems that cannot be readily solved in other ways. Multi-step organic synthesis is required in the manufacture of many prescription drugs.</AbstractNarration>
