    <AbstractNarration>With the steady increase of discovery of new anthropogenically generated nanomaterials with novel properties and the increase in their use in consumer products and manufacturing, it is critical that the public be informed of possible impacts to their environment, lives, and health, both good and bad that are related to nanotechnology and the use of nanomaterials. This workshop responds to this need by bringing together stakeholders and experts from academia, industry, the government, and non-profit consumer advocate groups to discuss public perceptions of nanotechnology, risks and rewards of the field, possible regulatory concerns, risk mitigation, and communication with the public. The workshop also focuses on identifying gaps in our present knowledge and looming challenges that need to be addressed in the next decade. Broader impacts of the workshop include engaging in dialog a diverse group of stakeholders that do not generally communicate with each other. Broad dissemination is enabled by publication of conference proceedings. Conveners have also been sensitive to diversity in terms of selecting steering committee members and forum speakers.</AbstractNarration>
