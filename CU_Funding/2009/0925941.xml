    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: ECCS 0925941&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Development of a Low Cost Form of Maglev Transportation Using Electrodynamic Wheels&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Jonathan Bird&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: University North Carolina ? Charlotte &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to experimentally and numerically verify that a low cost, high efficiency, maglev vehicle can be built. The approach is to electromechanically rotate Halbach magnetic rotor?s over flat passive aluminum guideways. The simultaneous rotational and translational motion of the rotors induces guideway eddy currents that can provide suspension, thrust and lateral forces for the vehicle. Each rotor?s speed and direction will be controlled in order to achieve optimal efficiency and dynamic stability. Custom designed 3D finite element code will be utilized to model the high-speed rotational and translational motion. An experimental setup utilizing at least four Halbach rotors will be built. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This research will involve the development of new electromagnetic optimizing techniques and control strategies for a fully 3D eddy-current electromechanical conversion device. Insightful trade-offs between stability requirements, efficiency, thrust and suspension levels will be considered. The research could lead to new methodologies for designing 3D eddy-current based machines. Novel multivariable control techniques will be employed in order to ensure stability of the complexly coupled device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The utilization of a maglev transportation system could significantly reduce the nation?s dependence on petroleum-based energy thereby mitigating airborne pollutants. The project will contribute to the education and awareness of power engineering as an exciting area for research. Undergraduate and graduate students will assist with this project at all levels. The PI will work closely with faculty advisors and the Multicultural Office to ensure underrepresented students are involved. The research will be published in leading magnetics and control journals.</AbstractNarration>
