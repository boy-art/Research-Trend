    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the development of mobility strategies for&lt;br/&gt;Robotic Sensor Networks (RSNs) which are networks of robots equipped&lt;br/&gt;with communication, computation and sensing capabilities. For RSN&lt;br/&gt;technology to be utilized in critical applications such as emergency&lt;br/&gt;response and environmental monitoring, mobility algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;operation in dynamic and complex environments are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, three novel mobility problems which arise in many RSN&lt;br/&gt;applications are introduced. These problems are general enough to&lt;br/&gt;capture the interplay between communication, sensing and&lt;br/&gt;mobility. Yet, they can be succinctly formulated as geometric&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems. This work will focus on solving these mobility&lt;br/&gt;problems which will yield provably correct solutions for numerous RSN&lt;br/&gt;applications. In addition, bounds on the performance of a given RSN in&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems such as tracking, collaborative sensing and&lt;br/&gt;estimation will be established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The output of this research will be a significant step toward enabling&lt;br/&gt;the use of fully autonomous RSNs for crucial applications in emergency&lt;br/&gt;response, energy and environmental monitoring, and health care&lt;br/&gt;automation. Sensing and actuation play important roles in the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of information technology. The project will contribute to&lt;br/&gt;this evolution through the development of novel distributed sensing&lt;br/&gt;and control algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
