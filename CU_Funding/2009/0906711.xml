    <AbstractNarration>-----------------Technical abstract---------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphene, the recently isolated two dimensional crystal of carbon, &lt;br/&gt;possesses extraordinary electronic properties arising from a low energy &lt;br/&gt;excitation spectrum which mimics ultra relativistic particles. This &lt;br/&gt;makes it possible to achieve high quality field-effect transistors and &lt;br/&gt;to observe the quantum Hall effect at room-temperature. The object of &lt;br/&gt;this work is to access the intrinsic properties of graphene by isolating &lt;br/&gt;it from the environment and to explore the emergence of new physical &lt;br/&gt;phenomena in response to the controlled introduction of chemical or &lt;br/&gt; mechanical perturbations. We will seek to understand and minimize &lt;br/&gt;environmental effects on the electronic properties by exploring the &lt;br/&gt;influence of various substrates as well as that of removing the &lt;br/&gt;substrate altogether. We will explore the role of interactions, &lt;br/&gt;boundaries, magnetic field and dopants on the quasiparticle spectrum in &lt;br/&gt;search of emergent phases and new physical properties. We will &lt;br/&gt;investigate the feasibility of fabricating graphene nano-devices based &lt;br/&gt;on these properties. The primary experimental probes in this project &lt;br/&gt;include scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy atomic force &lt;br/&gt;microscopy and magneto-transport. Work on this project will be carried &lt;br/&gt;out with the active participation of students at the undergraduate and &lt;br/&gt;graduate level and with post doctoral fellows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;----------Non-technical abstract------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent discovery of graphene, a two-dimensional crystal consisting &lt;br/&gt;of a single atomic plane of graphite, gives access to extraordinary &lt;br/&gt;electronic properties arising from charge carriers that mimic &lt;br/&gt;ultra-relativistic particles. Because of the low dimensionality and the &lt;br/&gt;possibility of attaining charge transport with exceptionally high &lt;br/&gt;carrier mobility, graphene holds the promise of becoming the building &lt;br/&gt;block for a new generation of nanoelectronics devices. The goal of this &lt;br/&gt;project is to access the intrinsic properties of graphene by isolating &lt;br/&gt;it from the environment and to explore the emergence of new physical &lt;br/&gt;phenomena and new phases of matter in response to the controlled &lt;br/&gt;introduction of chemical or mechanical perturbations. We will explore &lt;br/&gt;the feasibility of fabricating graphene nano-devices based on these &lt;br/&gt;properties. The primary experimental probes will include scanning &lt;br/&gt;tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and &lt;br/&gt;magneto-transport. Work on this project will be carried out with the &lt;br/&gt;active participation of students at the undergraduate and graduate &lt;br/&gt;level. Work on this project will be carried out with the active &lt;br/&gt;participation of students at the undergraduate, graduate and post &lt;br/&gt;doctoral levels. They will receive training in cutting edge research and &lt;br/&gt;in the use of state of the art equipment that will prepare them for &lt;br/&gt;filling demanding technical and research positions.</AbstractNarration>
