    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists and educators at the University of Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB), the Department of Oceanography, and Paepae o He'eia Fishpond on Oahu are working to develop a community-based research and education partnership that seeks to integrate fundamental research on the biogeochemistry and ecology of Native Hawaiian Fishponds with community education and career training opportunities. The Laulima A 'Ike Pono ("Working Together for the Collective Vision") project will build an inclusive, collaborative mechanism by which scientists work in a socially relevant context and community members obtain training in geoscience research and learn about career opportunities in the geosciences. By providing Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders opportunities to explore geosciences through community-based research internships, Laulima A 'Ike Pono integrates scientific methodologies and technology with traditional knowledge and practices to create a holistic educational experience in geoscience research. Mentoring of interns in college and career pathways will be offered through workshops and discussion groups. The project also provides a framework for training young and established scientists in the integration of their research with community and educational outreach programs. Further, the study of nutrient dynamics with the impacts of invasive algae on Fishpond geochemistry will provide information on how the pond functions today and may reveal options for remediation actions that could restore the pond to a more original state. This project will directly provide geoscience research opportunities for 60 Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, geoscience career awareness for 60 high school counselors and community college faculty, and outreach training seminars for 20 university research faculty. Dozens more community members and K-12 school students will be reached by integration with an existing community visitor program at He'eia Fishpond. Graduate student-created podcasts and education products will be distributed to public audiences via the Internet and other networking tools.</AbstractNarration>
