    <AbstractNarration>Development of Efficient X-Ray CT Image Segmentation Techniques for Quantitative Analysis of Phase Distributions and Flow Processes in Porous Media&lt;br/&gt;Markus Tuller, Pavel Iassonov and Marcel Schaap&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;Nondestructive imaging methods such as X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT) yield high-resolution 3 D representations of pore space and fluid distribution within porous materials. Steadily increasing computational capabilities and easier access to industrial and synchrotron X Ray CT facilities have contributed to a recent surge in microporous media research with objectives ranging from theoretical aspects of fluid and interfacial dynamics at the pore-scale to practical applications such as (D)NAPL transport and dissolution. In recent years, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to improve CT technology, micro-scale analysis, and fluid dynamics simulations. However, the development of adequate image segmentation methods for conversion of grayscale CT volumes into a discrete form that permits quantitative characterization of pore space features and subsequent modeling of liquid distribution and flow processes is lacking far behind. &lt;br/&gt;A preliminary study revealed that most of the documented segmentation methods that were originally developed for optical character recognition, pattern analysis, or medical research yield vastly different results when applied to X-Ray CT data of porous materials. Furthermore, there is virtually no commercial or open-source software with advanced image segmentation capabilities suitable for automated processing of large CT data sets available.&lt;br/&gt;To overcome these shortcomings we will identify the most promising segmentation methods and develop new hybrid algorithms tailored to industrial and synchrotron X-Ray CT data of natural porous media. Lattice Boltzmann simulations within X-Ray CT-derived discretized pore space compared to independently measured hydraulic properties will guide the development process. The generated algorithms will be combined in a user-friendly, stand-alone, and well documented software package and made available to the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
