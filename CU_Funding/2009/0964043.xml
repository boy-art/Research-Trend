    <AbstractNarration>NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BCS-0964138, BCS-0964043&lt;br/&gt;Lisa M. Kennedy, Kam-biu Liu&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech, Louisiana State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The body of literature on the ecological impacts of hurricanes is large, but nearly all the studies have focused on relatively short-term (years) changes. A persistent question arising from many of these studies is whether hurricanes change forest composition over the long term (decades to centuries). In addition, increased post-hurricane fire hazards have been hypothesized for the subtropical maritime forests of the southeastern U.S., but whether this relationship holds for tropical forests is still a question mark. Recent advances allowing identification of proxy records of hurricane landfalls in sediment profiles provide an opportunity to address such questions. This project will examine the long-term (decades to centuries) impacts of hurricanes on tropical forests and the possible link between hurricanes and fire through paleoecological analyses of sediment records from coastal lakes in the Dominican Republic. The investigators will analyze geological, geochemical, and biological proxies contained in the sediments, and use radiocarbon dating, to identify records of hurricane landfalls and to examine how these landfalls influence vegetation composition and interact with fire over long time scales. A key objective of this research is to document whether post-hurricane vegetation changes persist over the long term and whether fire hazards increase in tropical ecosystems after hurricane strikes (i.e., the hypothesis of hurricane-fire interactions) through the study of pollen grains and microscopic charcoal in closely spaced samples above and below hurricane overwash deposits. Multiple study sites in the Dominican Republic, where there are relatively high frequencies of hurricane landfalls, will allow comparisons between hurricane effects on vegetation and fire in tropical dry and moist forest ecosystems. The study of modern pollen rain and the signatures of historical hurricane strikes in lake sediments will provide a basis for interpreting paleoenvironmental changes and events from sedimentary proxy data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate and vegetation dynamics are poorly understood in tropical areas in comparison to mid- and high-latitude areas. This project will produce proxy records of paleohurricane activity from the Dominican Republic, a location in the Caribbean region strategic for evaluating mechanisms affecting hurricane activity on millennial timescales. The results of this study will shed light on other aspects of climate and environmental history, including possibly pre-Columbian human activities, and will help to provide a broader understanding of environmental change in the Caribbean, where long-term history is still poorly documented. This research will provide a long-term perspective and generate the first proxy-based estimates of hurricane return periods and landfall probabilities for the Dominican Republic, which may be useful to decision makers in terms of disaster planning and management. This project will provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in international research with field and laboratory components.</AbstractNarration>
