    <AbstractNarration>Ren&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0907777&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A diblock copolymer molecule is a linear chain of an&lt;br/&gt;A-monomer block grafted covalently to a B-monomer block. Because&lt;br/&gt;of the repulsion between the unlike monomers, the different type&lt;br/&gt;sub-chains tend to segregate, but as they are chemically bonded&lt;br/&gt;in chain molecules, segregation of sub-chains cannot lead to a&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic phase separation. Only a local micro-phase&lt;br/&gt;separation occurs: micro-domains rich in A monomers and&lt;br/&gt;micro-domains rich in B monomers emerge as a result. A&lt;br/&gt;nano-sized pattern formed from micro-domains is known as a&lt;br/&gt;morphology phase. The investigator develops singular limit&lt;br/&gt;methods to study morphology phases that concentrate on points,&lt;br/&gt;curves, and surfaces in space, and that might not be found by&lt;br/&gt;existing free energy methods. These methods reduce complicated&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear, nonlocal, variational, and partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equation problems to simpler geometric problems. They analyze&lt;br/&gt;the saturation phenomenon: a process of elongation, deformation,&lt;br/&gt;and breaking off of a small number of large objects to form a&lt;br/&gt;large number of small objects. They also explain defects in&lt;br/&gt;morphological phases caused by local-nonlocal competition or&lt;br/&gt;topological constraints. In the case of block copolymer vesicles&lt;br/&gt;the investigator studies the bending rigidity in the free energy. &lt;br/&gt;The singular limit techniques are extended to problems without&lt;br/&gt;variational structures, such as the Gierer-Meinhardt system for&lt;br/&gt;biological morphogenesis in development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Block copolymers are soft condensed materials that in&lt;br/&gt;contrast to crystalline solids, are characterized by fluid-like&lt;br/&gt;disorder on the molecular scale and a high degree of order on a&lt;br/&gt;longer length scale. An almost unlimited number of molecular&lt;br/&gt;architectures can be designed by modern nano-technologies to&lt;br/&gt;produce materials with particular mechanical, electric, barrier,&lt;br/&gt;ionic and other physical properties. Common box tapes use&lt;br/&gt;triblock copolymers to achieve pressure-sensitive adhesion. &lt;br/&gt;Block copolymers are blended with asphalt in road construction to&lt;br/&gt;reduce pavement cracking and rutting at low and high temperature&lt;br/&gt;extremes. In this project the investigator studies pattern&lt;br/&gt;formations within block copolymers that are related to changes in&lt;br/&gt;the morphology phase of the material, and hence to larger-scale&lt;br/&gt;material properties. The project includes graduate students, who&lt;br/&gt;develop skills and knowledge in both mathematics and materials&lt;br/&gt;science.</AbstractNarration>
