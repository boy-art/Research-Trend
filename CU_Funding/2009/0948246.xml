    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Daniel King has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to develop an integrated program of research and education at Penn State University. The goal of this project is to develop our understanding of the micro-scale physical mechanisms and the geological implications of frictional healing. Specifically, this project will involve experimental investigation of the role of thermally-activated processes on the mechanical evolution of quasi-stationary synthetic fault gouge. Mechanical data and microstructural observations will be analyzed within the context of theory for both frictional sliding and intragranular plastic deformation. The proposed research will contribute to developing a more complete understanding of the relationship between seismicity and viscous flow at scales ranging from individual grains to plate boundaries. The results of this study are expected to increase our understanding of fault zone processes and the mechanics of earthquakes. Results from experiments on olivine fault gouge, a material for which little data on frictional properties exists, are especially important for developing a mechanistic understanding of earthquake processes in the oceanic crust. The proposed research also includes plans to directly involve undergraduate students in the proposed research by completing discrete portions of the project as senior research projects. These projects are designed so that students can gain general research skills and specific technical skills. This educational component will also further the professional development of Dr. King by providing an opportunity to develop skills in advising and directing research projects.</AbstractNarration>
