    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: RI: Medium: Collaborative Research: Physically Grounded Object&lt;br/&gt;Recognition&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie-Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 05/05/09&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;Although the world is very much three-dimensional, most of today's approaches to&lt;br/&gt;visual object recognition essentially reduce the problem to one of 2D pattern&lt;br/&gt;classification, where rectangular image patches are independently compared to stored&lt;br/&gt;templates to produce isolated object labels within the image. This project aims to&lt;br/&gt;account for the three-dimensional nature of the real world by exploring qualitative&lt;br/&gt;geometric reasoning in terms of 3D spatial relationships between scene components,&lt;br/&gt;category-level object models, and global scene understanding.&lt;br/&gt;The project is organized around two major research areas. Qualitative 3D scene&lt;br/&gt;parsing: A central part of our effort will be to develop qualitative 3D models of the scene&lt;br/&gt;that describe the depicted objects and surfaces and their physical relations. Grounding&lt;br/&gt;objects in the scene: We integrate the geometric representation of the scene and the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding 3D spatial relations with the object recognition process by (1) inferring&lt;br/&gt;the set of likely object identities based on 3D relations among scene components; (2)&lt;br/&gt;predicting the most likely object locations from the scene layout; and (3) using the&lt;br/&gt;occlusion relations and depth ordering to predict the parts of objects that may be visible&lt;br/&gt;in the scene.&lt;br/&gt;The project is anticipated to result in major advances in 3D scene understanding from&lt;br/&gt;photographs, a critical enabling technology for a wide range of applications including&lt;br/&gt;autonomous systems, health care, human-computer interaction, assistive technology,&lt;br/&gt;image retrieval, industrial and personal robotics, manufacturing, scientific image&lt;br/&gt;analysis, surveillance and security, and transportation.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0905402 PI Name:Hebert, Martial&lt;br/&gt;Printed from eJacket: 05/06/09 Page 1 of 1</AbstractNarration>
