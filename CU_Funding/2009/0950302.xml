    <AbstractNarration>Savannas are ecological communities comprised of scattered trees in a grassland matrix. The mechanisms leading to the coexistence of grasses and trees and the persistence of savanna communities over long time periods are unclear. Opposing ecological theories have predicted either equilibrium savanna communities that result from niche partitioning or non-equilibrium savannas that result from repeated disturbances such as fire. This project will consider an alternative model to explain the structure of savannas, in which stability results from feedbacks between fire disturbance and vegetation. It will test the hypothesis that flammable savanna plants result in more frequent or intense fires and that these fires, in turn, promote the growth and establishment of savanna vegetation. Such positive feedbacks between savanna vegetation and fire could maintain the density of trees between the extremes of treeless prairies and the closed canopy of forests. The project will further explore whether less frequent, periodic disturbances such as hurricanes could have interactive effects with fire that could initiate vegetation-fire feedbacks and rescue savannas from a forest state. The underlying assumptions and predictions of a disturbance-feedback model will be tested using empirical and experimental data collected from sites that have been studied for the past 30 years in southern Florida, southwestern Georgia, and eastern Louisiana, and that broadly represent pine savannas in the southeastern United States. Demographic and spatial patterns predicted by a disturbance-feedback model will be compared to field observations and experimental data to ascertain the validity of the model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This alternative model of savanna dynamics will contribute to a general understanding of the processes that structure savannas across a wide range of environments worldwide, and will facilitate predictions of savanna responses to disturbances such as climate warming and landscape fragmentation. Understanding savanna responses to perturbations is of broad significance as savannas comprise an eighth of the global land surface, provide essential ecological services, and are important reservoirs of biodiversity. Results from this project will also be broadly applicable to ecological restoration and management of ecosystems across the United States. This project will support a postdoctoral scholar and provide research training for graduate and undergraduate students, and Girl Scouts at a camp near the study site in Louisiana.</AbstractNarration>
