    <AbstractNarration>Fundamentals and Applications of Thermoelectric Transport in Nanometer Scale Phase-Change Bridge Memory Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helena Silva (PI, University of Connecticut) and Chung Lam (Co-PI, IBM Watson Research Center)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to investigate thermoelectric transport in nanometer scale phase-change bridge memory devices and to devise improved phase-change memories that utilize the asymmetries introduced by thermoelectric effects such as multi-bit per cell operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase-change memory has been the subject of intensive research due to the continued need for higher capacity storage and expectations of the end of current memory scaling in the near future. Our findings point to the significance of Thomson Effect (thermoelectric effect in uniform materials) in phase-change processes. A better understanding of thermoelectric transport and phase-changes at the micrometer and nanometer scales can be applied towards thermoelectric devices for clean power generation and cooling, higher efficiency solar cells that combine photovoltaic with thermoelectric generation and on-chip cooling for micro/nanoelectronics. This project is carried out in partnership with IBM Watson Research Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research consists of detailed analysis of Thomson Effect at nanometer scale using phase-change memory devices. The role of electronic convective and electron-phonon scattering components in the thermoelectric transport in these structures is investigated. Students learn about nanoelectronic devices, phase changes, thermoelectric transport, nanofabrication, electrical and physical characterization, instrumentation and numerical modeling. This project allows investigation of basic physical phenomena relevant to a promising memory device technology and offers a rich program for educational and outreach activities at all levels. This collaborative research strengthens an important relationship between University of Connecticut faculty and students and IBM scientists.</AbstractNarration>
