    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Materials Research supports Stanford University with the conceptual engineering design and development of a prototype scanning sampling Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscope. High spatial resolution sampling scanning SQUID microscopes are among the world?s most sensitive magnetic detectors. The project will provide scientist and engineers with a new imaging capability of time-independent magnetic fields with nanoscale spatial resolution and single electron spin sensitivity. It will enable imaging of time-dependent magnetic fields with 10 picoseconds time resolution. Such measurements of nanomagnetic phenomena are of interest in information technology, biotechnology, and energy technology, as well as fundamental science. The microscope is designed to become a general user tool at two co-located shared user facilities, the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility (SNF), a member of the National Nanofabrication Infrastructure Network, and the Center for Probing the Nanoscale (CPN). The microscope would be a transformative tool in the hands of the users, scientists and engineers, needing to characterize such widely varying materials as superconductors, magnetic nanoparticles, magnetic semiconductors, and multiferroics. The project is based on collaboration between IBM and Stanford. This university-industry collaboration will allow mentoring and hands-on experience for a diverse group of students and postdocs in an industrial environment.</AbstractNarration>
