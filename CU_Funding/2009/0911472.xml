    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Julia Xiaojun Zhao of University of North Dakota. Prof. Zhao and her students will develop a series of new near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) nanoparticles for sensitive detection and imaging of trace analytes in biosamples. The resulting fluorescent nanoparticles are expected to show highly intense and photostable fluorescence signals, clearly discrete excitation and emission peaks, high water solubility, high biocompatibility and low toxicity. These particles are likely to find use in biomedical, environmental and homeland security applications. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to students in bionanotechnology. Prof. Zhao will continue her on-going educational and outreach activities aiming to engage Native American undergraduate students in her research and promote the field of nanoscience to a wide audience in the State of North Dakota.</AbstractNarration>
