    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61). Based on students feedback, professional teaching teams of faculty, lecturers and teaching assistants (TAs) in the Biology department at Stanford University are developing and testing research-based, interactive introductory Biology curriculum focusing on three areas, molecular and cellular biology, evolution, and ecology. Ten weeks of study are devoted to each area during which time students are guided in the laboratory and in the field by the faculty, lecturers and teaching assistants through modern research techniques to acquire and analyze data in order to explore an important research question provided to the class. After analyzing the data, teams of students propose a hypothesis based on the data, devise an experimental plan, execute the experiments, record and analyze data, present their results and conclusions to the class, and submit a final report. During the teaching of the course, feedback provided by both students and the professional teaching teams, through the use of formative evaluation tools, allows the instructional teams to make real-time adjustments to the course. Since exemplary teaching is critical to the success of these courses, goals for the professional teaching teams are part of the project, and their attainment is an important focus.&lt;br/&gt;This project is being co-funded by funds from the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Emerging Frontiers Division.</AbstractNarration>
