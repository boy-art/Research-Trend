    <AbstractNarration>The iron-oxygen (above 100GPa) and iron-carbon binary systems will be explored to determine phase stability and eutectic melting temperatures as a function of pressure. Partial melting, unit cell volumes and other crystallographic information are to be determined using synchrotron x-ray diffraction while the samples are compressed and laser-heated in a diamond anvil cell. Crystal structure is naturally monitored with x-ray diffraction, so subsolidus phase transitions will also be detected and identified during the course of the equation of state measurements. The experimental methodology for these experiments has been proven successful at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The data to be collected are critical not only to understand the temperatures in the Earth's core, but also for developing models of chemical evolution of the Earth's core. The phase relations in these systems and temperatures within the Earth's core are critical for understanding the generation of the magnetic field throughout the history of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the proposed study will be disseminated primarily through publication in the scientific literature, by participation at scientific conferences, and when warranted, through wider-reaching news outlets. Additional benefits of the proposed research include the continued development and refinement of experimental high-pressure, high-temperature techniques; continued exposure of university researchers, including student participants, to the facilities and talent at government-funded multi-user sites; and the training of students in the wide range of experimental techniques and scientific protocols associated with performing the proposed work.</AbstractNarration>
