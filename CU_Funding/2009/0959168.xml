    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Departments of Chemistry, Biology, Microbiology, and Physics at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse will acquire a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) to support research activities in these Departments. This instrumentation will significantly expand the capabilities of the University's Core Imaging Facility. Examples of specific projects that will use the requested instrumentation include: 1) the investigation of the structure and stability of DNA films on gold surfaces, 2) the investigation of organic/inorganic semiconductor interfaces, 3) the investigation of the structural and functional properties of full-length hemolysin A, 4) the use of semiconductor quantum dots to detect single photons, 5) the quantifying of particulate food resources in the upper Mississippi River as a means of evaluating the impacts of invasive species , 6) the analysis of the phenotype of defective cell cycle genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis, as well as the research projects of seven additional faculty in these Departments. The instrumentation will be available to a large number of undergraduate students -- both students enrolled in laboratory courses as well as undergraduate researchers. This group includes a significant number of students from underrepresented groups. In addition, the SEM and AFM will feature prominently in a number of extramural collaborations between research groups on campus and external partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy are widely used techniques for providing an image of a sample surface. The image is obtained by scanning an electron beam (SEM) or an atomically-sharp tip (AFM) over the surface under study. The resolution obtainable with both SEM and AFM microscopies (ca. nanometer or less) is significantly better than that achievable with optical microscopes. The instruments acquired will be housed in the University's Core Imaging Facility, and will be used by researchers from a wide variety of science disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
