    <AbstractNarration>DEVELOPMENT OF BIOPORES IN THE SUBSURFACE BY BURROWING ORGANISMS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON INFILTRATION, RUNOFF, AND CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT CHARACTERISTICS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major agent that can develop an extensive network of macropores in the subsurface is burrowing organisms that may include both vertebrates and invertebrates. Biopores created by burrowing animals and invertebrates could have a significant influence on hydrological processes. Understanding the burrowing process evokes interest among other disciplines such as soil morphology and entomology. Among the burrowing invertebrates, a species that has garnered significant attention in the U.S is the mole cricket. The project would be the first multi-disciplinary project to study biopore development by mole crickets and their effects on storage, transport, infiltration and runoff processes. The project will synergistically study biopore development from both hydrologic and entomological perspectives. The influence of biopores on infiltration, contaminant transport and runoff processes will be studied as a function &lt;br/&gt;of their age, as the pores are developed by mole crickets. We will also study the effects of biological coatings of the biopores on soil hydraulics using micro-morphological techniques. The project includes laboratory/ field-scale experiments as well as modeling work, which will shed new light on the evolution of biopores due to burrowing mole crickets at different scales. The biopores created by mole crickets will also be compared with similar-sized artificial macropores for their effects on infiltration and contaminant transport. The results from the project will be characterized using appropriate mathematical models to simulate effects of biopores on hydrologic processes. Specifically, we will develop modeling methods to describe how and why the biopores are different from artificial macropores, in terms of anisotropy in their flow characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have broader impacts on our knowledge of macropores from both hydrologic as well as entomological perspectives. The project will improve our basic understanding of the biopore development and their effects on infiltration and runoff processes. New information will be available on the differences between biopores encountered in soils and the artificial macropores typically used in laboratory studies. From an entomological perspective, the study will shed light on the burrowing behavior of mole crickets, the most important pest of recreational and pasture turfgrass in the southeastern U.S. This project will provide new insights into the behavior of this pest and for developing more efficient pesticide delivery strategies for controlling mole crickets.</AbstractNarration>
