    <AbstractNarration>This CPATH project creates new pathways for undergraduate education majors to become computer science teachers and to obtain sound foundations in computational thinking. It includes a joint effort between faculty in the departments of computer science and education to create a Computer Science (CS) Endorsement program based on the Educational Computing Standards set by the International Society for Technology in Education. The pathways to the endorsement program will be targeted to diverse student groups: all education majors will be exposed to modules focused on computational thinking, science education majors will be able to fulfill general course requirements while taking courses towards the endorsement, and students transferring into education from a STEM discipline will be able to build on their background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort builds on existing courses and teacher education. Modules on computational thinking that highlight the pervasiveness of computational metaphors in topics like reasoning, knowledge construction, and problem solving are to be integrated into existing courses. Two new courses are to be developed jointly: a CS Methods course with an associated teaching practicum in computer science and a course in Great Issues in Computer Science. These courses provide students with pedagogical and content knowledge experiences preparing them to effectively teach computer science. The team plans to run a workshop to bring together educators and computer scientists with a focus on incorporating computation in secondary teacher education and exploring the establishment of computer science licensure standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The design of a CS methods course and the associated collaboration between education and CS faculty should result in a better understanding of how to effectively teach secondary computer science, an urgent need in the nation's high schools. Selected material from the methods course will also benefit computer science faculty teaching introductory courses. Education students satisfying their practical training component in CS introductory courses will increase awareness of good practices and how to effectively teach introductory CS topics. The introduction of a Great Issues course will be of benefit and interest to a broad set of students. Thus the project has the potential to provide a national model for secondary computer science education and contribute to the sparse intellectual core currently existing in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The goal of the project is to increase the number of undergraduate education majors having taken CS courses and obtaining a CS Teaching Endorsement. This increase should translate into an increase in the number of future teachers who are qualified to teach computer science in high schools, are knowledgeable about computer science as a career, and who have an understanding of how the pervasive nature of computation impacts and changes our society. As a multiplier effect, qualified high school teachers teaching computer science should increase the number of high school students receiving a first computer science course. This increased contact is an important part in the ongoing national effort to raise interest in computer science and to educate a more computationally competent and proficient workforce.</AbstractNarration>
