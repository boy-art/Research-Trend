    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: In order to increase the number of disadvantaged students from the Cumberland Valley Area Development District and surrounding counties, the project is establishing math and science scholarships. Scholarships are awarded to academically-talented but financially-challenged students recruited from southeastern Kentucky, one of the nation's poorest and most educationally-disenfranchised regions. Approximately 15 scholarships are being awarded over the duration of the funding period. The program includes deliberate activities and support structures to increase matriculation, retention, and graduation rates by creating a collaborative learning community. Participants form cohesive learning cohorts by: being assigned academic advisors and peer mentors; being enrolled in designated sections of key courses; participating in field trips and service-learning opportunities; participating in research and internship opportunities; and being assisted in the career planning and placement process. Program networks established with area high schools and managers in STEM-related businesses function in future efforts to recruit, graduate, and place in employment, area students after the expiration of the grant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Seventy-three percent (73%) of students at the college are first generation or come from low income families. The scholarship program is serving these students primarily.</AbstractNarration>
