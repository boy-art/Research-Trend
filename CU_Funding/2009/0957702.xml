    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Benjamin T. King and his students in the Chemistry Department of the University of Nevada, Reno will prepare and study new circulenes and kekulenes. These compounds can answer important questions about the nature of aromaticity. In addition, they also serve as models for defects and provide a starting point to understand the chemistry and physics of graphenes and nanotubes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphenes and nanotubes are emerging classes of compounds of significant importance, as they are likely to find widespread technological applications within the next decade. Understanding the role of defects in these compounds is vital to their applications. The proposed study is also important in the development of the next generation of a technical workforce. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained through the proposed research. In addition, broadening participation efforts to recruit high school students out of a diverse candidate pool from local high schools will steer these students down a path to scientific careers.</AbstractNarration>
