    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this work is to investigate cavity QED with two polarization modes. The experiments explore quantum feedback on the ground state quantum beats of the system. Those beats, originating on long-lived ground state quantum coherences, are only present in the autocorrelation of the un-driven mode. The ground state superposition will be manipulated and controlled through conditional measurements and external fields, which shield the coherence and correct quantum errors through probabilistic error correction protocols. Investigations of the atomic polarization under strong driving fields will show the saturation of the atom, despite its multilevel structure, using heterodyne techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The project supports two graduate students in the area of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. The students will participate in the open houses of the laboratory that are organized by the undergraduate office of the Physics Department many times per year, as well as help with the Summer Girls Progam. The students are expected to attend the weekly Joint Quantum Seminar between NIST and UMD, where more than half of the speakers come from the AMO community and all are interested in questions related to quantum coherence. There will be undergraduates participating in the research effort and two Mexican undergraduates will spend ten weeks in the laboratory. Reports on the progress of the group will be available on the web page of the JQI as well as on the group's web site, with explanations geared to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
