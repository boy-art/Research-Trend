    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the 2009 Miami Topical Physics Conference on Elementary Particles, Astrophysics, and Cosmology. This is a successful annual conference which is essentially the replacement for the previous Coral Gables Conference, which had run successfully for many decades. The subject matter is highly topical, as the intersection between elementary particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology is increasingly at the forefront of modern theoretical physics research. The funds provided through the award are exclusively for the support (travel and local expenses) of young participants (graduate students and postdocs) for whom attendance at such a conference can have a profound effect on their development as scientists.</AbstractNarration>
