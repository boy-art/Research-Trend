    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to renovate the research component of Louisiana State University's (LSU's) campus network. The network includes a bypass feature which allows traffic between researchers and pre-cleared network addresses to bypass the institution's primary firewall and traffic-shaping devices. Such traffic flows between the border router and the campus network core through a router dedicated to bypass traffic, rather than through the campus firewall and traffic shaper. This architecture was created by LSU to address two primary concerns associated with the older network architecture, lack of adequate bandwidth over the 'last mile' to researchers with equipment generating or consuming large amounts of data in facilities in distributed locations, and the hindrance to high bandwidth, low-latency data flows imposed by various network security and integrity controls. The renovation involves upgrading multiple levels within the campus network. The goal is to upgrade the campus network in such a way that when, subsequently, a new high-bandwidth, low-latency connection is required at some location on campus, this can be deployed rapidly and inexpensively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgraded network will enhance research in many areas, including coastal modeling, the visualization of coastal models, computational biology, relativistic astrophysics, computer science, advanced networking research, and nontraditional areas of computational study such as music, theatre, and the visual arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing infrastructure for research, the upgraded network will also have an impact outside of science and engineering, on research related to technologies for use in the arts and digital media. The infrastructure will support research training since many of the people using the network in research activities will be graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
