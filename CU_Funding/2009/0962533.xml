    <AbstractNarration>0962533&lt;br/&gt;Dai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project proposes to establish the fundamental basis for developing a supercritical fluid (SCF) process for recycling printed circuit boards. First, the delamination/degradation mechanism of the bonding materials in printed circuit boards under supercritical fluid process conditions will be systematically investigated. The hypothesis is that these results will provide a basis for creating a supercritical fluid process to recycle printed circuit boards at low temperatures and pressures. If this hypothesis is proven out, there will be potential to transform the handling of discarded printed circuit boards, enabling the recycle of their make-up. The project offers a breakthrough opportunity for the recycling of printed circuit boards. The proposed SCF process potentially has important advantages compared to traditional metallurgical technologies and is anticipated to be environmentally benign as well as cost and energy saving. Additionally, classroom teaching will be enhanced by incorporating practical applications of SCF from the project. Collaborations with industrial partners are planned.</AbstractNarration>
