    <AbstractNarration>This project is initiating a community of undergraduate and graduate scholars in electrical, civil and industrial engineering that is focused on academic achievement and supports the goals of the S-STEM program. The project addresses the significant challenge of retention of students with financial need in engineering. The goals of the Scholars in Engineering program are to 1) cultivate a focus on academic excellence in early-stage bachelor's and master's students, 2) improve student retention and degree completion, 3) enhance student retention and support programs in the school of engineering, 4) improve graduate school or career preparation and placement. The program involves two cohorts of approximately 11 undergraduates each and five cohorts of about four graduate students each. The student community is being cultivated through academic monitoring, mentoring, professional development and community building activities. Two kinds of mentoring relationships are being encouraged: peer mentoring between the graduate and undergraduate students and hierarchical mentoring between faculty and graduate students to support community building, encourage academic excellence and increase career preparation. In addition to financial need and citizenship criteria, other selection factors include academic performance, motivation, and calculus I enrollment (undergraduates).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this proposal is two-fold. First, the development of an undergraduate-graduate student, and a graduate student-faculty mentorship relationship can improve the intellectual development of students. Second, the project helps to produce graduates who are well grounded in their disciplines and better prepared for success in graduate studies and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The strategies can substantially improve student retention in engineering fields, thereby increasing the engineering work force. More broadly, the approach is a best-practice model for other engineering schools.</AbstractNarration>
