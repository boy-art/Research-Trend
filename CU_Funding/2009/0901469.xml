    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;As our demand pushes the limits of the internet, we are confronted with the limitations of electronic circuitry. To address these demands, ultra-fast all-optical technologies for switching and logic are emerging as a viable alternative. We propose to investigate an unexplored material, TiO2, as a novel platform capable of meeting these demands for high speed, highly integrated on-chip photonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Recent measurements of TiO2's optical nonlinearity are similar in magnitude as highly nonlinear chalcogenide glass. Unlike most materials for all-optical switching, our work with TiO2 will enable both visible and IR operation. We will pioneer the structuring of this material and develop building blocks necessary for advanced devices. To demonstrate TiO2's viability as a nonlinear optical platform we will create micron sized nonlinear Sagnac interferometers and quantifying their performance as all-optical switches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Aspects:&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the creation of miniaturized photonic devices, the proposed work will contribute to the understanding of optical wave propagation at the nanoscale and will permit advances in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, optical memory read-out, and molecular electronics. This work will contribute to the education and training of future multidisciplinary scientists and engineers through research based education. Our work with local high schools, NSF sponsored programs, and the high representation of women in our research group will broaden participation of underrepresented groups. Our extensive collaborations with academic and industrial partners will enhance infrastructure for research. Finally, using the group's well-established program integrating outreach and public education with research, this work will be broadly disseminated to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
