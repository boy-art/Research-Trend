    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will spend one academic year at the National Weather Center (NWC), on the campus of the University of Oklahoma. The PI will gain experience in the acquisition and interpretation of radar data, and enhance his collaborations with researchers at NWC. The proposed research builds upon the expertise of the PI in the study of geometric flows. Recently, the PI and his collaborators have successfully introduced conformal geometric flows for one dimensional simple curves, as well as other geometric flows, that are expected to have applications to problems at NWC. The nonlinear decomposition of images will also be studied, and this work may lead to more efficient representations of weather phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will use this experience at NWC to develop a new course on the mathematical theory of image analysis. There will also be new opportunities for interdisciplinary research for undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
