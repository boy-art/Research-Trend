    <AbstractNarration>All political institutions require the public to view them as legitimate (i.e., public confidence and trust) in order to operate effectively. Courts are said to be especially dependent on public trust as they lack purse and sword to enforce their orders. This study will focus on one political theory known as descriptive representation, which posits that institutions enhance their political legitimacy by reflecting the gender, ethnic and racial make-up of the American population. Such institutional diversity not only helps realize the ideals of popular sovereignty, but also sends an important message to historically underrepresented groups that they are welcome in the halls of power. Given the spate of criticism of the Judiciary in recent years, the enhancement of the courts? political legitimacy has never been more timely and important. Accordingly, the research question at issue in this project is: how does increased diversity on the federal bench impacts citizens? views about the legitimacy of U.S. courts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative research design will be used for this project ? a series of experiments using a national random sample of subjects and conducted on the internet. Experiments have a critical advantage over traditional surveys, for they establish causation, and not mere correlation. The data collected for this survey will enable a wide array of researchers in the social sciences, the legal academy, and the federal government to better understand the relationship between race/gender and institutional legitimacy. The data will prove especially useful to scholars of Congress, the bureaucracy, the presidency, race and gender politics, and public opinion ? many of whom are engaged with questions about the changing demography in the U.S., and its impact on American politics. With the election of the first African American president, diversity in our government has never been more salient an issue.</AbstractNarration>
