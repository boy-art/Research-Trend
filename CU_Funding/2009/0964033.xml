    <AbstractNarration>Over the past two decades there have been many examples of &lt;br/&gt;results and insights in the Theory of Algorithms and Complexity that are motivated by,&lt;br/&gt;and inform, important research fronts in other sciences: Quantum Computing, &lt;br/&gt;Markov chain Monte Carlo, and Algorithmic Game Theory are &lt;br/&gt;examples. This project is about computational research&lt;br/&gt;whose purpose is to shed light to a broad front of central problems in &lt;br/&gt;Game Theory and Economics, Networking, and Biology. &lt;br/&gt;Aspects of this work involve devising algorithms for approximating &lt;br/&gt;Nash equilibria, or identifying computational impediments to the task;&lt;br/&gt;understanding better the power and limitations of learning and&lt;br/&gt;distributed algorithms for computing equilibria; exploring from the&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic standpoint the refinements of the Nash equilibrium concept, as&lt;br/&gt;well as of equilibrium selection processes, which have been&lt;br/&gt;developed by researchers in Game Theory over the past fifty years;&lt;br/&gt;coming up new, compelling, and computationally motivated solution concepts; &lt;br/&gt;identifying complexity-theoretic impediments to the central problem of characterizing &lt;br/&gt;the optimal multi-object auction, as well as developing algorithms and lower&lt;br/&gt;bounds for the problem of computing price equilibria in both the&lt;br/&gt;most general setting and in novel special cases of markets. &lt;br/&gt;Further goals of this project in the realm of Networking include &lt;br/&gt;studying a recently identified class of models known as ``networks of games;'' &lt;br/&gt;determining the extent to which sophisticated pricing schemes &lt;br/&gt;can improve the efficiency of selfish routing; and the analyzing two new &lt;br/&gt;genres of network models: One for social&lt;br/&gt;networks, and one for financial markets. In Biology, a recent result &lt;br/&gt;established that natural selection under recombination optimizes not fitness, &lt;br/&gt;as it had been assumed for decades, but a novel metric which we call ``mixability;'' &lt;br/&gt;this project shall follow on this work by devising techniques for proving mathematically &lt;br/&gt;this effect, as well as gauging rigorously its impact on Evolution, and and by exploring &lt;br/&gt;the relationship between recombination, mixability, and genetic modularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is likely to produce new insights into both Computation&lt;br/&gt;and the target disciplines (Game Theory, Networking, Theory of Evolution), &lt;br/&gt;as well as new mathematical techniques. In Algorithmic Game Theory, &lt;br/&gt;it seeks to make progress on some of the deepest and most looked at problems, but also to&lt;br/&gt;identify new exciting research fronts and directions in this field.&lt;br/&gt;In the Theory of Evolution, the effort is to shed light on some of&lt;br/&gt;the most fundamental and old questions of this important discipline.&lt;br/&gt;The insights from this work will be used in the development of graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate courses. A substantial part of this project aims at&lt;br/&gt;understanding and improving the global information environment (the&lt;br/&gt;Internet, the worldwide web, and the digital social networks they&lt;br/&gt;enable), which is one of Humankind's most valuable resources.</AbstractNarration>
