    <AbstractNarration>The International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems: Closing the Loop is to be held in conjunction with Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK) in Grenoble, France, October 11-16, 2009. The objectives of the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) workshop are to: (i) provide a forum for investigation of major challenges in addressing next-generation physical and engineered systems; (ii) promote collaboration and cooperation between CPS researchers in the United States and Europe; and (iii) stimulate discussions on research in CPS through panels, poster and break-out sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the emerging field of CPS requires close interaction and collaboration between experts from a variety of fields. CPS is of global importance and there are significant CPS research activities in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. This workshop contributes to the planning and coordination of CPS research that plays a critical role in identifying new crosscutting scientific foundations for building high-confidence cyber-physical systems and bringing together stakeholders from academia, industry and government agencies with a global perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impacts, this workshop can lead to advances in CPS with the potential for technological impact on a number of important application domains including energy, transportation, and healthcare. The workshop will facilitate diverse participation of U.S. researchers in the international ESWEEK event, including Ph.D. students and junior faculty. Efforts are made to towards broadening the participation of researchers from women and other underrepresented groups. The workshop, thus, has the potential to contribute to training the next generation of scientists, engineers, and designers for cyber-physical systems.</AbstractNarration>
