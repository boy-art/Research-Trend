    <AbstractNarration>Almost as remarkable as the ability to know one language is the ability to learn a second. However, current understanding of how the human brain acquires, organizes, and processes multiple languages is highly limited. A fundamental issue is whether multiple languages are represented in common brain areas. When monolinguals read, words enter the cortex at its posterior tip, and work their way forward. Within two-tenths of a second, the words are encoded visually, and then in the next three-tenths of a second they are encoded for meaning in specialized areas of the left temporal and frontal lobes. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Eric Halgren and Dr. Jeffrey Elman of the University of California at San Diego, with their colleagues, will study word encoding in young adults reading words in their native Spanish, or in their second language, English, which most have been using since they started school. Cortical neurons process information using electrical currents, which in turn produce minute magnetic fields. These will be detected using arrays of superconducting quantum interference devices as the magnetoencephalogram, and then mapped to particular cortical areas using magnetic resonance imaging. Experiments will determine if the English and Spanish words are encoded in the same areas. Specifically, experiments will test a model that hypothesizes that the second language does engage the same areas as the first, but in addition accesses the corresponding areas in the right hemisphere. Experiments will also attempt to confirm the suggestion that the second language uses brain areas which are otherwise engaged in high level vision, and explore if the second language is characterized by perceptual representations of words. Experiments will test how early in the processing stream English and Spanish words diverge, and whether this divergence is due to top-down strategic control or quick categorization. Subjects will vary in how well they know English and when they began learning it, so that the effects of age of acquisition, order of acquisition, and proficiency can be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research brings together neural, cognitive, language and imaging sciences, providing interdisciplinary training, especially for bilingual Spanish-English students, and introducing neuroimaging to a societal problem previously approached mainly behaviorally. Over two-thirds of the global population is multi-lingual. Bilingualism binds together the multiple American subcultures, being essential for socioeconomic integration of recent immigrants, and for the access of American goods and services to a global marketplace. Yet, second language education is often ineffective. A clearer picture of how the brain organizes multiple languages will form part of the scientific basis for developing effective second language teaching methodologies.</AbstractNarration>
