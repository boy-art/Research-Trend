    <AbstractNarration>0901116&lt;br/&gt;Karl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the 2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) to be held June 29-July 1, 2009, in Boston, MA This symposium is the sixth in a series and is co-sponsored by two IEEE societies: the Signal Processing Society (SPS) and the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Science (EMBS). The ISBI is a forum for researchers particularly interested in the computational and modeling aspects of biomedical imaging. Methodologies emphasized in the forum could apply to multiple imaging modalities and to imaging at varying scales. Topics for the forums include physical, biological and statistical modeling of biological and anatomical structures, image formation and reconstruction, computational image analysis, statistical image analysis, visualization, and image quality assessment. The meeting aims to facilitate cross-fertilization of methodologies between different imaging modalities and scales, with applications ranging from the nano, molecular and cellular levels through small-animal imaging and macroscopic to whole-body clinical systems. This symposium will be of great educational benefit and be inspiring to junior researchers and students across many fields.</AbstractNarration>
