    <AbstractNarration>Information Science and Systems (33) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes the Information Assurance Excellence Program (IAEP) to address the need for Information Assurance specialists in federal government agencies. The program creates a long-term recruitment pipeline that includes recruiting students on campus, creating agreements with community colleges, and providing early exposure for high school students. In addition to enrolling in courses as a cohort, the Scholars engage in professional and career development activities in which they deliver technical workshops and have opportunities to engage in discussions with practicing professionals. They participate in technology competitions and they work on research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation of the program components and its overall effectiveness contributes to the body of knowledge and best practice strategies for successful recruitment, mentorship, retention and placement of Information Assurance professionals. This program emphasizes practice. Under the mentorship of experienced faculty and alumni IA professionals, IAEP students are required to work in applied activities beyond the classroom. Specific requirements include the dissemination of skills based learning in the form of presentations and workshops, peer outreach to community colleges and high schools, and participation in regional IA competitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IAEP recruitment efforts focus on attracting a diverse range of applicants from CSUSB and community colleges, many of whom are likely to be students from underrepresented groups. By offering mentoring and support to increase the scholarly abilities of these future professionals, and by maintaining these support mechanisms throughout their internships and in their ultimate placement, the program experiences little attrition. The results of the program form a replicable model that can be disseminated to other participating Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>
