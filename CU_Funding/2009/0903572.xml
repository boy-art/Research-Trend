    <AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award aims to further our understanding of gravitational physics in areas ranging from fundamental theory to astrophysical phenomena. Despite the fact that General Relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, is well-confirmed by many tests and observations, outstanding puzzles in both cosmology and quantum gravity motivate investigation of the properties and predictions of various modifications. This research will study, in particular, theories with a preferred reference frame. The focus will be on stability and dynamical viability of such theories. A second theme of the research concerns properties and phenomena associated with spinning black holes, which are the universal endpoint of complete gravitational collapse. Topics to be studied include the mathematical description of such black holes, the limitations on their spin rate, and mechanisms that might produce the extremely energetic jets of matter that are observed to be ejected from their neighborhood. A particular such mechanism involves magnetic energy concentrated in tube-like structures behaving as elastic strings. A third area of the research aims to develop a better understanding of the nature of the entropy of black holes and other influence horizons. In particular, while this entropy appears to obey the second law of thermodynamics, the exact meaning of that statement and its validity remain murky. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research on modifications of General Relativity will produce a better understanding of the possibilities and problems that entails, and new ways to test the theory and to interpret anomalies if such should arise. The work on spinning black holes will provide insight into the dynamical behavior of such objects, and may contribute to understanding the origin of the high energy jets they sometimes generate. The work on black hole entropy attempts to capitalize on the tantalizing hints of black hole thermodynamics, to use those hints to discover principles of that may govern the underlying theory of quantum gravity. The results of this research will be disseminated through written articles, as well as seminars, conference talks, and lecture series. The research will help to train future scientists in both this research area and related fields through graduate and undergraduate courses taught at the University of Maryland, and through the supervision of research by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs. In addition the PI will give scientific talks to the public in various forums, to share the insights and excitement that science has provided about the universe and our place in it.</AbstractNarration>
