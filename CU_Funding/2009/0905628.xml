    <AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to study various problems in the field of geometric partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations. For example, he would like to study the qualitative behavior of the Ricci flow on manifolds with positive isotropic &lt;br/&gt;curvature. In particular, the PI would like to analyze what kinds of singularities can occur along the flow. In another project, the PI intends to study &lt;br/&gt;the Yamabe problem on manifolds with boundary. The goal here is &lt;br/&gt;to construct conformal metrics that have constant scalar curvature in &lt;br/&gt;the interior and zero mean curvature along the boundary. The PI also intends&lt;br/&gt;to study ancient solutions to the Yamabe flow on the n-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;sphere. This question is motivated by a classification result, due to &lt;br/&gt;Hamilton, Daskalopoulos, and Sesum, for ancient solutions to the Ricci &lt;br/&gt;flow on the two-sphere. &lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with questions at the crossroads of analysis &lt;br/&gt;and differential geometry. The use of analytical techniques in geometry &lt;br/&gt;has been extremely successful in recent years. In particular, Hamilton's &lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow plays a key role in Perelman's solution of the Poincare conjecture, &lt;br/&gt;as well as in the proof of the Differentiable Sphere Theorem &lt;br/&gt;by Richard Schoen and myself. The goal of the project is to gain a &lt;br/&gt;better understanding of these geometric evolution equations, and their &lt;br/&gt;qualitative properties.</AbstractNarration>
