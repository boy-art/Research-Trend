    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12) Two instruments, a handheld X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) and an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) are being integrated into undergraduate laboratories in the departments of Chemistry, Geosciences, and Biology at Trinity University. This integration of analytical tools into undergraduate curricula is helping address three primary goals: improving science and non-science major learning by engagement in interdisciplinary endeavors; improving student depth of understanding of elemental analysis methods; and increasing multidisciplinary interactions among faculty and students which in the long term will fundamentally transform STEM education on the Trinity campus. Project faculty are developing new, engaging laboratories for non-science and science majors that involve hands-on use of these sophisticated, research-grade instruments. The strategy of using relevant (environmental water samples), unique (museum paintings and artifacts), and interdisciplinary samples and problem frameworks (distribution of metals in soils and plants and ecosystems) is intended to better capture student interest than traditional isolated experimentation within a discipline. Elemental analysis methods are being explored at a variety of skill levels across a broad range of disciplines. The impacted courses and programs are affecting a large percentage of female and minority students. This equipment is being used by at least three departments and by two community partners. An outside, experienced consultant is performing formative and will be performing summative assessments of the project. The dissemination plan includes conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and web based materials (sites hosted by both Trinity University and the NSDL) that target multidisciplinary audiences.</AbstractNarration>
