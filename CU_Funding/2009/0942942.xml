    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;This project is implementing findings from research on note-taking strategies and metacognition to enhance students' learning in engineering courses. To this end, the project is developing a set of enhanced guided notes (EGNs) for a sophomore level electrical engineering for non-majors course. Enhanced guided notes are instructor-prepared-notes with spaces available for students to add comments and other annotations during and after the class. In addition, the EGNs require students to assess their metacognitive knowledge, create additional electronic notes of their own, and then share them with their classmates. The project has five goals: (1) to develop EGNs for classroom instruction on electric circuit concepts; (2) to implement EGNs in the electrical engineering for non-majors at Utah State University; (3) to evaluate and compare the learning performance of students who use the EGNs and those who use standard guided notes; (4) to understand the students' use of their metacognitive knowledge during engineering classroom lectures; (5) to understand how students' note-taking skills are improved through their engagement in collaborative online note-taking activities; and (6) develop guidelines for the creation and implementation of enhanced guided notes. The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an independent evaluator. The project's results are being disseminated through conferences and journal publications and the EGNs and other course materials are being made available for free download from the project's website.</AbstractNarration>
