    <AbstractNarration>Lay Abstract&lt;br/&gt;MCB-0963666&lt;br/&gt;Goldman, Robert&lt;br/&gt;2010 Intermediate Filament Gordon Research Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. Intermediate filaments (IF) are important structural proteins located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of vertebrate cells where they help to form the so-called "cytoskeleton" and "nucleoskeleton", respectively. They provide the cell with stability as well as mechanical resilience. IF represent one of the largest gene families, with over 70 genes coding for the proteins which are tissue-type specific and expressed in a developmentally regulated manner. Recent studies on IF interactions with other cytoskeletal and nucleoskeletal elements provide important insights into their unique contribution to the structure and function of cells in many different tissues. Importantly, defects in IF are responsible for a great many human diseases ranging from blistering skin diseases to muscular dystrophy and premature aging disorders. These findings, combined with recent basic research showing that IF can regulate protein biosynthesis and gene expression demand a revision of the classical view of IF as primarily structural proteins and necessitates linking IF research to other research communities with an interest in protein folding, gene expression, and signaling. The planned Gordon Research Conference on Intermediate Filaments is designed to expose established IF research groups to researchers from different fields, offering an opportunity to enhance studies of the role of IF in basic cell structure and function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The Gordon Research Conference on IF brings together participants of junior, senior and minority ranks from all over the world who study IF proteins from functional, regulatory and structural perspectives. The GRC has traditionally fostered a free-flowing exchange of novel ideas, tools and reagents, and facilitated the establishment of productive educational and research collaborations with world renowned experts in the field of IF structure and function. GRC provides a unique cross-disciplinary setting in which junior and senior investigators from diverse backgrounds can come together for innovative and collaborative brainstorming in an informal, relaxed setting. Oral presentations and posters describing the most recent cutting-edge research provide the basis for give and take discussions among all participants. The exchange of information is open, lively and provocative, often evoking exciting new ideas that lead to fruitful collaborations. The program for the 2010 conference will have a major focus on novel structural and functional findings, their emerging role in cell signaling and organelle function, the enlarging list of associated proteins they interact with, and potential novel approaches for their study. The conference will provide an important entry into other disciplines relating IF functions to cell biology, neurobiology, physiology, cellular transport, cell architecture, cell division, cell signaling, and cell-cell interaction. In short, this conference will serve both a scientific and a training function.</AbstractNarration>
