    <AbstractNarration>CPS:Small:Collaborative Research: Methods and Tools for the Verification of Cyber-Physical Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to investigate and develop methods and tools for the analysis and verification of cyber-physical systems. The approach is to augment the methods and tools that have been developed at the University of Utah and the University of South Florida for modeling and verification of asynchronous and analog/mixed-signal circuits to address challenges in cyber-physical system verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a unified framework with methods and tools which include an integrated formalism to comprehensively model discrete/continuous, functional/timing, synchronous/asynchronous, and deterministic/stochastic behavior. These tools will also include algorithms to analyze behavior and verify that it satisfies the correctness requirements on functionality, timing, and robustness. Finally, they will include abstraction and compositional reasoning approaches to enable large systems to be analyzed and verified efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since cyber-physical systems are becoming ubiquitous, improvements in such systems such as higher reliability, better fault-tolerance, improved performance, and lower design costs will have tremendous positive impact on society. Results from this research will be transferred to the cyber-physical systems community and other application domains by both publishing papers in related conferences and journals as well as by freely distributing tools via the Internet. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in this multi-institutional research where they will be exposed to the latest research in formal and probabilistic analysis. Early involvement of undergraduate students may help encourage them to attend graduate school. This research project will also recruit underrepresented and female students to allow it to reach broader audiences.</AbstractNarration>
