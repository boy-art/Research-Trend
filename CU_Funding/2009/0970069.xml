    <AbstractNarration>This proposal from four physicists at the University of Kentucky concerns recent theoretical developments at the border between high-energy physics, mathematical physics, and condensed-matter physics. Over the past decade, the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence has proven to be a very useful theoretical "tool" for analyzing strongly coupled theories, i.e., theories for which a standard perturbative mathematical treatment is ineffective. This tool, which resulted from developments in theoretical high-energy physics, has already been used in order to study systems at the interface of high-energy and nuclear physics, such as the quark-gluon plasma. However, just in the past few years, a new direction for the AdS/CFT tool has become apparent --- this is to study strongly coupled systems in condensed-matter physics. This proposal aims to develop teachniques using the AdS/CFT correspondence in order to address difficult problems in equilibrium and non-equilibrium many-body systems near or at their critical points. The PI's also aim to study the entanglement entropy of topological states of matter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this would represent an entirely new way of attacking extremely difficult problems in condensed-matter physics, and has the potential to lead to important new insights in both condensed-matter physics and for the mathematics of the AdS/CFT correspondence itself. Thus, this proposal is not only interdisciplinary in its scope, but also potentially transformative in its research potential, exploiting the synergy between theoretical high-energy physics, mathematical physics, and condensed-matter physics. Additional broader impacts of this proposal are focused on the training of postdoctoral researchers who will work in this newly emerging discipline.</AbstractNarration>
