    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Photonic crystal fiber represents a new frontier in fiber-optic research. This project aims to investigate a novel platform concept based on core-to-cladding-to-core mode coupling and recoupling enabled by long-period fiber gratings inscribed in this type of fiber for resonance laser absorption spectroscopy. Specific project activities will include simulation of mode properties of select platform designs such as field distribution, overlap, and propagation loss using commercial codes; simulation-guided laser inscription and optical measurements of the platform structures for the realization of mode coupling and recoupling at prescribed resonance wavelengths; and measurements and assessment of the sensing capabilities of the optimal platform structures via resonance laser absorption spectroscopy of environmentally significant gases. This project will lead to a wealth of information on optimization of the platform structures for strong cladding mode coupling and recoupling and for resonance wavelength control so as to facilitate robust resonance laser absorption spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will provide a knowledge foundation for practical exploitation of novel fiber-optic sensing schemes. Successful outcome of the project has the potential to usher in a new sensing paradigm that fundamentally transforms the conventional fiber-optic evanescent field sensing approach. In addition, this project will provide an excellent opportunity for the training of a doctoral student as well as for valuable research experiences of a high school science teacher and several high school students in a frontier research area. The university-industry partnership under the GOALI mechanism will significantly enhance the translational prospect of university research, ultimately leading to commercial applications.</AbstractNarration>
