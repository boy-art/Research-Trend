    <AbstractNarration>The proper development of an embryo relies on the coordination and integration of numerous signals. Wnt proteins represent one such class of signals and are required for many different developmental processes including brain, spinal cord, kidney, limb, lung, skin, bone, gonad, eye, ear, and muscle development. When properly functioning, Wnt proteins are secreted from cells and form an extracellular concentration gradient that is typified by a graded decline in concentration over distance. The shape and the length of this gradient have profound effects on the way that target cells respond to the Wnt signal. The goal of this work is to define the role of Wntless, a protein that is known to regulate the activity and distribution of Wnt proteins. In particular, this project will examine the role of Wntless in establishing the shape and length of the Wnt gradient. Upon the completion of these studies, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which gradients are formed will be gained. These data will have relevance to our understanding of embryonic development and may have broad implications for research pertaining to birth defects and other diseases in which Wnt signaling is improperly regulated. Importantly, funding for this research will provide research-training opportunities for up to 12 undergraduate and Masters students at San Francisco State University, which has an unusually rich and diverse student population.</AbstractNarration>
