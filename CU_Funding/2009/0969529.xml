    <AbstractNarration>This award provides continued support for this particle astrophysics group to participate in the operation and analysis of data from the Very Energetic Radiation-Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). VERITAS is an array of four 12-m Cherenkov telescopes which use the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique to detect and characterize the flux of ~50 GeV to ~50 TeV photons from astrophysical sources. The VERITAS array has successfully operated for two years at its new permanent site at the Whipple Observatory basecamp and has already detected or discovered 21 sources of very-high-energy gamma-rays, including M82, the prototypical starburst galaxy whose detection by VERITAS this year represents the discovery of an entirely new class of gamma-ray emitter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Chicago group has been a key participant in the VERITAS project since its inception. From design and construction to commissioning and operation and now to analysis and interpretation, Chicago has assumed leadership roles in all aspects of VERITAS. This award will allow the group to continue in this capacity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the area of Broader Impacts, the field of TeV astronomy has impacts on many other fields of science, from the study of the high-energy particle acceleration to fundamental physics questions such as the nature of Dark Matter. The VERITAS project has always had a strong involvement of both graduate and undergraduate students. The telescope relocation this summer was accomplished in large part by undergraduate summer students. While much of the VERITAS outreach activity is concentrated at the Smithsonian facility at the telescope site, there is also a strong local effort. At Chicago, they continue to profit from a successful partnership with Adler Planetarium for producing public lectures and classes for high school teachers. Members of the VERITAS group frequently participate in these efforts.</AbstractNarration>
