    <AbstractNarration>This ADVANCE PAID project at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) will have as its focus advancing women STEM faculty at the institution. Specifically, several primary objectives will be achieved, including: facilitating women STEM faculty?s ability to advance successfully through their careers at UNH as leaders in research and teaching; increasing women STEM faculty?s capacity to influence policy and decisions at the institutional and national levels; increasing women STEM faculty satisfaction with resources and research support and minimize feelings of research isolation amongst women STEM faculty; and increasing women STEM faculty satisfaction with faculty colleagues, deans and chairs who mentor them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. UNH?s ADVANCE PAID program will build upon strategies implemented at other ADVANCE institutions with innovative approaches that will be initiated and customized for the needs of UNH women faculty. As such, the existing UNH Faculty Mentoring and Professional Development Program will be strengthened and STEM women faculty scholars will be advanced through the initiation of a partnership program between tenure track and research faculty and through the provision of incentives for tenured women to participate in academic leadership positions within and outside of UNH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The UNH ADVANCE PAID initiatives will enhance existing programs and provide resources to develop more substantial programs to advance STEM women faculty. Additionally, a significant component of this project will include the establishment of new research collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
