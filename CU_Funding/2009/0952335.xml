    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arctic region is home to over 40 indigenous languages from at least six genetically unrelated language families: Uralic, Altaic, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, Eskimo-Aleut, Dene-Yeniseian, Yukagir, and the isolate Nivkh. Rapid change in the Arctic has led to the endangerment or extinction of the indigenous languages, and the relative geographic isolation of the region has further created difficulties in recording these changes. Maps provide researchers with a transparent way to organize and analyze heterogeneous, cross-disciplinary data. And the centralization of distributed geolinguistic resources on the Polar Regions will ensure that such data is readily available to all researchers in the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "ICE:Integrating Cartographic Elements: Creating Resources Emphasizing Arctic Materials (ICE)? project will integrate Arctic cartographic data and geolinguistic resources into a network of interlinked databases that is already maintained by The LINGUIST List (http://linguistlist.org). In addition, facilities will be developed to enable researchers to add data in real time to the geolinguistic database. At the same time, ICE will provide both cartographic and linguistic training to promising graduate students interested in the Arctic and the burgeoning new field of geolinguistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enhance existing map and language family data in the region, integrating these data with relevant non-linguistic information. The data will be of interest not only to linguists, but also to related scientific disciplines such as anthropology, geography, archaeology, history, and genetics. Moreover, the educational component of the project will indirectly benefit community groups. The project will develop the technical expertise of research assistants, and this expertise, as they move into linguistic field work projects, will become available to speaker communities in the Arctic.</AbstractNarration>
