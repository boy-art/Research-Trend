    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of the project is to analyze the interactions between plasmas and neutral particles by developing a three-fluid model. The three fluids are free electrons, the ions and the neutrals. The coupling comes via collisions among the different species and the electromagnetic field that connects different regions of interest. The purpose of the analysis is to provide a more physical and analytical understanding of the coupling. Rather than starting with complicated equations and a realistic geometry the approach here will be to conduct as much analytical analyses as possible. Additional terms and equations and more realistic geometries will be gradually introduced when the simpler ones are understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the theoretical analysis will be applied to the coupling between the magnetosphere, the ionosphere and the thermosphere, but the theoretical analysis could potentially be applied to many areas of space and astrophysical plasma phenomena. In particular the work has the potential to give new insight into the problem of chromospheric/coronal heating. Much of the research will be carried out by a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
