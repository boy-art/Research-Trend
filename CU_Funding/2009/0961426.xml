    <AbstractNarration>This study builds upon the theory of local legal cultural and the organizational analysis of criminal courts by considering how these factors work together to enhance courtroom efficiency. This research explores the relationship among several elements of criminal courts (management tools, legal culture, and institutional characteristics such as vertical prosecution) and their impact on courtroom efficiency and the timely administration of justice. It is unclear how well existing theories account for the complexity of crimes involving young victims, such as in child sexual assault cases. This project will examine whether current models of organizational court culture are robust vis-Ã -vis these cases, or alternatively, whether the theoretical models need to be refined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these research questions, this project will collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data from multiple sources including: an in-depth case study of three Oregon counties using an online survey administered to key stakeholders, site visits to conduct interviews with prosecutors, judges, and court administrators, and a review of relevant statutes and laws. The research team will also gather retrospective data on criminal justice processing of sexual crimes against children for the past two years from three Oregon District Attorney's Offices and conduct interviews with prosecutors on a sample of cases that took more than two years to be criminally resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on this topic is essential for developing comprehensive theoretical models to enhance the administration of justice. The results will: 1) identify a theoretical framework for understanding differences in case resolution time; 2) establish and promote effective models of prosecution; and 3) improve practice guidelines for prosecutors. By collecting data from key decision-makers in the court system, this study will have the broader impact of contributing to the enhanced comprehension of the nuances of legal institutions and criminal processing in terms of both theory and practice.</AbstractNarration>
