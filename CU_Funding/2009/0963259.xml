    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) to renovate the west wing of Stanley Hall, constructed in 1972 and shared by faculty in biology and chemistry. The renovation will affect about 5000 sq. ft. of laboratory space, which will be organized into "research neighborhoods". The theme of each research neighborhood will be dominated by the instrumentation it houses (analytical, biochemical, molecular, synthesis, and support). The renovation will provide house utilities that are currently inadequate or lacking, such as house air, vacuum, purified water and nitrogen gas, as well as improved storage, shelving and bench configuration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The faculty in chemistry and biology have a strong track record of collaboration. The renovated and reorganized space is expected to foster and stimulate further collaboration, new research projects, student research training and recruitment of new faculty as well as competitiveness and productivity of current faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earlham College serves a student body that includes 12% underrepresented minorities as well as students from underserved and rural areas. These students will benefit from enhanced research training. In addition, the renovated facility will be used for outreach activities and to stimulate collaboration with local industry.</AbstractNarration>
