    <AbstractNarration>Sexual traits such as courtship displays are often the most diverse features among closely related species. Understanding the origin and maintenance of diversity in nature thus requires understanding sexual selection (competition for mates and their gametes). Its basic mechanism hinges on the genetics of sexual traits, and recent findings about their genetic architecture are revolutionizing the field. This project will provide the most comprehensive information to date on the reaction norms of sexual traits (reaction norms are curves that show the forms that individuals of the same genotype can take in different environments). Different patterns in the reaction norms of male and females may have different consequences for sexual selection, all the way from hindering the process to initiating and promoting divergence. But we do not have enough data to assess which outcomes are common. This project will provide the foundation for making this assessment. This requires a study group in which sexual selection and environmental variation are known to influence divergence. This is the case in Enchenopa treehoppers, which are plant-feeding insects that communicate with vibrational signals (sounds that travel through plant stems.) Research methods involve quantitative genetics (in which breeding designs are used to estimate genetic parameters, as for example with cattle), and state-of-the-art laser vibrometry to monitor vibrational communication. This project will broaden the participation of under-represented minorities in science, and integrate research, teaching and outreach activities. Junior participants will be exposed to positive role models while more senior participants train in providing mentorship. The project will take advantage of Milwaukee's Urban Ecology Center to present core findings to the public in lectures and field activities.</AbstractNarration>
