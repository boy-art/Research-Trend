    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the project, which builds on prior NSF support, is to develop haptics-augmented software activities and Internet-based tutorials and to integrat these tools into undergraduate statics and dynamics engineering courses. Specifically the investigators are (1) developing a full suite of haptics-augmented statics and dynamics activities to complement standard textbooks; (2) evaluating these products in two large engineering schools; (3) developing curricula that integrates these products into statics and dynamics courses; (4) applying educational pedagogy research for experiential inquiry-based learning and implementing a learner-based hypothesis generation and testing procedure to encourage learners to translate tactile responses to their real world causes; and (5) using a design research approach in the evaluation process to make it an integral part of the development process. They are working to commercialize a unique CD-based set of software activities and tutorials that will enable students to change parameters, predict answers, interact with animations, and feel the results through the haptic device. The evaluation effort, under the direction of an experienced, independent evaluator, is examining student work captured on video along with student surveys and focus groups to monitor student learning. The broader impacts will include the dissemination of their products and results, particularly through commercialization and linking the material to successful textbooks.</AbstractNarration>
