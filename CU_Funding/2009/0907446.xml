    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI (John Millson) proposes three main lines of research all within the general framework of reductive algebraic groups and geometry. &lt;br/&gt;In the first main line (with Jens Funke) the PI continues his project of using the theta correspondence and differential geometry to construct&lt;br/&gt;Siegel (resp. Hermitian) modular forms that are generating functions for the intersection numbers of certain (special) cycles&lt;br/&gt;in locally symmetric spaces of orthogonal (resp. unitary) groups. The second main line deals with the ring R of projective invariants of n ordered points on the&lt;br/&gt;projective line. This ring was much studied by the invariant theorists in the late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;br/&gt;In 1894, A. Kempe found that R was generated by certain invariants of lowest degree. In the last year, working with Ben Howard, Andrew Snowden and &lt;br/&gt;Ravi Vakil, the PI computed the relations between the Kempe generators. They are quadratic, binomial and have&lt;br/&gt;a simple graphical description. The third main line is a continuation of the project dealing with the generalized triangle inequalities and related (saturation)&lt;br/&gt;problems from algebra. This project was the subject of the PI's most recent NSF grant, an FRG grant with Prakash Belkale, Thomas Haines, &lt;br/&gt;Misha Kapovich and Shrawan Kumar. This project is joint with Thomas Haines and Misha Kapovich. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI (John Millson) proposes three main lines of research all within the general framework of reductive algebraic groups and geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the proposal should have applications to number theory along the lines described by S. Kudla in&lt;br/&gt;his Beijing ICM talk and also to string theory (according to a preprint of Ai-Ko Lu).. The second part of the proposal is motivated in part because&lt;br/&gt;the problem completes work of mathematicians working in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries solving a one hundred year old problem. &lt;br/&gt;The third part deals with basic problems in representation theory e.g. decomposing tensor products and branching formulas which if solved would be of use in&lt;br/&gt;many disciplines.All the above projects are in collaboration with other mathematicians from within the USA or abroad. The PI presently&lt;br/&gt;has collaborations with eight mathematicians continuing a history of extensive collaboration (over forty joint papers).</AbstractNarration>
