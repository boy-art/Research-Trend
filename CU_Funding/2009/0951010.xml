    <AbstractNarration>When confronted with predators, many animals engage in lengthy, conspicuous displays. These antipredator signals are often assumed to be alarm calls that function to warn other individuals about the predator. However, recent research has shown that many of these anti-predator displays may actually be an attempt to communicate with the predator itself. Currently, little is known concerning the function and evolution of communication between two antagonistic parties, like predators and prey. This project will examine several hypotheses about the function of predator-prey communication by focusing on displays given by small mammals when they encounter rattlesnakes. The investigators will use video surveillance equipment and radio telemetry to document natural interactions between rattlesnakes and small mammals in the field. They will also design biorobotic animal models that can recreate key elements of the displays for experimental "playbacks". This playback approach will allow researchers to examine how specific behaviors used by small mammals may modify snake foraging behavior, and will provide the first experimental examination of key predictions derived from predator-prey communication theory. This project will provide novel insights into honesty in animal communication, antagonistic coevolution, and the role of receiver sensory systems in shaping signaling behavior. In terms of broader impacts beyond basic biological science, this project will (1) establish collaborations between ecologists and mechanical engineers to develop next-generation robotic technologies for the study of animal behavior; (2) increase participation of underrepresented minorities in research science; (3) develop public outreach through lectures, popular articles, radio, and documentary films; and, (4) provide mentoring for several undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
