    <AbstractNarration>The College of Science and the College of Education and Allied Studies at California State University, East Bay (CSUEB), the Alameda County Office of Education (ACOE), the Stephen D. Bechtel Jr. Foundation, and the Edward Teller Foundation are collaborators on the CSUEB Noyce Teaching Fellowship program. This program increases the number of highly qualified science and mathematics students who obtain a teaching credential and master's degree at CSUEB. It provides scholarships for the first credential/master's year and salary supplements for the subsequent four teaching years for two cohorts of eight Fellows. These sixteen Noyce Fellows complete an innovative cohort-based teacher preparation program, acquire laboratory experience and take advantage of a professional support network and mentoring, which helps them to succeed as teachers in high-need school districts. Throughout the program and into the Fellows' first teaching years, ACOE provides state-of-the-art professional development, in order to retain these new teachers who possess exemplary depth of mathematical and/or scientific content knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science fellows complete the Master's program that is jointly offered by the Department of Teacher Education at CSUEB and the Edward Teller Educational Center at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Partnering with the LLNL provides rigorous scientific training to this group of nascent teachers. This Master's program offers students graduate credit for participation in three summer seminars taught by laboratory scientists and other professionals at LLNL. During the 4th seminar, students are paired with an LLNL scientist with whom they conduct research for 6-7 weeks daily; this typically results in a publication or poster which may appear in a national, refereed journal. Mathematics fellows complete the Master's in Teacher Education, Option in Curriculum at CSUEB. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSUB Noyce Teaching Fellowship program recognizes that successful teachers must be able to adapt their teaching methods to meet the demands of diverse learning styles in the classroom. Therefore, the CSUEB program is structured to enable students to combine core knowledge and effective teaching methods that will produce successful learning experiences. The Noyce Fellowships support students in CSUEB teacher preparation and Master's programs that promote teamwork, leadership and problem solving and cultivate professional experiences that are designed to strengthen competence, enhance self-confidence and increase the likelihood of committing to teaching as a career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Noyce Teaching Fellows are expected to become leaders within their schools and districts and furnish the tools that will enable underrepresented groups to be competitive within the increasingly mathematical, scientific and technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
