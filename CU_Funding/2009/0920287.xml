    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fungal diseases of crops are economically and environmentally costly because they reduce yields and require large-scale applications of fungicides. Many pathogenic fungi enter leaves through stomata, which are pores on leaf surfaces involved in gas exchange and water movement through the plant. The mechanisms through which fungal pathogens sense and penetrate stomata are complex and poorly understood. This project focuses on defining the biochemical and genetic basis of stomatal infection in Cercospora zeae-maydis, a widespread and devastating pathogen of corn. To accomplish this goal, fungal genes involved in infection will be identified, and their functions will be determined. Additionally, plant-derived signals that influence stomatal infection will be identified. This information will provide a clearer understanding of stomatal infection by fungi in general, and a detailed model of how C. zeae-maydis infects corn. By clarifying an often-overlooked component of plant disease, this work will assist efforts to develop new sources of durable resistance against agronomically important plant diseases. Integral to the project is the training of post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students, with particular emphasis placed on broadening the participation of groups currently underrepresented in science. Additionally, the investigators are partnering with the Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service to distribute findings from this project through electronic and print media, regional and national presentations, and direct consultations with stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>
