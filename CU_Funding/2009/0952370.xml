    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professor Seth M. Cohen at the University of California- San Diego for a research project that will use post-synthetic modification (PSM) to alter metal organic framework (MOF) materials to introduce a range of functionalities without disrupting the overall structure and porosity of the MOFs. Post-synthetic modification is emerging as a useful tool to access functionalized MOFs that cannot be prepared directly. These materials will be useful as both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Although there are now quite a few examples of MOFs that have been used as heterogeneous catalysts, the proposal correctly identifies catalysis as an area of MOF chemistry that is under-developed. Preliminary studies show that chiral substituents, organocatalytic groups (carboxylic acids, ureas), and metal-binding groups can be readily introduced into MOFs by PSM. Early studies show that these modified MOFs are useful for catalytic reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Cohen will perform research that contributes to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) becoming more widespread as a material of choice for energy, catalysis, and biomedical applications. Based on these technological applications, and because of the growing importance of postsynthetic modification (PSM) of MOFs, Professor Cohen's work has garnered substantial attention from outside the immediate MOF community. Most notably is a recent paper on the use of MOFs as solid-state catalysts via PSM (Angew. Chem. 2009) that has gathered substantial attention in the catalysis discipline. This proposal also includes a novel broader impacts/teaching activity to develop internships and coursework in science policy. A Science Policy Summer Program at the University of California Center in Washington D.C. (called UC in DC) is being created. The PI is the Director of this new program that involves training of physical, biological, mathematical, and engineering science students in the importance of science in public policy. The program will involve special activities such as seminars, tours, in addition to coursework and science policy internships. This innovative program will impact students across the University of California system, and help to create a generation of scientists who better appreciate their role in society and in government.</AbstractNarration>
