    <AbstractNarration>TERC, in close collaboration with the Mason School in Roxbury, MA, the Benjamin A. Banneker School in Cambridge, MA, Newton Massachusetts Schools, and scientists and linguists from Tufts University in Medford, MA, Clark University in Worcester, MA, and Boston University, in Boston, is conducting a four-year project to enhance and study the development of elementary science teachers' skills in managing productive classroom talk in inquiry-based physical science studies of matter. The project hypothesizes that aligning professional learning with conceptually-driven curriculum and emphasizing the development of scientific discourse changes classroom culture and increases student learning. The project deliverables are new web-based resources, Talk Science! PD, to help elementary teachers better facilitate scientific discourse. These resources are comprised of two nine-week professional development courses for 4th and 5th grade teachers. The resources are being designed in collaboration with scientists, linguists, and cognitive psychologists to develop media-rich video case-based learning experiences that enhance teachers' understanding of the science and classroom discourse. The resources are closely aligned with the newly-developed, NSF-funded Inquiry Curriculum, a curriculum for elementary grades about the nature of matter and the conceptual development of material, mass, volume, and density. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is studying three research questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. How do teachers' awareness, understanding and skills for supporting science talk change as they use Talk Science!? &lt;br/&gt;2. How does student talk change as a result of changes in teachers' language-related actions? &lt;br/&gt;3. How do classroom discourse patterns change as a result of changes in the teacher's action? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resources are being evaluated through a comprehensive pre/post evaluation plan. The project is documenting teachers' learning and closely studying the changes in discussion patterns in 18 science classrooms from urban, suburban and rural schools in Massachusetts and Vermont. The products and research results of the project are being disseminated widely through conference presentations and publication of articles in appropriate professional journals.</AbstractNarration>
