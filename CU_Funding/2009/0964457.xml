    <AbstractNarration>This project studies an important class of complex structured planning &lt;br/&gt;domains called ``service domains'' using simulators and probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;action models. Examples of service domains include optimizing emergency &lt;br/&gt;response in a typical city, scheduling doctors and nurses in a &lt;br/&gt;hospital, administering tasks in a typical office, optimally delivering &lt;br/&gt;products to shops from distribution centers. These domains &lt;br/&gt;share many characteristics such as relational structure, parallel actions, &lt;br/&gt;multi-time-scale decision making, exogenous events, and the need for &lt;br/&gt;human interpretable solutions that make them highly challenging.&lt;br/&gt;The project develops scalable and principled planning algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;service domains through a variety of techniques including a novel&lt;br/&gt;hierarchical framework of multi-time-scale optimization, new&lt;br/&gt;model-free simulation-based planning algorithms, and model-based &lt;br/&gt;planning via composition of first-order decision diagrams. These &lt;br/&gt;techniques are applied to the real-world problem of optimizing &lt;br/&gt;the fire and emergency response in cities through a collaboration&lt;br/&gt;with the fire department of Corvallis, Oregon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the project include new algorithms and frameworks to solve &lt;br/&gt;service domains, prototype implementations of the algorithms&lt;br/&gt;in the emeregency response domain, and new testbeds of service domains &lt;br/&gt;for research. The broader impact of the work includes more cost-effective &lt;br/&gt;emergency response systems, and development of new research-oriented courses, &lt;br/&gt;tutorials and special workshops on the next generation decision support &lt;br/&gt;systems for service domains.</AbstractNarration>
