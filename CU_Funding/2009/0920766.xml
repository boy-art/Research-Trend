    <AbstractNarration>Robert A. Sharrock&lt;br/&gt;IOS-0920766&lt;br/&gt;Title: Structure, function, and signaling mechanism of plant phytochromes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunlight is a major source of the energy used to drive life processes on earth. Photosynthetic prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms have existed for 1-2 billion years and, throughout that time, have had an immeasurable influence on the planet and its atmosphere. Land plants and their products constitute the major food and energy sources for humans. Furthering our understanding of the ways in which plants sense and adapt to their light environment and how they respond to environmental light variation arising from competition, seasonality, and atmospheric change represent critical areas of scientific study. In plants, red (R) and far-red (FR) light directly regulate development, reproduction, and circadian rhythms. R and FR are sensed by the phytochromes, a family of five photoreceptor types that exhibit R/FR-reversible structural changes and biological activities. The objectives of this project are to determine the physical and genetic interactions between the different phytochrome forms in plant cells and between the phytochromes and the partner proteins that transmit light signals within cells. In addition, the roles of specific regions of phytochrome molecules in mediating their functions will be characterized and new systems for directing the formation of specific combinations of phytochromes in plants will be developed. It is already clear that phytochrome interactions are critical to light sensing/signaling in plants and the objectives of this project target a deeper and more comprehensive understanding these photoreceptors and their mechanisms of action. Challenges in science education facing universities in predominantly rural areas include geographical and cultural isolation of rural students, notably minority and women students, limited access to mentoring relationships, and lack of opportunities to participate in enrichment programs. This proposal will directly result in improved access for undergraduate and graduate students to individual research experiences and interaction with the broader national and international scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
