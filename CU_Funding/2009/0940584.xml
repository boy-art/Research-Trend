    <AbstractNarration>The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) propose to broaden participation in computing by leveraging the Broadening Engagement program of the SC ("Supercomputing") conferences for 2010-2012. For more than 20 years, the SC conference series has been the "goto" venue for technical development, community building, and interdisciplinary activity in high performance computing, networking, and storage. SC brings together computer scientists, applications scientists, government, industry, and education and can play a major role in facilitating the diversification of the computing community and workforce. The SC conference has continued to reach out to underrepresented groups to stimulate their successful engagement with HPC. The current proposal leverages SC Broadening Engagement programs for SC2010-SC2012 and extends community support and development and builds on existing networks and alliances in the BPC community to visibly increase the level of participation of underrepresented groups in high performance computing and computing disciplines. The project will foster lasting, collaborative relationships between faculty, IT professionals, students, and computer and research scientists who attend the conference. The project will be co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and ACM and with NSF support will provide participation grants, networking, mentoring and research opportunities during and beyond the SC10-SC12 conferences.</AbstractNarration>
