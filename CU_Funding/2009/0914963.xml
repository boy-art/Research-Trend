    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The immersed boundary method is a popular numerical scheme to simulate problems problems of fluid-structure interaction. Despite the popularity of the immersed boundary method, its convergence properties are poorly understood. The goal of this proposal is to build a convergence theory of the immersed boundary method and to develop efficient implicit methods to &lt;br/&gt;overcome numerical stiffness often encountered in application. A salient feature of the immersed boundary method is the use of regularized Dirac delta &lt;br/&gt;functions to handle the presence of sharp interfaces within the computational domain. This idea is now widely used beyond the immersed boundary method in multiphase and complex flow simulations in the context of front-tracking and level-set methods. The theory developed here should also contribute to&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of such methods. One of the major difficulties in applications of the immersed boundary method is numerical stiffness, necessitating the practitioner to use very small time steps to avoid numerical instability. Building upon previous work, efficient implicit methods will &lt;br/&gt;be developed to overcome this difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phenomena in which fluid and elastic materials interact abound in nature and engineering. Important examples include blood flow in the heart, swimming and flying of birds and insects, and flows that arise in industrial processes. Computational investigation is very important in understanding such phenomena, and the immersed boundary method is one of the most popular computational methods to simulate such problems. In this project, we seek to develop more accurate and efficient ways to perform immersed boundary computations. One important ingredient for this is to develop a theoretical framework to understand convergence properties of immersed boundary computations. Such a convergence theory should serve as a firm foundation upon which to develop better algorithms to simulate flows with immersed elastic structures.</AbstractNarration>
