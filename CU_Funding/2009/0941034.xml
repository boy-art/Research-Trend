    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the core of a strong undergraduate program in the STEM disciplines is the ability to offer students the opportunity to practice scientific inquiry throughout their academic experience. In this project, the use of modern technology and captivating concepts of current areas of research are being interwoven in the undergraduate curriculum. In a traditional curriculum design, lab experiments in modern physics topics are often reserved for advanced students in the physics major. Also relying solely on independent research with faculty is often neither feasible nor effective in helping undergraduate students develop the types of skills needed for graduate school and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project centers on incorporating a themed laboratory component in nuclear and particle physics into the curriculum at CSU, affecting high school and college students pursuing physics, engineering, and chemistry degrees. The project will take a multi-staged approach to improving the laboratory experience for our students by using modern research in recruitment and outreach programs, in introductory courses and in advanced teaching labs. Through the thoughtful choice of experimental teaching laboratory modules, this project will provide students with comprehensive guided-inquiry experiences: foster their interest in science, train them in the use of technology, introduce them to the methodology of current experimental techniques, and prepare them for successful collaboration in the research areas of the faculty members in our department. In this stage of the project, we are focusing on detector techniques for particle and nuclear physics experiments.</AbstractNarration>
