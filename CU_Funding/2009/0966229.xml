    <AbstractNarration>0966229&lt;br/&gt;Kaviany&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates how heat that is generated during energy conversion in a solid state device can be recycled before it becomes wasted, thus make the energy conversion process more efficient. Examples include devices that both (a) produce or use photons and (b) are employed in modern communications, diagnostics, and high-power applications such as the rare-earth doped solid-state lasers and light-emitting diodes. Currently, excess heat that is generated in these photonic devices has limited both their efficiency and their broader implementation. In this research, phonon recycling, which uses emitted phonons to assist in the photon emission process, is employed to alleviate excess heating and improve photonic efficiency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Phonon recycling is a new approach to the atomic-level design of thermal systems. A quantum mechanical approach that accounts for energy carrier population nonequilibra will be taken in order to predict the performance of devices that utilize phonon recycling. The theory will convert the current picture of electron-photon dominated transport to a phonon-oriented view, thus removing barriers that have historically limited the understanding of the fundamental phenomena in such systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The research will be integrated with the continued development of atomic-level heat transfer research and education. In addition to international outreach, a Heat Transfer Physics entry in Wikipedia (the online encyclopedia) will be developed to train and educate an international audience on topics involving phonon, electron, fluid particle, and photon transport.</AbstractNarration>
