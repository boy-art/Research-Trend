    <AbstractNarration>The team will study commonly-observed signatures of solar eruptions known as "coronal dimmings," in order to increase our understanding of the origins and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Coronal dimming observations provide timing and location information for CMEs, and can help provide insight concerning the energy budgets and evolving magnetic connectivity in CMEs. Dimming motions offer a dynamic view of CME magnetic footpoint evolution, and can aid in the determination of the length of time that strong magnetic connections between a CME and the solar surface can persist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the team will determine how dimming detectability relates to CME energetics and magnetic field morphology. They will also characterize the openness of CME magnetic fields by comparing remote dimming measurements with in situ observations of suprathermal bidirectional electrons (BDEs), and test whether a subset of CMEs actually evolve rooted externally to their source region, as is currently predicted. The Principal Investigator (PI) expects that this research will ultimately improve our ability to predict the heliospheric structure and impacts of CMEs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team includes several female researchers who will be role models for students, and in particular, for young women interested in the physical sciences and engineering. The participants will present their results from this investigation at community workshops and meetings. Since the PI has access to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in Boulder, Colorado, this research will have a direct impact on operational space weather forecasting. She will work with NOAA forecasters at SWPC to implement advancements in CME predictions as they become available during the project. A postdoctoral researcher based at SWPC will collaborate with the proposing team and with scientists from NCAR's High Altitude Observatory (NCAR/HAO).</AbstractNarration>
