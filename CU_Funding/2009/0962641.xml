    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conferences has sponsored 10 highly successful Plant-Herbivore Interaction workshops in the past. This will be the 11th and will feature 25 scientists currently conducting pioneering research in this area. The sessions are synthetic and range in topics from molecular genetics and biochemistry to community and ecosystem ecology and evolution. Speakers have agreed to address their subject's frontier and to project into the future, with the goal of generating discussion about the directions our science may take. The meeting will open with an overview entitled Perspectives in Plant Herbivore Interactions. Following, major topical areas to be addressed will be Herbivores in Complex Communities, Evolution of Herbivore Responses to Plant Chemistry, Plant Defensive Chemistry - Action &amp; Detoxification, Evolution of Plant and Insect Defense: Glucosinolates, Interaction Models: From Ecology to Genes, Extended Phenotypes and Evolution, Integrating Below Ground Interactions, and New Perspectives on Invasive Species. Like all Gordon Conferences, there are formal sessions in the morning and evening, leaving early afternoons free for impromptu field trips, discussions, and workshops. The formal sessions have been scheduled to maximize discussion; discussion leaders have been chosen to stimulate collegial discussion. Daily poster sessions in the late afternoon in a relaxed and convivial atmosphere, will also foster discussion. All attendees will be encouraged to submit posters, and history suggests that nearly all will do so. The relaxed and intimate atmosphere of this conference consistently generates excellent, stimulating interactions, and lasting networks, collaborations and friendships. This conference, like its predecessors will have its broader impacts by setting the course for research in this field for years to come. In addition, approximately 40% of funds will go to the support of graduate student and post-doctoral participation. Eight of the 25 speakers are female, nine are from outside the U.S. Half of the discussion leaders are female. As a result of this conference, new collaborations will be developed, new methodologies employed, new theories tested, and young/emerging scientists will interact with the top researchers in the field.</AbstractNarration>
