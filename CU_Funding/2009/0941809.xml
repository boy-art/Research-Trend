    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to develop an industry-based learning environment to prepare students to become skilled energy storage engineers and technicians in both the stationary and transportation sectors. The project is a partnership involving a four-year engineering technology program, two community colleges, and industrial partners from major battery manufacturers, solar energy developers, automobile manufacturers and suppliers. The investigators are creating an advanced energy storage curriculum; setting up an industrial-based energy storage laboratory; developing and delivering a short course for on-site training of engineers, technologists, and community college instructors working in the alternative energy field; and developing and delivering a series of workshops and seminars for K-12 science teachers, corporate partners, and energy and automotive professionals. The evaluation effort, under the direction of an expert from another university, is using pre- and post-tests instruments to measure knowledge and skills, student satisfactory surveys, and instructor observational checklists to monitor progress and final outcomes. They are disseminating their material and ideas through website postings, conference presentations, and journal article submissions. The broader impacts include the dissemination of the material, the outreach to K-12, the training program for current workers in the field, and a trained workforce in an important emerging area.</AbstractNarration>
