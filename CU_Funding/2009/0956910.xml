    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a commercial prototype of an aberration compensated focus control device. This device, based on a MEMS technology, will allow the user to deflect a deformable membrane mirror in a controlled manner in order to select a desired focal length. The device also features active control of low-order aberrations. This technology will enable the next generation of biomedical imaging devices for microscopy applications by enabling focus control and aberration correction in a simple, compact and low-cost sensor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are primarily in biomedical imaging. An industry partner is interested in using the technologys aberration correction capabilities to improve skin cancer detection with their confocal microscopy product line. Microscopy and endomicroscopy researchers at the University of Arizona have stated that this technology will be a valuable asset in their research in the fight against cancer. The company will also team with a recognized leader in MEMS technology to enable enhanced imaging capabilities, primarily for imaging in the field of ophthalmology.</AbstractNarration>
