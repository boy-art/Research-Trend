    <AbstractNarration>IIP 0968977&lt;br/&gt;Clarkson University&lt;br/&gt;Shuckers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clarkson University (CU) is planning to join the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR)" which currently is a multi- university center comprised of West Virginia University (lead institution) and the University of Arizona. CITeR focuses on research in identification which includes iris, fingerprint, and face recognition and helps enhance the research database available for the disciplines involved with security biometrics technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CU requests funding for becoming a site of the NSF Center for Identification Technology Research under the leadership of Professor Stephanie Shuckers. Clarkson University will help expand CiTER's focus on identity management to include a core of expertise that marries human identification with intelligence and cybersecurity. Emerging areas of research include how to contextualize the identity information with other information collected which includes people, places, patterns of activities, relationships, geospatial mapping, events, and signal intelligence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CITeR's research will assist industry and governmental agencies in advancing biometric technology which has broad impacts on stopping terrorism. This center will also have an impact on the participating students, and faculty through involvement with industrial members. Students will obtain hands on training to prepare them for high-tech jobs in the industry upon graduation. Faculty will get an exposure to industry-oriented research problems. The Clarkson site plans to work with McNair and CSTEP programs to encourage students to be active in this vibrant area.</AbstractNarration>
