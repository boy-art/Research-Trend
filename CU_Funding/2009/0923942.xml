    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project is aimed at developing devices for the detection of terahertz (THz) signals and a spectrometer based on these devices. To date, the lack of suitable electronic devices have made the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum inaccessible except by use of large and costly scientific instruments. The aim is to develop a simple, low-cost, low-power receiver which will make this important region accessible. The three critical components of the THz heterodyne receiver are an antenna, microbolometer/mixer and quantum cascade laser which functions as a local oscillator. With these novel components it is possible to develop a portable, field-deployable THz spectrometer capable of monitoring a wide variety of gases in its vicinity. The high-sensitivity spectrometer will allow rapid identification of chemicals and remote sensing of gases for environmental, global warming, and homeland security applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that the THz receiver, which has high sensitivity and high spectral resolution not achievable with existing devices, can be used in a much wider variety of imaging and screening devices. THz screening of personnel is non-invasive and harmless. Explosives and biological agents can be detected and identified even if concealed in clothing and suitcases because the THz radiation is transmitted through clothing and luggage. The proposed receiver also has a potential of providing THz imaging of biological materials and broad-band transmitting of digital signals.</AbstractNarration>
