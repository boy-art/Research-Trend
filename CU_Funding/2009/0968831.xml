    <AbstractNarration>I propose to work on p-adic interpolation of modular eigenforms, and on statistical issues in arithmetic arising from, for example, the recent advances in the conjecture of Sato-Tate; I will continue a long-range project, joint with Karl Rubin, to study Selmer groups; recently we have been applying our work in various directions. For example, to obtain some results in mathematical logic (we show that a piece of the classical Shafarevich-Tate Conjecture implies that Hilbert's Tenth Problem phrased for any commutative ring of in&amp;#64257;nite cardinality that is &amp;#64257;nitely generated over the ring of rational integers has a negative answer) and to resolve a conjecture of Darmon regarding a re&amp;#64257;ned form of the classical ''analytic formula'' for the &amp;#64257;rst derivative at zero of a Dirichlet L-function, and to study the proportions, in a family of quadratic twists, of the elliptic curves with 2-Selmer rank equal to a given number. Our goal is to make advances in each of these directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader issues that are the focus of the aspects of my proposal described above are the classical ones: determining the structure of solutions to polynomial equations; of delineating arithmetic problems that admit of no algorithmic solution; and studying the statistical features of data important to the study of arithmetic.</AbstractNarration>
