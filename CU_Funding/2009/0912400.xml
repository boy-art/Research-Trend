    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) series on Polar Marine Science provides an international forum for presentation and discussion at the frontier of polar research. The overarching goal of the conference will be to bring together marine scientists from wide ranging disciplines to better understand the implications of large-scale marine dynamics in polar regions. The 2009 GRC will approach themes within the context of a long-term, integrated system. To this end we will have speakers representing many disciplines of marine science, working in Arctic, Southern, and non-polar oceans. Invited speakers include scientists who have not historically participated in this GRC series, including those from the Palmer LTER and the recent Oden expeditions. The meeting has been moved to Italy in an effort to enhance international participation. The planned Conference will take place directly following the 2007-2009 International Polar Year (IPY), which has been one of the most significant internationally coordinated efforts yet undertaken in polar research. This conference seeks, as do all GRCs, to gather together leaders in the field and to bring them into contact with each other and with junior scientists (specifically graduate students and early career scientists) in an effort to seed new thought across this field. Funds will be used to enhance further the participation of early career scientists, particularly those from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
