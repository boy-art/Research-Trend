    <AbstractNarration>The project builds on the resources and results of a prior REESE project, Strengthening Tomorrow's Education in Measurement (STEM), that has produced a fine-grained analysis of the character and limitations of the spatial measurement content (length, area, and volume) in three elementary mathematics curricula. It will expand, deepen, and report STEM results for length, area, and volume but will also centrally address the task of putting that knowledge to work by improving educational practice. The project will complete the primary grades analysis of length, area, and volume and explore with the authors of the three elementary curricula ways to strengthen their existing materials. It will analyze the highly-regarded Singapore mathematics curriculum and compare and contrast findings with the U.S. results. It will also address issues relevant to the topic of measurement in the elementary science curriculum. It will develop and test effective ways of enriching preservice elementary teachers' knowledge of core measurement principles and work with practicing teachers to improve their measurement lessons using both innovative activities and existing curricular content. Finally, it will implement a three-year measurement mini-Center that will bring together major U.S. research and development scholars and projects for sustained interaction, innovation, and collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-year project is concerned with finding ways to strengthen instruction and learning of measurement in the elementary school mathematics curriculum. State and international assessments show U.S. children to be consistently underperforming in this content area. Difficulties are traced to significant weaknesses in conceptual and procedural understanding, including word problem solving. The project will compare the measurement approach used in the Singapore elementary curriculum with current U.S. elementary textbooks. Also, researchers and practitioners who work in the area of measurement in both science and mathematics contexts will participate in a yearly mini-Center with the goal of sharing findings and best practices relevant to the teaching and learning of measurement. Another interesting aspect of the study is the incorporation of findings in measurement courses for preservice elementary teachers, including relevant measurement experiences for practicing teachers. In the long term, the project is expected to provide a curriculum model that can potentially be replicated across the country.</AbstractNarration>
