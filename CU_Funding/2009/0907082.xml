    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This research program will develop understanding of novel one-dimensional electrical conductors; the metallic single-wall carbon nanotube, and the newly synthesized boron nanotubes. These form an ideal laboratory for studying one-dimensional behavior of electrons. The response of the nanotube to light will be measured, to determine how the individual electrons act collectively, and in what ways this differs from the behavior of macroscopic, three-dimensional conductors. This is important for understanding the possible use of nanotubes as interconnecting wires in future microcircuits. The broad range of research skills to be learned in microfabrication, optics, materials science and cryogenics will prepare graduate and undergraduate students for diverse career paths. Some of the advances in scientific understanding due to this research will be incorporated into an undergraduate seminar, Science of Modern Technology. In addition, visits to local elementary schools will have demonstrations of some of the ideas of optics and cryogenics that are used in the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This research program will develop understanding of novel one-dimensional electrical conductors; the metallic single-wall carbon nanotube, and the newly synthesized boron nanotubes. These form an ideal laboratory for studying one-dimensional electron physics. Propagation of plasmons, and spin-charge separation will be studied using measurements of the frequency-dependent absorption of power, in the far-infrared range of wavelengths.
