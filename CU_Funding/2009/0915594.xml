    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Doctoral Colloquium program at the 2009 iConference to be held on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill February 8 - February 11, 2009. This workshop will bring together 15 dissertation-stage doctoral students in diverse information and informatics subfields for one day of presentations, interaction, and feedback with five faculty members selected from among distinguished information researchers. The iConference Doctoral Research Colloquium is designed to assist doctoral students to become stewards of the information and informatics disciplines, by providing an opportunity for interaction with distinguished research faculty and for the development of a global cohort group of new researchers. This project provides support for the travel, lodging and registration of students, plus the registration for the participating faculty mentors, as well as the direct expenses of putting on the Doctoral Colloquium at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
