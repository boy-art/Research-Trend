    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is the theoretical and computational investigation of thermomechanical processes for manufacturing low-cost polycrystalline iron-gallium alloy (Galfenol) with properties comparable to expensive single crystals. Significant changes in properties occur during thermo-mechanical processing of Galfenol. Warm-rolled and annealed specimens retain high magnetostriction but become brittle; whereas, cold rolled specimens have high yield strength but lose their magnetostriction. The research will focus on predicting and controlling these changes by modeling microstructure evolution during processing. The validated model will capture crystallographic texture evolution, grain nucleation, grain growth and evolution of magnetization orientation using multi-scale crystal plasticity simulations. A finite strain homogenization technique will be developed to investigate final microstructural response under coupled magnetic and stress fields. Thermo-mechanical processes that lead to optimal properties will then be identified using a multi-scale sensitivity analysis algorithm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will lead to the development of inexpensive sensors and actuators in magnetomechanical devices including load sensors, energy harvesting devices, tracking and positioning systems. An educational tool for undergraduate engineering mechanics students will be developed that will allow graphical selection of microstructural features that maximize magnetostrictive actuator performance under various deformation modes. The research component will be integrated into a larger educational effort through graduate student training, hands-on research opportunity for undergraduate students through the SURE (Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering), SROP (Summer research opportunity for minority undergraduate students) program and outreach programs for K-12 education through the Office of Engineering Outreach and Engagement at the University of Michigan.</AbstractNarration>
