    <AbstractNarration>Despite the fact that mercury is well known to be dominantly associated with particulates in aquatic systems, surprisingly little is known regarding how this influences mercury methylation and transport in aquatic systems. Mining-impacted areas in Ecuador provide unique opportunities to examine the role of colloids in mercury transport due to the high levels of mercury in unlined mining impoundments. This planning visit will lay a platform to explore the following science questions: 1) Does association with colloids significantly alter the transport distances of mercury in subsurface and surface aquatic systems? 2) Does association with colloids significantly alter the rate or extent of methylation of mercury in aquatic systems? Knowledge gained from this research may help to mitigate mercury contamination in both U.S. and international settings. The work will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Ximena Diaz of Ecuador's National Polytechnic University, and will engage U.S. and Ecuadorian graduate students in project development activities. This planning visit will also support the development of two Ph.D. theses and one M.S. thesis by U.S. grad students.</AbstractNarration>
