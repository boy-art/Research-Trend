    <AbstractNarration>This award will fund the R&amp;D needed for future lepton collider detector and in particular the SiD detector concept. It has been designed to address fundamental questions of particle physics, including the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of mass, the unification of forces, and the structure of space-time at small distances, including possible evidence for extra dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SiD makes extensive use of silicon detectors, which are well-matched to the challenges of ILC physics and the machine environment. They are fast, robust against machine-induced background, and capable of very fine segmentation. SiD is based on silicon tracking and silicon-tungsten sampling calorimetry, complemented by powerful pixel vertex detection, and outer hadronic calorimetry and muon detection. This award will fund the development of a process for modeling of silicon pixel detector technology using commercial 3D software tools. To make a decision between the many proposed sensor and readout technologies, and to optimize parameters such as size and charge collection efficiency, the proposal will develop precise 3D modeling of various candidate technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is expected to have impact in education and outreach. There are ongoing activities at the participating universities are aimed at K-12 students an effective ways to reach students is through their teachers. New education and outreach efforts are centering on the ILC.</AbstractNarration>
