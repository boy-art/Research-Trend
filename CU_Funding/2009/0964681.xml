    <AbstractNarration>This project uses machine learning to accelerate the execution of a class of computer programs relevant to AI. Given a program and a class of inputs, the new methods automatically seek execution strategies that are fast while still achieving a high level of accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on the main inference algorithms that underlie statistical AI: dynamic programming, belief propagation, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and backtracking search. Each of these inference algorithms faces an enormous search space, iteratively extending or refining its picture of this space. Each algorithm must continually choose which computational step to take next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opportunity is to learn a strategy for making these choices. Some choices are on the "critical path" and help the system find an accurate output, while others lead mainly to wasted work. The learned strategy for evaluating choices in context may itself be computationally intensive, so the method learns to speed that up as well, within the same framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will disseminate software and will have broader impact on several fields. The targeted algorithms are central to natural language processing, speech processing, machine vision, computational biology, health informatics and music processing. Their ability to form a coherent global analysis of a set of observations is a hallmark of intelligence, and will enable artificial systems that aid human understanding and performance. Speeding them up is critical as researchers develop increasingly sophisticated statistical models.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the learning methodologies developed will be useful in other settings that attempt to learn computational or behavioral strategies.</AbstractNarration>
