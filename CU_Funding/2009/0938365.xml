    <AbstractNarration>This project is a conference on the "Foundations and Frontiers of Physics Education Research," in which established and up-and-coming researchers attend a residential conference to further the work of the field. There are 60 participants, including senior graduate students, research scientists, junior, and tenured faculty. The conference consists of a series of plenary talks by leaders in the community; working groups of participants to address common problems in the field and present recommendations for future work; and targeted sessions in which research topics are explored in detail by participants. Ample free time is also included, allowing for informal discussions and interactions that can lead to future collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: By bringing together the leaders of the physics education research community in an intimate setting, the conference promotes more intense discussions and more focused interactions than are possible at other meetings common to the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Establishing a more cohesive research community furthers the field of physics education research. Promoting the highest quality postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty strengthens their reputation in the community, supporting the growth of new leaders. Sharing results through plenary and targeted sessions spreads knowledge that advances the field. Finally, working groups answer questions of structural concern to the physics education research community. The results of the working groups are to be published in an American Physical Society Forum on Education newsletter, allowing them to be shared with a much larger audience than attends the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
