    <AbstractNarration>Tiospaye in Science is a scholarship program that aims to increase the number of American Indian students graduating from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) with bachelor's degrees in science. The targeted degree programs are chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiospaye is a Lakota word meaning 'extended family'; in this scholarship program, the extended family of science supports American Indian students in their academic, professional, cultural, and social activities. The financial support through the scholarships in combination with the web of support facilitated through one-on-one and one-on-small group contact with the science extended family serve as strong anchors to increase the pathways to success for American Indian students in science. The science extended family includes the scholarship recipients as well as the other students, staff, faculty, administrators, alumni/alumnae, employers, the community, student family members, tribal members, and tribal college partners - most notably Oglala Lakota College. Tiospaye in Science also partners with Tiospaye in Engineering, another scholarship program at SDSMT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through Tiospaye in Science, fifteen scholarships are being awarded to academically talented and financially needy students with a special emphasis on recruiting Native Americans that are members of federally recognized tribes, graduates of tribal high schools, or transfers from tribal colleges or universities. To ensure success for scholarship recipients, the program:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1. Recruits academically talented students with financial need and a commitment to a science career. &lt;br/&gt; 2. Retains these students in an environment that promotes academic and professional success, while supporting the students socially and in their cultural traditions.&lt;br/&gt; 3. Places these students in appropriate employment or further education through programs emphasizing career planning and professional options.</AbstractNarration>
