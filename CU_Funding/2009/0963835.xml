    <AbstractNarration>This project concerns one of the fundamental challenges facing&lt;br/&gt;contemporary science and engineering today, namely, the efficient&lt;br/&gt;processing and analysis of massive amounts of high-dimensional data,&lt;br/&gt;such as images, videos, web pages, and bioinformatics data. In short,&lt;br/&gt;data now routinely lie in thousands or even billions of dimensions. On&lt;br/&gt;the one hand, massive data collection is motivated by 1) scientific&lt;br/&gt;discovery and 2) the need for better engineering systems. On the other&lt;br/&gt;hand, the difficult task now is to conduct meaningful inference in&lt;br/&gt;such high dimensions, and draw correct conclusions from limited&lt;br/&gt;amounts of sample data and with limited computational&lt;br/&gt;resources. Fortunately, scientific or engineering data often have very&lt;br/&gt;low intrinsic complexity and dimensionality. This project addresses&lt;br/&gt;the opportunities offered by this common situation, establishes&lt;br/&gt;conditions under which reliable inference is actually possible, and&lt;br/&gt;develops computational tools for extracting key information from huge&lt;br/&gt;data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project is expected to have three outcomes: 1)&lt;br/&gt;the development of innovative mathematics needed to study the recovery&lt;br/&gt;of data matrices from partial and corrupted information 2) the&lt;br/&gt;development of effective algorithms for recovering low-rank matrices&lt;br/&gt;and performing accurate dimensionality reduction with corrupted data&lt;br/&gt;and 3) the development of novel applications in which these techniques&lt;br/&gt;are expected to considerably advance the state-of-the-art. With these&lt;br/&gt;new tools, scientists and engineers will be able to efficiently&lt;br/&gt;extract correct information from data, which was previously&lt;br/&gt;inaccessible or intractable by conventional techniques. This will&lt;br/&gt;enable the development of far better computer vision systems for face&lt;br/&gt;recognition, better compression schemes of video sequences, a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of gene expression data, or better search engines for&lt;br/&gt;web documents and images.</AbstractNarration>
