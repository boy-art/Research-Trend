    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI will investigate Sparsity Constrained Regularization (SCR) for solving the Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) inverse problem. Two recent algorithms are available for the implementation of SCR in DOT: the Generalized Conditional Gradient Method with Sparsity Constraint (GCGM-SC) and the Generalized Semi-smooth Newton's Method with Sparsity Constraint (GSNM-SC). The efficacy of GCGM-SC has been demonstrated with both theoretical and numerical results for linear and some non-linear problems. GCGM-SC, which has also been derived for linear problems, minimizes a given functional, not necessarily convex, with sparsity constraint with respect to a given basis. In this project, the computational aspect of the DOT inverse problem will be investigated to (i) develop a reconstruction algorithm for DOT using GCGM-SC, (ii) devise a strategy for computing adaptive basis such as finite elements to take full advantage of the sparsity constraint idea, (iii) extend GSNM-SC to nonlinear problems and compare GSNM-SC to Tikhonov regularization, and (iv) perform convergence analysis of the proposed GSNM-SC and GCGM-SC in DOT. The interdisciplinary research project seeks to integrate education and research and foster an international exchange of students. The educational activities in the project will include: (i) international research experience for students, (ii) student exchange between Clemson University and the University of Bremen, Germany, (iii) the incorporation of much of the research activities into teaching activities to help students bridge course materials with research, (iv) exposure of high school students to applied mathematics research, and (v) attraction of underrepresented groups to pursue applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) is a method for imaging a highly scattering medium using near infrared and visible light. For example, optical tomography of biological tissue has potential applications for the early detection of breast cancer. One major advantage of DOT is that it is less expensive and non-invasive as compared with x-ray mammography. DOT imaging technology also shows great promise as a tool for initiating discoveries in physics, biology, and medicine. However, despite its great potential, it has yet to be commercially or medically successful as the instability in image reconstruction results in the blurring of any resulting image. To overcome these difficulties, we will investigate novel mathematical techniques for image reconstruction. Research applications will vary from cancer detection in biomedical imaging to land mine detection in remote sensing to imaging objects in the ocean. Research results are also expected to contribute to scientific knowledge in neutron transport, transport in atmospheric science, photothermal spectroscopies and microscopies, laser pump probes, diffuse photon density waves and new tomography technologies, such as optical, electronic and thermal imaging, and biomedical diagnostics.</AbstractNarration>
