    <AbstractNarration>Abstract of proposal number 0936137 by Dr. Omnia El-Hakim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 0936137&lt;br/&gt;Title: A Proposal to Conduct a Mentoring Workshop for Underrepresented Minority Undergraduate Engineering Students and their Advisors.&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Shirley McBay.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Quality Education for Minorities Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Proposal # 0936137 title "A Proposal to Conduct a Mentoring Workshop for Underrepresented Minority Undergraduate Engineering Students and their Advisors" is an opportunity for students to meet outstanding mentors; and to understand the role of mentor and attributes of a good mentor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-day intensive workshop focused on mentoring of underrepresented minority undergraduate engineering majors. The goal of the workshop is to increase the participants' understanding of the role that faculty and peer mentoring play in enhancing the successful academic and professional outcomes of undergraduate engineering majors who are members of underrepresented minority groups. The workshop is planned for 150 underrepresented minority undergraduate engineering majors and 15 engineering faculty/staff advisors from 15 institutions with ABET-accredited engineering programs. The institutions will include seven Historically Black Colleges and Universities, five Hispanic-serving Institutions, one Other Minority Institution, and two Predominantly White Institutions. Each of the 15 institutions will be represented by 10 underrepresented minority undergraduate students and one faculty/staff advisor. Sessions will provide sharing experiences and best practices, learning about effective mentoring as well as build a plan for development of a peer support network and interaction. In addition, this proposal recognizes the importance of development of the whole person (i.e. communication skills, engineering in today's society, professional conduct, as well as academic preparation) and demonstrated commitment to diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; All presentations on the agenda will be placed on QEM's website and shared with interested students and faculty, whether or not they attended the workshop. Over the long-term, effective mentoring will pay off through an increase in the number of minority students who obtain baccalaureate and doctoral degrees in engineering that, in turn, will help strengthen the nation's global competitiveness in science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omnia El-Hakim, Ph.D.-Program Director &lt;br/&gt;For Diversity and Outreach&lt;br/&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;br/&gt;Directorate for Engineering&lt;br/&gt;4201 Wilson Blvd., Suite 505N&lt;br/&gt;Arlington, VA 22230&lt;br/&gt; Tel: (703) 292- 2149&lt;br/&gt;Fax: (703) 292- 9013&lt;br/&gt;E-Mail: oelhakim@nsf.gov</AbstractNarration>
