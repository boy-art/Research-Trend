    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI-R2: Acquisition of High Performance Deep Reactive Ion Etching System for Multidisciplinary Engineering Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to acquire a silicon deep reactive ion etching system to be installed and operated within the Shared Materials Instrumentation Facility at Duke University. The proposed system will be installed, operated and maintained with full-time engineering staff support for user training, operation and equipment maintenance. This arrangement ensures a sustainable long-term operation of the tool, while providing access to broad base of interested users from universities, non-profit research institutions and industry to serve as a regional resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal stems from the wide range of research this tool enables. The proposed system is capable of performing a wide range of silicon etching processes including high etch rate etch, high aspect ratio etch, deep sub-micron feature etch in the nanometer scale, smooth sidewall etch, minimal undercutting of silicon-on-insulator substrates, flexible sidewall profile control, and highly selective etch. This tool is expected to enable multidisciplinary research activities that encompass optical micro-electromechanical systems, metamaterials at the micro- and nano-scale, photonic crystals and nanophotonic devices, micro-power generators, precision packaging solutions for optical/electronic devices and systems, terahertz sources, microfluidic devices, and low-cost patterning technologies using molds and stamps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this program have educational and economical aspect. Addition of this capability to SMIF will provide graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to expand their research experience that will help train a higher quality work force, and enable local startup companies to develop their core technology that will lead to job creation and economic growth.</AbstractNarration>
