    <AbstractNarration>This project at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is creating a central Indiana pipeline to increase the number of students from the greater Indianapolis region (central Indiana) obtaining STEM degrees. Several activities involve Ivy Tech Community College Central Indiana and Butler University. The goals of this project are to increase the numbers of students of all demographic groups who pursue STEM academic and career pathways; participate in STEM research, industry internships, and honors activities; graduate with an undergraduate degree in STEM fields; and transition into industry, graduate and professional programs. The program has set a target of increasing the number of STEM graduates at IUPUI by 10% per year to produce an estimated 279 additional STEM graduates in the year 2015.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project employs and assesses the impact of several program-wide intervention strategies on student success. These intervention strategies include Summer STEM Bridge Academies, peer-mentoring and academic advising support for transfer students, Peer-led Teaching and Learning and Just-in-Time Teaching, Honor seminars, and Career Development services and internships. Numerous support services already are in place to assist with this initiative, making it possible for the project to integrate research and education on effective strategies for student learning in STEM disciplines. Additionally, the evaluation plan includes mechanisms for measuring the impacts of the individual initiatives and the effectiveness of the program as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project takes a coordinated and systemic approach to increasing undergraduate success in STEM at all levels, from pre-college, to the important first year experience, to the sophomore year and onto graduation, through leadership and career development. Dissemination of the project's results will occur through the web, peer-reviewed publications, and presentations to the local and national STEM community. A national conference will be hosted at IUPUI during the fourth year of the project, which will bring national leaders on STEM education, to share their knowledge of research and best practices, and for this project to showcase the work being done at IUPUI and other institutions on increasing the number of students completing STEM degrees.</AbstractNarration>
