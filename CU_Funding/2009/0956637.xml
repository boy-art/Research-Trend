    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project seeks to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a Web-based software that provides depression treatment for Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. A recent Pentagon study concluded that returning Iraqi and Afghanistan veterans are currently suffering from "daunting and growing mental health problems" with nearly 1/3 of these military personnel reporting symptoms of mental illness upon their return from combat. A lack of adequate available resources combined with a fear of stigmatization inherent in seeking face-to-face treatment, prevent as many as 77% of these military personnel from ever getting the treatment they need. The proposed innovation will enable the military's mental health professionals to offer an effective, evidence-based and drug-free depression intervention which will effectively mitigate stigma concerns faced by military personnel and will provide treatment at a fraction of the cost of the typical depression interventions available today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key innovation in this proposed research has the potential to create significant value by 1) allowing VA mental health professionals to provide an easily-accessible, evidence-based and drug-free depression treatment to returning military personnel suffering from depression 2) enabling veterans to seek treatment without having to face the fear of stigmatization inherent in seeking face-to-face treatment within the confines of a mental health care facility 3) reducing the economic burden on the military health care system by providing an effective and scalable depression treatment at a fraction the cost of today's typical depression interventions. With an estimated 5 million veterans and 20 million civilians in the U.S.A suffering from depression, cost-effective and innovative methods to help address this burgeoning healthcare problem are critical. Through further research, this Web-based framework has the potential to extend to many mental health problems that plague our country such as PTSD, Drug Abuse, Anxiety and Alcoholism.</AbstractNarration>
