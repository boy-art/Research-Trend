    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing a software application with social networking capabilities known as the Geoscience Student Data Network (GSDNet) that is being created in partnership with the National Geothermal Data System. GSDNet is enabling students to work in a single cyberenvironment where they are collaboratively and collectively contributing, accessing, manipulating, and analyzing data. GSDNet is also facilitating classroom instruction related to data management and modeling of earth processes via the integration of data layers and student-peer collaborations. The tool is being tested within a curriculum offered in parallel at City College of New York, a large minority-serving urban institution, and Boise State University. The project is developing three courses and supporting lab and field activities related to the applied research theme of geothermal energy. The project is exposing students from both institutions to field studies of geothermal systems and subsequently is requiring the two student populations to exchange ideas, information and data both in the field and in the classroom using the GDSNet cyberinfrastructure. The project is testing the efficacy of this approach, and also is assessing whether student communication skills involving writing and communication are improved via the use of GSDNet. Moreover, the project is determining how students from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds interact in the field and via the associated cyberinfrastructure. The field investigations are leading to individual senior thesis or independent study projects that are resulting in student research presentations at local and national conferences. The project is employing an iterative formative evaluation that is helping to improve the courses and the GSDNet in addition to a summative evaluation that is assessing the short- and long-term impacts of the curriculum and associated cybertools on student learning and performance. The PI and Senior Personnel are presenting the results of the program at conferences and through peer-reviewed publications. In addition, a series of webinar modules are being produced to raise awareness and provide training on the use of the GSDNet to the larger geosciences community. Summarily, the project focuses on developing and implementing cybertools and curricula that are better preparing students from diverse backgrounds for successful careers and graduate studies in the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>
