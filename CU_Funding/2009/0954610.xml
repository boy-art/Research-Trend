    <AbstractNarration>Professor Anne J. McNeil of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor is supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to study Ni-catalyzed chain growth polymerization for the synthesis of pi-conjugated polymers and copolymers. The aims of the proposed research include (a) obtaining insight into the mechanism of transition-metal-catalyzed chain-growth polymerizations, (b) synthesizing, characterizing, and evaluating new Ni0-arene -complexes as intermediates and initiators, (c) developing new synthetic methods to provide access to a new class of functional organic materials with novel properties and applications, and (d) elucidating the fundamental reactivity preferences when multiple monomers are used. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research promises to advance our understanding of the metal-catalyzed polymerization of conjugated polymers, with the potential of increasing the diversity of conjugated materials available for applications in technological devices, including thin-film solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in multidisciplinary research involving organic, inorganic, and polymer chemistry. Students and other faculty members will be engaged in a comprehensive overhaul of chemical entries in Wikipedia.</AbstractNarration>
