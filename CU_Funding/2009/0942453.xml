    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a computer and network security instructional laboratory (CNS-IL) to enhance undergraduate education in STEM disciplines. CNS-IL is designed to be a cost-effective, scalable, user-friendly, flexible, and remotely accessible virtual laboratory offering significant enhancements to undergraduate education in information assurance. It utilizes highly advanced Cloud Computing and Web 2.0 for easy experimentation of various computer and network security applications and attack scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instructional laboratory allows researchers and students to experiment and learn a variety of modern technologies such as Cloud Computing, wireless applications and provides a platform for studying emerging security issues in Cloud Computing. Using infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS) allows a share development results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project adopts clustering technologies that utilize surplus college computing resources so it can be easily set up in colleges with limited budgets and laboratory space. It is designed as a cost-effective solution since it uses open-source software with a rich set of experiment files and related course materials shared using modern Web 2.0 principles. This allows rapid dissemination in new laboratory developments in security-based curricula. Also, while the CNS-IL is designed mainly for undergraduate courses, it can be used as a showcase for high school student recruitment efforts.</AbstractNarration>
