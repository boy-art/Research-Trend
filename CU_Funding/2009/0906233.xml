    <AbstractNarration>The PI proposes, jointly with Toby Colding, to continue our&lt;br/&gt;investigations on minimal surfaces and related areas of geometric&lt;br/&gt;analysis, including geometric evolution equations such as the mean&lt;br/&gt;curvature (MCF) and Ricci flow. Our lamination theorem and one-sided curvature estimate&lt;br/&gt;played a key role in a number of results on minimal surfaces including the&lt;br/&gt;Meeks-Rosenberg proof of uniqueness of the helicoid, our proof&lt;br/&gt;of the Calabi-Yau Conjectures, and the Meeks-Perez-Ros proof of&lt;br/&gt;the uniqueness of the Riemann examples.&lt;br/&gt; Minimal surfaces with uniform curvature (or area) bounds have been&lt;br/&gt;well understood and the regularity theory is complete, yet&lt;br/&gt;essentially nothing was known without such bounds. The study is&lt;br/&gt;divided into three cases depending on the topology of the surface. Our understanding is relatively complete in the first case when&lt;br/&gt; the surface is a disk.&lt;br/&gt;The main problems are to get a finer understanding of compactness in the higher genus cases, to understand &lt;br/&gt;singularities of potential limit laminations (especially generic properties), and to understand moduli spaces &lt;br/&gt;like the space of genus one helicoids of &lt;br/&gt; M. Weber, D. Hoffman and M. Wolf (cf. with Hoffman and B. White). The second broad area of the proposal centers on the study of singularities in &lt;br/&gt;MCF, including estimates for the size of the singular sets, a compactness theorem for the possible types of singularities, and&lt;br/&gt; a classification of generic singularities of the flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minimal surfaces are surfaces that locally minimize their surface area and, thus, model soap films where surface &lt;br/&gt;tension is in perfect equilibrium and the film does not change other time.&lt;br/&gt;They have been studied at least since&lt;br/&gt; Lagrange's 1762 memoir, but recent years have seen&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs on many long--standing problems in the theory of&lt;br/&gt;minimal surfaces, with important contributions from many&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians. There is a time-varying analog of this where a surface (which is not in equilibrium) evolves to minimize its surface area as quickly as possible; this is called mean curvature flow or MCF. Mathematically, this leads to a nonlinear partial differential equation which is formally similar to the equation that governs the flow of heat in physics. Clearly, minimal surfaces remain static under the MCF. &lt;br/&gt;MCF and other geometric flows were developed for their intrinsic beauty as well as their &lt;br/&gt;potential applications to other &amp;#64257;elds &lt;br/&gt;to model, for instance, option pricing, motion of grains in annealing metals, and crystal &lt;br/&gt;growth.&lt;br/&gt;While key foundational results have been obtained, several of the most basic questions &lt;br/&gt;remain unanswered.</AbstractNarration>
