    <AbstractNarration>The mass of an atom is one of its most basic properties. Precise measurements of atomic masses have applications to many fields of physical science including nuclear physics, high-energy (particle) physics, astrophysics, physical chemistry, and the determination of the fundamental constants of nature. Currently the world?s most precise measurements of atomic mass are made with the Florida State University cryogenic "Penning Trap Mass Spectrometer". Making use of unique system features, e.g. the trapping and manipulation of one or two individual ions by a combination of electric and magnetic fields in an ultra-high vacuum, and the detection of their tiny motions using superconducting electronics, atomic mass measurements will be made with a fractional precision approaching 10 parts-per-trillion. These measurements, when combined with the results of other research, will impact fundamental scientific questions such as: what is the mass of the neutrino, the lightest known fundamental particle, and does Quantum Electrodynamics, currently the most accurately tested theory in physics, accurately predict the magnetic moment of the electron?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precision Penning trap techniques also have applications to analytical mass spectrometry, which is crucial to chemical analysis and trace chemical detection for National Security. The award also provides a unique research experience for post-doctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students in precision mass spectrometry, encompassing a broad range of precision measurement and experimental techniques. This prepares them for scientific and technological careers in industry, the national laboratories and academe, consequently benefiting the nation's economy and the solution of pressing national problems.</AbstractNarration>
