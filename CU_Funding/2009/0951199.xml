    <AbstractNarration>Cells, in order that they can carry out important physiological functions, must sense direction and spatial position. Many types of signals in the environment (for example light and gravity) are known to direct the behavior of cells. Electric fields are also a guidance cue that has been known for decades, but the mechanisms by which cells sense electric fields are largely unknown. They occur naturally, including for example in chick and mouse embryos during development, in plant roots, and in the eggs of seaweed. Although the strength of these electric fields is low, they guide both cell polarization (galvanotropism) and cell migration (galvanotaxis or electrotaxis). It has been very difficult to study the molecular mechanisms underlying electrotaxis because genetically accessible model systems have not been available. In the past few years, the principal investigators have jointly established in the slime mould (Dictyostelium) a simple model system by which to study electrotaxis. The first step in this project will be to generate hundreds of thousands of mutants of Dictyostelium cells. Then, using novel high throughput screening techniques, mutant cells will be identified that have abnormal electrotaxis phenotypes. These cells will then permit the identification and study of the molecules by which they detect and respond to extracellular electric fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Elucidating the mechanisms by which cells sense naturally occurring weak electric fields will establish a new biological signaling mechanism and provide powerful tools to intervene in many biological processes, including the engineering of tissues and organisms. This project will develop a genetically accessible model system and resources that will be made available to the community that studies cell migration. The investigators will continue to work with middle school students, undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows to provide experiences ranging from introductions to research to advanced training in unique interdisciplinary projects. Active participation in NSF-funded programs (including the Center for Biophotonics Science &amp; Technology) will provide additional opportunities for students from underrepresented minorities to participate in this research.</AbstractNarration>
