    <AbstractNarration>An observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would have profound implications for fundamental nuclear and particle physics. It would confirm that neutrino mass is truly a non-standard model phenomenon, open a window on grand unification physics, and constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino mass spectrum. Conversely, if neutrinoless double beta decay can be shown not to occur in nature, lepton-number conservation would be promoted from an accidental symmetry to an exact symmetry, sterile neutrinos would be proven to exist, and we would rule out a wide variety of new physics models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EXO (Enriched Xenon Observatory) collaboration has completed the construction and underground installation of the world's largest double beta decay experiment, the EXO-200 detector. This experiment is the first to be mounted at the 100 kg scale, and it represents one of our best opportunities to observe neutrinoless double beta decay in the quasi-degenerate mass region in the next two to three years. This award will provide support to continue the University of Maryland's involvement in EXO-200. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This support has additional broader impacts outside the field of neutrino physics, primarily by training young researchers in the methods of experimental science, and by demonstrating experimental techniques and technologies which have applications in other areas of pure and applied science.</AbstractNarration>
