    <AbstractNarration>This project will undertake a thorough theoretical study of the essential properties of coherent transport dynamics of trapped ultra-cold atoms, using a novel approach based on localized states. Besides being an effective way to numerically simulate transport of atoms through arbitrary potentials ('devices' in an atomic circuit), this approach can be directly implemented in atom transport experiments. Realistic designs for such experiments will also be developed as part of this study. The focus will be on mechanisms that involve time-dependent potential, coherent evolution, and features that distinguish atoms from electrons. The goal is to establish transport research with ultracold atoms as a flourishing field of study with significant applications. New quantum dynamical phenomena will be investigated for cold atoms, which are expected to have cross-disciplinary impact by providing a broader perspective on several transport phenomena. A new application of atom chips is implied in examining the flow of atoms, aligned with the functions of semiconductor microchips, with potential for integration into an atomic circuit. An alternate system that can probe coherent quantum transport in a controlled setting at the micron scale of atom chips, instead of the nanoscale of electronic circuits, will be valuable for testing and applying quantum transport dynamics imminent in future technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the work is its capacity to strengthen both teaching and research activity at a predominantly undergraduate institution. This project will enhance the educational experience of the students working on the project and will help to create an environment that encourages research for both students and faculty. Undergraduate research involvement will be an integral component of this project, with an emphasis on recruiting students underrepresented in science in an effort to encourage them towards careers in science and technology. Because of the location of the University, both inner city students and those from very rural areas will be recruited.</AbstractNarration>
