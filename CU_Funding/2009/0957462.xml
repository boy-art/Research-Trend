    <AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to develop agents capable of delivering halenium ions such as chloride, bromide, and iodide, in a chiral fashion, such that the products obtained are enantiomerically enriched. Historically, this goal has not been met with great success for a variety of reasons, most importantly because of the fact that halenium ions are reactive and difficult to sequester, and thus background reactions compete effectively with "coordinated" halenium delivery. Nonetheless, recent success in the principal investigator's laboratory has led to the development of a strategy for taming the halenium ion for the halolactonization chemistry that affords products in high yield and high enantiomeric excess. This early success will be extended in a hypothesis driven manner for the application of chiral halenium ions to a large number of other reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Babak Borhan of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University. Professor Borhan's research efforts revolve around the development of new enantio-selective methodologies that are facile, green, and economically feasible. The result of this work will expand the repertoire of enantioselective reactions to yield products of importance for the synthesis of biologically active agents and pharmaceuticals.</AbstractNarration>
