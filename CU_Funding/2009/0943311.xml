    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;31 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0943311&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI)&lt;br/&gt;PI: D. Fisichella&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: S. Humphris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to initiate the UNOLS East Coast Winch Pool which will support scientific operations aboard vessels in the US academic research vessel fleet as well as other US government-owned research vessels. The bulk of the funds provided will purchase portable winches and handling systems having advanced ?next-generations? capabilities that will enhance safety and the collection of scientific data at sea. This first year of funding for the East Coast Winch Pool will include purchase and/or maintenance and up-grade of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Portable, general-purpose winches (Light-duty, Medium-duty, and 0.680)&lt;br/&gt;2. Long Core System aboard the R/V KNORR&lt;br/&gt;3. Portable Cable Spoolers&lt;br/&gt;4. JASON ROV Handling System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These winches and handling systems will support a wide variety missions on all UNOLS vessels. The UNOLS East Coast Winch Pool, and corresponding West Coast Winch Pool at Scripps, will also serve to ensure that the equipment meets current UNOLS standards, provides commonality of design, and provides proper maintenance, administrative and logistical support to the academic fleet and the science community at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed UNOLS East Coast Winch Pool. The shared-use equipment purchased, and the administrative structure established to support the equipment, will provide improved services to both the vessel operators and the scientific community. The Winch Pool structure will also ensure proper maintenance of equipment, commonality of design, compliance with current standards, and efficiencies to NSF with regard to logistics, tracking and oversight of shared-use assets. The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute participates in a large number of outreach programs including web broadcasts from vessel while at sea, open house events, and other initiatives such as ?Dive and Discover? with the submersible ALVIN.</AbstractNarration>
