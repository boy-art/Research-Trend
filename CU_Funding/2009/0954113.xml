    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collection (TCWC) at Texas A&amp;M University to fund the replacement of all cases in the bird and mammal collections which were heavily damaged in a flood event over 15 years ago. With this funding, the principal investigators will be able to ensure the long-term safety and continued viability of these vertebrate collections, which number over 60,000 mammals and 15,000 birds. This award will also allow the collection to accommodate increasing numbers of specimens from active ongoing research programs. The PIs will also update taxonomy, verify specimen identifications, and cross-reference specimens to genetic resources, all of which are critical aspects of collection management. Additionally, the grant will fund graduate Curatorial Assistant positions, allowing the principal investigators to train and educate new museum-based researchers. Approaching its 75th year, the TCWC is one of the most active vertebrate collections in the state: the bird collection is the only active research-based collection in the state, and the mammal collection ranks among the top 20 in the western hemisphere. In addition to providing resources for basic research, the TCWC is a critical element in the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences curriculum, for which the collections host the lab sections of all vertebrate natural history courses. Over 200 undergraduates per year are exposed to, and are made beneficiaries of, the biodiversity represented in the bird, mammal and other vertebrate collections. Furthermore, the collections routinely sponsor undergraduate interns who participate in various aspects of collections management. The PIs anticipate providing over 12 internship opportunities associated with this grant.</AbstractNarration>
