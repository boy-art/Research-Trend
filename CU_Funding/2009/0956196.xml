    <AbstractNarration>Planning will be supported for a Research Coordination Network centered on the use of music as a tool for engaging undergraduate student interest and learning in biology. Initial tests of having students write and perform songs to reinforce learning of science concepts were received enthusiastically by students. Results of these tests suggest that this may be an effective way of engaging students, including non-science majors, in science classes and of increasing retention of course content. Improving science literacy among non-science majors would be a significant broader impact and address an important national need. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support communication among scientists, teachers, and songwriters with interests in developing this pedagogical approach. A project website, Undergraduate Biology Education - Songs for Teaching (UBEST), and a Facebook page will be created to support communication among participants and sharing of materials developed by the project. A key activity of this planning project will be to recruit experts in learning at the interface of arts and science. The goal of the project will be to develop a full RCN-UBE proposal that will support a broader network of scientists, teachers, and songwriters, and that will support testing of the most effective ways to use music to increase understanding of scientific concepts and natural history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported jointly by the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Division of Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>
