    <AbstractNarration>The University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras is the host site for the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate Program for academic years 209-2011. A seventh cohort of 12 students will be supported during the first two years of graduate studies in a STEM field at UPR, bringing the total number of BD fellowship recipients to 82 since the start of the program in 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fellows will participate in the Support Program that was successfully implemented with the six previous Cohorts, to enhance their academic preparation. A tracking system, designed by PR-LSAMP and in use, will document participant progress, including completion of degree and entering into the workforce, including the professoriate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BD Program is designed to: 1) prepare the next generation of scientists for careers in research and/or university teaching in Puerto Rico or the Mainland US and, 2) increase the nation?s pool of well-prepared, competent scientists with diverse views. Increasing the pool of STEM faculty members with Ph.D. degrees in Puerto Rico?s undergraduate institutions will have a long-term impact, particularly when taking into consideration the cumulative effect of graduates? life careers in academia and the thousands of students whose learning will be impacted.</AbstractNarration>
