    <AbstractNarration>This award supports an Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) Doctoral Colloquium at the 2009 Academy of Management (AOM) Annual Meeting to be held August 7-12, 2009 in Chicago, IL. The OCIS division within the AOM conference brings together researchers in the areas communications and information systems and issues related to the contemporary information-based society. The focus of the OCIS Doctoral Consortium is the intellectual content of the students' doctoral dissertations. These represent cutting edge research in the field of organizational communication and information systems. The OCIS doctoral consortium brings together highly talented students and several senior researchers, facilitating the development of a social network that will play a major role in the career success of new researchers. Since both faculty and students are diverse on several dimensions (research topics, methodological approaches, national and cultural background), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.</AbstractNarration>
