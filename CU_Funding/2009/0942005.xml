    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (GF-AAS) is being integrated across the college's chemistry curriculum and also in cross-disciplinary courses with the biology department. Specifically, usage of the GF-AAS is being incorporated into new or revised lab experiments in both semesters of general chemistry, and four upper-level chemistry courses: quantitative analysis, the second semester of physical chemistry, the first semester of biochemistry, and instrumental methods. In addition, project faculty are developing laboratory experiments involving GF-AAS usage in a cross-disciplinary ecology lab course, a course on the global environment, and the plant physiology lab course in the biology department. The lab experiments for chemistry and biology courses are being developed with special emphasis on capturing students' interest, and several of these experiments are creating vehicles for learning chemistry content that naturally touch on social justice issues in ethically appropriate ways. Learning and disposition outcomes for each of the laboratory experiments involving GF-AAS usage have been identified and are being assessed. The project has four main goals: 1) to offer real-world application of chemical analysis in student laboratories; 2) to use GF-AAS in new and interesting experiments in upper level chemistry laboratories; 3) to use chemical analysis in teaching disciplines other than chemistry; and 4) to make chemistry fun and interesting, i.e., accessible. These goals are integrated with the learning aims in the chemistry department's plan for assessing its overall commitment to offer a rigorous program that prepares students for future careers in science. The evaluation is analyzing pre- and post-course measurements of students' conceptual understanding through concept inventories in several courses. The evaluation is also longitudinally tracking chemistry majors as they progress through the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, to assess how usage of GF-AAS in many of their courses intensifies student interest in and understanding of techniques involving GF-AAS. The new laboratory experiments are being disseminated through peer-reviewed publications in chemical education and biology education and through cross-postings on NSDL. Research results are being shared through conferences and peer-reviewed journals in science education. The experiments are also being made available through Perkin-Elmer for use by other institutions that use the same instrument or are interested in incorporating usage of the instrument into their curricula.</AbstractNarration>
