    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop extremely low-power wake-up receivers. The approach is using novel ultrasonic data-communication devices and electronics. In wireless sensor and tag networks for ambient intelligence, structural and asset monitoring and personal health monitoring, sensing tags employ wake-up receivers to monitor requests for information from the central control node. These always-ON devices need to operate with extremely low power to save battery life or enable operation from energy scavenged from the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed ultrasonic data communication technologies offer two orders of magnitude of power reduction over current radio communication-based solutions. A novel technology platform combining flexible polymer piezoelectrics and integrated circuits will enable miniature ultrasonic transducers. These advances can also enable significant advances in proximity sensing, ranging, and communications through a variety of media with applications in automation, ambient intelligence and medical diagnostics and health monitoring, where radio transmission is poor or interference is not acceptable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of sensor and tagging networks is still in its infancy and the proposed research and education program will offer new technology and human capital to apply these technologies for the benefit of society. The graduate and undergraduate education and outreach activities of this cross-disciplinary program help train the next generation of researchers in ultra-low power electronics, device microfabrication and integration, and sensor networks. Ultrasound communication and localization modules will be developed with the Harlem Robotics League, a community outreach program for public high school students from underrepresented minority groups in Harlem.</AbstractNarration>
