    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to combine the finite element method with path integral techniques from statistical mechanics to solve problems in which configurational entropy due to thermal fluctuations plays a significant role. The advance of mechanics towards the frontiers of biology and soft matter necessitates an understanding of entropic forces which manifest themselves as thermal fluctuations at length scales of a micrometer and below. The modeling technique will be used to investigate two specific mechanics problems motivated from biology and backed with a wealth of experimental results: (a) energetics of protein mediated loops in DNA, and (b) mechanical behavior of networks of filaments, such as, actin and fibrin. The proposed methods to analyze DNA loop formation are relevant to (i) the action of DNA binding proteins implicated in gene regulation, and (ii) mapping the human genome. An understanding of the mechanical behavior of filamentous networks will have implications on manipulating adhesion, locomotion and differentiation of cells since these are controlled by mechanical interactions between a cell and its surroundings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity will lead to a better understanding of how mechanical properties of cells and tissues are implicated in diseases. It will also enable design of new biomaterials and possible therapeutic interventions for curing diseases. Furthermore, there will be collaboration with a local start-up company on projects related to mapping the human genome. The project will also open up opportunities for educating graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in the interdisciplinary areas of nanotechnology and biophysics.</AbstractNarration>
