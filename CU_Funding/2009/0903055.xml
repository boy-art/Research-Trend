    <AbstractNarration>This project expands the workforce preparation for the renewable energy and environmental technology industries through a partnership of Red Rocks Community College (RRCC) with the Colorado Governor's Energy Office, the University of Colorado, the Colorado School of Mines, Colorado State University, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, and the Jefferson County School District. The project advances environmental sustainability and energy technology education through curriculum development, materials preparation, professional development, and hands-on energy science experiences in the RRCC Energy Laboratory. The critical education juncture of high school through community college (grades 9-14) is the focus of the student education and teacher professional development. Workforce development focuses on adults in career transition as well as underserved traditional students. The project connects renewable energy and environmental technology education with partner research universities to increase Colorado's competitiveness in propelling renewable energy technology transfer from research and development to commercial application. The project offers teachers an opportunity to increase their understanding of and improve skills in energy science and environmental technology as well as prepare students for the future using new materials and instructional methods. The partnerships with the Governor's office and the national laboratory allows the project to reach across the state in supporting high school students, community college traditional and non-traditional students, and teachers underrepresented in science and technology careers.</AbstractNarration>
