    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award funds the acquisition of a Genome Analyzer IIx sequencer to enable deep sequencing, a new technology in biological and medical fields, at Dartmouth College. Deep sequencing technology enables experiments that were, until now, virtually impossible to perform, and provides a way for the researcher to determine the exact sequence of all the DNA and RNAs in a cell at a given time. Understanding how cells function and interact with their environment in normal and disease states is the major goal of all biological and medical researchers. The Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx at Dartmouth would enable researchers to (i) pinpoint genetic mutations and variations associated with enzymatic reactions, microbial biofilms, plant physiology, and many other biological phenomena; (ii) determine the genomic locations bound by specific DNA binding proteins involved in gene regulation; and (iii) identify and quantify differences in mRNA expression as a function of environmental, toxicological, and physiological responses. The results from these studies would be published in peer-reviewed journals and deposited in public databases for the benefit of the biological fields. Furthermore, through their research activities, their sponsorship of the Dartmouth REU-SITE(www.dartmouth.edu/~surf), and their mentorship of individual students, the PIs and the co-PIs are deeply committed to training. Additionally, all of the PIs and co-PIs disseminate scientific knowledge via outreach programs in K-12 schools and/or the Montshire Science Museum in Norwich, Vermont. These activities encourage broader participation in science and promote the training and development of the next generation of research scientists.</AbstractNarration>
