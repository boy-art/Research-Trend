    <AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project is a Type II (A:B) partnership, occurring within the University of Massachusetts Amherst with participation from the NSF PFI graduated grantee (0090521) in collaboration with participants from two other NSF partnership supported programs (both &lt;br/&gt;I/UCRCs): Center for University of Massachusetts and Industry Research on Polymers (CUMIRP), which was founded in 1980 and has since graduated but is still active, and e-Design Center (0332508/0838747). The precision manufacturing sector, primarily Small and Mid-sized Enterprises (SMEs), is an important part of the economic base of Western Massachusetts with significant employment. The industry is currently challenged by cyclical markets, increased global competition, aging facilities/technologies and insufficient labor supply. The PFI program which was put in place in 2000 successfully established a regional industry network, Regional Technology Corporation (RTC), and this proposed program will enable significant enhancement and sustainability of technology transfer. This project will stimulate transformation of relevant new discoveries at UMass to SMEs that have little or no experience working with a research institution. Drawing upon the scientific and engineering research conducted at UMass, the university and the SMEs will collaborate on targeted and tailored research projects focused on translation and application. UMass facilities, state-of-the-art testing and characterization equipment, as well as its engineering design and management tools, will complement the project's translation and application process&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome of this program is a sustainable regional innovation infrastructure that supports effective transformation of the precision manufacturing SMEs to new markets through infusion of new technologies with a flexible and capable workforce. SMEs are a significant part of the U.S. economic engine and have contributed greatly to employment growth and economic development. The evaluation and assessment of this program should lead to important and transferable learning. The focus on enhancing technology transfer and translational work with SMEs, on partnering with regional assets, and on seeking additional financial support should ensure that the impacts of the program are meaningful, documented, disseminated and sustained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: University of Massachusetts Amherst (lead institution), including participation of the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Research and Engagement, Office of Research Liaison and Development, Office of Commercial Ventures and Intellectual Property, Polymer Science and Engineering Department, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Center for UMass-Industry Research on Polymers, Center for e-Design, and Department of Landscape Architecture and Region Planning; and Holyoke Community College; Private Sector Organizations: Ben Franklin Design and Manufacturing Company, Inc.; State and Regional Organizations: Regional Employment Board of Hampden County, Inc., MA; and Regional Technology Corporation,(RTC), MA. Other participating organizations and personnel include Academic: Springfield Technical Community College; and State and Regional Organizations: Economic Development Council for Western Massachusetts, and Western Mass Chapter-National Tooling and Machining Association (WMNTMA).</AbstractNarration>
