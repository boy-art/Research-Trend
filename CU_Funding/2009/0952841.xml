    <AbstractNarration>The International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) will be held in Bangalore, India, on January 9-14, 2010. HPCA is sponsored by IEEE Computer Society. HPCA is one of the top 3 computer architecture flagship conferences, and provides a high-quality forum for scientists and engineers to present their latest research findings in the rapidly-changing field of computer architecture.&lt;br/&gt;The conference offers graduate students pursuing doctoral studies in computer architecture the opportunity to participate in a week-long intensive program focusing on the core as well as new and emerging areas in computer architecture.&lt;br/&gt;This award is to make travel scholarships available to students and universities not typically represented at HPCA in order to improve the conference?s impact and outreach.</AbstractNarration>
