    <AbstractNarration>This project explores the development of double-glazed windows with embedded active control systems to achieve significant reduction in noise transmission. The motivation for this work comes from the fact that homes close to airports and highways in major metropolitan areas suffer from serious noise problems. Windows constitute the primary path through which aircraft noise enters a home. In contrast to other active noise control approaches previously attempted in homes and offices, this project aims to reduce the noise that enters the home in the first place rather than actively trying to cancel noise in a room after the noise has already entered the home. Specifically, the project will: a) develop carbon nanotube based thin film speakers that are transparent, b) develop an adaptive noise control system for the windows application, c) develop signal processing algorithms to obtain a time-advanced reference signal for the controller and to isolate room audio interferences, d) experimentally evaluate the performance of a prototype window.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active noise cancellation developed in the project also has significant applications beyond windows. These include noise cancellation panels for machinery, transparent incubators for pre-term babies in neonatal intensive care units and aircraft cabin noise reduction applications. The educational objectives of the project include incorporation of class projects focused on noise and vibrations for school students from the Highland Park High School. The project will also recruit minority and women undergraduate students through a specialized summer REU program, providing them an opportunity to work on cutting edge research and motivating them to pursue graduate studies.</AbstractNarration>
