    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a renovation project to provide infrastructure improvements to approximately 1000 square feet of existing research space into a lab shared by six chemistry and biochemistry faculty, their instrumentation and equipment, and undergraduate research students. The renovated facility will improve research conditions for faculty pursuing research projects with undergraduates studying the mechanisms of viral genome evolution; several high-value areas of organic chemistry: high-spin molecules and their metal complexes, carbonyl and heterocycle chemistry, and organofluorine chemistry; solid/aqueous phase and interfacial chemical reactions influencing the fate of trace elements through bench-to-pilot scale experiments; environmental sampling, analysis, and remediation of soil, vegetation, wildlife, and water resources on the college campus; and developing "green" oxygenation catalysts that are organometallic in nature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renovated laboratory will provide the faculty and their students interested in pursuing careers in the chemical sciences modern and safe facilities in which to develop their interests.</AbstractNarration>
