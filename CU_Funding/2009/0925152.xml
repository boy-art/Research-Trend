    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to understand the fundamental transport and scattering phenomena in graphene based electronic devices. The approach is to combine scanning probe microscopy and electrical transport measurements to both create and probe the local electronic properties of these devices.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Graphene has shown promise to augment silicon in future semiconductor technologies. However, as a gapless semiconductor it is not directly useable in digital electronics. This limitation can be overcome by opening a controlled bandgap by patterning the graphene into narrow strips. This research will explore ways of creating these nanoribbons with atomic control using scanning probe microscopy. Beyond creating these devices, the research will also examine the role of defects, edge roughness, surface morphology and charged impurities on the electronic properties of the nanoribbons. Furthermore, the scanning probe microscopy techniques developed in this proposal may be extended to study other low-dimensional systems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research may lead to entirely new types of electronics devices made from graphene rather than silicon. These devices may significantly extend the capabilities of current semiconductor devices. A concurrent education and outreach program will involve the training of both undergraduate and graduate students and well as outreach to local K-12 schools through the creation of a set of demonstrations based on the research. The outreach to local schools will primarily reach under-represented groups and excite them about nanoscience at a young age.</AbstractNarration>
