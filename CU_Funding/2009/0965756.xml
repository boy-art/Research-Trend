    <AbstractNarration>The Peers Organized by Discipline for Success (PODS) project is providing scholarships and intensive mentoring for 90 academically talented, financially needy science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students in the sciences, mathematics, and aerospace engineering technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The program is promoting academic success, retention, and completion through an enhanced academic support and peer-mentoring system called PODS in which small groups of 3-5 students, supported by a faculty mentor and peer tutors, form a "triangle for success". Recipients participate in "Ready, Set, STEM!" orientations, the College's STEM Club, "how to study science" seminars, and receive assistance from science and mathematics tutors. Activities include field experiences, site visits to STEM-related businesses and institutions, transfer workshops, "Speaking of STEM" lectures, career development activities, and scientific internships and symposia. PODS is providing financially needy STEM students with additional financial, academic, transfer and career assistance to increase their chances for success. The College is well qualified to implement PODS because of past success with NSF grants and a variety of programs to assist financially needy students. The PODS team includes faculty with proven mentoring experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Information gained through PODS is help improve academic success, graduation and job placement for students beginning higher education at community colleges, institutions rapidly becoming one of the pipelines for STEM majors.</AbstractNarration>
