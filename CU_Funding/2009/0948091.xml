    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests travel support for U.S. students, including graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, to participate in the 21st Annual IEEE/LEOS Workshop on Interconnections within High-speed Digital Systems to be held May 2-5, 2010 in Sante Fe, New Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, this workshop is of particular significance due to the increasing demand for very high speed interconnects to support high data rate communication and due to the growing importance of multi-core architectures, which require high data rate interconnects. The multidisciplinary nature of the problem domain is reflected in the workshop which brings together researchers in semiconductor devices, processor architecture, three-dimensional packaging, and optical-electronic integration. In addition to talks, posters, and tutorials, the workshop features a "workshop problem" where participants interact through small working groups to address a challenge problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impacts, the proposed support improves the education of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers through participation in the multidisciplinary workshop and associated interaction with leading researchers and other students. The workshop and associated travel support are to be advertised through active outreach to minority serving institutions and organizations focused on women and other students from underrepresented groups. The selection process will emphasize broadening participation.</AbstractNarration>
