    <AbstractNarration>Microbes, such as bacteria and fungi, are the most diverse and abundant living organisms on the planet. Recent advances in evolutionary theory and microbiology have revealed that many microbes display complex social interactions. Behaviors such as cooperation, cheating, and communication are widespread in microbial communities and often require the production of substances called public goods, such as enzymes and signaling molecules. The goal of this project is to develop theory that links evolution and ecosystem ecology via social behaviors in microbial communities. This theory will then be used to predict how microbial interactions and public goods will affect the cycling of carbon and nutrients around the globe. The investigator will build computer models to simulate production of public goods at the microbe scale and chemical processes at the ecosystem scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolutionary theory has rarely been used to understand processes at the ecosystem level of biological organization. The first broader impact of this study will be to use evolutionary theory to understand fundamental ecosystem functions. Human societies and natural ecosystems rely on the functioning of microbial communities. By developing theoretical models, this research will provide new insight into processes ranging from the emission of greenhouse gases to nutrient cycling in marine food webs. The project will provide interdisciplinary training to one graduate and at least one undergraduate student. Web-based computer software to illustrate theoretical principles in microbial ecology will be developed for use in teaching and outreach efforts. These efforts will be executed through undergraduate courses and an existing program at UCI that targets teachers, minority high school students, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
