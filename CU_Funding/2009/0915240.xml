    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0-1 Semidefinite Programming (0-1 SDP) is a new optimization model&lt;br/&gt;that covers several classes of challenging nonlinear integer&lt;br/&gt;programming problems. 0-1 SDPs arise frequently from numerous&lt;br/&gt;applications in various domains such as learning, communications and&lt;br/&gt;facility location. However, in spite of its broad range of&lt;br/&gt;applications and the computational challenge it poses, little is&lt;br/&gt;known with respect to the new optimization model except few results&lt;br/&gt;scattered in the literature. In this project, the PI and his&lt;br/&gt;research group will study the theoretical foundations of the 0-1 SDP&lt;br/&gt;model including identifying polynomially solvable cases of the model&lt;br/&gt;and exploring its theoretical limitations from an optimization&lt;br/&gt;perspective, develop resolution techniques for this new class of&lt;br/&gt;problems such as effective exact algorithms and scalable&lt;br/&gt;approximation algorithms that can deal with large size problems, and&lt;br/&gt;apply the new modeling and resolution techniques to problems from&lt;br/&gt;various disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the project is to study a new optimization&lt;br/&gt;model that can be applied to a broad range of domains such as&lt;br/&gt;learning and engineering design, and to develop reliable and scalable&lt;br/&gt;resolution tools for such a model. Creative modeling techniques are&lt;br/&gt;crucial for capturing the problem semantics in many applications. For&lt;br/&gt;example, in multi-agent learning, every agent might have a&lt;br/&gt;different objective and solution to the same problem. It is&lt;br/&gt;important to integrate various opinions and solutions from the&lt;br/&gt;agents to have a more comprehensive understanding and achieve a&lt;br/&gt;global objective. The new optimization model in this project&lt;br/&gt;provides a powerful approach for multi-agent learning. Reliable&lt;br/&gt;and scalable computational methods are essential for learning from&lt;br/&gt;massive and noisy data set.</AbstractNarration>
