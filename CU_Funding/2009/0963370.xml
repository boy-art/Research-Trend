    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to renovate the Biology Research Laboratory in the Classroom Building at the Schuylkill Campus of the Pennsylvania State University. The Lab was originally designed and constructed in the 1960s, and it has received little modernization since then. Consequently, it is severely deteriorated and outdated. The biology faculty at PSU Schuylkill conduct research in three major areas: parasite transmission and host-parasite interactions, effect of prenatal drug exposure on neurological development of mice, and chemical interactions of invasive plants and plant-soil interactions. The lack of adequate research facilities has severely impaired the ability of the faculty to conduct their research. The renovation will update the overall physical condition of the Biology Research Lab, construct a small vivarium where mice and mosquitoes can be raised, and improve the lighting and climate control of the greenhouse to make it better suited for research applications. One impact of the renovation is to increase significantly the number of students, especially minority students, who are involved in independent research projects and research training.</AbstractNarration>
