    <AbstractNarration>This pedagogical qorkflow research project will create a novel hybrid-workflow framework that supports efficient assessment of student learning through interactive generation and execution of various assessment workflows. Unlike in many existing workflow systems, the task of student assessment includes steps that cannot be fully automated, such as obtaining grade, background and student survey information. The system will provide assistance in executing and integrating the results of the manual steps. Research steps will include (a) knowledge-based modeling of computational and non-computational assessment tools as workflow components; (b) interactive generation of assessment workflows while propagating and combining constraints from both computational and non-computational components; and (c) interactive execution of hybrid workflows that incorporates new constraints that are inferred from execution of non-computational components. Evaluations will focus on the effects of Pedagogical Workflow technology on learning assessment performance, especially the assessment of pedagogical discourse in undergraduate engineering courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational technology to support online learning is now centrally supported by many colleges and universities. The perceived mandate to use technology for instruction, in addition to the enormous amount of information available for consumption on the Web, places a considerable burden on instructors who must learn to integrate appropriate student practices and learning assessment via the new media. Pedagogical workflows will allow instructors with little or no training in educational assessment to perform large-scale complex diagnosis and assessment of student learning in ongoing lessons. Facilitating the integration of personal student information into assessment will point to directions to improve STEM participation, learning, and retention. The finding will provide benefits to society by sharing results and technology with instructors and educational experts. The proposed work also has the potential to lead to a new research field on e-Learning workflows, similar to the way in which workflow technology transformed e-Science research with e-Science workflows.</AbstractNarration>
