    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This project supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in DMR studies chemical factors that influence magnetic behavior of solid state materials. The first part of the project focuses on investigation of magnetostructural correlations and anomalous magnetic behaviors in rare-earth transition metal phosphides and arsenides with the ThCr2Si2-type structure. The overall goal is to understand how chemical modifications impact the structural and magnetic properties of these phases, which exhibit dramatically different magnetic behavior depending on the nature of the rare-earth and transition metals. The targeted materials are closely related to the isostructural FeAs-based superconductors, and it is expected that findings from this part of the project will also provide knowledge that is relevant to other important classes of materials. The second part of the project uses exploratory synthesis for discovery of lanthanide-rich magnetic phases in Ln-T-X systems (Ln = rare-earth metal; T = transition metal; X = P, As, Ge, Sn). Very few phases have been reported in the rare-earth rich part of such ternary diagrams, and the extensive exploration of compositions with &gt; 40% content of Ln may uncover new materials with prominent magnetic properties. The study of correlations between structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of these materials will contribute to our understanding of complex interactions between the localized f-electrons and itinerant d-band magnetism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in DMR supports the search for magnetic solids with improved performance which requires fundamental understanding of correlations between the crystal structure and magnetic behavior. The proposed research is directed at the exploration of this relationship and preparation of new materials with potentially promising magnetic properties. These goals will be achieved through chemical modification of materials to control their magnetic behavior and the use of innovative synthetic approaches for the discovery of new magnets. The project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of solid state chemistry, crystallography, and magnetism. The research objectives are intertwined with the development of an innovative curriculum in materials chemistry. As a part of the project, a series of visual materials will be implemented to provide an introduction to instrumental methods in materials research for both undergraduate and high-school students.</AbstractNarration>
