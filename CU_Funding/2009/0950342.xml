    <AbstractNarration>Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) operate on secondary spectrum bands, where they opportunistically access and use under-utilized spectrum bands. Though research on CRNs is gaining momentum, there is still little or no understanding of how these networks will fair in the face of attacks. Moreover, the addition of new architectures and protocols bring more vulnerabilities that have not been seen before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make use of game theoretic techniques to develop pragmatic design methodologies that will lead to more efficient algorithms and protocols for tackling vulnerabilities in cognitive radio networks while maintaining high spectrum usage. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the execution of four tasks. These are 1) devising and solving malicious node detection games where malicious nodes(s) will be detected and isolated by regular nodes, 2) devising mechanisms that will enforce cooperation among cognitive radio nodes such that they use the commonly available spectrum in a co-operative manner, 3) developing rules and policies such that nodes belonging to different networks can co-exist, and 4) studying the performance trade-offs on service guarantees when policies are set in a dynamic manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact of this project will include the dissemination of the research results by means of conference and journal publications. Minority and women students will be recruited as research assistants to assist the PI in his efforts. The PI will not only educate the students at UCF about the vulnerabilities in CRNs but will also help the academic and industrial efforts bring the cognitive radio technology to the market place.</AbstractNarration>
