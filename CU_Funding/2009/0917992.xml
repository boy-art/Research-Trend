    <AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project--a Type III (A:C) partnership between Montana State University, an NSF PFI graduate (0125429) and University of Montana, an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as one that has never been a PFI grantee)--seeks to respond to the problem of the use of methamphetamine (meth), a highly addictive illicit drug, and to meth-related crime, which has reached epidemic levels in the U.S. and particularly in the state of Montana; by developing laser-based remote sensing technologies to detect clandestine meth labs and also the hazards inside. Advances in the areas of laser operation, in detection, and knowledge of the detectable chemicals are all being addressed in the Remote Methamphetamine Detection Initiative (REMEDI) partnership, and each advance in these areas will contribute to improving the sensitivity and reducing false positives, which are essential for adoption of the device by law enforcement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity is focused on the development of a technology that can assist law enforcement in uncovering meth labs and also alert first responders as to which hazardous chemicals are present. The societal impact of this activity is of major importance, particularly in Native American tribal communities. The technology can also be directly extended to remotely detecting other airborne chemicals. Some of these chemicals include other drug manufacturing signature chemicals, chemical weapons, global warming chemicals, chemicals important to home security and dangerous or other toxic industrial effluents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: Montana State University (lead institution), and University of Montana; Research Institution: National Jewish Medical Center; Private Sector Organizations: Battelle (not-for-profit)(Richland, WA), AdvR, Inc.; Bridger Photonics, Inc., and Scientific Materials Corporation/FLIR Systems; State and Local Organizations: Missouri River Drug Task Force, Montana Department of Justice, Division of Criminal Investigation; and Montana Governor?s Office; and Other: Montana Meth Project, Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council, and MSU TechLink.</AbstractNarration>
