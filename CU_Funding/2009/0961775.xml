    <AbstractNarration>Over the years much has been learned about faulting and fault processes on land through the study of samples collects from exposed fault, ?fault rocks?. Measurements of fabric elements (such as grain orientation and sense of shear), deformation histories and properties such as strength and permeability have been the focus of research in many laboratories for decades, but owing to their inaccessibility, no such studies of fault rocks have been carried out. Using samples from a variety of sources including submersible sampling, drilling and ophiolites where oceanic rocks are exposed on land, this study will be the first of fault rocks from the seafloor. As a first venture into a new area of research it will face a number of difficulties, but will likewise almost certainly yield new insights. The broader impacts of this work are its contribution to fundamental knowledge, support for a young investigator, and support for a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
