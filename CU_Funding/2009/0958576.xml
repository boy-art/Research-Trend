    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to obtain funding to acquire computing&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure to perform cross-disciplinary research in artificial&lt;br/&gt;intelligence, natural language processing, bioinformatics, social&lt;br/&gt;networks and related fields. In particular, the projects that will&lt;br/&gt;be supported by the infrastructure acquired include developing algorithms&lt;br/&gt;and architectures for large-scale ontology alignment, particularly in&lt;br/&gt;the biomedical domain; mining Wikipedia and similar Web-based sources&lt;br/&gt;for geographical, temporal and ontological information; performing&lt;br/&gt;named entity recognition in biomedical and other domains; performing&lt;br/&gt;computational motivational and content analysis of socially generated&lt;br/&gt;content such a blogs and micro-blogs; undertaking corpus-based computational&lt;br/&gt;linguistics research in under-studied and possibly endangered languages from&lt;br/&gt;India and other locations; developing better-performing algorithms for gene&lt;br/&gt;expression analysis; and developing, implementing and comparing algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for protein structure prediction, particularly proteins that contain&lt;br/&gt;coiled-coil structures. These projects deal with large amounts of data&lt;br/&gt;and information and processing such data and information requires large&lt;br/&gt;amounts of computing power. Our proposal seeks to acquire adequate and&lt;br/&gt;flexible computing hardware to facilitate problem-solving in these and other&lt;br/&gt;areas, so that current and future problems can be solved felicitously. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infrastructure acquired will enable cutting-edge research by Ph.D.,&lt;br/&gt;Masters and undergraduate students, including REU site students, in a&lt;br/&gt;variety of cross-disciplinary topics that employ ideas and innovations&lt;br/&gt;in artificial intelligence, machine learning and information retrieval.&lt;br/&gt;For example, the results of our research may enable creations of systems&lt;br/&gt;that discover overlaps and matches among large medical ontologies so that&lt;br/&gt;painstakingly created domain-specific information can be fused, compared&lt;br/&gt;and utilized better; and may assist in creating programs that assist in&lt;br/&gt;automatically understanding and/or visualizing content of socially-generated&lt;br/&gt;Websites such as Wikipedia and Twitter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.uccs.edu/~kalita.</AbstractNarration>
