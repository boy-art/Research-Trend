    <AbstractNarration>There is an urgent need to develop experience-based learning opportunities for undergraduate students that will invigorate their interest in science, biology, and global sustainability. In the intermountain west, the impacts of climate change are manifest through large scale phenomena such as the pine bark beetle outbreak, increased wildland fire, long-term drought, and invasive species. All these issues, many of which interact with changes in land use, are impacting communities that depend on natural resources for recreation, jobs, and economic stability. How can we prepare the next generation of public land stewards with the multidisciplinary skills needed to address impacts of climate change? The Rocky Mountain Sustainability and Science Network (RMSSN) will combine real-world careers and biological education using field experiences to address critical issues for the sustainability and ecological integrity of public lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this network focus on undergraduate understanding of biological and sustainability concepts and their application to land management.The RMSSN strives to increase the representation of the multicultural demographic of the western states through active engagement of minority serving institutions and purposefully outreach. The RMSSN has four principle goals. First, identify and assess opportunities for students to develop their understanding of sustainability and biological sciences through experiential learning. Second, build partnerships among federal agencies, non-profits, and academic institutions to address issues of sustainability and student development. Third, build a model of experiential science learning and design assessment tools which will facilitate the application of the RMSSN learning model to other experiential learning programs throughout the country. Fourth, establish a diverse next generation of land stewards who excel in the sciences required to address sustainability issues in the rapidly changing and multicultural intermountain west. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported jointly by the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Division of Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>
