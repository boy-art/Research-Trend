    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from the NSF MRI-R2 program has allowed the purchase of a Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP cell sorter, a BD Pathway 885 High-Content Bioimager, and a Miltenyi Gentle Macs Dissociator, and related equipment to support research focused on understanding the biodynamics of molecular interactions leading to cellular differentiation. This interdisciplinary effort integrates faculty, post-doctoral and student researchers in the disciplines of biochemistry, immunology, physiology, molecular cell biology, neurobiology and plant biology. Results of studies planned for this suite of instruments will allow specific subsets of T cells to be identified, separated, cultured, and their interactions with specific activating and inhibiting factors imaged in real time. The differential effects of growth factors on freshly isolated subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion neurons grown on carbon and magnetic nanotube substrates will be characterized. The uptake of plant lectins and fluorescent nanocrystals by pulmonary and immune cells in intact animals and the subsequent effects of this absorption on cellular molecular dynamics will be characterized. The equipment will also be used to support science education outreach to high school, undergraduate and graduate students. ASU has active NSF-funded REU, URM, GK-12, and Louis Stokes Minority Alliance programs, as well as a recently funded McNair project, that focus on recruiting, retaining and enhancing the educational experience of students of under-represented minorities. Many of these students are actively participating in research projects in the PIs labs. To further broaden potential impacts, training and applications seminars will be held in addition to integrating these technologies into our Molecular Biosciences PhD techniques courses in immunology and microscopy. Enhanced research capabilities will strengthen the University's effort to recruit and retain minority students, faculty, and collaborators who might otherwise choose other universities or other disciplines to study. Results from the studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented by students and faculty at regional and national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
