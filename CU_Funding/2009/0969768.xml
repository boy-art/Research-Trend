    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a planning project to develop a "Research and Study Abroad Program" to avail U.S. undergraduate students access to the world-leading research facilities at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the World Health Organization and the various operations of the United Nations based in Geneva, Switzerland. A facility is envisioned to house approximately sixty American students in the greater Geneva community, to provide them with proper supervision and security, to provide a structure for repatriating to their U.S. institutes course credit for their participation in cutting-edge data collection and analysis efforts at these facilities, and for any approved courses they take during their research and field study abroad period. It is expected, based on the experience of the CERN REU program, that the students will contribute in real and meaningful ways to the research program underway at CERN, and by extension, to the World Health Organization and other institutions based in Geneva.</AbstractNarration>
