    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of plant-derived actives for sunscreen and other cosmetic applications. Recent research has raised concerns that the chemicals used in sunscreens and cosmetic products may be related to health problems, and their accumulation may also be an increasing threat to aquatic life. This research is focused on six plant extracts that have been shown to absorb UV light and scavenge free radicals 100 times better than currently available antioxidants. This feasibility study will include: i) isolation and identification of the active molecule(s) responsible for the beneficial properties; ii) investigation of the toxicity and stability of the molecule(s); and iii) identification of one or more active molecule(s) for use in all natural sunscreen/cosmetic products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, will be the availability of all natural sunscreen/cosmetics products devoid of negative side effects that synthetic analogs may bring. Commercial interest in effective natural sunscreen/cosmetic products have been validated with leading companies in cosmetics and personal care. Moreover, if successful, the increased scientific knowledge of natural extracts from this project may also find applications in nutraceuticals, and may contribute to cures and prevention of free radicals linked diseases. Industrial applications may also benefit from this work in applications such as UV stabilizer for polymers and pigments.</AbstractNarration>
