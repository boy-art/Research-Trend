    <AbstractNarration>The major goal of subatomic physics is understanding the structure of the nucleon. The structure can determined by scattering proton, electron, or neutrino probes from nucleons. Each probe is sensitive to different aspects of the nucleon structure. By varying the energy of the probe, the structure can be determined at different length scales. The objectives of this project are to measure the structure of the nucleon at distances from about 10% of the nucleon size up to the size of the nucleon. In addition, the characteristics of neutrino interactions with various nuclei will be determined with the MINERvA experiment. The results of these measurements are an important ingredient for other experiments which aim to understand the properties of neutrinos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the scientific impact, this work will serve to train both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral students, in the methods of scientific research. This training in fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers in and outside of physics. Our students and post-docs have successfully moved to varied careers in medical physics, homeland security, and finance, as well as continuing in fundamental research.</AbstractNarration>
