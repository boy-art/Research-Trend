    <AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support to graduate students and postdoctorates to attend the 10th International Workshop on the Interrelationship between Plasma&lt;br/&gt;Experiments in Laboratory and Space (IPELS) to be held in Djuronaset, Sweden, from June 7 through 12, 2009 (http://www.spp.ee.kth.se/ipels2009). The IPELS Workshop is an international meeting that began in 1991 with its original focus on the interrelationship between laboratory plasma experiments and space experiments and observations. In this workshop format, researchers from both the laboratory and space research communities have held 9 workshops bringing together the diverse researchers from the space and laboratory experimental fields. Plasma physics is a common language that ties together all scientists who study the waves, particle acceleration and heating, magnetic reconnection, dynamos, global and micro-stability of plasmas, magnetic turbulence and plasma transport problems.</AbstractNarration>
