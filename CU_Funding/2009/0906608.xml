    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Technological breakthroughs to support societal needs, such as solar energy harvesters and improved data storage strategies, require disruptive advances in new materials with novel functionalities. To that end, this project employs the tools of nanotechnology to fabricate, characterize and tailor the response of titanium-iron-oxide-based nanotube arrays with simultaneous functionality employing electronic charge, magnetic spin and optical response. Properly engineered, these materials hold promise for potential application in devices to efficiently absorb and transfer solar energy and/or to process data with increased speed, precision and accuracy. The research is carried out by an interdisciplinary team of researchers from science and engineering and includes the involvement of students, teachers and junior scientists at all levels of experience. Unique features of the educational experience of this proposal are the opportunities to introduce students to research at large scientific facilities such as the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the fact that the proposal is led by a majority female PI team, providing diversity models to both students and colleagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Iron-doped titania nanotubes are fabricated by electrochemical means and studied using a variety of probes (structural, magnetic and optical, including synchrotron-based spectroscopies) to obtain a fundamental understanding of their magnetic, spintronic, optical and magnetocatalytic properties as functions of composition and structural attributes. As pure titania is a large-bandgap semiconductor, Fe additions not only perturb the band structure but also serve as sensitive probes of the lattice modification by virtue of the large Fe magnetic moment. Further, nanostructured titania is anticipated to exhibit enhanced functional responses due to its large surface area. In this manner it is desired to develop novel multifunctional nanostructures for combined spintronic, optical and photocatalytic properties, at room temperature, in one material. Eventual device applications in sensing, catalysis and spintronics to enable advances in alternative energy and data processing technologies are envisioned.</AbstractNarration>
