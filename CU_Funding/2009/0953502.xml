    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to test the hypothesis that machined surface and subsurface quality of dental ceramic materials can be significantly enhanced by rotary ultrasonic machining. Approaches of finite element analysis and design of experiments combined with theory of contact mechanics and fracture mechanics will be employed to carry out the following research tasks: investigate mechanisms of material removal and subsurface damages generation; solve the problem of complex surface machining; quantify machining induced damages; measure ultrasonic vibration amplitude within accuracy Â±0.1 micron; and discover the relationship between ultrasonic vibration amplitude and subsurface damages. The educational objective of this CAREER proposal is to enhance the education program in manufacturing at a Historically Black College/University. The specific approaches involve incorporating research results into existing manufacturing courses; developing a research laboratory; recruiting African American graduate students; developing multimedia courses to improve manufacturing education; and involving undergraduate students and K-12 teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research is expected to bring about a breakthrough innovation in dental ceramic manufacturing, which will directly benefit the nation?s medical consumers and society. An innovative and crack-free precision machining technology will be provided for the US dental industry. The research results will also benefit other medical industries where bioceramic materials are widely used such as bone and joint replacements. The proposed education activities in this CAREER plan will improve engineering education at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, contribute to increase the percentage of engineering doctorates awarded to African Americans, and broaden participation of underrepresented populations and non-traditional students in engineering research.</AbstractNarration>
