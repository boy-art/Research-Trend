    <AbstractNarration>This project studies evolving knowledge bases, using tools from theoretical computer science. As opposed to a database containing facts that can be queried, a knowledge base contains general statements that can be used to derive further implications. Developing a knowledge base, in particular, a knowledge base containing commonsense knowledge that can be used for commonsense reasoning, is a fundamental task of artificial intelligence (AI). This task is taking on a somewhat different focus nowadays, as even partial solutions would have important applications in intelligent agent technology. One common feature of current approaches to the development of commonsense knowledge bases is the interactive acquisition of web-based user input of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms for developing commonsense knowledge bases have to perform several different tasks, such as reasoning, revising (i.e., updating the current knowledge in the presence of new, potentially conflicting information), and learning (i.e., improving the quality of the knowledge base over the long run). This research addresses all three of these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bulk of the research uses Horn formulas as the formalism for knowledge representation. Horn formulas are an important class of logical expressions that have been studied for decades in complexity theory, logic programming, databases, and AI, with efficient algorithms for basic reasoning tasks. Evolving knowledge bases present many new problems for Horn knowledge bases. Particular problems addressed by this research, based on the challenges referred to above, include: Horn-to-Horn belief revision, learning Horn formulas in the model of learning from entailment, approximate minimization of Horn formulas, probabilistic analysis of the set of consequences of random Horn formulas and related combinatorial problems, Horn approximation of knowledge bases and complexity problems for non-classical generalizations of Horn formulas. The latter point towards extending the knowledge representation formalism to handle different aspects of commonsense reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more general terms, the objective of the research is to develop algorithms for building knowledge bases that can evolve over time. This task is relevant for both short and long term applications. The research contains a comprehensive approach to several important areas which so far have been mostly been studied separately. In the long term, research in this area will contribute to the development of tools for building better intelligent agents possessing commonsense knowledge and capable of commonsense reasoning. Such agents will expand the scope of and improve the quality of automated services.</AbstractNarration>
