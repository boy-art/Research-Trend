    <AbstractNarration>0954499&lt;br/&gt;Loheide&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is on developing a new method for continuous monitoring of soil water potential. The method will use distributed temperature sensing technology by relating the heat pulse induced thermal response of a buried fiber optic cable to the soil water potential. Three-dimensional, variably-saturated groundwater flow modeling will be performed to extend in space and time already extensive field data so that hydrologic niches can be estimated for past climatic conditions. Using this knowledge, a coupled vegetation and hydrologic modeling framework will be created to enable quantitative prediction of the vegetation composition and patterning and hydrologic feedbacks that would result from potential restoration strategies. With the models produced in this study, the extent to which desired vegetation can be re-established by restoration activities will be able to be predicted during the design phase of projects and a set of guidelines will be created for restoration practitioners of the region. The project has broader impacts related to both improving the practice of river restoration and providing context-based educational opportunities to middle school, undergraduate, and graduate students. This award is co-funded by the Environmental Sustainability program in ENG and the Hydrologic Sciences program in GEO.</AbstractNarration>
