    <AbstractNarration>0966527&lt;br/&gt;Zikanov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a part of the cooperation research activities conducted by the University of Michigan Dearborn, MI, USA and the Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany. It addresses the fundamental questions of interaction between flows of electrically conducting fluids and magnetic fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project advances our understanding of flows of electrically conducting fluids affected by magnetic fields. The main attention will be given to typical technological and laboratory flows of liquid metals and oxide melts. Model flows in a rectangular duct will be used to investigate how the magnetic field affects the transition to turbulence and properties of turbulent flows, in particular, their ability to transport heat and admixtures. On the basis of the acquired understanding, the PI will search for optimal control methods of electromagnetic flow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the research are expected to advance the understanding, modeling, and optimization of the processing of electromagnetic materials, such as steel, aluminum, and semi-conductor crystals, as well as for the design of lithium cooling blankets for future nuclear fusion reactors. In all such technological processes, optimization of the field flow interaction is a key to reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will foster a competitive research environment and dynamic innovative instruction at the University of Michigan Dearborn, an institution focused on serving the metropolitan Detroit community. A graduate and several undergraduate students will be trained in the fields of turbulence theory, magnetohydrodynamics, and computational modeling. Close international cooperation strengthens the research and will establish new ties between the U.S. and German science communities. It also opens opportunities for students at the University of Michigan Dearborn to enrich their education via participation in international collaboration activities, visits to foreign research centers, and interaction with visiting German scientists.</AbstractNarration>
