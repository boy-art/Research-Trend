    <AbstractNarration>The Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum at the University of Missouri is organizing and hosting a series of three week-long conferences for advanced doctoral students and recent doctoral graduates in mathematics education. The conference activities draw upon the summer research workshops organized by most of the Centers for Learning and Teaching, which were funded by the National Science Foundation, and the Project NeXT seminar organized by the Mathematical Association of America for assistant professors in mathematics. The conferences are held in conjunction with the Park City Mathematics Institutes (PCMI) in Park City, UT. The PCMI is organized and managed by the Institute for Advanced Study and each summer hosts research mathematicians, mathematics doctoral students, mathematics undergraduates, and mathematics teachers. The conferences are supported by and would involve students and graduates from all the mathematics CLTs; recent doctoral graduates from other universities are also recurited to participate.</AbstractNarration>
