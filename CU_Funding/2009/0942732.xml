    <AbstractNarration>Computing-others(35)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A five-course interdisciplinary Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science concentration, Technology Entrepreneurship, is being developed. The concentration integrates the theories of computing, finance, health informatics, and entrepreneurship with their applications through the aid of industry support into a new discipline that focuses on knowledge transfer between the disciplinary domains and between theory and practice. Students are acquiring the knowledge, skills, and expertise needed to design and develop innovative and imitative algorithms for competitive products, processes, or services in a technology oriented financial and health informatics related company or department. Additionally, student graduates are acquiring knowledge and skills in entrepreneurship and its application as well as the application of computing science and information systems theories and practices to other disciplines and industries such as business and healthcare. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic solutions to real world financial and healthcare problems that could lead to beneficial discoveries are being developed by students working in teams and assisted by industry experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is allowing the expansion of computing application capabilities across disciplinary boundaries and the infusion of computing in finance and health sciences to help extend computing instructional focus. A unique blending of experiential learning and academic learning in an interdisciplinary computing setting using teamwork, cooperative education, and industry experts in the roles of mentors, project evaluators, and guest speakers represent the environment for the program.</AbstractNarration>
