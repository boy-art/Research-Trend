    <AbstractNarration>Studies in computational complexity in three directions are proposed: &lt;br/&gt;holographic algorithms, Darwinian evolution, and multicore algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;In the first of these areas, holographic reductions have been shown to&lt;br/&gt;be a fruitful source of new efficient algorithms for certain problems,&lt;br/&gt;and evidence of intractability for othrs. In this research the aim is to&lt;br/&gt;arrive at a better understanding of the possibilities and limitations of&lt;br/&gt;holographic algorithms, by exploring ways in which specific currently&lt;br/&gt;known limitations of this class of methods can be circumvented. For&lt;br/&gt;evolution the goal is to understand better what classes of mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;can evolve through the Darwinian processes of variation and selection&lt;br/&gt;when only feasible resources in terms of population sizes and numbers of&lt;br/&gt;generations are available. In the area of multi-core algorithms, a&lt;br/&gt;methodology will be developed for expressing and analyzing parallel&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that are optimal for a wide range of hardware performance&lt;br/&gt;parameters. Such algorithms would make possible portable software, that&lt;br/&gt;is aware of the parameters of the machine on which it executes, and can&lt;br/&gt;run efficiently on all such machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work on multi-core algorithms aims to have the practical goal of&lt;br/&gt;increasing the effective exploitation of multi-core computers as these&lt;br/&gt;become more pervasive. The work on evolution will highlight the fact&lt;br/&gt;that the question of how complex mechanisms could have evolved within&lt;br/&gt;the resources available, is a question that is resolvable by the methods&lt;br/&gt;of computational complexity, and aims to provide more precise&lt;br/&gt;mathematical specifications of what the Darwinian process can achieve.&lt;br/&gt;The work on holographic algorithms aims to make progress in our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of what are widely regarded as the most fundamental&lt;br/&gt;questions regarding the power of practical computation.</AbstractNarration>
