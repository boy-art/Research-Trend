    <AbstractNarration>This project develops a framework for deploying multi-robot teams on man-made structures for continual inspection, structural health monitoring, and minor repair tasks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this framework, sensory information obtained by a coordinated group of mobile robots is pooled, resulting in a diagnosis of the state of the structure on which the robots roam. In addition, methodologies for endowing the robots with the ability to self-diagnose are being explored. These topics involve the integration of advanced probabilistic, geometric, and mechanics-based computations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research are expected to enhance the robustness, lifetime, and range of applicability of robotic systems. Research results will be leveraged by collaborating with external research labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The robots and structures in the testbed being developed in this project, which are scaled down models of real-world systems, are ideal for student projects.&lt;br/&gt;Participation by undergraduates and local high-school students on research projects in the PI's lab will serve as a model for increasing interest in engineering research among these groups.</AbstractNarration>
