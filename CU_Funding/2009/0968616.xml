    <AbstractNarration>This project studies the ongoing NASA-ESA-ASI Cassini Mission to Saturn to better understand the issues that envelop complex socio-computation systems, such as the mutual interdependence of humans and machines, to present broader implications for the design of complex human-computer systems more generally. While the robots become famous, robotic space exploration missions also require networked and distant hardware to control spacecraft movement, extensive home-grown software suites that coordinate work activity, and several hundred human scientists and engineers who must negotiate scientific priorities and make decisions that guide the robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using ethnography, oral history interviews, and archival work, researchers will probe the practices of sociotechnical organization, distributed operations, data sharing, and community maintenance in an existing, complex, high-stakes and international sociocomputational environment. The research addresses the questions: what constraints does the social place on the technological, and vice versa? Also, how does the political and decision-making structure of a group align or clash with their technical infrastructure, and with what consequences for both social interaction and scientific production?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in its melding of five disciplinary areas of investigation - Science &amp; Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Organization Sciences, Human-Computer Interaction, and Human-Robot Interaction - to generate a holistic picture of the institutional and workplace realities of large-scale technoscience in a radically distributed context. The broader impacts of this work include design implications for the next generation of socially-intelligent computational systems both within and outside of planetary exploration.</AbstractNarration>
