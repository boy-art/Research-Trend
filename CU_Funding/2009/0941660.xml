    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing a set of active and collaborative learning modules for an introductory sophomore level electric circuits course that allow students to explore and utilize the standard concepts and techniques of electrical circuits in the context of applications to practical circuits. A novel feature of the project is the use of students who have recently completed the course to revise and refine the modules. The new course is being offered at Montana State University in Bozeman and via distance learning to students at Montana State University in Billings. Additional project objectives include facilitating the transfer of students in two-year pre-engineering and science programs within the state of Montana to Montana State University and developing a template for using advanced pedagogies in online engineering courses. The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an independent evaluator. The evaluation plan is designed to establish the quality of the materials and to ensure the project goals are met. The project's results are being disseminated through conferences and journal publications. The project includes specific efforts to increase the engagement of women and the Native American community in Montana.</AbstractNarration>
