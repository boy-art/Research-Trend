    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professor David E. Bergbreiter at Texas A&amp;M University for a research project that will use phase-selectively soluble polymer-bound catalysts in immiscible solvent mixtures to address important challenges in synthesis and catalysis and will have an effect on the areas of catalysis, synthesis, Green chemistry and polymer chemistry. The proposed research will extend the PI's past discoveries on the use of polymer-bound catalysts in homogeneous solutions to conduct reactions in oil-in-oil emulsions. The catalyst immobilization chemistry proposed is based principally on the properties of the soluble polymer support. Using chemistry developed in prior work will allow the preparation of a variety of homogeneous catalysts, and phase segregate and concentrate them in the discontinuous phase of oil-in-oil emulsions. Transesterification catalysts, organometallic catalysts and organocatalysts will all be studied. The reactions to be studied are macrocyclizations using several different methods such as transesterification, olefin metathesis, Baylis-Hilman reactions, and carboxylic acid additions to epoxides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Bergbreiter will perform research that will not only apply to multiple types of macrocyclizations (lactones, epoxides, Baylis-Hilmman), but also include careful and clever studies designed to optimize reaction rates, catalyst recovery, and removal of catalysts from products. Professor Bergbreiter?s work has also had an impact in the technology arena where earlier work was the basis of a recently described process by DuPont for a commercially viable route to clearcoats containing low volatile organic compounds (VOC) for automotive finishing applications. Broader impacts of this work include the training of undergraduate, PhD, and postdoctoral students. Professor Bergbreiter has had success introducing undergraduates both from Texas A&amp;M and elsewhere to research. His research program is expected to continue to involve a significant percentage of students from underrepresented groups. The current program included 34% women and 38% students from underrepresented groups among the undergraduates or graduate students who worked on the project. These percentages will increase to 50% in the future by targeting schools in Texas that serve underrepresented groups. International outreach will be achieved by working with an undergraduate institution in Qatar, and with universities in Japan and Thailand, which will broaden the cultural experiences of his students.</AbstractNarration>
