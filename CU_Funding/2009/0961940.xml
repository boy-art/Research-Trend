    <AbstractNarration>SES-0961940&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jane Sell&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Texas A&amp;M University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0962289&lt;br/&gt;PI: Carla Goar&lt;br/&gt;Institution: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even when there is no logical reason for them to do so, initial status differences among group members, such as race, class and gender, can organize interaction in groups. Such organization is often detrimental to both the individual and the group. We propose four experimental studies to study how racial inequality in task groups can be lessened. The first two studies examine how presentation of the group task affects racial inequality. The next two studies test whether group members can transfer their experiences from groups in which racial inequality is lessened to new groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The results reflect upon interactions common to many small groups, such as research teams or classrooms. Additionally the studies involve research training for both graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
