    <AbstractNarration>Next Generation Lithium-Ion Rechargeable Batteries Featuring Nano-Engineered Anode Architectures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nikhil Koratkar, Catalin Picu and Toh-Ming Lu&lt;br/&gt;Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silicon is one of the most promising anode materials for Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries because it has the highest known theoretical charge capacity and is the second most abundant element on earth. However Silicon anodes have limited applications because of the huge volume change associated with the insertion and extraction of Lithium. This causes cracking and pulverization of the anode, which leads to a loss of electrical contact and eventual fading of capacity. The objective of this project is to develop novel stress-resistant nanostructured Silicon anode architectures with a high capacity and long life. We will systematically study various anode architectures with a view to understanding and controlling failure in nanostructured Lithium-ion battery anodes. More specifically, we propose to study three categories of nanostructured anodes: (1) Nano-rod/nano-spring arrays of Silicon and other promising materials such as Aluminum and Tin, (2) nano-compliant support structures for conventional Silicon film anodes and (3) Silicon scoops deposited on nanorods composed of an electrochemically inert material. In addition to the experiments, atomic scale simulations are proposed to investigate the physics of Lithium diffusion and stress build-up in nanostructures. This information will be used to develop continuum models in order to determine the optimal structure of the nanopatterned electrode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rechargeable Lithium-ion batteries are integral to today's information-rich, mobile society. The proposed work will provide the fundamental understanding necessary to develop and refine the design of nanostructured anodes to enable order of magnitude enhancements in charge capacity, charge/discharge rate capability and cycle life of Lithium-ion batteries. This can lead to revolutionary new high performance battery technologies which in addition to portable electronics could also play a central role in next generation wireless communication devices, stationary storage batteries, microchips, defense applications, and even in hybrid and all electric vehicles.</AbstractNarration>
