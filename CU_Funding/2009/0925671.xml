    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Joyce V. Millen of Willamette University will undertake a three-year research and educational program to advance understanding of African diaspora-driven health philanthropy in the context of Africa's acute shortage of medical personnel. She will compare two migratory linkages: (1) between Senegal and France and (2) between Ghana and the United States. The research is designed to follow the circulatory trajectories of Senegalese and Ghanaian associations and health professionals from host countries of employment to countries of origin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher and her colleagaues will conduct ethnographic research among a select sample of Senegalese and Ghanaian diaspora associations in France and the United States. They will document the networks and processes through which these associations articulate with state and multilateral agencies in their efforts to transfer medical skills and health resources to their countries of origin. They will collect life history interviews among individual Senegalese and Ghanaian medical providers in the diaspora to ascertain on migration, work, and philanthropic efforts. The histories will provide data to assess whether class, duration away from homeland, and level of connectivity with homeland, among other variables, are predictive of diaspora philanthropic engagement. The last year of the study will culminate with ethnographic research in the Senegalese and Ghanaian towns identified in the first phases of research as recipient communities of diaspora-led efforts. The aim of this last phase of research is to ascertain how the medical philanthropic projects are being implemented and received locally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of the program employs a novel collaborative model that enables select American students to conduct ethnographic research in direct collaboration with African counterpart students from universities in Senegal and Ghana. The findings of this research will bring needed critical analysis to bear on current received wisdom regarding the potentials of "diasporas for development." The study will also bring empirically-grounded anthropological insights to broader disciplinary debates on transnationalism and deterritorialized citizenries.</AbstractNarration>
