    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Semiconducting nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) are tiny ?balls? of material with exciting optical and electronic properties that can be controlled by changing the size of the NQD and other parameters. They are relatively easy to incorporate into devices, and have already proven their utility as fluorescent markers for biological imaging. NQDs are being used in photovoltaics, energy efficient lighting, and photodetectors, though the electronic properties of NQDs are sensitive to their immediate surroundings. This Faculty Early Career Award supports a project seeking to understand electronic properties of nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) in environments relevant to functional optoelectronic devices. This will be done by using a scanning probe microscope that can investigate individual NQDs, measuring the charge, current, and location of the NQDs in a variety of environments, leading to improved device design. Furthermore, this project aims to increase general science literacy and motivate the female undergraduate students at Mount Holyoke College to pursue careers in science, by engaging undergraduates in hands-on research projects and developing a first year seminar. The seminar seeks to excite the students about present-day research and to educate both science majors and interested non-majors about how science ?happens? by reading and discussing recent popular coverage of scientific discoveries and debates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Award supports a project seeking to understand electronic properties of nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) in solid state structures, in particular an understanding of charge transport on and off NQDs. The research project will focus on the use of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) to locally probe NQD arrays, as well as isolated and aggregated NQDs deposited on a variety of materials and embedded in organic semiconductors. Scanned gate techniques, electric force microscopy, and conductive SPM can spatially reveal variations in electrical properties of nominally identical areas, illuminating the role of the local environment and imperfections of fabrication on microscopic and macroscopic properties. Furthermore, this project aims to increase general science literacy and motivate the female students at Mount Holyoke College to pursue careers in science, by engaging undergraduates in hands-on research projects and developing a first year seminar. The seminar seeks to excite the students about present-day research and to educate both science majors and interested non-majors about how science ?happens? by reading and discussing recent popular coverage of scientific discoveries and debates.</AbstractNarration>
