    <AbstractNarration>The distribution and organization of genes on chromosomes varies widely among animals. Chromosomes can change in number and size, as well as gene composition, over short evolutionary time scales. Furthermore, chromosome location can influence how genes are expressed. The aims of this project are to test alternative hypotheses for the origin and evolution of chromosome organization using diopsid flies as a model system. The research will focus on the genetic composition of the X and Y chromosomes. These chromosomes are responsible for much of the behavioral and physiological differences between males and females and are dynamic with respect to gene content. Also, preliminary research indicates that the X chromosome of diopsid flies is an autosome in other flies and, therefore, provides an opportunity to study how gene content and expression evolves on a newly derived X chromosome. The project will utilize advanced next-generation technology to identify a complete catalog of genes located on these chromosomes and their movements between species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project represents a collaboration between the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). The project will substantially enhance our understanding of the origin and evolution of new chromosomes and will influence scientific infrastructure by generating substantial genomic resources that will be made available through online databases. Training opportunities will be provided for students at all levels at both institutions. Finally, outreach will involve high school student interns at the AMNH and a high school teacher seminar series offered at UMD.</AbstractNarration>
