    <AbstractNarration>This Materials World Network focuses on Non-volatile Phase Change Memory (PCM) is a promising alternative for future data storage systems, as it is more scale-able and requires less power than present technologies. Understanding and controlling the materials science of the phase change process while writing data is of particular importance, as it defines the ultimate operational speed and is fundamental to surmounting challenges with stored data accuracy and longevity. To investigate these issues, this joint effort between the University of Connecticut and Lancaster University in the UK leverages complementary expertise at both sites in nanometer- and nanosecond- scale property measurements. In addition to a semester abroad for the supported students, teaching modules on the topic will be developed for local high school teachers, and two international scientific symposia as well as a special journal issue will be organized on the topic of this sponsored research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Present data storage systems are based on technologies that are difficult to scale, relatively slow, and/or energy inefficient given future storage requirements. Non-volatile Phase Change Memory (PCM), based on resistance changes for locally switchable crystalline vs. amorphous states, is a promising alternative. The materials science of this switching process is therefore of tremendous importance, especially the dynamics of nucleation and growth which defines ultimate switching speeds and is implicated in challenges with bit retention, fidelity, and fatigue. To investigate these issues, this joint US/UK effort leverages complementary expertise in quantitative electronic, mechanical, and thermal property measurements at the necessary nanometer and nanosecond scales. Accordingly, switching will be initiated electrically, thermally, and optically, and the switching pattern, speed, and mechanisms will be quantified by several variations of scanning probe microscopy as a function of composition, processing, and switching cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program features a semester abroad for the supported students, faculty exchanges, round-robin measurements, and extensive industrial collaboration. During the award, the PI?s will develop hands-on teaching modules for local high school teachers, jointly organize two international symposia, and co-edit a special journal issue on the topics of nanocharacterization and next-generation memory devices.</AbstractNarration>
