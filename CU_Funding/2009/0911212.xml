    <AbstractNarration>Given the wide range of reactions that ruthenium complexes can catalyze, this proposal focuses on the development of "one-pot" multi-step processes effected by known and new ruthenium complexes. The overall outcome of the proposed research will be more efficient tandem protocols for converting simple olefin containing starting materials into much more complex and valuable targets. Specifically, the powerful olefin metathesis reaction will be coupled with other complexity-building transformations, such as cyclopropanations, metal mediated couplings, oxidations, cycloadditions, isomerizations and radical atom transfer reactions to yield highly unique and valuable, ruthenium-catalyzed, tandem transformations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program at the NSF is supporting the research of Professor Snapper of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College. Professor Marc Snapper's research involves the development of more efficient and effective bond-forming strategies. The ability to effect multiple complex functional group and bond changes in a single operation can represent a considerable improvement in efficiency for accessing useful organic compounds. Moreover, minimizing the time, labor, solvents, reagents, energy, waste streams, and material losses by eliminating the isolation of intermediates will significantly reduce the cost and environmental impact of preparing desired targets. In general, this research will lead to new, more powerful reactions and molecule building strategies that will lower the cost and environmental impact of preparing current and future molecules of importance.</AbstractNarration>
