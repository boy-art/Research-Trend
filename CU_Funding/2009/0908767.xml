    <AbstractNarration>This Materials World Network award by the Metallic Materials and Nanostructures program and the Office of Special Program in the Division of Materials Research to Northeastern University is to synthesize and study heterostructured films of equiatomic Iron-Rhodium (FeRh) compound, and to map out its multi-dimensional phase space and identify low-energy pathways to tailor the first-order antiferro- to ferromagnetic phase transition and associated functional responses that are found in this compound. While first-order magnetic transitions are known to underlie an assortment of extreme functional phenomena with important technological attributes (colossal magnetoresistance, giant magnetocaloric character and giant magnetic shape memory), knowledge concerning key materials factors controlling these responses remains elusive. In this project, the researchers plan to modify the phase boundaries in model-system FeRh epilayers by: (1) employing additional magnetic layers to amplify or offset the applied magnetic field that drives the transition; (2) applying stress via substrate selection; and (3) exploiting interphase ferromagnetic exchange coupling. Unique educational features of the project are extended scientific student exchanges between the U.S. and the U.K. teams, as well as providing training to students in the application of advanced probes to the research such as synchrotron x-ray scattering, neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project features fundamental research focused on a member of a very rare class of materials -?magnetostructural materials? - that exhibit intimate interactions between the electrons in the material and the atoms that constitute its crystal lattice. This unique arrangement lends the material an extraordinary responsiveness to physical perturbations such that very small changes in temperature, magnetic/electric field or strain can drive a very large response in the material. Thus this class of materials is poised for development and potential application in advanced sensors to monitor environmental conditions and enable, via computer networking, so-called ?smart? networks with relevance to energy management and efficiency. To facilitate experimental clarity, the simple magnetic compound FeRh will be made in thin film form and studied at the partner laboratories in the U.S. (Northeastern University, Brookhaven National Laboratory) and in the U.K. (University of Leeds, ISIS/Rutherford Appleton Laboratory). Students from the educational institutions involved will participate in transatlantic research exchanges and will have the opportunity to be trained in fundamental science as well as in the use of advanced probes such as synchrotron x-ray scattering, neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy.</AbstractNarration>
