    <AbstractNarration>A major question in conservation biology is why some populations with low levels of genetic variation remain relatively stable while others decline in size. Stable populations may not have lost genetic variation related to disease resistance, such as the suite of resistance genes known as the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). Theory suggests that natural selection is more likely to maintain functionally important MHC variation in populations that have experienced declines in size. This study will make direct estimates of natural selection on the MHC and other immunity genes using data from both historic and contemporary populations of the greater prairie-chicken, which is one of the most threatened species of bird in North America. This project will also examine the association between variation at MHC genes and parasites, immunity and survival in two small populations that are undergoing augmentation with translocations (Wisconsin) and captive breeding (Texas) to increase genetic variation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will be valuable for biologists studying the effects of population size on disease and parasite resistance, and it will provide management guidelines for captive breeding and translocating animals, practices that are likely to increase with continuing loss of prairie habitat. Graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher will be trained in immunogenetics, and the project should lead to valuable new genetic markers for studying immunity-related genes in other species. The PIs will work with environmental education centers in Milwaukee and Dallas-Fort Worth on citizen science and teacher education projects that focus on the health of wildlife. The results will be broadly disseminated to state and federal wildlife agencies, environmental groups and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
