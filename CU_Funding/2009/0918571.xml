    <AbstractNarration>This proposal coordinates the efforts of several geomechanics investigators planned at the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) facility at Homestake Mine. The project will provide a framework that will allow construction and operational decisions to be made efficiently while ensuring that important design parameters are obtained. At present, knowledge of the characteristics of rock masses and, particularly the capability to predict the performance of underground openings are limited. This limitation is caused by the lack of three dimensional exposure, the related difficulty to know what is in the rock mass and the lacking knowledge of the basic behavior of discontinuous media such as rock masses. At DUSEL it will be possible to use existing and new rock mass exposure/exploration to develop rock mass models and to then compare them to reality when construction occurs. Since construction occurs in stages it will be possible to verify and improve the models in stages. It is also very likely that doing all this together with other scientists and engineers will lead to innovative thinking about engineering problems. DUSEL provides the absolutely unique opportunity to further science and engineering both in research and education. Underground construction, be that for civil purposes (transportation, storage, utilities, possibly habitation) or for mining, is very costly and time consuming. The proposed research will lead to innovations, which have the potential for significant cost and time savings while maintaining or increasing safety.</AbstractNarration>
