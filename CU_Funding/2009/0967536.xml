    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on applying bio-inspired principles to industrial resource networks and to creating relationships and metrics for design. This project is envisioned as a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to an investigation of biological network efficiencies and translation of the pertinent mechanisms into models for industrial resource networks. The research is focused on reducing the environmental burden and cost associated with human activities involving industrial networks. The intention is provide substantive quantifiable metrics for the design of networks within the industrial domain. The project goal, to achieve a fundamental understanding of why the application of ecological principles and patterns leads to environmentally superior industrial resource networks, is grounded in specific tasks that progressively build the foundation of knowledge, culminating in verification through robust industrial case studies. The impact of the reduction of environmental burden through bio-inspired design of industrial networks promises to be significant. The use of case studies will enhance outreach to industrial sectors with win-win examples of industrial ecology. The project is designed to systematically build on established relationships including industrial partnerships and educational programs that bring together biology students and engineers and others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bruce K.
