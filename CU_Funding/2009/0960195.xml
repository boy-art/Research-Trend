    <AbstractNarration>0960195&lt;br/&gt;Johnson&lt;br/&gt;U. of Oklahoma Norman Campus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for the acquisition of a Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) at OU for imaging, analytical work, and electron beam lithography (EBL). Essentially these tools are the "eyes" and "pen" required for doing nanoscience. Features of this modern FE-SEM include: (1) low acceleration voltage which provides excellent resolution even below 1 kV on conductors, insulators and even biological materials and (2) a bigger sample chamber that will allow us look at larger samples without additional preparation and will permit a "suite of techniques" that will provide truly nanoscale topographic, structural, and compositional contrast along with elemental and crystalline characterization. Electron beam lithography on the FE-SEM will provide us with writing capabilities below 10 nm linewidths.&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of a FE-SEM will provide enormous intellectual merit to the engineering and science programs at OU. Specific examples of the intellectual merit of this proposal include: Accelerate research efforts on semiconductor-based structures as innovative materials for electronic, photonic, and spintronic device applications; Advance the development of novel nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery; Provide an understanding of the role of scaffold structure on cell growth and cell integration in a variety of tissue engineered materials; and Expand our knowledge of the interactions between polymers and single-walled carbon nanotubes.&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of an FE-SEM will also take nanoscience outreach to the next level throughout the state. Specific examples of the broader impacts of this proposal include: Strengthen OU's efforts to act as a regional hub for nanotechnology in industry and academia; Tele or web-presence will enhance our already strong electron microscopy outreach effort; and Broad impact will be felt in existing outreach efforts with high schools, community colleges, and regional 4 year universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Oklahoma's acquisition of a state-of-the-art Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) will allow researchers access to the nanoworld, allowing easy and versatile imaging of conductors, insulators, nanoelectronic and biological materials. Truly nanoscale topographic, structural, and compositional images and information require this technology to take our nanotechnology to the near-atomic level. A large sample chamber will allow larger samples to be examined intact, with minimal preparation, permitting a suite of analytical techniques to provide nanochemically-informed fabrication of diverse materials. Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) capacities on the FE-SEM will allow nanoscopic patterns to be written onto materials at the finest widths possible. These capabilities will provide us with the means to probe, interact, and manipulate their properties on the nanoscale.&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of a FE-SEM will have an enormous intellectual impact on the already first rate engineering and science programs at OU. Specifically this proposal will allow an accelerations of research efforts on semiconductor-based structures including innovative materials for electronic, magnetic, and light emitting and sensing devices; will advance the development of novel nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery; will provide detailed understanding of the role of scaffold structure on cell growth and cell integration in a variety of tissue engineered materials(e.g. synthetic bone and organ synthesis); expand our knowledge of the interactions between polymers and single-walled carbon nanotubes for the ultimate goal of electrically conductive and high strength polymer composite materials.&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of an FE-SEM will also take nanoscience outreach to the next level throughout the state by strengthening OU's efforts to act as a regional hub for nanotechnology in industry and academia. In addition, an FE-SEM will enhance our already strong electron microscopy outreach efforts with K-12 schools, community colleges, and regional 4-year universities by providing a means to demonstrate on site (e.g. demonstrations and tours) or remotely through tele or web-presence the vital role electron microscopy has in virtually all fields of scientific endeavor.</AbstractNarration>
