    <AbstractNarration>GOALI: Characterization of Energy Storage System for Wind Energy Support&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop an innovative integrated wind and energy storage system to support wind energy to achieve higher penetration in the electric utility grid. Energy storage can play a major role in improving the short-term and long-term dynamics, power dispatchability, and reducing voltage and frequency footprint of the wind energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main intellectual merit of this project is to model, simulate, and characterize an integrated system of wind turbine generator hardware and controls with a new utility scale battery. The analysis from the modeling and simulation will be applied and a scaled down model of the system will be built, tested and characterized. The system developed in this project is capable of assisting in mitigating dynamic power intermittency, long term power smoothing and power shifting, regulating voltage, controlling power ramp rate, and frequency droop control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main broader impact is to provide quality integrated education, research, and engineering to meet the emerging workforce and needs of nation?s energy industry. The project team will promote education as an integrated part of this project. The results of this research will be integrated in workshops, short courses, and courses to be taught to undergraduate and graduate students and working professionals. Although there is a large population of minorities, including African-Americans and Hispanics, in the greater Milwaukee area, the percent of minority students at UWM is insignificant. One goal of this project is to include underrepresented minority and female students in this research.</AbstractNarration>
