    <AbstractNarration>This research project in gravitational physics is largely in support of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). It will be theoretical, although in many aspects closely related to experiments. In LIGO instrumentation, this project seeks to finalize the optical-configuration design of LIGO detectors after the successful initial operation of Advanced LIGO; it will also critically evaluate optical configurations for third-generation detectors, the next major upgrade to LIGO, while continue to generate new ideas. This project will continue to study how gravitational-wave experiments will probe quantum mechanical behavior of macroscopic objects. In gravitational-wave data analysis, this project seeks strategies that enable fast detection of compact binary systems (consisting black holes and/or neutron stars) by incorporating advanced signal-processing techniques. In general relativity theory, this project seeks to shed light on the dynamics of the highly curved space-time of binary black-hole mergers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase the scientific output of gravitational-wave astronomy by contributing to the short- and long-term improvement of instruments, by optimizing data analysis strategies, and by improving understandings of gravitational-wave sources. It will eventually lead to the experimental proof (or disproof) that quantum mechanical laws also apply to macroscopic (human-sized) objects. This project will also have the following broader impacts: (i) It will serve as a training ground for young theoretical physicists, through solving a broad range of problems. (ii) The PI will assume teaching responsibility at Caltech. He plans to update the web-based course in gravitational-wave science that he assisted Professor Kip Thorne in creating. This course has helped train graduate students at Caltech and other universities and institutes, and has made gravitational-wave science accessible to scientists and engineers throughout the world. (iii) Through cooperation with Glendale Community College, results of cutting-edge research in gravitational-wave science will be communicated to a diverse student body; participation of research projects by students with stronger math and physics background will encourage them to pursue a career in science and engineering. Through web pages and demonstration programs, gravitational-wave science will be communicated to a broader audience in the general public. (iv) The PI will carry out research in collaboration with scientists in Germany, Australia, Japan, and Russia. These collaborations will strongly influence the design of the European third-generation gravitational-wave detector, the Einstein Telescope, and maximize scientific output of prototype detectors in Australia and Japan.</AbstractNarration>
