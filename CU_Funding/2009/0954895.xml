    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the PI in his development of the HAWC (High Altitude Water Cherenkov detector) data systems and online data processing, and his leading role in the analysis of HAWC data. This analysis will include searching for VHE (very high energy) emission from GRBs (gamma ray bursters) and developing a multiparticle analysis of AGN (active galactic nuclei) emission by combining HAWC observations with IceCube, Fermi, Swift, and RXTE data. HAWC will have a sensitivity 10 -15 times greater than previous instruments exploring VHE cosmic rays. The source of these cosmic rays remains unclear but possible candidates for these are AGNs and GRBs. HAWC is modular in design and data taking will begin when the first modules are commissioned. The PI will also use what is learned by HAWC to tailor a search for neutrinos with the IceCube array. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAWC is planned to be built in Sierra Negra Mexico, which will lead to strong international collaborations between scientists from the US, Mexico, and other countries. In addition to mentoring graduate students and postdocs, the PI will enhance Penn State's Upward Bound Math and Science Program for students from urban Pennsylvania schools who attend a summer program at the university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported by the Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering of the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
