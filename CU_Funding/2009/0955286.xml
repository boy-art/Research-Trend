    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the CAREER development plan of Prof. Stephan Link of the Department of Chemistry at William Marsh Rice University. Prof. Link and his students will combine novel single particle optical spectroscopy techniques with electron microscopy methods in order to understand the energy coupling between metal nanoparticles in close packed nanoparticle assemblies. Understanding the energy transfer in nanoparticle assemblies will ultimately determine the feasibility and aid in the development of cost-effective platforms for bottom-up chemical synthesis and self-assembly of nanoparticle-based functional materials such as antennas and waveguides, which are tolerant of variations in NP size, shape, and ordering. The PI and his students will connect their excitement about research and discovery in nanotechnology with outreach activities to educate K-12 students about nanotechnology and inspire them about careers in science related fields. Specifically, the PI will develop lectures for K-12 students on how NP size and shape is related to color and how this correlation is observed in an ensemble vs. single particle study. These lectures will be presented in the Civic Scientist Program at Rice University. The proposed project will provide excellent training opportunities to graduate students at the research frontier of physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
