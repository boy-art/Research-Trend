    <AbstractNarration>The Third Midwest Statistics Research Colloquium will be held at the University of Chicago March 26 and 27, 2010. The conference will consist of three sessions of two talks each, an additional two sessions of talks by graduate students, and an evening poster session. Speakers who have already accepted invitations are Yuguo Chen, Shuva Gupta, Chris Hans, Sunduz Keles, and Susan Murphy. Funds from NSF will be used to defray the travel and lodging costs of speakers and of graduate students and other new researchers. It is our intention that the Midwest Statistics Research Colloquium becomes an annual event serving to disseminate the best research being done in the region and to support intellectual exchanges in the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Midwest possesses a large number of strong statistics departments. To encourage interactions between these departments and the broader statistical research community in the region, a number of these departments sponsored the First Statistics Research Colloquium, held at the University of Chicago in March 2008. This was followed by a second meeting, also held in Chicago, in March 2009. The investigator, together with the organizing committee, seeks to follow up the success of these meetings with a third meeting in March, 2010. The day and a half meeting includes talks on a wide array of topics in theoretical and applied statistics and a poster session for graduate students and other new researchers. The regional nature of the meeting will allow many graduate students to carpool to the meeting, thus allowing many students to attend at modest cost. In addition, we will be encouraging direct interactions among the graduate students to get them started building the personal and intellectual relationships among their peers that will nourish them throughout their careers.</AbstractNarration>
