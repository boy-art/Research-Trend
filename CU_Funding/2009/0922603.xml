    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kean University has been awarded funds from the NSF to acquire equipment that will establish a core, multi-user DNA sequencing facility called Molecular Ecology and Biosystematics Laboratory (MEBL). The instrumentation includes: (1) an Applied Biosystems, four-capillary AB3130 Genetic Analyzer, with Sequencher 4.2 software workstation; (2) BioRad DNA Engine Peltier Thermal Cycler + Chromo-4 Real-Time PCR Detection System; (3) Eppendorf Refrigerated Microcentrifuge (Model 5417R); (4) Eppendorf Mastercyler Thermal Gradient Cycler (Model E5331000 045); (5) Fisher Scientific Isotemp Ultralow-Temperature Freezer (Model 13-990-32); (6) Perkin Elmer LAMBDA 950 Spectrophotometer w/ UV/VIS/NIR capabilities; and (7) Percival Scientific P-99 Walk-in Plant Growth Chamber with Advanced Intellius Controller and H-12 Relative Humidity Control Option. The equipment will be used by faculty and undergraduate students in research centered on the use of DNA sequence information. The research will address a broad range of questions related to the molecular ecology and biosystematics of: (1) plant-associated microfungi, (2) marine macroalgae, (3) melanthiaceous angiosperms and (4) hymenopteran insects in urban ecosystems. The instruments will be used for undergraduate student training, especially gender and ethnically underrepresented individuals who are interested in a career in the sciences. Kean University is ideally suited for this effort because of its focus on undergraduate education and its highly diverse and non-traditional student body, and because of its proximity to leading pharmaceutical and biotech industries in northern New Jersey. The MEBL will serve as a catalyst for the recruitment and subsequent employment of underrepresented student groups into the life sciences, in addition to forging cross-disciplinary ties between Biology, Chemistry and Computer Science Departments within the University. Additionally, the MEBL will serve as a foundation for the strengthening of pre-existing curricula, as well as the development of a set of new curricula specifically focused on the acquisition and analysis of DNA sequence information. Results from studies conducted with the new molecular ecology equipment will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through student and faculty presentations at regional or national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
