    <AbstractNarration>This project will fund replacement of damaged and deteriorated cabinets for mammals in the Oklahoma State University Collection of Vertebrates (OSU COV). Purchase of new cabinets will allow the PI to move more than 13,250 specimens of mammals, representing 26 of 29 extant orders, into a single location. Specimens have heretofore been stored in three different locations in six different designs of cabinets, ranging from modern steel cases to secretarial supply cabinets and cabinets hand made by Curator Emeritus Bryan P. Glass and his students during 1940-1950s. Not only have specimens been inadequately protected, but the diversity of cabinet designs and dimensions results in inefficient use of newly renovated space allocated to COV in 2009. New cabinets will alleviate currently poor storage conditions, improve use of newly renovated space, and allow thoughtful and steady expansion for research and teaching. Osteological material will be housed in dust-free cabinets, and fragile tanned hides will be moved into custom cabinets similar to those for large, fragile textiles. This project also facilitates reorganization of specimens to reflect current taxonomy. The resulting improvements in storage conditions and organization will facilitate collaborations with Art Department programs at OSU, increase accessibility to the public of northern Oklahoma, and enhance collaboration with K-12 programs in the Colleges of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology and Education. The PI will offer a multidisciplinary course in curatorial practices supported by this award. In addition to students enrolled in the course, the project will provide direct support to one doctoral and three undergraduate students and will supplement existing practicum experiences for approximately five undergraduates per semester.</AbstractNarration>
