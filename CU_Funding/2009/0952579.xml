    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this NSF-CAREER project is the regulation of gene expression in maize, an agriculturally important crop plant in the United States. Gene expression is a regulated process that determines which biochemical components are present and active at any particular time in a living cell. Recently, biological science has been dramatically advanced by the sequencing of the genomes of a wide range of organisms, including maize. Although the gene sequences are essential to understanding the traits, growth, and development of an organism, they represent only one type of heritable information that influences the regulation of gene expression. The goal of this project is to determine how gene expression is regulated by epigenetic factors; that is, factors other than the actual sequence of genes. Examples are the addition of methyl groups to the DNA in or near particular genes and the association of regulatory regions of DNA with specific proteins, either of which can be heritable information and can influence which genes are expressed. This research will use genetic and genomic techniques to identify specific factors required for epigenetic gene regulation of introduced and naturally occurring genes in maize and will explore interspecies variation in epigenetic gene regulation. Currently, relatively little is known about the importance of epigenetic regulation to phenotypes and adaptation or about how such information is passed from one generation to the next, so the project will also address these important questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator strives to improve scientific literacy beginning at the precollege level and to inspire and advance young scientists by providing them with positive research experiences through their direct involvement with intellectually stimulating research projects. Maize provides an excellent system through which to teach and learn genetics, presenting many opportunities to observe examples of important genetic concepts. Every experiment in this project will be conducted by postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate trainees. Emphasis will be placed on excellence in preparation for scientific careers and in mentoring young scientists for success. Additionally, the project will provide information about the genetic regulation of transgenes in genetically modified organisms and will improve the understanding of how gene expression is regulated in an agronomically important crop plant. In the future, this basic knowledge can be applied to trait and yield improvements in maize.</AbstractNarration>
