    <AbstractNarration>Computer Engineering (32) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project expands the capacity of the Iowa State University (ISU) SFS Cyber Corps program. Designated by the National Security Agency as a charter Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education, ISU further recognizes the importance of the information assurance (IA) field by supporting an IA Center on campus. Through this project, ISU continues participation in the NSF SFS program. Faculty from the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Political Science, Mathematics, Educational Leadership, and Logistics, Operations, and Management Information Systems lead the interdisciplinary Cyber Corps program. Students work closely with the faculty to receive IA training, conduct research, and develop as leaders and team members. Students complete IA courses and develop deeper problem-solving skills through more in-depth research efforts and involvement with major professors. All students participate in the unique and critical component of the ISU SFS program: leadership, teamwork and professionalism development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expanded SFS program provides faculty team leaders with a foundation to develop a year-round recruiting plan with special emphasis on: increasing the number of participants from underrepresented groups; further enhancing the selection process; supporting the strong student cohort experience; increasing the scope of mentoring for students; more systematically involving all students in IA research; and employing additional measures of program success. This infrastructure allows placing 100% graduating students in the federal government after graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ISU SFS program continues to benefit society by providing the federal workforce with new professionals who have the capacity to address the problems of securing critical federal information infrastructure in innovative ways. It contributes to the IA knowledge base by enhancing several ISU research programs that address important issues including intrusion detection systems; network security; data privacy and security; dependable systems and networks; and security policy.</AbstractNarration>
