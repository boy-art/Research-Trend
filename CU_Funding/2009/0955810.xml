    <AbstractNarration>In the last several years large observational programs have produced results that have led to a basic understanding of how star formation in galaxies has evolved over cosmic time. However, an understanding of why star formation varies as it does has remained elusive. This is primarily due to a lack of information about the dense reservoirs of gas that serve as the fuel of star formation in these galaxies. In this proposal Dr. Baker outlines a program to characterize the masses, distributions, and physical conditions of the dense gas in a range of star-forming galaxies. The core strategy of the program is to target distant (high-redshift) galaxies that have been gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxy clusters. This proposal will use the NSF-funded ALMA array to make critical observations for the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will support one graduate and one undergraduate for the duration of the grant. The undergraduates will be participate in the Research in Science and Engineering (RISE) program at Rutgers University, a program specially aimed at underrepresented groups and/or first-generation college students. Additional educational activities, such as the inclusion of modern astronomy topics in physics classes, will take place as part of an existing collaboration between Dr. Baker and Xavier University in New Orleans and a majority-minority high school in Newark, New Jersey. The materials developed through this grant will also be incorporated into the Rutgers Future Scholars program.</AbstractNarration>
