    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS 09-23203 &lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Murphy, Robin R.; Ames, Aaron D.; Gutierrez-Osuna, Ricardo; Song, Dezhen; Stoleru, Radu&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Texas A &amp; M&lt;br/&gt; College Station, TX 77843-3000&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI/Acq.: Mobile, Distributed Instrumentation for Response Research (RESPOND-R)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring equipment to create a mobile, modular, distributed instrument called RESPOND-R, aims to develop an integrated, interoperable research instrument suitable for a comprehensive use of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies for various types of incidents: urban building and bridge collapse (earthquakes, hurricanes, explosives), radiological or chemical spills, and terrorism. CPS explores new technologies such as robots, wireless networks, miniature sensors, sensor networks, and other types for emergency preparedness, prevention, response, and recovery. The instrument services projects in multidisciplinary research in Emergency Informatics for disaster response. Emergency Informatics consists of a real-time collection, processing, distribution, and visualization of information for emergency preservation, preparedness, response, and recovery. RESPOND-R addresses the lack of an Integrated Emergency Informatics Instrument that can be configured to support scenario-based experimentation and transported to exercises and responses. To capture the interaction of devices, the physical worlds, and human decision making, the project will use the Disaster City facility at the institution. CPS components in core areas (unmanned systems, imaging/chemical and radiological sensors, wireless communication networks, nodes and motes, and human performance) will be acquired. Addressing testing within real-world conditions and scenarios, RESPOND-R is expected to advance knowledge in the emerging, multidisciplinary fields of Emergency Informatics and CPS by providing access to a complete, large scale system that is located in a fidelity disaster testbed or can be transported to homeland security exercises or actual incidents. RESPOND-R will be open to researchers outside the institution, with a projection that 22 universities will participate over 3 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Used by 18 faculty in 8 departments and 2 colleges (Engineering and Architecture), the instrument contributes to educate 10-20 graduate students each year through field components of courses and dissertation work. Leveraging initiatives for underrepresented group, RESPOND-R will also be utilized for the training of 1000 responders and policy makers. In keeping with instruments used by ?storm chasers,? the instrument will be deployable for exercises and disasters where CPS components can reduce negative outcomes of events while gathering extremely valuable data and/or save lives.</AbstractNarration>
