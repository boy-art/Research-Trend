    <AbstractNarration>A fundamental challenge in evolutionary biology is to understand the mechanisms that generate biological diversity. Traditional studies of diversity have focused on comparing traits between distant groups but such an approach tells little about the mechanisms that cause the differences between closely related species. Darwin's Finches in the Galapagos Islands comprise a group of fourteen closely related species that has evolved extreme diversity of their beak shapes and sizes. Similarly, the Caribbean Bullfinches, an independently-evolved group of closely related species, display similar levels of beak variety. This second group provides an ideal opportunity to test whether the genetic tool kit that fueled the diversity of beak shapes in Darwin's Finches is shared with other species. The researchers will perform analyses of gene expression in natural populations of both groups of birds followed by experiments with beak development in chicken embryos in the laboratory. This project will 1) establish which genes are involved in generating the highly specific seed-eating beaks of Darwin's Ground Finches and 2) investigate whether the same genes are used in a different group of birds to adapt to similar environments. The results of this research will aid the general understanding of how embryological processes generate variation within and among species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary nature of this project, combining fieldwork and developmental genetics in an evolutionary context, will involve collaborations with scientists from several fields of biology. The work involves international collaborations and training, plus the involvement and mentoring of undergraduates in field and laboratory methods.</AbstractNarration>
