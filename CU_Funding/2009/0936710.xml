    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS 07-07939 07-08344&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Isler, Ibrahim V. Papanikolopoulos, Nikolaos&lt;br/&gt; Drineas, Petros; Trinkle, Jeffrey He, Tian&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute University of Minnesota - Twin Cities&lt;br/&gt; Troy, NY 12180-3522 Minneapolis, MN 55455-5200&lt;br/&gt;Title: IAD: Collab Rsch: Research/Education Infrastructure Based on Modular Miniature Robot Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project, developing a modular hardware and software infrastructure (miniature robots with the pertinent software), aims to identify minimum capabilities required for accomplishing tasks which are crucial for most robotics-sensor applications. The work involves investigating the relationship between the capabilities of individual units and the collective capabilities of the entire robotic team. The major innovation lies in the creation of a flexible design spectrum for both research and education based on the capabilities of the individual units. On the lower end of the spectrum, the basic design "Explorer," a robot based on a Gumstix unit and earlier robot designs from one of the institutions, provides an inexpensive and yet significantly powerful solution. On the higher end, the platform "MicroVision," a robot based on the Intel Pentium M processor and RoboAudioStix board, provides real-time video streaming and processing using standard off-the-shelf hardware and open-source video algorithms. The modularity of both designs allows the addition of special hardware capabilities. The infrastructure aims at low-cost, easy-to-use platforms that support research and can be adopted into courses. Specifically, this development enables design of robotics sensor-network systems that can&lt;br/&gt;. Communicate reliably and efficiently via multi-hop in the presence of frequent network topology changes;&lt;br/&gt;. Identify relative positions among members of a robotic team promptly and accurately for effective coordination;&lt;br/&gt;. Enable energy-efficient marsupial maneuvering;&lt;br/&gt;. Provide collaborative sensing with spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal coverage guarantees; and&lt;br/&gt;. Interact with environments through grasping and manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This infrastructure will be used for senior theses and K-12 students will be engaged via school visits and science field days. An annual Robot Camp will be held. The activities will be helped by the National Center for Engineering and Technology Education (NCETE). Coordination with Berea and Smith College, as well as UVA ascertains exchange among undergraduate- and minority-serving institutions.</AbstractNarration>
