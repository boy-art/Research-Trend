    <AbstractNarration>This project revolves around the enhancement in synthetic efficiency by using alkynes as key building blocks. Most notably, the enhanced chemoselectivity of an alkyne as well as its ability to be chemoselectively transformed into reactive functional groups will be pursued, which should minimize the use of protecting groups, a major contributor to synthetic inefficiency. Furthermore, it explores the invention of addition reactions where anything else is needed only catalytically, most notably reactions based on ruthenium catalysis. Transformations that previously were unknown or quite difficult not only may become feasible but may be performed with high atom economy. A rare principle, the use of two separate transition metal catalyzed reactions occurring in the presence of each other either concurrently or consecutively, will also be examined. In addition, the formation and reactivity of ruthenium enolates will be studied for chemo, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Professor Barry M. Trost of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University. Professor Trost's program will contribute to making the synthesis of complex bioactive molecules more environmentally benign by design. By so doing, it will help transform one of the most environmentally poor sectors of the chemical industry, the specialty chemical industry which includes both the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries, into a much more environmentally sound one.</AbstractNarration>
