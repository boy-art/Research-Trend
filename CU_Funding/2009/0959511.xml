    <AbstractNarration>0959511&lt;br/&gt;Sankar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computed tomography (CT) is the 3D-reconstruction of projections of an object viewed from different directions. CT non-destructively generates a fully 3D model of samples that allows many possibilities for analysis: the non-destructive visualization of slices (a very powerful aspect), arbitrary sectional views, pseudo-color representations and pore analysis. Technological advances have led to progressive improvements in CT resolution and accuracy. In the past, synchrotron radiation-based microCT (SRìCT) has been the high resolution technique of choice. Nanotomography (nanoCT), a recently developed technique, exploits X-ray sources with sub-ìm focal spot size to yield spatial resolutions down to 200-300 nm. NanoCT enables a large range of applications ranging from low-absorbing biological samples to high-absorbing metal objects such as metallic implant materials. The proposed system provides room for future expansion to design and incorporate appropriate accessories for high-resolution in situ visualization of material behavior in in vivo environmental conditions, as dictated by research findings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision of NCAT's NSF ERC-RMB is to revolutionize metallic biomaterials and underlying sciences and technologies, leading to engineered systems that will interface with the human body to prolong and improve quality of life, coupled with the development of a vibrant, diverse workforce well-prepared for the multidisciplinary and global challenges and opportunities of the new millennium. The mission is to deliver on the potential of bio/nanoengineering to dramatically improve treatments for orthopedic, craniofacial and cardiovascular ailments. The goal is to develop new implant materials and tunable biodegradable metals that can grow and adapt to the human body and eventually dissolve when no longer needed.</AbstractNarration>
