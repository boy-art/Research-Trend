    <AbstractNarration>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for determining the structure of molecules, and is the basis for the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology which is now an established feature of modern medical diagnostics. In this project, supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Yoshitaka Ishii of the University of Illinois at Chicago and his research group will develop methods to drastically accelerate NMR spectroscopy for solid materials and biomolecules, which is generally called solid-state NMR (SSNMR). The proposed work would employ paramagnetic doping, very fast magic angle spinning, and an ultra high magnetic field in order to increase the speeds of the data collection 10-30 fold. Another component of the research involves 13C sample enrichment to facilitate SSNMR analysis of graphene/graphite based nano materials, in particular, graphene oxide and graphite oxide, at molecular level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Ishii's research will advance NMR technology applications to insoluble proteins and non-crystalline materials which cannot be analyzed by other tools such as x-ray crystallography. Advances in the Ishii group research will likely have impacts in the many venues of NMR based technology, including nanomaterials analysis, and MRI. Professor Ishii will integrate his research into his educational activities by providing hands-on NMR experiments in a graduate NMR course, and in the physical chemistry laboratory for senior undergraduates. Professor Ishii will also develop MRI experiments in the undergraduate course by incorporating a gradient coil into an existing spectrometer for solution samples. Subsequent exercises will be developed that address the correlation of contrast-agent used in chemical imaging with relaxation time of an NMR signal. Finally, Professor Ishii will participate in the University of Illinois at Chicago's Summer Research Opportunities for Undergraduates Program (SROP).</AbstractNarration>
