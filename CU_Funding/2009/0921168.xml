    <AbstractNarration>How are we able to prevent ourselves from being distracted? How can we overcome our compulsions, tics and inappropriate urges? These are questions about cognitive control. A good understanding of the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying such control is of paramount importance for many aspects of everyday life as well as for basic science. A fruitful way to study cognitive control is to examine how people stop already initiated responses. Stopping an already initiated response could be an experimental model for the way in which we stop all kinds of urges in everyday life. Recent research suggests that stopping is achieved by several key "nodes" in the brain. It is likely that communication between the nodes occurs via long-range connections (white matter tracts). With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Adam Aron and his research team will test this idea of a network of long-range connections underlying stopping behavior. The approach is twofold: first, to use a form of neuroimaging to measure the strength of the connections in a sample of healthy young adults, and to examine how variations in the strength of the connections relates to individual differences in the behavioral ability to stop; second, to image the connections in patients with specific brain injuries. If particular connections are key for stopping, then damage to these connections will produce problems with stopping even when the key brain "nodes" themselves are intact. Overall, these studies will harness recently-developed methods for the analysis of brain connections to reveal novel information about how the network of connections between key brain regions underlies human control. They are in keeping with recent developments in cognitive neuroscience which emphasize the importance of connections rather than just brain regions themselves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funded work will complement activities in Dr. Aron's laboratory which already have an impact on science education at multiple stages, including outreach activities in San Diego area schools, hosting of minority students in the lab and undergraduate and graduate teaching. The work adds unique educational value by introducing new scientific components into Dr. Aron's lab and department: these include the study of patients with brain lesions and methods for analyzing brain connections. Overall, the planned experiments could yield information about the neural architecture of stopping that has implications for diverse domains such as human development, jurisprudence and neuropsychiatry. Alterations in brain connections, perhaps related to developmental delays, disease, or injury, could lead to deficits in inhibiting inappropriate actions. Various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as attention deficits, tic disorders, over-eating and substance abuse may relate to alterations in the brain connections underlying stopping.</AbstractNarration>
