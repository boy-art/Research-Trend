    <AbstractNarration>Control of complex systems at the atomic scale is at the frontier of nano-technology. At this scale, the effects of quantum mechanics allow for a fundamentally new generation of information processing devises such as quantum-computers, communication systems, and precise sensors. These effects will be studied in a joint theoretical-experimental project involving ultra-cold vapors of approximately 1,000,000 cesium atoms trapped and probed by laser light. This collection of atoms act as a single unit analogous to a spinning top. The collective spin will be controlled with lasers and magnetic fields in order to create new quantum states that can form the foundation for encoding and communicating information at the quantum level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will contribute to the knowledge base of quantum information science, and to the training of future scientists in this highly interdisciplinary field. Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, including education, research, and the dissemination of results. The project will become a cornerstone of the newly-formed Center for Quantum Information and Control. Video conferencing will be used to allow participation of CQuIC partners in the regular activities of CQuIC, including weekly group meetings and research seminars, and strengthen the connections between junior and senior members through an annual research retreat. All students and senior personnel will actively participate in the Southwest Quantum Information Technology (SQuInT) network, including the annual workshop. During its 11-year history SQuInT has provided a vibrant avenue for exchange of ideas and results in QIS, with particular emphasis given to PhD students, postdocs, and new researchers in the field.</AbstractNarration>
