    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Humboldt State University (HSU) to establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program to engage under-represented minority students in a research and mentoring program to prepare them for graduate study in the biological sciences. A cohort consisting of six students will be trained, except the first cohort in which only five students will be involved. NSF funds will be used to support each undergraduate participant for a total of two calendar years while in the program. Over the 5-year period of the grant, a total of twenty three (23) students will be trained in the program. The program will primarily recruit Native American and Latino/a students with the goals of increasing the number of students from these groups who graduate from HSU in the biologically-related sciences and facilitating their transition into graduate programs. Students will enter the program during the summer after their freshman year, and will engage in a series of three rotations to explore various research projects and meet potential research mentors. During their first Fall semester, the students will enroll in a Research Methods Course that will cover topics in scientific method, study design, proposal preparation, scientific writing and presentation. During the course, each student will develop a detailed research proposal for a project that they will pursue for the remainder of the program. Student research will be individually mentored by one of at least sixteen faculty coming from seven departments in HSU's College of Natural Resources and Sciences. The research areas of the faculty are grouped into three themes: 1) Ecology and Evolution, 2) Physiology, Cell and Molecular Biology, and 3) Natural Resource Management. The HSU URM program will offer students a variety of courses, seminars, workshops, presentations, and other activities that will provide them the foundation and structure to succeed.
