    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on enhancing combinatorial and timed release of drugs for the localized treatment of cancer. Currently there are few solutions for localized elimination of tumor cells following surgical removal of breast cancer (lumpectomy). There is a real unmet need for minimally invasive devices that locally deliver a cocktail of drugs in a sustained and safe fashion. We propose to develop an implantable polymer-based microfilm device for the release of Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine that is non-toxic, comfortable and cosmetically acceptable to the patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader Impacts of this research are:&lt;br/&gt;- Establishment of a multidisciplinary initiative that integrates expertise in biology, materials science/engineering and nanotechnology to address an unmet medical need.&lt;br/&gt;- Enhancements in breast cancer treatment, coupled with downstream opportunities to treat a broader array of other diseases that are expected to improve patient outcomes globally.&lt;br/&gt;- Economic value through new market creation, product development and clinical applications&lt;br/&gt;- Biotic Laboratories has a strong relationship with educational institutions (high schools and universities) in the LA and Chicago area and has engaged intern activity as part of its start-up activities. In general, new entrepreneurial companies such as Biotic serve as both economic growth engines and inspiration to a future generation of scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
