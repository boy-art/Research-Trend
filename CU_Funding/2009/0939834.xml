    <AbstractNarration>The PI has requested partial funding for a special issues of The Oceanography Society (TOS) Magazine, "Oceanography" - Mountains in the Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seamounts are a major frontier in ocean research with a diverse community of scientific, commercial, and societal stakeholders focusing on their exploration, study, and commercial use, and protection from overexploitation. Scientific interests in seamounts range from their use as windows to Earth?s mantle to the understanding of the ecology of biological hot spots. Profitable fisheries led to the need for protection and understanding of sustainable fisheries yields. This proposed volume is the first truly integrated look at seamounts, where leaders of the geophysics, geochemistry, microbiology, marine ecology, oceanography, and fisheries communities will present the current understanding of and pose new questions related to seamount science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanography Magazine is an excellent venue for such an interdisciplinary set of papers and it will be used by scientists to stay current and by educators as a resource. This issue is quite timely with respect to social issues including fisheries and MPAs.</AbstractNarration>
