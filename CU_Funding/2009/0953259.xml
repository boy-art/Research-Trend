    <AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Tristan Lambert of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University. Professor Lambert will be developing several new catalytic methods for cyclopropanation and for achieving novel oxidative carbonylations. The first cyclopropanation strategy concerns Lewis acid catalyzed methylene transfer from epoxides or related functionality, and the second concerns direct oxidative cyclopropanation of 1,3-dienes with activated methylene compounds. For carbonylations, novel oxidative carbonylation methods will be developed which provide access to reactive carbonyl functionalities, including acid chlorides and aldehydes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Lambert's research could lead to efficient methods for the preparation of complex organic molecules. These molecules are highly sought after in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In addition, these compounds are important in any area of activities in which organic chemicals are involved, such as the study of molecular biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Lambert will also be developing new laboratory experiments aimed at the high school level and designed to increase exposure to and excitement for organic chemistry. These simple yet visually dramatic laboratory experiments will be focused generally on the accessible and fascinating phenomenon of aromaticity and will be accompanied by explanatory literature prepared by Professor Lambert.</AbstractNarration>
