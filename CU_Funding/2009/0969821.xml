    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to integrate the three sequential stages that typically are required to get complex mechanical assemblies to function and assemble properly. The first of the three stages is the setting of limits on the geometric variations by design engineers. The second is conversion of these limits by manufacturing engineers to process plans, the step-by-step procedures used in a factory to accomplish the manufacture of a part or an assembly. The third is the conversion of measured points on the surface of a part during quality control inspection to a form that may be used for direct comparison with the limits set by the designer. The method is to extend the concepts of a newly developed mathematical model for design both to complex geometries and to the domains of manufacturing and inspection of mechanical parts. The new model represents the design limits as boundaries in multidimensional geometric space. The boundaries separate smaller variations, which are acceptable, from larger ones that are not. The new math model is unique because no other model represents all classes of limits used in the practice of design and manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The benefits from this award, if successfully carried out, will be a first mathematical model to integrate manufacturing variations in mechanical parts in a manner that will be consistent with the standards used in practice. Further, until now, all geometric manufacturing variations have been attributed to manufacturing processes, not to the geometry of the feature and the specified limits to the variations. The proposed use of the new mathematical model for design will enable a new way of thinking by separating variations that are purely geometric from those that come from characteristics of manufacturing processes and machines.</AbstractNarration>
