    <AbstractNarration>Fluctuation in water content is a universal problem confronting all animals, and environmental stresses that impact the amount of water present in the cells of animals pose a threat to life. Tolerance to water stress is most likely governed by several different mechanisms that are in place to protect cells and tissues during water loss, as well as to repair injuries after rehydration. However, scientific understanding of these mechanisms is incomplete. &lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate whether or not certain types of naturally-occurring proteins [Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins], when combined with small sugar-like compounds, are able to protect cellular components, isolated cells, and intact animals during water loss and subsequent recovery. These LEA proteins and sugars are predicted to preserve biological structures because they have been repeatedly found in species that possess extreme tolerance to water loss (anhydrobiotic animals). The mechanisms by which these proteins and sugars may stabilize the structure and function of cellular components (e.g., enzymes, membranes, mitochondria) will be investigated using biochemical, physiological and genetic approaches. The anticipated result is that cells and tissues that do not possess tolerance to desiccation stress will be protected by LEA proteins and sugars against damage normally incurred during water loss.&lt;br/&gt; Successful completion of this project has the potential to offer important practical applications. For example, storage of biological components and cells in the dried state will extend their shelf-life, which could represent enormous savings of time, effort and money for scientific researchers in both basic and applied fields. Investigators using model species like Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) for genetic studies would benefit immensely from the ability to store early developmental stages in a dried (dormant) state, thereby reducing the costs of maintaining genetic variants of this species. Finally, this project will provide exciting opportunities for the training and education of undergraduate and graduate students from a wide diversity of backgrounds in the fields of biochemistry, physiology and molecular genetics.</AbstractNarration>
