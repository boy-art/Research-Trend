    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this proposal involve research and education goals that will allow the integration of magneto-optical garnet in non-reciprocal devices to enable source-integrated photonic and optoelectronic integrated circuits (PICs/OEICs). Garnet is the obvious material for such devices, due to its figure-of-merit (rotation/loss) which is several orders of magnitude higher than any other magneto-optcical material, but the integration of garnet with semiconductor platforms has long been thought impossible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Using a recently developed process, garnet devices will be realized here on Si, InP and GaAs for use in the near infrared (1.3 and 1.55um) and infrared (~2um) wavelengths. The research will focus on doped garnet waveguide isolators, garnet photonic crystal (PC) circulators, semiconductor-core isolators (with garnet claddings for evanescent coupling), and quasi-phase matched rotators. These devices will be the first of their kind to be monolithically integrated, and they therefore promise to transform the field of photonics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning from graduate student training through K-12 outreach, including a focus on under-represented groups. In addition, this project truly enables the "missing link" in photonics such that the first generation light sources will be integrated with photonic integrated circuits and opto-electronic integrated circuits near the completion of this project.</AbstractNarration>
