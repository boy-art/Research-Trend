    <AbstractNarration>0968912 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University; Saied Taheri &lt;br/&gt;0968940 University of Akron; Celal Batur &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Tire Research and Test Center (Tire TeC) will focus on building a base of research, engineering education, and technology transfer that will impact industrial practice and productivity through advanced materials and intelligent tire technologies. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) and the University of Akron (UA) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with VT as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of this planning project are to initiate formal partnership with various industry partners and national laboratories that have an interest in tire technologies, and to discuss fundamental issues and topics for research. The proposed IUCRC will generate new scientific knowledge; develop novel smart-material-based tires, novel nanotechnology-based tire compounds, and intelligent tire technology; and advance their associated dynamic models and constitutive relationships by developing virtual and hardware-in-the-loop-based simulation environments. The various envisioned research thrusts will provide solutions to improve the industry's yield and contribute to its competitiveness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed Center has the potential to improve sustainability and profitability of US tire manufacturing industry by developing new technologies that will reduce energy consumption, pollution and increase driving safety. The Center will greatly enhance the infrastructure and lead to other opportunities to assist the tire manufacturers. The proposed center plans to provide students and faculty with a platform for conducting industry-relevant research, establish an effective mechanism for collaboration, and will help promote, catalyze, and accelerate the commercialization of innovative technologies. Finally, Tire TeC will recruit participants from groups traditionally under-represented in Mechanical Engineering, Polymer Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and other scientific disciplines and will promote this center through its ongoing working relationships with colleagues at Virginia Tech's Northern Virginia Campus and the Middle Eastern and Northern Africa (VT-MENA) campuses.</AbstractNarration>
