    <AbstractNarration>Multiplexed spectral imaging has led to many valuable discoveries in biological studies. To further improve our knowledge of biological systems and enhance our understanding of signaling pathways, more and more proteins and other molecules are being studied simultaneously. Such studies are complex, often requiring the spectral multiplexing of optical labels. Similarly, high-throughput and/or high-data rate measurements are also needed. &lt;br/&gt;Our objective is to develop metal nanoparticles for highly multiplexed imaging. The goals for this project are to synthesize nanoparticles, functionalize nanoparticles, and characterize and optimize the nanoparticle performance. Work toward meeting each of these goals will be performed in parallel because frequent iteration of methods involved for each goal will be required to reach the desired final result. The development effort can serve user communities involved in a range of biological studies, including cellular labeling, particle tracking studies, protein-protein interactions, and cellular protein dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;This work will have broad scientific impacts, as well as social and educational and training impacts. The one-year project will integrate research and education through the training of one postdoctoral fellow and one undergraduate summer student. Although the student will be supported by this grant, he or she will participate in the NSF-supported Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, which SRI's Molecular Physics Laboratory has conducted for the past 17 years. The transformative capabilities of the enhanced imaging method will lead to greater understanding of biology, cell biology and disease processes.</AbstractNarration>
