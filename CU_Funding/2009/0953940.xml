    <AbstractNarration>This research integrates the theoretical perspectives of personality trait psychologists and cultural psychologists to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between culture and personality, as well as the impact of personality on behavior and mental health in different cultures. Cross-cultural research on personality processes can identify cultural universals and differences, and clarify the role of socio-cultural factors in personality, behavior, and psychological well-being. In six studies, across nine countries including the United States, Australia, Norway, Mexico, Venezuela, Philippines, Malaysia, China, and Japan, the investigators will address fundamental questions regarding personality and mental health across cultures, including the following: Do personality traits predict important behaviors and mental health equally well in different cultures? Do people in different cultures vary in the consistency or stability of their personality characteristics across different situational contexts? Is such consistency more important for mental health in some cultures than others? Are there universal psychological needs that account for personality consistency and well-being in all cultures? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the significance of the research for scientific theory derives in part, from the importance of integrating the personality trait and cultural psychology perspectives, the broader impacts of this work are notable. Indeed, the involvement of collaborators from countries that are underrepresented in the scientific literature will contribute to a broadening of the data base of scientific psychology, and this will ultimately have important implications for mental health interventions and treatment outcomes in each of the societies.</AbstractNarration>
