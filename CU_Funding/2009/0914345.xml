    <AbstractNarration>New proof techniques and new optimal algorithms and complexity&lt;br/&gt;results will be obtained under the grant. Many important scientific and&lt;br/&gt;engineering problems have continuous mathematical formulations. Since&lt;br/&gt;digital computers can only deal with numbers, continuous problem have to&lt;br/&gt;be discretized for input into the computer. Hence the information about&lt;br/&gt;the continuous mathematical problem is partial and contaminated and only&lt;br/&gt;an E-approximation can be obtained. Because the information about the&lt;br/&gt;continuous problem is partial and contaminated&lt;br/&gt;one can use adversary arguments pioneered by the investigators and their&lt;br/&gt;colleagues to obtain computational complexity and optimal algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;important problems. This may be contrasted with discrete problems such as&lt;br/&gt;integer factorization, where one has to settle for conjectures about the&lt;br/&gt;complexity hierarchy. A central issue is to determine for which settings&lt;br/&gt;and spaces a problem is tractable; that is, its complexity is not&lt;br/&gt;exponential. There is a huge literature on the computational complexity of&lt;br/&gt;d-dimensional problems. Most of these papers and books obtain results&lt;br/&gt;which are sharp with respect to 1/E but have, unfortunately, unknown&lt;br/&gt;dependence on d. But to determine if a problem is tractable, we need to&lt;br/&gt;know the dependence on both 1/E and d. This requires new proof techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many important scientific and engineering problems involve a large&lt;br/&gt;number of variables. Equivalently they are said to be high dimensional.&lt;br/&gt;Examples of such problems occur in quantum mechanics, molecular biology,&lt;br/&gt;and economics. For example, the Schrodinger equation for p particles has&lt;br/&gt;dimension d = 3p; systems with a large number of particles are of great&lt;br/&gt;interest in physics and chemistry. This problem can only be solved&lt;br/&gt;numerically. In decades of work scientists have found that the problems&lt;br/&gt;get increasingly hard as p increases. The investigators believe this does&lt;br/&gt;not stem from a failure to create good numerical methods--the difficulty&lt;br/&gt;is intrinsic. The investigators believe solving the Schrodinger equation&lt;br/&gt;suffers the curse of dimensionality on a classical computer. That is, the&lt;br/&gt;time to solve this problem must grow exponentially with p. (A classical&lt;br/&gt;computer is any machine not based on the principles of quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics--all machines in use today are classical computers.) The&lt;br/&gt;investigators hope to show this problem is tractable on a quantum&lt;br/&gt;computer. Success in this research would mark the first instance of a&lt;br/&gt;PROVEN exponential quantum speedup for an important non-artificial&lt;br/&gt;problem.</AbstractNarration>
