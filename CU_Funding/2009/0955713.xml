    <AbstractNarration>Humans are altering the global cycling of carbon (C) on Earth. The addition of billions of tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is changing its heat-trapping capacity, which in turn is changing the Earth's climate. Large amounts of carbon are stored within the soils of terrestrial ecosystems. Recently, attention has been drawn to the thawing of permafrost (permanently frozen ground) as a mechanism that could move significant quantities of stored C from land to atmosphere in response to a changing climate. Because of the size and nature of the permafrost C pool, decomposition of previously frozen, old organic carbon is one of the most likely positive feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to climate change in a warmer world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While ground temperature increases in permafrost regions are well documented with data from permafrost borehole networks, as well as from surface temperature observations, there is a knowledge gap surrounding the response of permafrost carbon to climate change. This Vulnerability of Permafrost Carbon research coordination network (RCN) project will bring together biological and physical carbon cycle researchers. Through a series of meetings, working groups will be established that will address key questions about carbon cycling and vulnerability in permafrost regions and synthesize data and literature. An interactive website will be developed for non-scientists and the media that will synthesize the state of knowledge about permafrost. This RCN will strengthen the interconnection between biological and physical scientists, between early and later career-stage scientists, and will produce new knowledge through synthesis that can be used to quantify the role of permafrost carbon in affecting climate change in the 21st century and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
