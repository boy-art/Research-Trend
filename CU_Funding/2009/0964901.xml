    <AbstractNarration>David Raymond Weaver &lt;br/&gt;IOS-0964901&lt;br/&gt;2010 Pineal Cell Biology Gordon Research Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The 11th Gordon Research Conference on Pineal Cell Biology: Mechanisms of Circadian Rhythmicity and Melatonin Action (Pineal GRC) will occur on February 7-12, 2010, in Galveston, Texas. The Pineal GRC will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of new developments and ideas in this exciting, interdisciplinary field, including aspects of melatonin and circadian rhythmicity from the diverse viewpoints of expertise in retinal phototransduction, chronobiology, brain development, neuronal signaling, genomics, metabolism, and cancer. The major objective of this meeting is to promote interaction among a diverse group of scientists in the cloistered Gordon Conference format, leading to information exchange, new experimental strategies, new hypotheses, and ideas for future projects and collaborations. Stimulating and intense discussion will lead to insights into general principles, and will identify key areas for future research into the impact of melatonin and circadian rhythms on physiological functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special efforts have being made to encourage the participation of women, underrepresented scientists, and those at early stages of their careers. A significant number of the attendees will be doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, and interactions at the meeting will foster professional growth and career development, enhance networking and promote diversity in the field of pineal cell biology. The Conference will thus contribute positively to the professional development of women, underrepresented groups, and scientists early in their careers.</AbstractNarration>
