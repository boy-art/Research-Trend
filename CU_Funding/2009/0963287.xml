    <AbstractNarration>This award supports travel expenses for U.S. participants in the international workshop "Analysis on Graphs and its Applications Follow-up Meeting," to be held at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge, UK, on 26-30 July 2010. This workshop is the planned follow-up meeting for the semester-long international program "Analysis on Graphs and its Applications" held in the same venue in 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substantial recent progress in spectral theory of combinatorial graphs, quantum graphs, and analysis on fractals makes a follow-on conference highly desirable. This meeting will assemble a diverse group of experts, young researchers, and students working in the quickly-developing interdisciplinary field of applications of analysis on graphs to mathematical physics, nanotechnology, microelectronics, chemistry, materials science, photonics, number theory, discrete groups, and fractals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://www.newton.ac.uk/programmes/AGA/agaw06.html</AbstractNarration>
