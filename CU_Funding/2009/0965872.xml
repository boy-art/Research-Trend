    <AbstractNarration>S-STEM scholarships are being awarded to a cohort of 24 full-time students in biotechnology or environmental science associate degree programs. Students are recruited from high schools, nonprofit organizations, and the college's student population; selected based on financial need and academic talent, and; assisted by support infrastructures including a learning community, ongoing monitoring, added counseling, problem-based learning projects, industry contact, and internships (an existing degree component). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives &lt;br/&gt;1. Enhance and increase student support services via curricular and extracurricular activities; &lt;br/&gt;2. Improve academic support through Problem Based Learning (PBL) and Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL); &lt;br/&gt;3. Increase the number of educated and skilled employees in biotechnology and environmental science; &lt;br/&gt;4. Provide an internship in local industry and academic and governmental labs; &lt;br/&gt;5. Provide assistance with job placement or career advancement; &lt;br/&gt;6. Increase student networking through a learning community between the two degree programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;Academic Models: &lt;br/&gt;In Problem Based Learning (PBL), students work in small groups to solve a structured curriculum-related problem. Students systematically define what information is needed and what resources are available to solve a problem. As proficiency increases, PBL activities become more complex to reflect realistic situations with few clues. &lt;br/&gt;In Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL), a learning model where students work in teams to solve structured problems under a trained peer leader, large numbers of students are engaged through both course material and interaction among study groups. Evaluation of a 10-year study in 12 institutions shows that the PLTL approach improved performance and retention, communication, course satisfaction, and interest in pursuing further study in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;Communication across two related disciplines, biotechnology and environmental science, and the implementation of PBL activities, can serve as a general model for supporting engagement and success in other academic and workforce preparation fields. Also, by eliminating economic barriers for financially needy, talented students, diversity in the sciences is improved.</AbstractNarration>
