    <AbstractNarration>Project Synergy is being accomplished with the context of Biology 1103, the quintessential introductory biology course for non-science majors at the University of Georgia and one that typifies general education introductory courses taken by undergraduates throughout the nation. The project addresses two parallel and interconnected objectives: (1) to advance the functional science literacy skills of non-science majors using technology-enhanced communication in even the largest undergraduate general education courses, and (2) to involve graduate students in a long-term "scaffolded" apprenticeship program that aims to create and implement these strategies. This research builds upon and extends prior work related to learner-centered instruction, especially in large-enrollment courses. The project is creating active learning modules about current relevant issues in the biological sciences. Examples of communication strategies developed for the course include collaborative problem-solving exercises that mirror real life applications, followed by opportunities for students to further investigate and communicate their understanding using current technologies such as wiki pages and digital storytelling. Several instruments are being used to measure changes in students' functional science literacy, confidence in scientific abilities, and desire to continue learning about biology after course completion. In the scaffolding process, novice graduate student instructors assume increasingly independent roles in creating, implementing, and training their peers in the development of teaching strategies. Evaluation of the graduate apprenticeship program includes quantitative instruments and qualitative interviews to document shifts in attitudes toward teaching, competency and likelihood of adopting these teaching practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is advancing functional science literacy for more than one-third of the University of Georgia college graduates. This is the only college science learning experience for most of the University's undergraduates and is representative of the educational experience nationwide. The project is also creating a self-sustaining process in which future faculty will be trained to mentor the next generation of instructors. The novel instructional practices and apprenticeship program are generalizable across STEM disciplines. Both the materials and strategies are being disseminated at multiple scales, in partnership with graduate student participants: locally, across STEM disciplines at the University of Georgia; regionally, through workshops for instructors at other institutions in the University System of Georgia; and nationally, through workshops at science and education conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific project goals for undergraduate are to (a) identify and cultivate an interest in current scientific issues centered in biology, (b) apply science process skills (e.g. generate questions, identify variables and assumptions, collect and describe data, explain consequences and limits of results) to make decisions about relevant scientific issues, and (c) communicate their understanding through writing, discussion, and new media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific project goals for graduate students are to (a) learn to create and implement new instructional practices for large-enrollment courses, (b) measure the effectiveness of their changed teaching practices using evidence-based assessment methods, and (c) peer-mentor novice graduate students in active learning practices and the scientific teaching process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being co-funded by funds from the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Emerging Frontiers Division.</AbstractNarration>
