    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Helminck, Aloysius G.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0913405 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: North Carolina State University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Conference on: Quantum Groups, Algebraic Groups and Related Topics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum groups have become a comprehensive and mainstream research area in mathematics with numerous applications in mathematics and theoretical physics. It involves research from a broad range of fields, including many types of algebras, like vertex algebras, Kac-Moody Lie algebras, Hecke algebras, etc. Much of the theory of quantum groups is based on results developed for algebraic groups and Lie groups and the interface of these areas continues to provide a base of new research opportunities. The scope of the areas of quantum and algebraic groups is very broad and expertise in the various aspects has been developed all over the world. In order for the subject to continue to develop and flourish it is important that there are periodic international conferences bringing together specialists from all over the world together with young mathematicians and graduate students seeking to specialize in these rich areas. This will create opportunities for exchange of ideas and to expose new frontiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the travel expenses of a group of research mathematicians and graduate students from USA universities to join researchers from Asia, Australia and Europe in a timely international conference on "Quantum groups, Algebraic groups and related topics" at the Peking University, Beijing, China during July 18-23, 2009. Some of the participants will also attend a second related conference hosted at the Chern Institute of Mathematics, Nankai University, Tianjin during July 23-27, 2009 on "Quantum algebras and Physics.'' There are more than half dozen major mathematical departments and research centers in the region such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Institute of Mathematics, etc. A large number of graduate students from local universities and research centers will attend this conference. The senior invited international experts will outline the future directions of research in quantum groups and algebraic groups. The informal sessions will provide ample opportunity for junior researchers and graduate students to interact with other experts in the field. This conference will bring unprecedented opportunities for graduate students and young researchers to gain insights on the important area of quantum groups and algebraic groups. In particular, the USA graduate students will gain international working experience. It will also help strengthen the ongoing collaboration between USA and Chinese mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>
