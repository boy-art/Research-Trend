    <AbstractNarration>People rely on two types of trust when making everyday decisions:&lt;br/&gt;vertical and horizontal trust. Vertical trust captures trust&lt;br/&gt;relationships between individuals and institutions, while horizontal&lt;br/&gt;trust represents the trust inferred from the observations and opinions&lt;br/&gt;of other peers. Although significant benefit could be realized by&lt;br/&gt;combining horizontal and vertical trust mechanisms, they have evolved&lt;br/&gt;independently in computing systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing a composable trust model capable of&lt;br/&gt;tightly coupling vertical and horizontal trust in a manner that is&lt;br/&gt;both amenable to formal analysis and efficiently deployable. This&lt;br/&gt;research advances the state of the art in trust management through a&lt;br/&gt;series of innovative results, including the design of a unified&lt;br/&gt;framework for specifying composite trust policies and the design and&lt;br/&gt;analysis of efficient algorithms for policy evaluation. The composite&lt;br/&gt;trust management approach championed by this project also enables&lt;br/&gt;policy authors to move beyond simple proof of compliance to identify&lt;br/&gt;the "top-k" preferred users satisfying security policies including&lt;br/&gt;subjective assessments. The beneficiaries of this research range from&lt;br/&gt;administrators of traditional computing systems who can better&lt;br/&gt;incorporate previous history into their decision-making processes, to&lt;br/&gt;users in social networks who can more carefully manage the exposure of&lt;br/&gt;their personal data.</AbstractNarration>
