    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will address the motion between East and West Antarctica. The estimates of motion in the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic come from summing the plate circuit linking East Antarctica to Australia to the Lord Howe Rise to the Pacific plate to West Antarctica. However, major uncertainties remain in the history of the plate motions in this region, leading to widely different implications for the global plate circuit, without a clear indication of which model is correct. The PIs propose to analyze this motion in two parts: motion since 42 Ma and motion before 42 Ma. For the younger time interval, the PIs will improve accuracy of rotations by taking advantage of an unusual plate geometry that enables them to solve a five-boundary, four-plate configuration. For the older time interval, the only way to calculate motion between East and West Antarctica is via the long Aus-Pac plate circuit. The difficulty in this time interval is that there are three sets of rotations with distinctly different results for the Aus-East Ant boundary. The disagreement over the fundamental motion between Aus and Ant before 50 Ma leads to large differences in the predicted motion in the Western Ross Sea and near Ellsworth Land. The PIs propose to re-examine the key elements in the Aus-Pac plate circuit with the objective of reducing uncertainties, using quantitative methods where possible, and resolving some of the critical issues involving alternative interpretations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The scientific impacts of this work are an improved understanding of Antarctic plate tectonic history to incorporate into global models. This project will support one graduate student at each institution. The results of the project will be made available in the global plate motion and plate reconstruction databases. In addition, results will be used for outreach work to middle school groups. Cande has made an animated movie of the plate motions around the Aus-Pac plate circuit that he uses as part of his undergraduate and graduate teaching. He plans to update and expand this animation using the results of this project.</AbstractNarration>
