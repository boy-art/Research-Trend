    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks support for US researchers participation in a workshop/conference to be held in association with the Third International Conference on Remote Sensing Archaeology (http://www.spacetimeplace2009.org). The proposed symposium aims to take stock of the emerging trends in Remote Sensing and also explore promising new research pathways as related to multi-diciplinary interaction in emerging topical areas made possible by large scale geospacial and temporal data stores. The agenda is being designed by the The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI) (www.ecai.org), a research unit of International and Area Studies at the University of California, Berkeley . In the last twelve years, ECAI and other scholarly groups have pursued the capabilities in remote sensing and digital application in archaeology. Concepts like space, place, landscape, time and "context" plus technological inputs in mapping and management of heritage are becoming conceptual frameworks in recent trends in the field of archaeology and related areas. The study is inherently international in scope and such conferences as this are integral in moving scholarship forward.</AbstractNarration>
