    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0906280&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Krzysztof Wysocki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general terms, the goal of the project is to study analytical&lt;br/&gt;aspects of symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems. The overall aim of the project is the development of a&lt;br/&gt;general framework for studying nonlinear elliptic equations&lt;br/&gt;appearing in symplectic geometry. Many of the problems in&lt;br/&gt;symplectic geometry, like the Gromov-Witten theory and the&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic Field Theory, are based on the study of the moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces of the first order nonlinear elliptic equations. These&lt;br/&gt;muduli spaces exhibit lack of compactness, however, they have&lt;br/&gt;nontrivial compactification. In the project, Wysocki jointly&lt;br/&gt;with Hofer and Zehnder continues the development of a new general&lt;br/&gt;Fredholm theory, which takes place in new smooth spaces called&lt;br/&gt;polyfolds. This general Fredholm theory has all the properties of&lt;br/&gt;the classical Fredholm theory, but is more flexible and&lt;br/&gt;applicable to problems with lack of compactness. In the project,&lt;br/&gt;the general Fredholm theory on polyfolds is applied to the&lt;br/&gt;Gromow-Witten theory and to the Symplectic Field Theory. In&lt;br/&gt;another part of the proposal, we use the theory of&lt;br/&gt;pseudholomorphic curves and the theory of generating functions to&lt;br/&gt;study multiplicity of closed characteristics on weakly&lt;br/&gt;dynamically convex energy surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic geometry has its origin in classical mechanics. For&lt;br/&gt;example, the motion of the planetary system can be described by a&lt;br/&gt;system of nonlinear differential equations called Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;systems. The flow lines of Hamiltonian systems follow very&lt;br/&gt;complex patterns. Hence it is of importance to get better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of Hamiltonian flows on its energy surfaces. The&lt;br/&gt;development of the general Fredholm theory on polyfolds will put&lt;br/&gt;the Symplectic Field Theory on solid analytical foundations. The&lt;br/&gt;methods developed in this project should have applications to&lt;br/&gt;larger classes of nonlinear partial differential equations of&lt;br/&gt;relevance in differential geometry and physics.</AbstractNarration>
