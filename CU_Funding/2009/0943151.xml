    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: UNDERSTANDING WORK-LIFE&lt;br/&gt;BALANCE ISSUES OF THE GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED&lt;br/&gt;SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Washington State University&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 08/02/09&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5). In recent years, the use of geographically (and often globally)&lt;br/&gt;distributed teams to accomplish organizational tasks has become ubiquitous. One arena&lt;br/&gt;where the use of such teams is popular is in Information Systems Development.&lt;br/&gt;Interestingly, while the motivation for globally distributed systems development is often&lt;br/&gt;to harness appropriate human capital, scant attention has been paid toward addressing&lt;br/&gt;the human resource issues faced by the IT professionals involved in this context. One&lt;br/&gt;particularly challenging human resource issue is that of work-life balance of the IT&lt;br/&gt;professionals involved in globally distributed systems development, who routinely&lt;br/&gt;experience overlaps and conflicts between their work and personal life domains. In spite&lt;br/&gt;of these recognized challenges, we know of no empirical examinations and very few&lt;br/&gt;theoretical perspectives informing us about work-life balance issues in this context. Our&lt;br/&gt;research program attempts to fill this gap.&lt;br/&gt;Integrating three theoretical perspectives (Border Theory, Social Exchange Theory, and&lt;br/&gt;Dialectical Theory), this research seeks to develop a theoretical model for work-life&lt;br/&gt;balance in globally distributed systems development settings, and provides a more&lt;br/&gt;complete, credible, and theoretically-informed picture of the work-life balance&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon as it relates to this context. We utilize a multi-stage multi-method empirical&lt;br/&gt;approach involving exploratory interviews and pilot survey, followed by a full-scale&lt;br/&gt;survey, and finally in-depth interviews of globally distributed systems development&lt;br/&gt;workers within a cross-cultural context.&lt;br/&gt;The research will help demonstrate that workers in distributed/virtual settings face&lt;br/&gt;unique challenges. The study will help understand the specific nature of these&lt;br/&gt;challenges, both in terms of factors and processes, and also facilitate the development&lt;br/&gt;of best practices and programs that organizations can implement beyond the popular&lt;br/&gt;family-friendly policies and flexible work arrangements, to help employees manage their&lt;br/&gt;work and personal lives. The results will also enable us to understand the effect of&lt;br/&gt;work-life balance (or the lack thereof) on worker turnover and organizational&lt;br/&gt;commitment, among others, and thereby lead us to discover ways to ensure a steady&lt;br/&gt;supply of globally distributed systems development -capable professionals, such that&lt;br/&gt;the distributed/virtual form of work in IT and related areas can be sustained over a&lt;br/&gt;longer period of time. Finally, through the cross-cultural analysis, we hope to uncover&lt;br/&gt;the cultural nuances associated with work-life balance -related issues, and allow us to&lt;br/&gt;learn from the best practices in diverse locations. We believe that the knowledge gained&lt;br/&gt;from this research will be of interest to the scholarly communities in several disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;including information systems, computer supported cooperative work, human resource&lt;br/&gt;management, and international business.</AbstractNarration>
