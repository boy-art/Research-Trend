    <AbstractNarration>Several phospholipids, particularly inositol-containing phospholipids, have been implicated in many complex signaling processes, which play a role in controlling cell growth and proliferation in higher eukaryotes. The mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells control the synthesis of membrane lipids in coordination with ongoing membrane biogenesis are not yet fully understood. The first step in understanding these complex phenomena is to examine the regulation of phospholipid gene expression. In order to understand this regulation, the precise details of the chromatin structure and relevant factors involved in the transcriptional activation process must be unraveled. Yeast cells synthesize a typical eukaryotic mixture of phospholipids, using pathways which are similar to those in higher eukaryotes. The goal of this research is to use the genetic and biochemical tools available for Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the mechanism of INO1 expression. INO1 encodes inositol-1-phosphate synthase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of inositol. INO1 expression is required for the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylinositol, which has been implicated in complex signaling processes, such as mRNA export, vesicular trafficking, and cell growth and proliferation. This project addresses questions pertaining to the possible roles of the transcriptional activator, Ino2p, during INO1 activation. These experiments will examine how chromatin remodelers and histone modifying enzymes are recruited to the INO1 promoter, and identify the functional residue(s) in Ino2p, which is/are responsible for recruiting remodelers and/or histone modifying enzymes. Therefore, this research will provide new insight into the mechanism of gene regulation and the signal transduction pathway of phospholipids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project will provide an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students to be actively engaged in cutting-edge research. Students will be trained to perform experiments, leading to new discoveries related to gene expression. During the course of study, undergraduate researchers will gain experience in biochemical and genetic techniques, creative problem solving, and working together as a team. The ability to integrate the knowledge they have acquired in the classroom with hands-on, exciting scientific research will provide an invaluable experience for undergraduate students. Furthermore, laboratory research experience can provide students with the opportunity to develop and acquire rigorous scientific methodologies. Thus, these students will be equipped with both fundamental and comprehensive knowledge that they may then apply in solving other biological questions.</AbstractNarration>
