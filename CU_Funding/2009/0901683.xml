    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to evaluate the velocity-electric field characteristics of single crystal based and polycrystalline organic transistors. The approach is to use both DC and transient measurements to measure the velocities at electric fields up to 106 V/cm. DC measurements involve the extraction of velocities from the output characteristics of a set of small-channel length devices. Transient measurements involve the measurement of channel formation time and the extraction of velocity information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Knowledge of the charge carrier velocity-electric field relationship is important in understanding charge transport mechanisms in organic transistors. Such measurements are not routinely done by research groups due to the requirement of specialized instrumentation, device structures, and measurement methods. The proposed work will address this need and fill this gap. Additionally, the proposed research will enable the characterization of trapping phenomena and its effects on the turn-on and turn-off characteristics of transistors. This will be useful in designing circuits and systems such as displays based on organic transistors. Trapping phenomena are especially important in thin-film transistors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.: This work will lead to the continued development of coursework in organic electronics as well as the production of trained human resources for industry/academia including Ph.Ds. Minority and women students will be given research opportunities leading to enhanced diversity in the workforce. Interactions with US-based industries will lead to knowledge transfer of information generated from this work and collaborative work. Outreach to area schools will promote interest in science and engineering among such students.</AbstractNarration>
