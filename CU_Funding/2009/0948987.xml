    <AbstractNarration>0948987&lt;br/&gt;Thomas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and an IR microscope for measuring volatiles in natural materials and in materials synthesized in known temperature and pressure regimes. The proposed acquisition will allow analyzing trace amounts of water in synthesized minerals and glasses created under controlled pressure and temperature conditions. Experimental systems will allow the investigators to vary pressure, temperature and chemical composition in order to assess water solubility in minerals and glasses. The FTIR system will allow direct water measurement in normally anhydrous components and will be be used to constrain mechanisms and refine models for natural materials. The measurements are fundamental to understanding effects on physical properties occurring when even small amounts of water become incorporated during mineral formation. Crystallographic siting and specific absorbing component spatial orientation within the crystal lattice will be assessed using the new FTIR system. Other analytical techniques (linear particle accelerator with H+ profiling, a Raman microprobe, and supercomputing facility) will help validate water concentrations and characterize mineral distribution. Measurements and modeling obtained in controlled experiments will ultimately be used to interpret and quantify FTIR spectra from natural materials. The instrument will be used to model processes which are difficult to understand without laboratory simulations (fluid flow, mantle convection, water-assisted deformation, melting, plutonism, volcanism, and ore deposition). The PIs have supported research projects for eight undergraduates over the past two years. Students present research at meetings and in research papers. Two graduate students will be directly supported in their research with this acquisition. The PI will assume overall responsibility for daily operation, maintenance, user scheduling, and training. Ample space is already available in recently-renovated laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
