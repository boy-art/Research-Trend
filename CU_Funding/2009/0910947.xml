    <AbstractNarration>The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Amit Basu of Brown University who outlines an approach for studying carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions (CCI) that occur between cell surface glycolipids found in the myelin sheath, a multi-layer of membranes found in the nervous system. During the proposed funding period, Professor Basu's group will, 1) Continue to study CCI using both established model systems as well as those developed in their labs; 2) Develop a quantitative analysis of CCI; and 3) Investigate the use of glycoconjugates to bind to and perturb the function of glycosignaling domains in oligodendrocytes. This will be accomplished by preparing propargyl glycosides of galactose and its analogs, and linking these sugars to dendrimers, silica nanoparticles, and polymers. The interaction of these glycoconjugates with immobilized glycoconjugates will be examined using surface plasmon resonance measurements. Finally, the interaction of the glycoconjugates with oligodendrocytes, and their effect on cell surface architecture and signal transduction will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research by Professor Basu will develop a clearer picture of cell adhesion, which is a fundamental biological phenomenon involved in various scientific fields with significant societal impact such as embryonic development, infectious disease, cancer, and bioterrorism. Students involved with these projects will be trained to conduct interdisciplinary research. This research impacts a broad number of fields such as, organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials, neuroscience, and membrane biology. Professor Basu is involved with the Leadership Alliance, a consortium of 33 institutions that provide summer research internships to develop underrepresented students into outstanding leaders and role models in academia, business and the public sector. Professor Basu is an advocate at the institutional level for promoting and developing curricular reform and innovation, having served on a University Science and Education committee tasked with evaluating and improving science education at Brown and the Task Force on Undergraduate Education, which examined the entire liberal arts curriculum on campus. He is currently a member of the Science Center Advisory Board and was appointed as a Faculty Advising Fellow (FAF) in Fall 2008. The latter is a three year appointment to a position that seeks to strengthen the faculty-student advising relationship. As a FAF, Professor Basu has initiated a program to discuss research opportunities and bring scientific seminars to students in an informal residential setting. He is actively engaged in outreach, and is scheduled to visit both a local kindergarten and elementary school this winter to lead hands-on activities in science.</AbstractNarration>
