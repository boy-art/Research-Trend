    <AbstractNarration>The work will facilitate the synthesis and integration of research carried out under MARGINS source-to-sink initiative through an inclusive international conference and the creation of a digital text and educational resources. Knowledge gained in a wet tropical setting (New Guinea and the Gulf of Papua) will be contrasted with that completed in a temperate setting (New Zealand and its adjacent continental margin) in order to resolve fundamental differences in the operation of processes that transfer mass (particulate and dissolved) across the Earth surface. The general goal of the meeting is to articulate the ideas that are the foundation for a holistic understanding of sediment dispersal from land origins to marine accumulation, and to explore the theoretical and observational studies that support them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A synthesis of the S2S science in itself would be an important resource for the broader Earth science community. Other broader impacts include participation of graduate students and young investigators in the conference, production of digital text for advanced college courses and mini lessons for introductory courses, and inclusion of applied scientists, geoscience educators and others who study the stratigraphic record.</AbstractNarration>
