    <AbstractNarration>0923115&lt;br/&gt;Bommisetty&lt;br/&gt;South Dakota State U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary: Fundamental understanding of relationship between nanoscale structure and optoelectronic properties of photovoltaic materials is important to improve the efficiency of solar cells. Several experimental tools can measure the nanoscale topography and optoelectronic properties independently. The proposed effort aims to develop a scanning probe microscopy tool that can measure both topographical and optoelectronic properties simultaneously, thereby providing critical information needed to connect these two quantities. The proposed tool measures the topography, surface potential, surface photovoltage (SPV) and SPV spectroscopy with nanometer spatial resolution. These measurements help estimating the minority carrier diffusion length and carrier life time with high spatial resolution in nanostructured photovoltaic materials that is critical to understand charge transport processes in Gen-2 and Gen-3 solar cells. This tool will strengthen the proposing group?s collaboration with industrial partners, whose needs are focused on improvement in solar cells, thereby facilitating regional economic growth. The proposed tool will provide strong interdisciplinary training to several graduate and undergraduate students from SDSU and other research universities in the state, providing highly skilled manpower in the region. The proposed collaborative effort with the SPM division of Agilent Inc has strong potential to develop into a commercial product that will have much broader benefits to the research community. Proposed effort will also strengthen the PI?s support for attracting under-represented groups (Native Americans and women) into higher education, specifically in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: Development of low cost solar cells technologies that can efficiently convert sun light into energy is important for national energy independence and environmental protection. Current solar cells are based on high quality crystalline silicon and are expensive. Significant reduction in the cost of solar energy conversion can be achieved by developing new technologies that can efficiently convert the sunlight into energy. Development of low cost photovoltaic technologies, such as organic solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells, thin film solar cells, require significant improvement in the fundamental understanding of nanoscale optoelectronic properties and associated charge transport processes. Proposed scanning probe microscope tool measures topography and optoelectronic properties with nanoscale resolution. This data will help several research groups within the state of South Dakota to develop novel solar cells. Proposed tool will help accelerating the development of new photovoltaic materials and strengthens the PhD program in electrical engineering at SDSU and introduces a new multidisciplinary course. Proposed effort includes several outreach programs to broaden the participation of Native Americans and women in higher education at SDSU.</AbstractNarration>
