    <AbstractNarration>The long-term objective of this project is development of a recruitment and retention program designed to attract and graduate engineering and computer science leaders (Leadership Scholars) who have been traditionally underrepresented. Strategies to achieve this objective include strengthening the pipelines with engineering academies and community colleges, as well as retention strategies focused on leadership and academic excellence. These recruitment and retention strategies are being developed, tested, and refined as part of a college program designed to advance leadership in engineering and computer science. Specific objectives for the Class of 2015 engineering and computer science graduates are:&lt;br/&gt;1. At least 30% of the students who graduate belong to underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;2. A minimum four year retention rate of 70% is attained for underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;3. The Leadership Scholars belong to the top half of their respective graduating classes.&lt;br/&gt;4. The necessary recruitment and retention strategies to sustain these goals are in place by the project completion date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underrepresented students in computer science and engineering at the college belong to one or more of the following three categories: non-European ethnic groups, first-generation college students, and women. The college is recruiting a cohort of approximately 13 first-year students and 6 community college students. These Leadership Scholars receive tiered, need-based scholarships that increase after they declare their majors. Upon matriculation, the Scholars participate in a three-semester Leadership in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) co-curricular program designed to strengthen the cohort, and to expose them to the distinctive opportunities available at a liberal arts college The Leadership Scholars have opportunities to participate in voluntary paid summer research or internship experiences during their first two years at the college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is modeled after the successful Meyerhoff Scholars Program, however, it is adapted to emphasize the particular benefits of STEM education within a liberal arts context. Studies regarding science education at liberal arts colleges conclude that they are very successful in developing STEM leaders since they offer extraordinary benefits that support many of the goals outlined in strategic plan of NSF including the need for alternative and diverse approaches to excellence in education, cross-fertilization between disciplines, and discovery-based learning &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project supports the recent strategic plan at the college that embraces a vision to graduate diverse engineering and computer science leaders by broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. By disseminating the project results, the program advances the understanding of strategies that are successful in recruiting and retaining diverse STEM leaders.</AbstractNarration>
