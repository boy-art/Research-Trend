    <AbstractNarration>This Materials World Network (MWN) award supports a joint research project between Cornell University and Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg to use quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to answer the longstanding question of the size of the difference of the Kohn-Sham band gap and the true fundamental band gap of a semiconductors and insulators. This difference is the so called derivative discontinuity -- the discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy at integer electron numbers. This is a question that is not only of great fundamental importance in density functional theory (DFT) but also of great practical significance for band-gap engineering of materials. For example, accurate predictions of the bandgaps of inorganic semiconductors and of inexpensive organic semiconductors is important for designing photovoltaic cells. Another goal of this proposal is to determine nearly exact exchange-correlation potentials for a number of materials that would constitute a reference in the development of new density functionals. Such a reference, so far, is missing for periodic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves training US and the German graduate students and visits by the students and faculty to their partner institutions as well as exchanges at international conferences. Both the US and the German graduate students will receive a thorough grounding in state of the art QMC and DFT methods. The German graduate student will be a member of the newly founded Graduate School for Molecular Science at the University Erlangen-Nuremberg and the US graduate student will have the opportunity to attend summer and winter schools offered there. There will also be exchanges with faculty and graduate students at the University of Paris. The computed nearly exact DFT quantities will be dissminated widely via the web.</AbstractNarration>
