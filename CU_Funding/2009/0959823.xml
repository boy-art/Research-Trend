    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the development of two versatile, modular fluorescence microscopy platforms for tracking and mechanically probing single molecules/particles at the University of Michigan (UM), and the installation of a third, user-friendly microscope system for user training and project development. The development and application of two open-access single molecule tracking and probing microscopes transforms the limited capability for high-content screening of biological samples. Benchmarks are set that make both instruments operational within two years and lay out plans for testing, further optimization and expansion over an additional two years, after which recharges will maintain them. The instruments are being utilized for research and education by the University of Michigan community and beyond, engaging physical and biological scientists as well as an engineer. This development activity helps establish a unique, nation-wide, educational Center of Single Molecule Analysis (CoSiMA) in a highly cross-disciplinary, emerging field of transformative power in the biosciences. CoSiMA is engaging in vigorous outreach efforts to experimentalists, theorists, undergraduates, and high school students with large, local, underrepresented groups, as well as the public at large, in close collaboration with UM's existing IDEA Institute. These efforts are facilitated by the creation of a central laboratory facility with access to multiple single molecule microscopes under guidance of a Steering Committee and a senior staff scientist, as well as by the broad inspirational appeal of the emerging single molecule biosciences. Results from the studies enabled by the new equipment are disseminated by student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings, and through publication in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
