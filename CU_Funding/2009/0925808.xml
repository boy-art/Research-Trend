    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of the research program are to transform technologies that send, receive and manipulate electromagnetic microwave (EM) signals by realizing substantial reduction in device size, weight, and cost while concomitantly enhancing performance and functionality. The approach entails: i) develop and implement new numerical and simulation methodologies that address the EM interaction with anisotropic ferrite materials, ii) optimize processing of low-loss ferrite materials, and iii) develop microstrip prototypes having integrated active tuning via low power, voltage- and current-driven transducers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research eliminates the disadvantages of ferrite-based microwave devices, namely large volume, slow response time and high power consumption inherent to the present magnetic field-biased waveguides. The generation of magnetic fields via small voltages (10's V) and currents (10's mA) derived from magnetoelectric heterostructures lead to &gt;100X reduction in power consumption and response time. The impact is the development of planar phase shifters and circulators having low insertion loss, high power handling, low power consumption, and fast response time for applications in wireless and satellite communications and mobile networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The implementation of this program will positively impact society?s socioeconomic challenges related to increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in science, technology &amp; engineering (ST&amp;E) careers. This is achieved by identifying, recruiting, and educating underrepresented populations at the pre-freshmen stage of education by creating opportunities for student exchange and diversity through the establishment of Summer Science Magnetism Camp for rising middle school students and Magnetism and Engineering Summer Bridge Program for high school students.</AbstractNarration>
