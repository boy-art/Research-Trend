    <AbstractNarration>Objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to study the use of stochastic optimization and coordinating control to improve the stability, reliability, and economic efficiency of the next-generation power system with significant wind penetration. The approach is to (1) develop novel modeling and optimization frameworks using probability-based decision-making approaches for security-constrained stochastic optimization of the power system; (2) enhance steady-state and transient performance of wind plants through novel wind-plant supervisory control; and (3) enhance overall power system dynamic performance and stability through novel wide-area coordinating control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the creation of new philosophies for optimization and control design, this project will advance understanding of the critical operational issues of the next-generation power system and will lead to smarter power grids to provide better electric energy security, efficiency, and sustainability. In addition to power systems, this research will create several fundamental frameworks and methodologies applicable to optimization and control of other interconnected, large-scale, stochastic, dynamical, complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will build a thriving and diversified power program through the integration of graduate and undergraduate research and teaching with K-12 outreach, which will provide a unique platform of learning for young individuals entering the power engineering profession. This project will build multiple foreign research training and exchange programs to promote international collaborations in power engineering education and research. The outcomes of this project will further exploit the benefits of wind power in reaching the goal of supplying 20% of the nation's electricity by wind and will benefit various sectors of the nation's economy.</AbstractNarration>
