    <AbstractNarration>The PI?s propose to develop an Autonomous eXpendable Instrument System (AXIS), an advanced probe autolauncher system with higher capacity, greater interactivity, and more efficient operation than existing research-oriented designs. AXIS will streamline data collection using expendable probes, facilitate novel and interactive observational approaches, and reduce both the operational cost and logistical complexity of probe deployments from research and commercial vessels. Support is requested to advance AXIS development from an existing mechanical prototype to a pair of fully-functional and field-tested systems. Initial installation of AXIS is proposed aboard the R/V Oceanus and the M/V Oleander, a container vessel that is continuing a 30-year program of regular measurements spanning the Gulf Stream between Bermuda and New Jersey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal mainly the community benefits of improved sampling. AXIS will help to optimize sampling with these probes. It will help to reduce at-sea personnel requirements and costs. The 2-way communication aspect makes possible adaptive sampling to resolve transient or sparse features. There is no explicit mention of teaching or training, although Fratantoni does interact with graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
