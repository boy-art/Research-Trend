    <AbstractNarration>The quark-gluon plasma that is being created at particle accelerators presents theorists with the challenge of understanding the dynamics of strongly interacting quarks. An emerging approach for modeling strongly coupled plasmas is gauge-gravity duality. Gravity dual models have already uncovered analytical connections between a wide variety of dynamic variables that were not realized with conventional gauge theory techniques. The goal of this project is to place phenomenological constraints on gravity dual models to such a degree that we can use experimental data for precision tests of gauge-gravity duality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New York City College of Technology CUNY plays a leading role in the education of minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and is a Hispanic Serving Institution. The PI will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups by involving students in research projects. This will enable the students to apply technical skills learned in the classroom, develop their investigative skills and participate in the scientific enterprise. In addition, by helping to write papers and presenting the research at conferences, the students will improve their information literacy, writing and communication skills. This will help to develop their skill set needed for lifelong learning and maximize their chances of success in the STEM areas. Since the majority of City Tech students are the first in their families to go to college, outreach programs are critical in order to increase family involvement and support, as well as raise the public awareness about the importance of the STEM areas. The PI will also organize and develop a series of public lectures for the local community, which will present physics in a non-technical and entertaining manner.</AbstractNarration>
