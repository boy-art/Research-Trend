    <AbstractNarration>Enrique Peacock-Lopez of Williams College is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to continue and expand his work in the area of chemical self-replication as well as chemical and biochemical regulatory mechanisms in solutions and on surfaces. A large number of biochemical systems show regulatory positive and negative feedback loops that extend from the molecular cell level to the physiological level. The PI's group studies the molecular basis of chemical self-replication and chemical, biochemical and physiological regulatory mechanisms. Their aim to to develop dynamic models to explain observed temporal and chaotic oscillation in the concentrations of relevant metabolites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamical analysis of chemical and biochemical mechanisms and chemical self-replication provides insights into efficient ways to modify or redirect overall biochemical dynamics. The Peacock-Lopez research group is composed entirely of undergraduates who receive valuable training and experience in the scientific research process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RUI award is supported in a co-funding arrangement with the Genes and Genome program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.</AbstractNarration>
