    <AbstractNarration>The 2010 Gordon Research Conference on Aqueous Corrosion (GRC) will be held July 25-30, 2010, at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire. There will be about 22 invited oral presentations and about 50 posters. The preliminary list of topics includes: Advances in mathematical modeling of corrosion and protection; Understanding and controlling Environmentally Assisted Cracking; Degradation and protection of non-metallic materials and coatings; Interfaces of corrosion science with other disciplines; Corrosion issues in energy technologies and sustainability The 2010 GRC will be immediately preceded by a Gordon Graduate Research Seminar (GRS), a two-day weekend meeting run by and for young researchers along similar lines to the GRC. The GRC will feature speakers from academia, national labs, and industry worldwide, mostly mature leaders in the field, but with a number of younger researchers. The demographic and gender-diverse mix of speakers and discussion leaders will reflect the worldwide community of people working in the field of corrosion as well as under-represented minorities and women. Corrosion science is an interdisciplinary field that draws together fundamental aspects of the physics, chemistry and electrochemistry of interfaces, advances in modeling, and cutting-edge characterization techniques. The selected topics highlight the fundamental science that underpins practical solutions to corrosion problems, as well as recognizing the common ground between corrosion science and related disciplines, and bringing scientists from those disciplines into the wider corrosion science community. Corrosion science has wide societal importance in view of the enormous cost of corrosion to developed economies, and its impact on safety, environment and quality of life. Corrosion control can be seen as critical to the sustainability of raw materials supply. Beyond that, corrosion issues arise in advanced technologies, including biomedical engineering and nanotechnology. This GRC will promote education and the scholarly pursuit of research in this technologically significant field. Almost all attendees, students in particular, are expected to participate via talks or posters. Meanwhile, the GRS gives an ideal opportunity for the next generation of corrosion scientists to develop their ideas and confidence, fostering beneficial national and international links. The engagement of women and under-represented minorities is already well underway after the outstanding 2006 and 2008 GRCs and inaugural 2008 GRS.</AbstractNarration>
