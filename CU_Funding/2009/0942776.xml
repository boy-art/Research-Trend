    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61). This plant-based life sciences curriculum project entails the design, implementation, and assessment of an innovative model for research-based pedagogy that allows all students to do original biological research across multiple levels of the biological hierarchy, from molecules to communities. The model introduces laboratory modules developed from ongoing undergraduate thesis work into core first-year courses, then incorporates undergraduate research projects vertically into biology curricula at the sophomore, junior, and senior levels. The modules supplement traditional instruction in basic plant science concepts (community ecology, taxonomy, physiology, and molecular population genetics), and facilitate development of experimental design and analysis skills. In addition, the modules are being designed to expose classroom researchers to several different facets of and approaches to studying the same problem during multiple time periods (lower- and upper-division courses), and to engender in them an appreciation of the scientific process. Rather than using only traditional one-on-one methods for mentoring undergraduate research, this approach provides first-hand, course-based research experiences for all biology students. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the modules at addressing goals for student learning incorporates use of several established and reliable instruments. The modules are designed to be flexible, allowing for adoption of the research-based pedagogy model at a variety of institutional types (including secondary schools, urban or rural universities, and schools with small or large student bodies), and are being shared through a website. This research-based pedagogy model also incorporates use of upper-level research students to mentor cohorts of underclassmen during laboratory exercises. The research students benefit by receiving invaluable instructional training; serving as mentors is giving them opportunities to become more knowledgeable and adept at communicating about their chosen research topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being co-funded by funds from the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Emerging Frontiers Division.</AbstractNarration>
