    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to upgrade the facilities of the Northeast Science Station (near Cherskiy, Siberia), enabling greatly expanded analytical capacity onsite. The equipment purchases include a Shimadzu total organic carbon and nitrogen analyzer, muffle furnace, precision balance, stereo microscope, and YSI multi-parameter water quality logger. Increased analytical capacity at the Northeast Science Station will facilitate expanded freshwater, marine, and terrestrial research opportunities and minimize the logistical costs associated with international shipping and customs. Many types of analyses are best done on fresh samples, so the capacity to perform measurements onsite will also improve data reliability. The upgraded analytical facilities would benefit student training. The upgrades requested in this proposal would accelerate scientific progress and allow sampling strategies to be adapted in the field based on results of recently collected and analyzed samples.</AbstractNarration>
