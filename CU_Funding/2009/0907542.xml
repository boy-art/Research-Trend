    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is a continuation of the current NSF award and involves the design, synthesis, and study of liquid crystalline materials that are uniquely suited to address fundamental questions and applied problems in the field of liquid crystals. The proposed materials are nematic liquid crystals containing boron clusters, a class of compounds that displays unusual steric and electronic properties. Because these materials have the potential to meet technological needs in modern society, the project has two related goals: the development of new materials for applications in flat panel displays and new liquid crystalline electrolytes for rechargeable Li+ ion batteries. The project involves the molecular design of new materials aided by quantum-mechanical calculations, inorganic/organic synthetic methods, structure-property relationship studies, electrooptical characterization and ion mobility investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multidisciplinary program is directed at the development of new advanced molecular materials for addressing fundamental questions in the field of liquid crystals and for applications in flat panel displays and rechargeable batteries. The design involves unique organic-inorganic hybrid molecules, which will be synthesized and investigated using a broad array of modern research tools. The proposed work will affect a number of areas of science and engineering, and is expected to impact LCD and energy storage technologies. It will provide excellent opportunities for the involved personnel (undergraduate and graduate students and also postdoctoral workers) to obtain broad training in modern materials chemistry through domestic and international collaborations, which include the LCD industry (e.g. Vision in Colorado).</AbstractNarration>
