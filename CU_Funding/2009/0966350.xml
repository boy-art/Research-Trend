    <AbstractNarration>The E-Scholars program provides financial, academic, and professional development support for engineering students interested in energy-related careers, especially in renewable energy. The cohort is being drawn from a target population of engineering students with energy interests and from at-risk groups, with an emphasis on 1st-generation college students. The project goals are achieved through a combination of scholarship support, academic and personal counseling, and cohort building using a three-pronged approach: cohort building, cohort focusing, and bridging activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on existed TRiO, McNair, and Upward Bound projects. Students are primarily being recruited through existing channels (e.g., Upward Bound) and new ones such as the program web site and engineering outreach. Twenty students are receiving four year scholarships averaging $6500 annually.</AbstractNarration>
