    <AbstractNarration>The University of California-Santa Barbara proposes to create a program that integrates computing education with topics -- Mesoamerican culture and conservation of endangered species -- that are culturally relevant and attractive to Latina/os and females and their families. The focus is not on ecology or cultural studies as an end, but rather as a means to interest students in computing. The themes will motivate students from the targeted groups to excel in school, attend college, and choose computing as a career. The goal is to attract new students, students who are not already interested in computing. The program will include a summer program, in conjunction with long-term mentoring, advising, and tracking. Over the course of the 4 week summer program, students will learn about culture, history, and conservation as motivators for the real goal: learning about computer science. Participants will then use programming and web technology to create and share art, stories, and games with their peers and their parents through the eVoices web site. A comprehensive follow-up plan will engage and retains students from middle school through university with hierarchical mentoring and support from existing university programs (Pathways). The approach, if successful, can be replicated at many institutions using different culturally-relevant topics that appeal to their target populations.</AbstractNarration>
