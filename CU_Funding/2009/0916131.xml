    <AbstractNarration>This project develops an innovative real-time simulation system of turbulent fluids, FlowBase, by employing a novel flow pattern database. A collection of pre-generated small flow patterns are managed by a database system with efficient storage and searching strategy, query and transaction handling, to enable fast and effective retrieval. The patterns are integrated with real-time ongoing simulation according to physical and topological parameters of the ongoing global flow. The FlowBase system is implemented with GPU (graphics hardware) acceleration on single PC or clusters. Furthermore, the system provides focus+context flow pattern integration that only appends turbulent flow details in focus areas, and also offers flexibility by adding patterns according to the computational resource budget. In this way, the system overcomes the resource limit for large-scale simulations and provides turbulent flow details for modeling visually-satisfying and physically-correct fluid phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FlowBase system can rapidly provide vivid and spirited fluid behavior to create realistic experiences which are a decisive factor in many educational and entertainment applications, including virtual reality based education, advertisement and entertainment industry. It also benefits prediction and training applications, where fast computation and visual interaction of turbulent fluids are highly critical, such as contaminant dispersion prediction, emergency responder training, flight simulators, and urban and environmental design. The research outcome of the pattern database, novel algorithm, modeling techniques, computational and visualization tools are made publicly available through publications and software packages.</AbstractNarration>
