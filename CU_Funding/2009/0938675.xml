    <AbstractNarration>The strategic objective of this conference at Suzdal is a deeper integration of the Russian geophysical community  back into the global geophysical disciplines with targeting of the younger Russian generations as potential scholars for the years to come. With the above goal taken into account, over 40 invitations were sent out to leading scientists from USA , Asia and Europe from within various subfields of the sciences of the Earth. We will also bring over young American scientists to set some examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to now for over two decades conferences of such enormous dimensions have not been held in Russia. At the conference there will be a discussion on the current state and latest achievements in the study of global and regional processes within Earth bowels and their appearance on the surface and in geophysical fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest world developments in the study of the structure, content and rheology substance of the Earth mantel will be presented, as well as the mechanisms that lead to generation and evolution of the lithospheric plates, Earth mantle convections, occurrence and rise and introduction of the hot spots into the plumes of the lithosphere, processes in zones of subduction, in particular influence of water on the  mantel, lithospheric, and bedrock tectonic and seismic processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest observational data, precise laboratory measurements, theoretical research, mathematical modeling, and in particular, modern supercomputer technologies will also be brought to the fore during these discussions.</AbstractNarration>
