    <AbstractNarration>Introducing Dynamic Number is a research and development project undertaken by KCP Technologies to extend and operationalize research in number, operation, and early algebra. The project builds on the paradigm of Dynamic Geometry (the interactive and continuous manipulation of geometric shapes and constructions) with a new technological paradigm, Dynamic Number, centered on the direct manipulation of number representations and numerical constructions. Using The Geometer's Sketchpad as a starting point, KCP Technologies is developing new software tools to deepen students' conceptions of integers, fractions, decimals, real numbers, and early algebra in grades 2-8 mathematics. These tools are accompanied by 40 supporting classroom activities, as well as a six-week online professional development course for teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the software and learning materials are being designed from the perspective of a "bottom up/top down" analysis of the content domains. The University of Georgia, working under a subcontract, serves as the project's evaluator. Using a combination of videotaped teaching experiments and classroom observations from eight field-test schools, they are examining how Dynamic Number technology effects students' conceptions of discrete numerical quantities, continuous numerical quantities, and early algebraic principles, such as the concept of variable. They are also examining whether the software allows students to design and construct dynamic mathematical models of their own invention.</AbstractNarration>
