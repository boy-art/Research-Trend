    <AbstractNarration>The project aims to establish new results in different topics of &lt;br/&gt;stochastic analysis. First a new approach for proving the smoothness &lt;br/&gt;of the density for solutions to stochastic partial differential &lt;br/&gt;equations will be introduced. This method is based on a stochastic &lt;br/&gt;version of Feynman-Kac's formula for the Malliavin derivative of the &lt;br/&gt;solution. Moreover, the techniques of Malliavin calculus will be &lt;br/&gt;applied to derive upper and lower Gaussian estimates for the density of &lt;br/&gt;the solution. A second objective of the project is to obtain results &lt;br/&gt;on the rate of convergence of Euler-type numerical approximation schemes &lt;br/&gt;for stochastic differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian &lt;br/&gt;motion. The application of the techniques of Malliavin calculus to &lt;br/&gt;analyze numerical approximation schemes for backward stochastic &lt;br/&gt;differential equation is also one of the topics of the project. &lt;br/&gt;Another research direction deals with the proof of central and &lt;br/&gt;noncentral limit theorems for a large variety of functionals of a &lt;br/&gt;Gaussian process, including multiple stochastic integrals, and weighted &lt;br/&gt;power variations. The project also aims to establish Feynman-Kac's &lt;br/&gt;formulas for the one-dimensional stochastic heat equation driven by a &lt;br/&gt;fractional multiplicative Gaussian noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic analysis is an active area in mathematics which is motivated &lt;br/&gt;by the study of ordinary and partial differential equations perturbed by &lt;br/&gt;a random noise. These equations play a central role as models in many &lt;br/&gt;areas of physics and economics. The application of these equations in &lt;br/&gt;concrete problems requires suitable numerical approximation schemes, &lt;br/&gt;and convenient estimates for the probability distribution of the &lt;br/&gt;solution. This project aims to make new relevant contributions to these &lt;br/&gt;problems, by developing and applying powerful mathematical &lt;br/&gt;techniques such as the Malliavin calculus. On the other hand, motivated &lt;br/&gt;by some applications in hydrology, telecommunications and mathematical &lt;br/&gt;finance, there has been a recent interest in input noises possessing a &lt;br/&gt;long memory property such as the fractional Brownian motion. The &lt;br/&gt;development of a stochastic calculus with respect to these long memory &lt;br/&gt;processes is also one of the aims of this project.</AbstractNarration>
