    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation project is to develop a portable, tripod-mounted radar system that will be used for high-resolution (sub-millimeter) deformation measurements of infrastructure and natural hazards. The operation of this ground-based radar (GBR) is based on the identification of interference patterns from radar measurements performed at different times to detect and quantify movements. The development approach for this project is to design the GBR device to operate at multiple frequencies and polarities to enhance the accuracy of the measurements for a wide range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed GBR instrument has the potential to transform the way deformation measurements are performed in civil engineering and geological applications. The mobility, versatility and exceptional sensitivity of the GBR device will allow for use in a variety of applications, from small-scale evaluation of buildings and bridges, to large-scale monitoring of dams, tunnels and landslides. Benefits to society will result from the development of new methods to: identify problems with civil infrastructure, mitigate effects on society from natural hazards, and detect potential threats to national security. In addition, this equipment will serve as a unique, hands-on educational tool for students in the fields of civil engineering, electrical engineering, and the geological sciences.</AbstractNarration>
