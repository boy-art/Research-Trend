    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI grant will be used to acquire an X-ray microtomography (XM) system to support diverse research and education groups at Clarkson University (CU). The equipment will directly support the research and educational mission of CU through the training and involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in educational experiences inside and outside of the classroom. The XM system provides new and unique experimental research capabilities at CU for the investigation of internal geometric and material characterization problems. The system adds advanced experimental capabilities to modernize the CU mechanical characterization and testing capabilities, which serve several innovative, multidisciplinary research and education projects. This system will have a very significant impact on the fundamental understanding of various mechanical, aerospace, bio-mechanical and biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This X-ray microtomography capability will enhance collaborative research targeted at improving the human condition, and will provide state-of-the-art instrumentation for training of CU graduate and undergraduate students interested in emerging research areas in advanced materials and engineered biological systems. The XM facilities will enhance experiential project-based learning in pre-college, undergraduate and graduate courses and research projects directed by CU.A broad range of fundamental and applied research programs will utilize the system, including: investigation of the mechanical and pharmaceutical properties of advanced drug tablets, health and biological effects of nanoparticles, characterization of nanocomposites and self-healing materials, and osteoporosis-induced compression fractures in vertebral bone. The system will play a critical role in enabling the CU researchers to acquire new knowledge and understanding in these emerging fields and train next generation technical professionals.</AbstractNarration>
