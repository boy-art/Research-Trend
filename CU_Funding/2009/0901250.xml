    <AbstractNarration>General Relativity has very important long term goals among which&lt;br/&gt;the weak and strong cosmic censorship, final state and stability of Kerr&lt;br/&gt;conjectures are the most outstanding. To complete such goals one&lt;br/&gt;needs to solve many fundamental difficulties among which the PI proposes&lt;br/&gt;to concentrate on the problems of uniqueness and stability of the Kerr&lt;br/&gt;family as well as the bounded curvature conjecture. The PI intends to&lt;br/&gt;continue his work with A. Ionescu, and more recently S. Alexakis, to&lt;br/&gt;remove the restrictive real analyticity assumptions of the well known&lt;br/&gt;results of S. Hawking and Carter-Robinson. The PI also plans to continue&lt;br/&gt;to work with I. Rodnianski and J. Szeftel and settle the important&lt;br/&gt;bounded curvature conjecture. Together with I. Rodnianski they plan&lt;br/&gt;to adapt the recent work of Christodoulou, based on what he calls&lt;br/&gt;the short pulse method, with which he was able to derive the first&lt;br/&gt;result on the formation of trapped surfaces for solutions of the Einstein&lt;br/&gt;vacuum equations. The PI and his collaborator believe that the new method can be signifficantly improved and applied to various situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the proposal will give a better understanding of some&lt;br/&gt;of the main theoretical open problems of General Relativity. The long&lt;br/&gt;term hope is that some of the insight gained in the process will &lt;br/&gt;influence related areas such Theoretical Physics and Numerical Relativity.&lt;br/&gt;Of paramount interest to the gravitational wave experiments is to de-&lt;br/&gt;sign numerical algorithms which can simulate, realistically, black hole&lt;br/&gt;interactions. The PI also hopes that the interplay between geometric and an-&lt;br/&gt;alytic methods, which are being developed, will influence other areas of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear PDE, Differential Geometry and Analysis. The PI plans to attract&lt;br/&gt;and train a larger number of PhD students and postdocs, than he has&lt;br/&gt;done so far, in General Relativity. The PI believes that the subject is going&lt;br/&gt;now through an exciting period when important problems are solved and many new avenues of research are being open.</AbstractNarration>
