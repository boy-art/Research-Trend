    <AbstractNarration>Securing future sources of sustainable energy is a global challenge that will benefit greatly from international collaboration. The USA-Pakistan International Conference on Renewable Energy, to be held in Lahore, Pakistan from October 10 to 12, 2016, will facilitate these collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Securing future sources of sustainable energy is a global challenge and global collaboration is required to develop effective technologies that suit the wide range of needs and operating environments. U.S. scientists are increasingly seeking test-beds for evaluating technologies at the research stage, are seeking partners with new perspectives, and also seek new markets for the technologies they develop. This project will bring U.S. scientists and engineers to Pakistan for a three day conference to discuss a wide range of alternative energy technologies, focusing overall on material design, synthesis and evaluation of material sustainability. This direct communication may facilitate collaborations that improve the quality, versatility and applicability of research efforts by providing U.S. personnel with a more global perspective as well as the insights of new partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will discuss a range of topics that are both cutting edge and appropriate for promoting collaboration between U.S. and Pakistani scientists and engineers. The topics include: International Collaboration on New Energy, Storage and Smart Grid Technologies, Solar Energy, Hydrogen and Fuel Cells, Nuclear Energy, Wind Energy, and Other Energy Sources (geothermal, biofuel, energy efficiency, etc.). The workshop will be structured to promote interactions among scientists and engineers from different disciplines and at different career stages. It will include researchers in academic institutions, national research labs and industry in the U.S. and Pakistan. Entrepreneurs, policy makers and manufacturers are also expected to be present, and the conference includes an industry/manufacturers expo.</AbstractNarration>
