    <AbstractNarration>This project is part of a summer field study to gain a better understanding of reactive chemistry in the atmosphere of a forested environment. In this project, the exchange of nitrogen compounds at the leaf-level will be investigated to better predict the production of ozone, secondary organic aerosols and the cycling of nitrogen between the atmosphere and the biosphere. Improving the understanding of reactive chemistry in forest environments will improve projections of how future changes in forest succession and climate might affect the future composition of the atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of this study are to: (1) determine leaf exchanges of NO, NO2, NOy, and ozone for the dominant tree species at the University of Michigan Biological Station's (UMBS) Program for Research on Oxidants: PHotochemistry, Emissions, and Transport (PROPHET) site; (2) determine the dependency of the leaf-level gas exchanges on the physiological and environmental factors including photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, light, temperature, and humidity; (3) determine the dependency of the leaf-level gas exchanges on the ambient NOx and ozone mixing ratio; (4) Investigate potential connections between leaf-level NOx exchanges and emission of biogenic volatile organic carbon; (5) re-examine nocturnal and daytime below-canopy turbulent transport representation in the Multi-layer Canopy Chemical Exchange (MLC-CHEM) model using high resolution temperature gradient measurements; and (6) incorporate, revisit, and further improve the modeling of the UMBS forest oxidation.</AbstractNarration>
