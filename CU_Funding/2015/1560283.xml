    <AbstractNarration>Two NSF-funded Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) at North Carolina State University, NCSU, have partnered together to propose a joint REU Site program to provide diverse and talented cohorts of undergraduates, from institutions with limited or no research opportunities, the unique opportunity to explore the spectrum of energy research from nano-scale harvesting to the larger scale smart grid technologies. The Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) Systems ERC is focused on fundamental research (system theory, advanced storage, and post-silicon power devices) and enabling technology development (secured communication, distributed grid intelligence, high-frequency and high-voltage power conversion, and distributed energy storage devices). The mission of the Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technologies (ASSIST) ERC is to use nanotechnology to improve global health by enabling a correlation between personal health and personal environment, and by empowering patients and doctors to manage wellness and improve quality of life. Unlike traditional REUs that often focus on a singular topic this ERC collaboration will provide research experiences and discussions on broader applications of energy innovations. Given the limited exposure of undergraduates to the field of energy research, this REU site will address a need in REU opportunities. The opportunity that this REU Site presents will help move the nation to a more informed society through both the encouragement of individuals to participate in related research and careers, and their ability to become ambassadors of this information to their peers, families, and communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this 10-week summer REU Site program is to increase and broaden participation of underrepresented students in STEM fields through graduate studies, with an emphasis on energy; from nano-scale harvesting all the way to large-scale power management and distribution. The goal is met through four objectives: 1) RECRUIT students from minority-serving institutions, women's institutions, and community colleges without STEM research programs, 2) ENGAGE students in the culture of research via projects that are relevant to students' experiences and meaningful relationships with mentors, 3) PREPARE students for success through activities in three skills areas: Independent Research, Systems, Thinking, and Professional Skills, and 4) SUSTAIN student engagement beyond the program through immersions with the NCSU ERC research community.</AbstractNarration>
