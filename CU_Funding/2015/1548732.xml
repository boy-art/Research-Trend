    <AbstractNarration>The main goal of this 2-year project is to improve present understanding of the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) process by elucidating the relationship between flux emergence and CME dynamics, thus providing additional insights into the CME genesis. The study will also clarify how flux emergence contributes to the transport magnetic energy from the solar interior to the heliosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2-year research effort is focused on an undergraduate research project, thereby providing direct training with data analysis and the conduct of scientific research. Any relationships found between source-region properties of CMEs, including flux emergence and speeds of associated CMEs, should also enable improvements in space weather forecasting, which could minimize adverse impacts of CME-driven disturbances on our society. This project directly supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>
