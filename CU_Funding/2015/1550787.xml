    <AbstractNarration>Scientific drilling and coring is crucial for the advancement of the Earth Sciences. Vast&lt;br/&gt;resources have been invested in drilling and coring operations around the world: on land,&lt;br/&gt;in the oceans, and in the polar regions. The return of these investments must be maximized&lt;br/&gt;by ensuring optimal access and re-usability of the data generated through drilling and coring&lt;br/&gt;projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, Open Core Data (OCD), is a next-generation approach to data management that will&lt;br/&gt;open vast stores of existing and future geoscience data to new and innovative scientific use by&lt;br/&gt;radically improving discoverability, accessibility, citability, preservation, and integration&lt;br/&gt;of data from past, current, and future drilling and coring projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research objectives of the International Ocean Discovery Program and Continental&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Drilling communities provide impressive examples of the breadth of scientific&lt;br/&gt;themes that drilling and coring helps address, ranging from the nature of the deep biosphere&lt;br/&gt;and oceanic sub-seafloor, to understanding environmental change, species evolution, fault&lt;br/&gt;zone dynamics, magmatism, and tectonics, among many others. The scientific potential enabled&lt;br/&gt;by OCD is therefore large and expected to impact many geoscience domains. OCD will form the&lt;br/&gt;nucleus of a federated data infrastructure that will support entirely new scientific approaches&lt;br/&gt;and lines of inquiry by facilitating integration of continental and marine data for synthesis&lt;br/&gt;studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCD will align with NSF data policies to provide open access to all scientific drilling data.&lt;br/&gt;Both research and the process of transferring data to archives for permanent curation will&lt;br/&gt;be simplified and streamlined through this effort. Open Core Data will structure and integrate&lt;br/&gt;scientific drilling data optimally to enable data-driven science that faces substantial barriers&lt;br/&gt;at present related to data heterogeneity in discovery, access, and formats. Open Core Data&lt;br/&gt;will enable geoscience domains that utilize scientific drilling and coring in their workflows&lt;br/&gt;to come closer to realizing the full potential of their data, and to make their own unique&lt;br/&gt;new contributions that benefit science and society as new research is enabled.</AbstractNarration>
