    <AbstractNarration>The near-Earth space and upper atmosphere (Geospace) is a complex natural system that can impact various human technologies deployed in space and on the ground. To forecast, and thus mitigate that impact, it is necessary to develop accurate understanding of the interaction processes between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere. These processes are mainly initiated on the planet's dayside and can be observed at high latitudes in both hemispheres, near the ionospheric intersection of geomagnetic field lines that map from the high-altitude interaction region. A variety of coupled phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales are produced by this interaction that transfer the solar wind energy and momentum through the magnetosphere down to the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Developing our understanding of these interaction processes and how they couple to both polar ionospheres is important for developing physical models that can describe and predict "space weather" disturbances ? a major goal of the recently adopted National Space Weather Strategy. This goal has been hampered so far by the lack of sufficient data to investigate processes and to validate global models, particularly in the Southern hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will overcome the above problem through the operation and use of data from a new generation of autonomous instrument platforms strategically deployed in the Southern polar cap. This research will continue studies of various physical mechanisms involved in the solar wind interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere for better understanding of the multi-scale, global, and interhemispheric electrodynamic coupling within the entire Geospace system. Important aspects of these investigations include operation of a new chain of autonomous low-power ground-based instruments deployed along the 40-degree geomagnetic meridian in the East Antarctic. These stations are geomagnetically conjugate to the Greenland West Coast chain of long-term-running magnetometers supported by Danish scientists. These interhemispheric connections are crucial for interpretation of satellite observations (such NASA's THEMIS and MMS missions) in and near the magnetopause and for further understanding of the global geospace system's dynamics. The project will employ young scientists in the operation of remote Antarctic stations, as well as investigate space weather events, and, thus, contribute to the development of the nation?s scientific workforce. Use of the project's data to validate space weather models can provide benefit to society as a whole as it aids to protect various navigation, communications, and defense technologies that can be impacted by space weather.</AbstractNarration>
