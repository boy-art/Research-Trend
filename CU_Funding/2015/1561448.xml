    <AbstractNarration>The Purdue Entomological Research Collection (PERC), an active research unit within the Department of Entomology at Purdue University, houses the largest and most important collection of arthropods in Indiana, estimated at about two million specimens. Over the last 120 years, the PERC has acquired numerous historical insect collections of great significance to the entomology community, including thousands of unique reference specimens, and a world-class collection of aquatic insects. This project will update the existing storage systems in the collection to ensure they are preserved for future research and education. In addition, specimen images and associated data will be stored in an online database freely available to the public. Training will be provided on proper preservation of entomological specimens and natural history collections to junior researchers, and undergraduate students, as well as underrepresented groups. This project will raise awareness of the importance of insects and natural history collections through various public engagement activities, aquatic ecosystem workshops, and rural community youth programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PERC's holdings include the world's largest and most comprehensive collection of mayflies (Ephemeroptera), as well as several important historical collections, including damselflies and dragonflies (Odonata), aquatic beetles (Coleoptera), and North American bees (Hymenoptera). The PERC also serves as a repository for various Indiana Survey projects and other voucher material, and houses over 2,200 primary and secondary type specimens. Despite the importance of its holdings, the PERC has remained underutilized by, and in some cases inaccessible to, scientists, students, and water managers outside of Purdue. This project will address these problems by updating the curatorial standards and expanding the specimen database. Specific goals include transferring improperly stored specimens into modern drawers and cabinets, integration of recently collected specimens for molecular work, updating the current slide storage system, reorganizing and ethanol-preserved collections. PERC specimen data will be shared and made available online through iDigBio (www.idigbio.org); PERC's mayfly data will also be made available through the Mayfly Central website (www.entm.purdue.edu/mayfly/). Additional information can be found at the official PERC website (www.entm.purdue.edu/perc/).</AbstractNarration>
