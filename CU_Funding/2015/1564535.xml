    <AbstractNarration>On August 21, 2017, a total solar eclipse will traverse the United States from Oregon to South Carolina. Millions of Americans will witness totality, in which the Moon completely blocks the Sun, and over 500 million people across North America will experience a partial eclipse. In this project, the American Astronomical Society (AAS) will forge an umbrella organization consisting of an eclipse project manager, a centralized website of resources, and a mini-grants program to coordinate and facilitate local and national activities that will educate the public about the science of this rare event. The project will leverage this fascinating display of beauty to engage as many people as possible in the endeavor of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve scientists, educators, and amateur and professional eclipse observers in developing extensive plans for unique outreach activities to reach a significant fraction of the diverse U.S. population. The goal is to use the eclipse, which will generate significant media attention, to educate a broad audience about the associated science and to encourage young people from widely diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in science. Special emphasis will be placed on citizen science projects and on educational activities targeting groups that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. A mini-grants program will be established to fund efforts specifically targeting underrepresented groups in order to increase their participation. The evaluation plan will focus on the utilization of the materials on the website and the learning gains of participants in specific activities funded by the mini-grants. All lessons learned will be collated in a publicly available formal report and will lay the groundwork for a strategic plan to fully capitalize on the next U.S.-based solar eclipse in 2024. Because this project aligns well with the objectives of multiple NSF directorates, this award is co-funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education and the Division of Research on Learning in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources; the Division of Astronomical Sciences in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences in the Directorate for Geosciences.</AbstractNarration>
