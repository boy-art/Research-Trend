    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to fundamentally transform the undergraduate geoscience experience at the University of Hawai'i (UH) School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) and Kapi'olani Community College (KCC), both in and out of the classroom, using evidence-based practices. The expected outcome is to contribute to the development of a diverse geoscience workforce equipped to tackle today's environmental challenges and the development of a national model for institutional transformation. The objectives of the project are to increase enrollment of newly declared SOEST undergraduate majors among Associate of Science in Natural Science (ASNS) degree holders, to increase retention of newly declared SOEST undergraduate majors during their first year at SOEST, and to increase underrepresented minority enrollment among SOEST undergraduate majors (with at least half of the increase among Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos). These objectives will be accomplished through the implementation of four components. First, courses at SOEST will be transformed to incorporate student-centered strategies (e.g. active-learning, targeted interventions to stimulate student learning and success) and innovative assessment tools. The second component is professional development opportunities for the students through participation in a mentoring network, workshops, and outreach activities. Another important component will be the establishment of the Geoscience Learning Center at SOEST modeled after the KCC STEM center. The Center will have dedicated staff and space to promote STEM learning, networking, collaborations, and shared sense of purpose. The last component is support for KCC ocean science program by developing an introductory oceanography laboratory course and offering fieldtrips to the KCC students. Through a key cross-cutting strategic partnership, KCC students will be supported before, during, and after they transfer to SOEST.</AbstractNarration>
