    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at New York University (NYU) seeks to strengthen K-12 education in the STEM disciplines by involving middle and high school science and mathematics teachers from the New York City School District in mechatronics and robotics research, entrepreneurship, and industry experiences through 6-week summer workshops. The RET participants will gain first-hand multidisciplinary experiences to foster their development of the necessary pedagogical content knowledge to engage their own K-12 students in authentic experiences in science and engineering. The program will impact two areas that are of direct interest to the United States and the world: increasing access for K-12 teachers and their students to a deeper understanding of the STEM disciplines, research, and career opportunities; and inspiring teachers and students to pursue engineering careers. The decreasing cost of electronics and hardware components along with technological advances in additive manufacturing promise to significantly lower the cost of robot hardware, making the use of robots economical in diverse industries. Mechatronics and robotics designs will provide participants with a comprehensive experience in systems integration and product development through which they can practice and hone their skills in creativity, inventiveness, and entrepreneurship and gain an appreciation of the pathway from STEM education to careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a three-year period this RET Site will offer an intensive summer research program for a total of 30 middle and high school STEM teachers from schools in underserved New York City neighborhoods with socially, economically, racially, and ethnically diverse student bodies. Planned research projects include: marine robotics, microfluidic biosensing, wearable robotics, mechatronics device for liquid projectile visualization, and robots for disabilities. Project plans include: conduct guided training under the supervision of the Principal Investigator; collaborate with management experts to allow teachers to learn entrepreneurship, conduct innovation case-studies, and shadow entrepreneurs; offer research and industry experiences to teachers, in 2-teacher teams collaborating with faculty/industry mentors and research students; conduct events such as Open House, RET Day@Poly, and research seminars; conduct an Inno/Vention student idea contest and develop a business-philanthropy partnership to offer summer internships to students.</AbstractNarration>
