    <AbstractNarration>Increasing awareness of environmental issues has led to interest in renewable energy sources and waste materials recycling. This collaborative project between Adelphi University (US) and Warsaw University (Poland) will address these topics by focusing research on the development of novel, smart materials for alternative energy sources and new methods of water purification using solar energy. The project will increase the number of future U.S. workers who can understand and solve these important issues while increasing their ability to partner with international researchers who are also interested in these topics. This US-Polish International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project provides eight-week, photochemistry and nanotechnology research opportunity for twelve US students at Warsaw University, Poland. Specific efforts will be made ensuring the involvement of underprivileged and underrepresented in STEM minorities. Prior to their internships in Poland, students will spend the academic year working in research laboratory at Adelphi University developing essential technical skills relevant to the proposed research. This early-career research experience will enhance the professional training and education of the US undergraduate students by exposing them to modern instrumentation, advanced nanotechnology research, and its practical application. IRES students will develop global competencies through experiential education in an international environment motivating and inspiring young US researchers to invest in future research careers and become agents of change in today?s world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research efforts will focus on fabrication and characterization of nanohybrids combining CdX (X=S, Se) thin films with conducting polymers and wide-bandgap semiconducting metal oxides for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. Detailed studies of the nanohybrids formation process and their characterization will help to identify the key parameters influencing the semiconductor heterojunction quality, such as: materials? choice, their synthesis and processing, in order to correlate their composition, structure and performance. The experiments proposed in this project will test this hypothesis. Both, material synthesis and characterization of the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties will be performed using state-of-the-art electrochemical, spectroscopic and microscopic instrumentation available at Warsaw University laboratories. The US-Polish team expects to gain a better understanding of the basic working principles of these nanohybrid materials in order to increase their effectiveness and construct high efficiency solar cells and photocatalytic devices for environmental remediation. Successful completion of the proposed research would suggest solutions on some environmental issues, such as: hazardous waste treatment and low cost, high efficiency, alternative energy sources. The results of this project will be disseminated by conference presentations, journal publications and community outreach.</AbstractNarration>
