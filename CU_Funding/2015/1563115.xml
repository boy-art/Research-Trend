    <AbstractNarration>This research activity is the US component of a tri-partite collaboration between the US, Ireland, and Northern Ireland (UK) to investigate advanced manufacturing techniques in plasma and laser cutting for the creation of an entirely new class of interlocking steel connections that rely on neither welding nor bolting, both of which are time-consuming and expensive. To date, advanced manufacturing equipment has only been used to accelerate traditional processes for cutting sheet metal or other conventional fabrication activities. Such approaches have not capitalized on the equipment?s full potential, and this project will lay the groundwork to transform steel building construction by investigating the underlying science and engineering precepts to interlocking connections created from precise, volumetric cutting. Such connection system could radically transform how structural steel is fabricated, assembled, deconstructed, and reused. The class of interlocking connections represents the introduction of the first universal, structural steel connector system in more than one-half a century, and it will better engage advanced manufacturing into the US, Irish &amp; UK construction industries. Moreover, it offers the potential for significant reuse of materials that are heavily imported. The activity offers an innovative outreach program with broad-based technical dissemination through webinars and workshops, and educational outreach for K-12 students by means of national-level, student competitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced manufacturing for the assembly of structure steel (AMASS) system enhances the integration between design, fabrication, installation and maintenance through building information modeling (BIM) platforms to implement advanced connections. Fully automated, precise, volumetric cutting of open steel sections introduces intellectual challenges regarding the load-transfer mechanisms and failure modes for interlocking connections. The research activity includes closing the knowledge gaps concerning the mechanics, load resistance, and design of steel systems with interlocking connections. Also multi-scale modeling will be applied to investigate the mechanics of interlocking connections including stress and strain concentrations, fracture potential and failure modes, and to optimize connection geometry through parameter studies. Physical data will be collected from full-scale tests of beams, columns and beam-column assemblages with interlocking connections to determine nominal capacities in flexure, shear and axial loading, as well as for appropriate combinations.</AbstractNarration>
