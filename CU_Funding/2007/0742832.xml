    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this exploratory research proposal is to build at a conceptual level a broad framework of an Intelligent Distributed Autonomous Power System (IDAPS). This research proposal is presented in the context of a new paradigm where a mix of central station generation, distributed generation and energy efficiency/demand side management practices will provide an alternative and sustainable way to meet the growing needs for electricity. The proposed concept takes into account the availability of cleaner, efficient and cost effective small-scale generation sources, as well as advanced IP-based communication technologies in building a resilient electric power system with demand-side participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of an IDAPS microgrid conceptual framework will contribute to building a resilient and environmentally friendly customer-based microgrid which can exploit energy efficiency opportunities. While the current focus of microgrid R&amp;D is on utility-owned Distributed Energy Resource (DER) units which are designed to work in a collaborative fashion the IDAPS concept captures and coordinates customer-owned DER devices. In addition, the proposed framework takes advantage of demand side management in ensuring that critical loads are served during emergency conditions. This is unlike the traditional approach where demand-side management and servicing of critical loads are not generally coupled. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal represents a stepping-stone toward building a small IDAPS simulation test bed located at the Advanced Research Institute of Virginia Tech. The test bed will broaden student exposure beyond the academic environment through laboratory work. In addition, it will provide collaborative opportunities with other academic researchers who are active in similar research areas. Some of the research findings will also be used to teach a new graduate-level course on "Electrical Energy Infrastructure Assurance" at Virginia Tech.</AbstractNarration>
