    <AbstractNarration>Stiff oscillatory ordinary differential equations are common mathematical models in many important scientific fields, ranging from classical celestial mechanics to atomistic dynamics in modern physics and chemistry. These models are gaining ever more importance as the computer capability increases. Numerous simulations based on such systems are being performed in order to predict the nature, for example, of propagation of cracks and dislocations in metals and under what condition certain proteins change shape and take on specific functions that can be used in drug design. Many fundamental phenomena are generated through delicate interactions between rapid oscillations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge is to simulate these highly oscillatory interactions over physically relevant time without having the quality of the output being damaged by numerical errors. The research of this proposal aims at developing a new multi-scale computational approach such that the interesting phenomena resulting from interaction between oscillations can be computed accurately and efficiently over long time. The corresponding mathematical analysis of the algorithms will also be performed.</AbstractNarration>
