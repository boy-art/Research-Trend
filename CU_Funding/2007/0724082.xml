    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering, Prof. Arne Gericke from Kent State University and his graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will investigate the physicochemical behavior of ceramide-1-phosphate model membrane systems. This research coordinates with a collaborative award funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) to Dr. Gerald Brezesinski from the Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces. The physicochemical properties of these model membrane systems will be studied as a function of a number of environmental factors: salt concentration, presence of divalent cations, and the presence and nature of other lipids. The characterization tools that will be used are extensive, and include solid state NMR, X-ray scattering, infrared spectroscopy, FRET and a suite of microscopic and thermodynamic measurements. The ultimate goal of these studies is to learn more of how the physicochemical properties of ceramide-1-phosphate are linked to a broad number of diverse physiological functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lipid molecule layers enclose the contents of all cells. Scientists are increasingly learning that these layers are dynamic, structured and inherently complex entities. Studies like the ones supporting Prof. Gericke and his colleagues are aimed at developing an understanding of how fundamental molecular properties emerge into broader kinds of complex properties of biological systems. This research is at the intersection of the physical and life sciences, and the students working on these projects will receive outstanding interdisciplinary research training. In addition, students working on these projects will be exposed to research in an international setting.</AbstractNarration>
