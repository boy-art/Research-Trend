    <AbstractNarration>For nearly two decades, scientists worldwide have engaged in resource-intensive efforts to produce scientific evidence and a succession of assessment reports on the state of the global environment. In the meantime, little attention has been paid to whether or not intended audiences are receptive to them, and to understanding the factors conditioning or undermining such receptivity. Focused on the role of science, power and politics in Brazilian climate policy formation, this research project funded by the Science and Society Program uses ethnographic and policy network methods to identify and analyze the science-policy interface. It examines the weight and meaning given by different, climate-involved actors and social networks to different kinds and sources of scientific knowledge, and how these actors seek to manage science to ensure its perceived reliability and protect political interests. It centrally probes the practical considerations and socio-cultural, political and structural factors that bear on decision makers' science and policy choices, and the relative credibility they give to sources that are variously foreign, international or national, governmental or non-governmental. The project subsumes the PI's involvement in "Compon", an international collaborative effort to produce and compare studies in 17 countries on the role of social networks and science in climate decision making. The research also includes preliminary field-site investigation in Argentina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The research advances theoretical and practical understanding of the science-policy interface in general, and in Latin America and Brazil in particular, contributing to policy, science and environmental studies, anthropology and international relations. The research fills large knowledge gaps related to the role of science in environmental policy making in general, and in Brazil in particular, a country whose climate-related decision making is highly consequential internationally, politically and environmentally. It contributes to a new initiative to make "Earth System Governance" a central, cross-cutting theme under the major global change research programs, and, through Compon, promises to push Earth System Governance research past isolated and difficult to compare case studies towards rigorous, inter-comparative analysis of knowledge and decision making systems in a wide range of national contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The study identifies global, regional, national and sub-national patterns of science-policy structures and dynamics, including problems in the production, framing and flow of knowledge that weaken environmental protection in the face of climate change. This knowledge is used to identify the circumstances under which science is and is not deemed relevant and credible by decision makers, with view to improving the effectiveness of science through resource allocation and science-policy interface changes. Insights from the research are brought to bear in multiple contexts through peer-reviewed publications, collaborations, conference and seminar presentations, internet sites and web logs.</AbstractNarration>
