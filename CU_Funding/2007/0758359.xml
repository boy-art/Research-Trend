    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop a new capability for the design of complex articulated linkage systems. These systems form the skeletons of many machines, and this research expands the inventive reach of designers to explore novel new designs. This research seeks to formalize a uniform approach to the synthesis of large arrays of complex linkage structures. The combinatorial expansion of these structures and the increasing complexity of both their synthesis and analysis will be addressed using modern continuation methods in a parallel computing environment. The research plan focuses on prototype computing tools for articulated systems that move in a plane, and progresses to address massively complex spatial system design. These tools will be regularly applied to the invention of new systems to identify strengths and weakness of the approach. Deliverables include documentation of the theoretical results, distribution of prototype software, and demonstration and validation via hardware development as well as engineering student education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide an expanded ability to invent products that provide controlled planar and spatial articulated movement. Ease of construction and efficient operation make these devices cost effective and reliable design solutions. However, the current computational burden of finding these solutions forces designers toward more complex and expensive computer controlled systems. This research will provide effective tools for the analysis and design of complex articulated systems that can be applied at any scale. Example application areas include reverse engineering of protein structures, design of new complex micro-electro-mechanical systems, synthesis of novel home and factory automation devices and design of large space structures. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research.</AbstractNarration>
