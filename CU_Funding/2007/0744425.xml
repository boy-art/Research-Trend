    <AbstractNarration>0744425&lt;br/&gt;Feineman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding to acquire a quadrupole ICP-MS system for rapid analysis of laser ablated material. The facility currently has a 213 nm laser ablation system coupled with high resolution magnetic sector ICP-MS. A Thermo X-Series II quadrupole ICP-MS is requested which will increase the mass scanning rate (ultimately the sensitivity) by an order of magnitude. Matching funds are provided by the PI's startup monies and from other PSU facilities. PSU will guarantee salary for a permanent analytical chemist to oversee the facility. The new ICP-MS will be used in differentiating East African Rift System lavas, in constraining central Ethiopian thermal structure and lithosphere thickness by xenogcrist and xenolith analysis, in analyzing crystal and silicate liquid trace element diffusion, in determining magma mixing and storage within the East African Rift System, and in for general experiments to better understand element partitioning between minerals and fluids, minerals and melts, and melts and fluids. Several student projects will also be supported. The instrument will occupy existing space in the Material Characterization Laboratory (MCL), Hands-on training and certification will be provided by a staff scientist. The dedicated staff will oversee the day-to-day operation and maintenance. PSU provides general support for the facility with instrument user fees supporting maintenance, supplies and repair funds. The requested instrument will be a career vehicle for a new female hire. The instrument will be incorporated into undergraduate ?Forensic Geoscience,? and ?Techniques in Environmental Geochemistry? classes. The instrument will be made available to PSU?s Women in Science and Engineering Research and Minority Undergraduate Research Experiences programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
