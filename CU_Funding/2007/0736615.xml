    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological literacy for the general population is increasingly viewed as a necessity in a technological society. Citizens must understand what technology is, how it works, how it is created, how it shapes society, and how society influences technological development if they are to make informed decisions and choices. At a workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National Academy of Engineering, a framework for the design and evaluation of technological literacy courses emerged and the framework for technological literacy courses guides and informs this project. The project is refining and validating the framework and developing courses and modules based on it. A repository of technological literacy materials based on the framework is being established through this project that is easily accessible to those who wish to teach technological literacy courses across the nation. The resulting tools and teaching strategies are being disseminated broadly so that universities and community colleges can establish and evaluate technological literacy courses on their respective campuses.</AbstractNarration>
