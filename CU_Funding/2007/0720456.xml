    <AbstractNarration>The recent resurgence of research in server virtualization &lt;br/&gt;has created a lot of interest among providers of large-scale&lt;br/&gt;data centers in employing this technology to design improved &lt;br/&gt;solutions for managed hosting. Virtualization holds the promise of increased&lt;br/&gt;degrees of resource consolidation with accompanying reduction in&lt;br/&gt;operational costs of administration, repair, and electricity. &lt;br/&gt;Designing efficient virtualized data centers &lt;br/&gt;is therefore a desirable and worthy endeavor in multiple ways. &lt;br/&gt;The transition from traditional hosting models &lt;br/&gt;to a virtualized model is, however, not a trivial one. Realizing&lt;br/&gt;the consolidation-related benefits that virtualization has to&lt;br/&gt;offer requires a re-consideration of: (i) schedulers within the VMM,&lt;br/&gt;(ii) mechanisms for resource usage monitoring and accounting, and &lt;br/&gt;(iii) system-wide dynamic resource provisioning mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal identifies the key challenges that arise on&lt;br/&gt;all these fronts in a virtualized data center, and &lt;br/&gt;develops a comprehensive solution, called River, to address them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;River will make the following specific contributions: (i) improved&lt;br/&gt;resource management algorithms &lt;br/&gt;within the virtual machine monitor (VMM) that use both &lt;br/&gt;horizontal (between the schedulers in the VMM) and vertical &lt;br/&gt;(between VMM and hosted OS schedulers) co-operation, &lt;br/&gt;(ii) efficient and stable dynamic resource provisioning, and &lt;br/&gt;(iii) systems primitives that would provide new opportunities&lt;br/&gt;to the provisioning algorithms for improved cost-cutting via &lt;br/&gt;reduction of virtualization overheads. A prototype River data center based&lt;br/&gt;on Xen will be developed and resulting code &lt;br/&gt;made available to the community. Finally, we will&lt;br/&gt;re-design the labs associated with the systems courses at Penn State to &lt;br/&gt;employ virtualized hosting of class projects.</AbstractNarration>
