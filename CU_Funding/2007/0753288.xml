    <AbstractNarration>Consumers of health information have access to increasingly large numbers of sources from which to gather this information. Privacy preserving access to high quality health information will be an important adjunct to personal healthcare management. This project is developing a "patient-centered" approach to handle search complexity and provide personalized access to high quality health information while preserving the patient's privacy at all times. This research brings together an interdisciplinary team of computer and information scientists and health experts to develop a test-bed and simulation environment to support research in this emerging area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the research will be twofold. Locally Indiana University offers a graduate degree in Health Informatics. This project will help inform and educate the next generation of health informaticians. The larger health informatics community will benefit from the availability of a test-bed to advance information retrieval in this important area.</AbstractNarration>
