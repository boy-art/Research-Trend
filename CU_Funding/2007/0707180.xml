    <AbstractNarration>Bridges constitute one of the most important components of the highway infrastructure network in the United States. With nearly 600,000 bridges and culverts on highways ranging from multi-lane urban freeways to two-lane rural highways, the operation and functionality of the highway network greatly depends on the performance of these structures. Many initiatives towards improving bridge management have been undertaken, the latest being a program for long-term bridge performance (LTBP) incorporated in the recently approved highway. While the LTBP program provides funding and a general mechanism for effective management of bridges, the details of its thrust and its components are yet to be established. &lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of the proposed workshop is to bring together bridge owners, federal policy makers, researchers, national experts, and international experts in one physical location with the ultimate goal of formulating a roadmap for the future direction and activities of the long-term bridge performance program. A two-day meeting to be held in early 2007 is proposed. It is envisioned that at the conclusion of the workshop an insightful, thorough, and practical report is compiled that essentially captures all the key discussions and recommendations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop and the recommendations that will result from the workshops are of pivotal importance to the US highway bridge safety and economy. The collective wisdom of the workshop participants will set the trends and directions that FHWA, NSF, and state departments of transportation will follow in near and long terms with respect to research, field implementation, monitoring, assessment, decision process, and bridge management. Effective and visionary expenditure of the funds for the initial phase of the program could help facilitate the allocation of federal budget for future phases, with the end result being safer, more reliable, and more economical bridges that utilize the latest technologies.</AbstractNarration>
