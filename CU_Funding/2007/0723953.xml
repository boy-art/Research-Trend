    <AbstractNarration>The Effects of Formative Assessment in a Networked Classroom on Student Learning of Algebraic Concepts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will investigate the use of formative assessment in a networked classroom as it affects middle grades student learning of algebra concepts. The study will examine the effects of teachers using formative assessment with a system of networked technology and compare them to the effects of teachers using formative assessment without networked technology. The research will focus on student growth in achievement, the effective implementation of formative assessment practices and teacher and student attitudes toward the use of these practices. The project will explore the challenges of implementing formative assessments and research feasible ways for teachers to implement formative assessment strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed study involve measuring and comparing student achievement and describing and analyzing the implementation process. The project will conduct a two-group randomized study, with teachers as the unit of analysis. The study will use a full-treatment (X1) vs. partial-treatment (X2) design in Year 2 and a continued-treatment (X3) vs. full-treatment design (X1) in Year 3. In Year 2, Group A will be trained in both the TI Navigator and formative assessment, and Group B will be trained in formative assessment only. Teachers in each group will then implement the TI Navigator and/or the formative assessment in their classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on evolving research on formative assessment, the emerging technology of networked classrooms and best practices of reflective teaching that address the most difficult aspects of formative assessment identified in the research literature related to effective implementation. The study will explore a new way of using technology, investigate a feasible way of implementing formative assessment and closely track how teachers and students use formative assessments and what difficulties arise in the implementation process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact from this study will result from an analysis of the effectiveness of implementing formative assessment in a networked classroom. By advancing mathematics learning for all students, the potential for building the nation?s capacity in related fields increases. The proposed research will enhance the development of a research-based formative assessment technique employing hand-held technology as well as the aspects of professional development necessary for successful implementation.</AbstractNarration>
