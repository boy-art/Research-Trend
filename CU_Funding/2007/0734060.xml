    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. This project analyzes whether specific software interventions produce motivational and mathematics achievement gains for girls within real K12-level educational settings, at two crucial moments of girls? development of attitudes towards STEM, grades 5-6 and 10-11. Randomized controlled evaluations are used to analyze the impact of strategies that improve girls' and minorities' performance in mathematics and motivation to pursue mathematics coursework. The study uncovers empirically-supported guidelines for the design of math software that benefit girls' and minorities' motivation and achievement in mathematics. This research furthers research into computation techniques (intelligent agents/learning companions, user modeling and tools), educational psychology (rigorous analysis of the impact of interventions on motivation and self-efficacy, student characteristics and on-line instruction) and developmental psychology (gender differences across several ages).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The project provides Internet environments for students in poorly performing school districts and those who might be home-schooled as a result of a disability. It advances the understanding of students who find potential failure in math to be threatening (most often, females and students from traditionally under represented minority groups), promoting interest in mathematics among generally underrepresented students. It improves the quality of on-line courseware and reduces the barrier for entry to STEM. The project will produce instruction that is responsive to individuals, lays the groundwork for more innovative curricula and creates new understandings of the complexities of taught materials.</AbstractNarration>
