    <AbstractNarration>The California Academy of Sciences is offering an exciting opportunity for undergraduates to engage in research. The Academy houses collections that reflect interests in global biodiversity -- from the deep sea and coral reefs to the forests and mountains of tropical Asia. Starting each June, the Academy's Summer Systematics Institute will bring seven undergraduates to the California Academy of Sciences for an 8-week summer session that will provide participants with an excellent understanding of what are among the most important aspects of biology: the study of biodiversity and the evolutionary relationships among organisms. Each prospective intern will apply to work with an Academy scientist on a research project. Students will develop directed projects that provide them with an introduction to the problem, organisms to be studied, and aspects of data collection, interpretation, and dissemination as it relates to systematic biology. Successful applicants will participate in formal lectures, tours of the Academy's facilities, and research seminars. Each student will write up the project's results in the form of a scientific paper, and make an oral presentation to their peers. Recruitment is on a national level, with emphasis on candidates from groups under-represented in the sciences, particularly African-Americans, Native-Americans, and Latinos. Participants will receive a stipend, housing/subsistence allowance, and travel funds to and within San Francisco. Information on application procedures can be found at: http://www.calacademy.org/research/internship/ssi/. For specific inquiries about the program or the application, candidates can also contact the Curriculum Coordinator: Dr. Rich Mooi at rmooi@calacademy.org.</AbstractNarration>
