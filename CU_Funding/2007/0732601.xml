    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;OISE 0732601 Chen, Rowan University "International Planning Visit to China for Collaboration in Fracture Mechanics and Engineering Education" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will allow the PI and two U.S. graduate students to develop future collaborative research with the School of Mechanical and Power Engineering at East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST), Shanghai, China. The planning visit is scheduled for the mid-summer 2007. Objectives for the planning visit include familiarization with facilities and personnel, development of a research plan in fracture mechanics in metals, and planning for joint curriculum development and student exchange for research experiences. The PI is John Chen, Associate Professor at Rowan University, a primarily undergraduate serving institution. The counterpart organizer is WANG, Zhengdong in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at ECUST.</AbstractNarration>
