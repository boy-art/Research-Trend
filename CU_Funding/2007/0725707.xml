    <AbstractNarration>ECCS 0725707&lt;br/&gt;Keren Bergman, Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highly scalable and energy efficient interconnection networks are critical to the future performance of advanced computing systems. Photonic interconnection networks offer a potentially disruptive technology solution that can provide ultra-high throughput, minimal access latencies, and low power dissipation that remains independent of capacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: In this proposed program we aim to address the design and implementation of optical systems in broadband networks by coupling advancements in silicon nanophotonics with the tremendous capacity of optical data communications. The merging of these two fields offers an unparalleled opportunity in creating a new paradigm of truly optical domain integrated systems based on dynamic nanophotonic building blocks. In this proposed research program, core nanostructured photonic components ? consisting of fast and power efficient switch nodes and delay lines ? are realized to enable an integrated optical network for ultrahigh capacity data routing. The novel network architecture is specifically designed for nanoscale integration and implementation of truly end-to-end transparent lightwave paths for high capacity data communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Outreach: The proposed program tackles what is perhaps the most critical performance challenge to the future scaling of performance computing systems, namely the mounting communications infrastructure bottleneck. The insertion of a photonic interconnection network can fundamentally alter the performance and energy efficiency roadmap for future generations of computing systems. In terms of education, this interdisciplinary combination of networks and optical devices aspects will be introduced into revised and new undergraduate and graduate course sequences that emphasize and explore their physical- and logical-layer inter-dependences. The proposed program further offers a unique opportunity to train graduate students in a vertically integrated team-oriented research, with specific outreach on networks and optics to K-12 schools with high proportion of underrepresented minorities around the New York metropolitan area.</AbstractNarration>
