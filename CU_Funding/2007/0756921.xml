    <AbstractNarration>The University of Cincinnati's College of Engineering is increasing and retaining to completion the number of underrepresented students in engineering fields. The project is an outcome a NSF Bridges to Engineering Education (BEE) Planning Grant that held focus group meetings with teachers and administrators from 14 school districts and conducted secondary school and university student surveys. Based on the findings, an alliance was formed among UC engineering faculty and teachers and administrators from 18 school districts within a 100 km radius of Cincinnati to develop this project that targets the 159,623 students enrolled in these districts' public schools. The student population consists of about 41% minority and 49% female students, and about 29% of these students have indicated an interest in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is focusing on recruitment and retention. Included among the strategies being used are precollege activities, a summer institute for high school students, both six week and one week summer bridge programs, peer, corporate and faculty mentoring, supplemental instruction, and both summer and academic year undergraduate research opportunities. The first two activities listed are supported by non-NSF funds.</AbstractNarration>
