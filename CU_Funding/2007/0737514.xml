    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;This study is examining a strategy for improving the lifelong learning skills of engineering students, by improving their writing and critical thinking skills. Critical thinking in this project is defined to be reasonable, reflective thinking that is focused on deciding what to believe or do based on personal assessments of the authenticity, accuracy, and worth of knowledge claims and arguments. In this project, the impact of pairing skills courses (English) with content courses (in Engineering) is being explored for freshman engineering students. Clustering and pairing of classes is creating a type of learning community where the deliberate cross fertilization of ideas and assignments is teaching students how material is applied in a variety of contexts. This design is creating a venue for students to apply and test their skills as they learn them. The project is measuring improvements in their critical thinking skills throughout the year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This project is improving critical thinking skills of freshman students through structured writing assignments, increasing the retention of freshman students in engineering, and raising the level of freshman student learning of both engineering content knowledge and engineering practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work is the knowledge gained about the effectiveness of this approach and the likelihood that this model will guide other universities in instituting similar approaches to building critical thinking skills and improved knowledge of engineering during the freshman year. The project is focusing in particular on the effectiveness of this living and learning community on female engineering students.</AbstractNarration>
