    <AbstractNarration>The project focuses on the development of new methods and new strategies for the facile construction of complex molecules in the laboratory. The research is by design of practical nature, thus, it is conceivable that innovations from the work might find industrial applications, such as in fine-chemical or pharmaceutical product synthesis. A number of new transformations that form carbon-carbon, carbon-oxygen, and carbon-nitrogen bonds with absolute stereo-chemical control will be investigated. Molecular complexity will be developed rapidly and in ways that are subject to prediction. The complex products of the transformations hold great promise to function as useful new building blocks in chemical synthesis, with potential applications in many different areas of scientific and commercial enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Andrew G. Myers in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University. Dr. Myers will focus his work on developing synthetic methodology that can be applied to complex synthetic problems. The broader impact of the work is in the areas of pharmaceutical, agricultural and materials chemistry. Further, the project presents an excellent setting for the training of graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
