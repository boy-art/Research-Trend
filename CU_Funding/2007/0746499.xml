    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Conductive polymers have been widely used in organic electronic devices such as field-effect transistors (FETs) and photovoltaic devices (OPVs) where the polymer charge mobility and morphology play an important role in obtaining high device efficiency. With the support of this CAREER award, Professor Zhai's research group at University of Central Florida will 1) fabricate regiorecular poly(alkylthiophene)(rrPAT) ordered nanowire structures via perylene diimide ending group functionalization, 2) fabricate rrPAT nanocolumnar structures via a living polymerization from triphenylene, 3) build freestanding rrPAT nanofilms via the self-assembly of rrPATs with oligopeptides connected through photolabile links, 4) fabricate rrPAT/carbon nanotube composites by the dispersion of carbon nanotubes using various block copolymers comprised of rrPAT and nonconjugated polymer segments, and 5) study the electrical properties of rrPAT supramolecular structures and rrPAT/carbon nanotube composites. This research will bring about a deeper understanding of the relationship between molecular structures, solid assemblies and electrical properties, provide rational and predictable design rules for fabricating conductive polymer structures with desired properties for organic electronics, and realize efficient FETs and OPVs. This program will offer interdisciplinary research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students. It is critical that multidisciplinary training is expanded in our educational system to prepare future engineers and scientists for our society. A nanoscience and technology educational module will also be established at the NanoScience Technology Center at UCF that will introduce nanoscience to college and K-12 students as well as the general audience. Extra effort will be taken to reach minority and underrepresented groups through the educational module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Conductive polymers, i.e. plastics that can conduct electricity, have been proved to be very promising in replacing inorganic materials such as silicon in electronics. Polymers are light, flexible and ease to process, which allow for the fabrication of flexible electronic devices including large area flexible displays and solar cells. This CAREER award will support the research that will investigate how to increase the efficiency of organic electronics by building ordered polymeric structures. The success of the program will provide materials for low cost and efficient organic electronics that will have great impact on the economy. For example, the organic solar cells will greatly reduce the cost of solar energy which is the most important renewable energy. The research program involves multidisciplinary collaboration in nanoscience and technology and will provide interdisciplinary education and training for graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students. The education and outreaching activities include 1) developing a graduate/undergraduate course entitled "Organic Photovoltaics", 2) offering interdisciplinary research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, and 2) developing a nanoscience and technology educational module including a nanomuseum that will provide hands-on experience on nanoscience for college and K-12 students as well as the general audience.</AbstractNarration>
