    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0747178&lt;br/&gt;Xiuling Li, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to establish a new type of nanotechnology building block, III-V semiconductor nanotube, and its functionalities. The approach is (1) to use semiconductor nanotubes as individual building block for the channel material of field effect transistors; (2) to functionalize semiconductor nanotubes by incorporating active epitaxial device structures in the tubular frame for optical resonators; and (3) to explore their applications for compact and effective chemical and biological sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Semiconductor nanotubes open a new direction in III-V device physics and applications, by adding a degree of freedom, out-of-plane curvature. The top-down formation approach is expected to lead to large area integration. Results will advance the frontier of knowledge in semiconductor carrier transport, optical waveguiding, and strain engineering, and related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The versatile functionalities of this new class of nanotechnology building blocks will inevitably impact many other technology of emerging importance, including drug delivery, homeland security, fuel leak detection in automobiles and spacecraft, and pollution mission. By engaging students in this emerging field of research, the proposed activities will help ensure their competence and leadership in today?s global environment. By recruiting and retaining women engineers through creating and maintaining a sense of community and leading by example, the PI will make a long lasting effect on the world class, broadly inclusive science and technology workforce. An outreach program targeting elementary school girls will cultivate the young minds at the earliest possible stage to respect and embrace a career in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
