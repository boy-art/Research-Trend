    <AbstractNarration>Most existing wireless sensor systems and protocols are based on two-dimensional design, where all sensors are distributed in a two dimensional plane. This assumption is somewhat justified for applications where sensors are deployed on earth surface and where the height of the network is smaller than transmission radius of a sensor. However, 2D assumption may no longer be valid if a sensor network is deployed in space, atmosphere, or ocean, where nodes of a network are distributed over a 3D space and the differences in the third dimension is too large to ignore. This project focuses on designing novel geometric approaches to solve various topology control and position-based routing problems in 3D sensor networks. Although many geometric topology control protocols and position-based protocols have been studied in 2D sensor networks, the design of 3D networks is surprisingly more difficult than the design in 2D. Many properties of the network require additional computational complexity, and a number of problems cannot be solved by extensions or generalizations of 2D methods. Facing up with these challenges, this project seeks to study new geometric approaches for 3D sensor networks. The expected results include: (1) various localized algorithms to efficiently construct 3D geometric topologies in order to maintain network connectivity, conserve energy and enable energy efficient routing; (2) new 3D position-based routing methods which can guarantee the delivery of packets or the power efficiency of their routes; (3) integrated 3D geometric approaches to address the joint design of topology and routing where these two issues are strongly coupled and fundamentally influenced by geometry.</AbstractNarration>
