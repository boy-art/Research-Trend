    <AbstractNarration>The project focuses on the asymmetric hydrogenation of unfunctionalized alkenes. There are two specific aims. One is to use asymmetric hydrogenation of largely unfunctionalized alkenes to prepare widespread fragments in chiral, acyclic molecules and the other is to optimize and refine the optically active carbene oxazoline catalyst developed previously to facilitate enantioselective hydrogenation of a more diverse set of largely unfunctionalized alkenes. These studies will be applied to form all stereochemical permutations of difunctionalized chirons that correspond to some of the most fundamental building blocks in chiral, acyclic molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kevin Burgess in the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University. Professor Burgess will focus his work on the development of methodology for the asymmetric hydrogenation of unfunctionalized alkenes. A great range of genuinely useful chiral building blocks will be prepared. The work has the potential for broader impact in the pharmaceutical industry and the project serves as an excellent venue for the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>
