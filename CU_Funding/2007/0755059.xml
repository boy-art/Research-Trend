    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded by the Divisions of Biological Infrastructure and Earth Sciences at NSF. This interdisciplinary REU Site Program at the Sevilleta LTER in central New Mexico will train ten undergraduate students who will conduct independent research under the guidance of UNM faculty in Biology and Earth and Planetary Sciences. The summer program includes a seminar series, a journal club, an annual symposium, professional development workshops, ethics training, and fieldtrips. Students will conduct independent research at the Sevilleta, and present results at the annual research symposium. They will also attend a weekly seminar and journal club, and interact with visiting scientists. The program includes faculty in ecology, the geosciences, and meteorology. The LTER site provides a venue for close interactions among students, faculty, and graduate students. Students will have numerous opportunities to share ideas and explore issues within and across disciplines. A goal is to increase the number of students, particularly underrepresented minorities, pursuing careers in bio-geosciences. The program will provide exposure to a large, multidisciplinary research program, inspire students to continue into professional careers, and prepare students for the rigors of graduate school, professional research, and responsible citizenship. The program exemplifies the integration of research and education. As students conduct research, they will learn how to be a scientist, along with many technical, methodological and ethical issues that arise in scientific research. More information about the Program can be found by visiting http://sev.lternet.edu/REU or contacting the PI, Dr. Scott Collins (scollins@sevilleta.unm.edu) or the REU project manager (jjohnson@sevilleta.unm.edu).</AbstractNarration>
