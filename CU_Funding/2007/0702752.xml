    <AbstractNarration>GOALI: Dynamics and Manipulation of Logic States in Coupled Nanomagnetic Arrays&lt;br/&gt;Dmitri Litvinov&lt;br/&gt;The objective in this research is to study the dynamic properties of the logic gates and data channels based on networks of interacting nanomagnetic cells. Among the projected properties of magnetic cellular logic are high integration density, high speed, room temperature operation, low power consumption, and, significantly, the resistance to ionizing radiation and electromagnetic shock waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will constitute the first dynamics study of logic state propagation in magnetic cellular networks. It will contribute to the understanding of signal propagation in coupled nanomagnetic arrays and the interplay between energy dissipation and statistical variations in geometry and materials properties. Utilizing crystalline magnetic anisotropy of advanced materials instead of shape anisotropy to define the states of the cells will open a route to efficient device scalability down to a superparamagnetic limit near 2-3 nm. Furthermore, moving from the sub-micron regime, the proposed research will be the first to enable cells of a size that could be inserted near the end of the semiconductor technology roadmap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this research is to contribute to the understanding of the dynamics phenomena in magnetostatically coupled arrays that are of direct relevance to magnetic data storage and magnetic random access memory. The long-term potential of this work, the development of integrated magnetic computing systems, could foster significant advances in information processing rivaling, if not surpassing, the integrated circuit revolution of the past half-century. The students involved in the program will be at the forefront of a fascinating scientific field with broad industrial potential.</AbstractNarration>
