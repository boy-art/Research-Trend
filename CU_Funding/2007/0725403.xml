    <AbstractNarration>With the advancement in nanomechanics and nanotechnology, a new generation of smart materials, sensors and devices are being developed in the recent years. To promote the international collaboration in this important arena, the objective of this award is to provide the travel support for a group of US researchers and educators to participate in the International Conference on Smart Materials and Nanotechnology (SMN2007), which will be held in Harbin, China, during 1st - 4th July, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SMN2007 consists of sessions in different topics related to smart materials and nanotechnology, such as shape-memory alloys and polymer, electro-active polymer, piezo-materials, electro and magneto restrictive materials, fiber optic sensors, and so on. Both invited and contributed papers will be published in the conference proceedings. Selected papers will be published as a special volume in an international journal after a peer-review process. Hence, the proposal could promote the international collaboration and make an immediate contribution to the progress of nano science and engineering related to mechanics, materials and sensors by disseminating the new findings and integrating different team efforts among active researchers and educators in the world. A direct outcome from SMN2007 is that institutions, researchers and infrastructure in the world could be identified with capabilities to advancing nano science and engineering. A special effort is made to invite speakers from the groups underrepresented in science and engineering. Thus, the research travel support would have an international impact on developing complementary approaches that are mutually beneficial, and accessible to the whole community.</AbstractNarration>
