    <AbstractNarration>Through this award, Dr. Browne will investigate the intriguing and important, question of how phenotypes (physical characteristics) are linked to genotypes (genetic characteristics). The most successful group of animals in earth's history has been the arthropods. Arthropods dominate, and play key ecological roles, in our seas, land, and air and thus arthropods are particularly well suited for asking how phenotype and genotype are connected. The experiments proposed by Dr. Browne are focused on understanding the unique development of the head in the arthropod, Parhyale hawaiensi. He will address the phenotype/genotype link by employing a multidisciplinary approach combining techniques from developmental and evolutionary biology, and molecular genetics. Histological techniques will be used to investigate and describe the morphology and neuroanatomy of the head and will allow comparative analyses among various arthropods and serve as an important foundation for the interpretation of molecular experiments. He will then use gene knockdown, gene overexpression, and transgenesis techniques to determine the expression and function of two genes critical to the embryonic development of the head, brain, and eye in P. hawaiensis, Ph orthodenticle1 (Photd1) and Ph rhodopsin1 (Phrh1). Altering Photd1 gene expression, combined with the detailed analysis of the regulation of Photd1 and Phrh1, will provide information concerning the role of Photd1 in organizing early head development and the potential interaction between Photd1 and Phrh1 genes in the later development of the eye. This work in a non-insect arthropod, will enhance general knowledge of the molecular basis for biological diversity and provide information regarding arthropod nervous system ontogeny. It will further develop reagents and methodologies for the use of P. hawaiensis as a model system for understanding the evolution of developmental systems. As part of his work Dr. Browne will recruit, mentor and train underrepresented minority scientists in the fields of evolution, development, and neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>
