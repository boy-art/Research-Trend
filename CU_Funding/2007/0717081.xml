    <AbstractNarration>The creative digital media exhibition Speculative Data and the Creative Imaginary:&lt;br/&gt;shared innovative visions between art and technology will be held at the National&lt;br/&gt;Academy of Sciences Gallery in Washington D.C., June 3 to August 24, 2007, as part of&lt;br/&gt;the program for the Association for Computer Machinery (ACM) Creativity and Cognition&lt;br/&gt;Conference, to be held June 13 to 15, 2007 in Washington D.C.. The exhibition will be&lt;br/&gt;open for almost 3 months and in the summer, allowing ample time for adult, children,&lt;br/&gt;and tourist visitors to view and interact with the exhibits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit in this exhibition lies in the collection and dissemination of digital&lt;br/&gt;media projects that illustrate premises that information technology (IT) is forming a&lt;br/&gt;powerful alliance with creative practices in the arts and design to establish the exciting&lt;br/&gt;new domain of information technology and creative practices (ITCP)set&lt;br/&gt;forth in the 2003 National Research Council experts meeting and report Beyond&lt;br/&gt;productivity: Information Technology, Innovation and Creativity and the Rockefeller&lt;br/&gt;Foundation report New Media Arts | New Funding Models, (Mitchell, Inouye, and&lt;br/&gt;Blumenthal, 2003; Jennings, 2000) Creative digital media works to be presented&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate the contemporary practice of the merging of the creative practitioner and&lt;br/&gt;the engineer - sometimes as a single person and other times as interdisciplinary teams&lt;br/&gt;that exhibition participant Donna Cox, Director of Visualization from the National Center&lt;br/&gt;of Supercomputing Application, calls renaissance teams. The term renaissance team is&lt;br/&gt;descriptive of the CISE CreativeIT focus in supporting research that is done with groups&lt;br/&gt;of people from different backgrounds in which the creative synergy is focused on a&lt;br/&gt;specific context, problem, or perceived need resulting in new products, models, and&lt;br/&gt;areas of research that transcend discipline specific methods of inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this exhibition is in having the exhibits available in a public space&lt;br/&gt;for children and adults to visit and interact with.</AbstractNarration>
