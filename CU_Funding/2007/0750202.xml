    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase II project will develop and deliver a software media architecture that removes a critical barrier to the widespread use of multi-projector, high-resolution, ultra definition displays. The approach defines a set of layered abstractions from the low-level display driver to higher-level protocols including multi-user display use and security. This model is the bedrock of a new display architecture that will not constrain future display innovations, allow content developers and producers to communicate to current and future display systems, and acts to isolate the underlying complexities of new display technologies from users. Building on this new architecture, the Phase II project will implement a software-based Display Operating System. The project is motivated by the perception that we will soon live in a world where displays cease to be individual discreet devices but rather become an extension of our environment; a limitless fabric of pixels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential impact of this innovation is significant, by removing the usability and cost barriers normally associated with ultrahigh-resolution displays, applications once available to only a select few can become commonplace. This has the potential to change the advanced visualization, media interaction models, as well as the way in which we interact with our computational environments.</AbstractNarration>
