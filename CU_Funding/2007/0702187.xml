    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to explore, both experimentally and theoretically, new concepts related to the propagation of optical waves in periodic arrays of optical waveguides. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: We are all aware of the historically extraordinary difference in behavior between a single atom and the collective behavior of a periodic array of atoms that are organized to form a solid. Interestingly, today we have a similar opportunity to study and perhaps to engineer the corresponding difference in optical behavior between a single waveguide and the extraordinary collective behavior of an array of waveguides. For example, our study of small deviations from periodicity of a waveguide array will allow us to better assess and take advantage of the role of defects in both linear and nonlinear periodic structures. In addition, we are always looking for way to control and to minimize diffraction effects, especially losses, and our investigation will further our understanding and perhaps more importantly, the management of diffraction in periodic waveguide arrays. Finally, our proposal also includes exploring the inclusion of quantum dots in waveguide array structures and therefore offers an exciting way to enhance their nonlinear behavior and open new applications. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: All of the proposed research topics challenge basic fundamental questions with some having direct implications in other fields beyond optics. Moreover, we also propose an outreach effort that brings hands-on inquiry based lessons in optics to K-12 science education and attracts under-represented students into optical sciences and engineering. Finally, add to this picture our students designing waveguides, fabricating them, and analyzing them. This is an educational experience that spans the range from basic optical science to operating devices - a beautiful way to learn many old and new concepts in optical engineering.</AbstractNarration>
