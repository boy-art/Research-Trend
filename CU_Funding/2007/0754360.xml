    <AbstractNarration>This award is to support the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. The objectives of this REU site are: (1) to introduce undergraduate physics majors to the excitement of physics research, (2) to train these students in the laboratory skills needed in modern physics research, (3) to foster student personal growth by having the students work in teams and by teaching them the ethical dimension of scientific research, and (4) to promote diversity in the field of physics by encouraging applicants and participants from under-represented groups. The Idaho physics faculty will design research projects that are challenging yet viable. Both theoretical and experimental projects will be made available. The students will be encouraged to work in small groups to foster teamwork skills. Weekly meetings will be held to allow the students to interact and to keep each other posted on their progress. The REU students will interact with Idaho faculty, research staff personnel, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduates. Supplementary activities will include weekly lunch together with faculty and weekend activities that revolve around the tremendous outdoor experiences available in Idaho. The program will conclude with REU student research presentations.</AbstractNarration>
