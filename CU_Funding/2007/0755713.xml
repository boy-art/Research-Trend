    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0755713&lt;br/&gt;Lempert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-pressure non-equilibrium plasmas form the basis of many practical technologies including plasma television displays and other lighting sources, semiconductor manufacturing processes, and processes for hazardous waste mitigation. In the last three to five years, new potential applications have been proposed for non-equilibrium plasmas in the area of combustion, including strategies for reduction in pollutant emissions, improved-efficiency fuel synthesis, and high-speed ignition and flame holding. While an array of non-equilibrium plasma combustion-related phenomena have been observed, the ability to predict the effectiveness of potential new processes and systems has lagged due to a distinct lack of fundamental kinetic data in this field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is an integrated experimental / modeling study of hydrocarbon oxidation mechanisms in plasmas under conditions of extreme thermal non-equilibrium. Large, highly non-equilibrium pools of important hydrocarbon combustion intermediates and electronically excited air species will be created in a short pulsed fuel-air plasma, created using specialized discharge technology available at Ohio State University. The time evolution of critical species will be measured experimentally using advanced laser-based optical diagnostic methods and then compared to theoretical predictions in order to validate and improve fundamental plasma kinetic models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major benefit to society will be to advance a truly different ignition methodology that improves combustion engine technology. Furthermore, the combination of experiment and analysis provides excellent opportunities for teaching, learning, and training. As a result of this grant, one team member will incorporate a module on plasma aerodynamics, including plasma combustion, into his undergraduate fluids curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
