    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports Prof. Anthony Lagalante and his group at Villanova University for research to devise and test sensitive new methods to detect and quantitate polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants in automobile interior dust. The research goals are 1) to develop and promote the use of environmentally-friendly techniques for the extraction of PBDEs from automobile dust using supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, and solid-phase microextraction; 2) to develop new sensitive and selective methods for PBDE quantitation using photospray-tandem mass spectrometry (APPI/MS/MS) and 3) to examine automotive variables for statistical linkages to human PBDE levels and degradation pathways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves collaborative effort between Villanova University students and scientists from the Analytical Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Students gain proficiency developing advanced extraction techniques and a range of experience with gas and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection. The research trains future scientists from Villanova University and while developing new methods and data on PBDEs that will have far-reaching consequences in solvent extraction, automotive design, and human toxicology.</AbstractNarration>
