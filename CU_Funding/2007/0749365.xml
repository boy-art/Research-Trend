    <AbstractNarration>The Ecological Society of America's project, Strategies for Ecology Education, Development and Sustainability (SEEDS), is designed to increase the participation of underrepresented undergraduate students in the ecological sciences. Annually, the project allows up to 60 students to participate in two intensive field trips lasting 4-7 days, and a SEEDS leadership meeting. At least one of the field trips will be at an NSF supported Long-Term Ecological Research site. These activities together offer opportunities for students to be exposed to high level field research, as well as to develop practical leadership and project development skills. SEEDS research fellows are also supported to present their preliminary research results at annual leadership meetings. Additionally, SEEDS will develop a program to inform and refer underrepresented students to available principal investigators who obtain REU supplements from NSFs Division of Environmental Biology. The Society will work with program officers in the Division to develop this strategy, which will include listings and searchable databases of REU supplemental opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exposure to ecological research and subsequent research experience is vital for undergraduates in their decision to pursue a career in science. PIs of the Division?s REU supplements face a major challenge in recruiting underrepresented students. This project will increase the awareness and participation of underrepresented students in ecological research opportunities. Through follow-up SEEDS support, the project will enhance the experience of mentoring among PIs and nurture more students along the ecological career pathway. Over time, SEEDS program activities will foster a more diverse scientific community within environmental biology and help increase the diversity of perspectives and ideas.</AbstractNarration>
