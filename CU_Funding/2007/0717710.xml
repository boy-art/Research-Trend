    <AbstractNarration>Proteins containing inorganic prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur are called [Fe-S] proteins and they have a wide variety of functions in essential biological processes. Among these are included electron transfer, substrate activation, catalysis and environmental sensing. In vitro evidence has been obtained to support the hypothesis that [Fe-S] clusters used to activate [Fe-S] proteins are pre-formed on assembly scaffolds. The current project is concerned with dissecting the in vivo details of bacterial [Fe-S] protein maturation and is designed to achieve the folowing objectives. Biophysical characterization of [Fe-S] clusters that are assembled on scaffold proteins in vivo. Biophysical, structural and genetic analysis of [Fe-S] cluster assembly complexes that are produced in vivo and contain trapped forms of [Fe-S] clusters. Identification and purification of bacterial components that can contribute to the effective catalytic maturation of [Fe-S] proteins. It also provides young students with wonderful opportunities to learn how to conduct science and training in modern molecular biology.</AbstractNarration>
