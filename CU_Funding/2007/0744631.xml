    <AbstractNarration>The ultimate goal of this research is to develop models to predict the structure of RNA molecules from their sequence. Many defects in cellular processes are mediated through RNA, and the ability to predict their structure will lead to the rational design of drugs. The specific aim of this research is to characterize the thermodynamic stability of RNA duplexes containing bulge and hairpin loops. These studies will combine both thermodynamic and structural characterization of the RNA duplexes to achieve a better understanding of the nature of RNA loops. RNAs are intimately involved in a wide variety of biological activities. During the process of gene expression, they serve as both the informational molecules and as part of the decoding machinery. Biological molecules, including RNA, must fold into the correct three-dimensional shape to acquire their active-functional form. The ability to predict RNA structure from sequence will improve our understanding of RNA and its biological role. Undergraduate students will perform all of the investigations, including the selection of sequences to be investigated, providing them with excellent training and valuable research experience. This work will be disseminated both as published manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific meetings including regional and national ACS meetings.</AbstractNarration>
