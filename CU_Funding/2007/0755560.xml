    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Biological Sciences at the University of Montana is offering an 8-week summer REU program for eight undergraduate students, including incoming freshmen. Students with an interest in environmental biology will be recruited. Students will be matched with a mentor based on their interests and will conduct an original hands-on research in one of the areas offered in the program, which include microbial ecology, plant ecology, and ecological and evolutionary genetics. Student projects will be designed to help REU participants develop their research skills and independence, as well as enhance their knowledge in a specific area of environmental biology. Students will gain experience in many aspects of scientific research, including formulating questions and hypotheses; designing experiments; analyzing data; writing a paper, and communicating research results. Students will also participate in workshops to develop additional research-related skills, to learn about career options in environmental biology, and to learn how research findings are applied in areas such as ecology of disease, habitat restoration, wildlife management, forest management, and invasive species management. Students will also have the opportunity to share their experience in group meetings and to develop a sense of scientific community. Applications from graduating high school seniors and from Native American students are encouraged. More information is available at http://reu.dbs.umt.edu or by contacting Bill Holben at bill.holben@mso.umt.edu, or (406) 243-6163.</AbstractNarration>
