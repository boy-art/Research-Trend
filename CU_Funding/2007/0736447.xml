    <AbstractNarration>A planning meeting will be held to determine if a new multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Health Organization Transformation will be established at Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Minnesota. The proposed center applies and refines a comprehensive transformation framework that will guide, research, and advance organization transformation in health systems, especially hospitals, clinics, and physician groups. With its industry partners, the center will conduct research on the execution of research on transformational interventions and strategies described below that combine evidence-based management and clinical innovations and ongoing organizational learning and cultural change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will contribute significantly to the efficiency and quality of care offered by industry partners as a result of more effective implementation of transformation strategies and interventions. It will help the participating health systems and larger health industry to meet consensus aims for heal care established by the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine and to more effectively use organizational technologies to meet increased demands for accountability and to be viewed as an economic driver and service leader and not as a drain on the larger economy.</AbstractNarration>
