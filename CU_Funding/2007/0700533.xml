    <AbstractNarration>This project supports research by Buss and his graduate students on&lt;br/&gt;computational complexity, proof complexity, algorithms, and&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods. Buss investigates proof theory and proof&lt;br/&gt;complexity, especially aspects that are closely connected to open&lt;br/&gt;problems in computational complexity including the P versus NP&lt;br/&gt;problem. The relevant proof systems include bounded arithmetics,&lt;br/&gt;which are first-order theories tailored to have logical strength&lt;br/&gt;related to feasible computability, and propositional proof systems,&lt;br/&gt;which have rich connections to bounded arithmetic and circuit&lt;br/&gt;complexity. Buss will work to establish lower bounds on proof&lt;br/&gt;complexity based on complexity assumptions such as the existence of&lt;br/&gt;provably secure cryptographic systems. He will work to prove new&lt;br/&gt;independence results and separation results for weak proof systems.&lt;br/&gt;He will investigate what kinds of computational content can be&lt;br/&gt;extracted from proofs. Buss will investigate the proof complexity of&lt;br/&gt;propositional systems such as Frege systems, cutting planes systems,&lt;br/&gt;Nullstellensatz proof systems, counting axioms, the polynomial&lt;br/&gt;calculus, and intuitionistic proof systems. Buss also works on&lt;br/&gt;numerical and geometric algorithms arising from computer graphics.&lt;br/&gt;He will work on simulation methods for rigid multibodies using&lt;br/&gt;higher-order approximation methods over manifolds, on symplectic&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and other energy-conserving algorithms for physical&lt;br/&gt;simulations, and on collision response algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project supports research by Buss and his students on problems&lt;br/&gt;that le at the interface between mathematics and computer science,&lt;br/&gt;as motivated by open questions concerning the fundamental limits of&lt;br/&gt;computation. These open questions include the P versus NP problem,&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical feasibility of secure cryptographic coding, and the&lt;br/&gt;optimality of particular algorithms and circuits for solving&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial problems. Busss addresses these questions by&lt;br/&gt;investigating computational complexity and proof complexity. The&lt;br/&gt;project studies questions about the tradeoffs between the strength&lt;br/&gt;of a formal proof system and the size of optimal proofs. Good bounds&lt;br/&gt;on proof complexity are closely related to upper and lower bounds on&lt;br/&gt;the hardness of computation, as well as to the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;underpinnings of cryptography. The project also supports Buss's&lt;br/&gt;work on algorithms for simulation of dynamical systems</AbstractNarration>
