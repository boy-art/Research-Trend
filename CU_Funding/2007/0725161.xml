    <AbstractNarration>Sexual differentiation is the process by which hormones act to organize the developing body, including the brain, into male or female patterns. This process is proposed to occur by the action of steroid hormones, acting via receptors (such as the estrogen receptor), secreted by the gonads early in development. This research uses the Australian zebra finch (ZF; Taeniopygia guttata) to explore how hormones, such as estrogen, initiate different patterns of development in male and female brains. Songbirds, such as the ZF, have highly sexually dimorphic brains and behaviors. Males sing a courtship song females cannot sing and the brain regions controlling song are larger in the male brain. Recent research suggests that co-activator proteins are one possible mechanism through which steroids initiate differences in the brain. Co-activators greatly enhance the function of steroid receptors. The current project will use various techniques to examine if the amount and location of four estrogen receptor co-activator proteins are present at different levels in male and female ZF brain. Understanding the processes by which co-activator proteins influence steroid receptor function will add an important element to this field. This research will clarify how neuronal sex differences develop in all vertebrates and will provide a foundation for interpreting neuronal and behavioral sex differences across development. In addition, this work will promote the training of undergraduate and graduate students through the participation of students, in particular underrepresented groups, in this research. The training of students will enhance the infrastructure for education and research at GSU. Another important goal of this project is to increase the science knowledge of K-12 teachers and thus enhance the science learning and achievement of their students. This will be achieved by conducting a series of scientifically intensive hands-on teacher workshops. The research proposed in this application will serve as the basis for presenting material on animal behavior, neurobiology, and molecular biology with all information presented to the teachers based on the National Science Standards.</AbstractNarration>
