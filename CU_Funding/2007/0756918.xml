    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to increase the number of students in the Division of Science and Mathematics who receive baccalaureate degrees by increasing retention. Over 30% of Morehouse students major in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines; however, only 20-25% of the students who begin majors in STEM disciplines graduate with a STEM degree. Retention is being increased by: 1) Identifying at-risk students in their freshman year and then providing these students with skills that are necessary to overcome stumbling blocks in the majors. Skills such as quantitative literacy and critical thinking as well as academic and personal future building skills form the basis of a three-semester Scientific Literacy course designed for STEM majors; 2) Providing a comprehensive support program within the Division of Science and Mathematics that includes student intervention, cohort collaboration, automated systems for intervention, academic support and undergraduate student research opportunities, as well as faculty training; and 3) Establishing an environment in which students discover the value of team learning, thereby creating a culture at Morehouse that supports collaborative learning. Peer Led Team Learning already has been implemented in introductory gatekeeper courses throughout the Division of Science and Mathematics. To enhance and support a growing culture of team learning, peer leaders for key upper level courses in the Division are being added, and numerous workshops such as the Pedagogy of Team Learning and Study Skills are being offered to students. These provide continuing support for students who have matriculated beyond the first two years in their major and thus further support the goal of creating a culture of team learning.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The process for creating a collaborative/team learning culture among African American male students throughout an entire Division of Science and Mathematics is being investigated. The components that affect behavioral change in student study habits from independent to collaborative learners are being assessed. Components that are being evaluated include the impact of teaching the pedagogy of team learning to students, peer led team learning, team supplemental instruction, automated tracking of at-risk students and intervention programs designed around peer study groups. In addition, continuing studies are being conducted on predicting student success and the behavioral norms of successful and unsuccessful students as indicated by the Birkman Assessment instrument. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The activities of this project are broadening the participation of underrepresented African-American males in the STEM workforce by increasing the graduation rates at Morehouse College. The efforts of this project are expected to result in a model for enhancing retention by developing a culture of team learners that can be used to decrease attrition at other Historically Black Colleges and Universities and majority institutions. Morehouse is a founding member of the Atlanta University Center (AUC), a consortium of six independent institutions forming the largest private center of African American higher education in the world. Advancements made in one institution often impact the entire Center. The development of a Cyber Village is having a broad impact on the College's infrastructure as well as the AUC by facilitating networking among cohorts and departments, encouraging student participation in summer and academic year research, and expanding student participation in scientific meetings. Dissemination is occurring through posters and presentations at local and national meetings, a web site presence, and articles in newsletter and campus publications and in peer reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
