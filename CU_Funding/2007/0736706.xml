    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project is giving students a greater understanding of spectroscopy, chemical identification and its application to real problems. The project is incorporating X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy into many areas of the curriculum, including history, art, core courses, in-service education courses, and chemistry courses by focusing on hands-on laboratory experiences for students. Exposure to the instrument is broad, affecting chemistry, history, and art majors, in-service middle and high school teachers, as well as non-science majors. Many experiments have applications to the career interests of students in the areas of historical numismatics, art restoration, forensics, environmental chemistry, nanotechnology, and process control. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project stands on the premise that the infusion of new technology into laboratory and course settings produces a more scientifically literate public. Experiments are designed to give students both hands-on exposure and theoretical background information. This approach allows non-science students to benefit from exposure to this technique in an experiential setting to see how scientists solve analysis problems. Chemistry majors are being exposed to an exciting technique that is widely used in industry as well as many expanded and novel areas of research. This project interfaces nicely with recent nanotechnology initiatives undertaken at the institution, and allows for additional, continued and broad based nanotechnology infusion into courses such as analytical, inorganic, and physical chemistry, geology, and undergraduate research. Results from this study are being disseminated to the public via adaptation, implementation, and publication of experiments throughout the scientific and non-scientific community. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project increases the understanding of XRF and its applications to scientific problems across a broad range of science and non-science experiences. Students are being provided with opportunities to be involved with an interdisciplinary program that brings together disciplines that do not have a history of collaborating on curriculum and laboratory improvements. The project allows for significant interdisciplinary interactions in the community, including history-chemistry-art projects as well as reaching into the local school system by interacting with in-service middle and high school teachers. This interdisciplinary interaction can serve as a model for the collaboration between science and non-science departments at other universities. The institution is committed to quality education for all segments of the population. Of the chemistry program's 15 majors per year, 57% are female and 23% are African-American. A further impact on society is through increased understanding of the role of spectroscopy in identifying and solving real problems. This is achieved in this project by showcasing the use of XRF spectroscopy across the institution within science and non-science settings, culminating in a public symposium elucidating the impact of XRF on the community.</AbstractNarration>
