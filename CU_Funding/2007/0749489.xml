    <AbstractNarration>In this research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professors Buratto, Bowers, and Metiu and their groups will prepare, characterize, and test three new types of nanoscale catalysts, having one feature in common: very small, isolated, well-defined, catalytically active sites. They will prepare and study (a) very small Aun and Agn mass-selected clusters supported on oxide, (b) very small mass-selected, binary clusters such as PdmAun supported on oxides, and (c) very small, mass-selected oxide clusters supported on oxides. A variety of techniques will be used, in a concerted manner, to study these important catalytic processes: model catalytic systems will be prepared by depositing mass-selected clusters on oxide surfaces to ensure atom-by-atom control of catalyst size; all samples will be prepared and studied in ultra-high vacuum by surface science techniques (AES, XPS) as well as by STM/ AFM before, during and after the catalytic chemistry; and density functional theory (DFT) will be used to calculate the structure of the clusters, their XPS spectrum and their chemical activity. Through the work proposed here they will develop a detailed understanding of the catalytic chemistry of these materials and find out how this chemistry depends on size, composition and the nature of the substrate. While the focus of the research is on the catalytic activity of specific nanoscale catalysts, there is a high probability that the results will be applicable to other systems. In addition, it is hoped that the concepts developed through this research will help optimize important industrial processes using these nanoscale catalysts and provide insight into the discovery of new nanoscale catalytic materials.&lt;br/&gt;The research funded by this grant will be interdisciplinary. Graduate students will interact continuously with three different research groups, will have daily contact with other outstanding scientists, and will acquire hands-on experience in a large number of techniques of surface science, gas-phase chemistry, scanned probe microscopy, and high level theory. The research will provide a valuable opportunity for graduate education, found in very few places in the world. Researchers supported by this grant (including PIs) will also be active in outreach to K-12 schools in the Santa Barbara area to present a tutorial on an atomistic view of heterogeneous catalysis and to show an atomically-resolved picture of our model catalyst systems. This will be included in the currently active outreach program in the chemistry department at UCSB. A series of lectures on catalysis by nanostructures will be developed and included as part of a course in nanoscience currently taught in the materials chemistry curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
