    <AbstractNarration>SciTube.tv. is a project to provide a new venue for the dissemination and sharing of scientific information. Initially, in collaboration with the Public Library of Science (PLoS; www.plos.org), SciTube.tv is providing a Web resource for authors to upload a video clip linked with a paper published in a PLoS journal. The video clip will include a voice commentary, a pictorial stream of the presenter, a PowerPoint presentation, as well as links between the video presentation and the journal article. SciTube.tv presentations provide an intermediate level of detail between a typical abstract of a scientific paper and the full paper. SciTube.tv will appeal particulary to the new generation of scientists conversant with the video technologies prevalent in today's popular culture. The technical aspects for this resource are being provided by the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC; www.sdsc.edu) by way of their Cyberinfrastructure Channel technology (www.cichannel.org).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key goal of this exploratory project, SciTube.tv, is to evaluate the acceptance both of authors uploading video clips and viewers watching those clips. The evaluation will consider both the length and type of format and, for each, whether the viewer has a rewarding viewing experience that increases their comprehension of the material being presented over conventional scientific journal articles. Additionally, SciTube.tv provides a rating system and the opportunity for virtual communities to gather around a particular "videopaper" through which a discourse can take place. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will inform future implementation efforts which are expected to include extending the scope of authors beyond PLoS journals to develop a large video archive of scientific content, making this content available under a creative commons license framework to maximize reuse, and developing unique capabilities for searching. Additional ideas under consideration include enabling laboratories to have their own SciTube.tv channel where they can store protocols, educational video materials and so on, and provision of educational materials, simulations etc. for use by the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of an accessible and robust video resource can have very broad impact in enabling new means for disseminating scientific information and promoting collaboration, in developing new paradigms for education, and in communicating the excitement and promise of science to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
