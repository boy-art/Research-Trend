    <AbstractNarration>The five undergraduate Claremont Colleges: Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd, Pitzer, Pomona, and Scripps Colleges, will jointly sponsor a Research Experience for Undergraduate Site each summer 2009, 2010, 2011. The Claremont Colleges have a strong tradition of engaging undergraduates in research, and in addition, during the grant we will also be actively coordinating with a summer research program at the Claremont Graduate University. The objective of the REU project is to give undergraduate mathematics majors experience in the intellectual life of a working mathematician, with particular emphasis on individual, concentrated research as well as exposure to the math community and additional scholarly activities. During each summer, ten students will work closely with three Claremont faculty for a period of eight weeks. Students will work in teams of three or more on original research projects in various areas of mathematics. In addition to the intense work with their faculty supervisor and with members of their research group, students will participate in other mathematical and social activities. These activities will provide opportunities to interact with additional Claremont faculty and other, non-REU, Claremont students involved in summer mathematics research. Participants will attend workshops throughout the summer to learn skills needed to conduct mathematical research (e.g., using TeX and mathematical software, using bibliographic databases, giving oral presentations, applying to and preparing for graduate school, etc.). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are especially interested in recruiting students who are not typically represented in mathematics and for whom this experience could be the deciding factor in choosing a career in mathematics. Special efforts will be made to include women, underrepresented minorities, person with disabilities, and students coming from institutions where research opportunities are limited.</AbstractNarration>
