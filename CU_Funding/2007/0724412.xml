    <AbstractNarration>In association with recent climatic warming in interior Alaska, water bodies in some wetland regions are drying, while other regions are becoming wetter. The goal of this project is to create a replicated field experiment that quantifies climate controls on carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in Alaskan wetlands. In multiple sites, plots will be established that include control, drainage and flooded water table treatments. Within these treatments, replicate open top chambers will be used to locally increase soil temperatures. Fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane will be measured regularly on these plots. Models will be used as tools to understand the dynamics and mechanisms underlying greenhouse gas responses from high latitude wetlands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global warming is affecting much of the boreal forest region, a region which contains 1/3 of the world's soil carbon, much of it stored in wetlands. This study will improve the ability to quantify how responses of greenhouse gases in Alaskan wetlands may enhance or mitigate future climate warming. The Alaska Peatland Experiment will continue to provide a valuable venue for graduate and undergraduate training in field research in northern ecosystems. An interactive website (http:///www.apex.msu.edu) will provide an accessible resource for teachers, researchers and children as well as data exchange among researchers and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
