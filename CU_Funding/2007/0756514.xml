    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a program of research and education in computational physics at Bowdoin College, a highly selective undergraduate institution located in Brunswick, Maine. The supported research, in the areas of gravitational wave source simulations (numerical relativity) and computational astrophysics, provides opportunities for undergraduate students to participate. The research goals, involving numerical simulations of neutron stars and black holes in binary orbit, are primarily motivated by the prospect of detecting gravitational radiation from such objects with the new generation of gravitational wave laser interferometers, including the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO.) To identify and interpret any observed signals, and to extract their astrophysical content, requires theoretical models of the sources. The extreme environments of neutron stars and black holes require them to be modeled within the framework of Einstein's theory of general relativity. The research activities supported by this award are aimed at developing the necessary numerical algorithms, at numerically constructing such theoretical models, at predicting gravitational wave signals for comparison with future observation, and at answering related astrophysical questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will actively participate in a computational physics research group, providing them with a ?hands-on? research experience and generating a research-enriched learning environment. The students will work on a variety of well-defined, manageable and meaningful projects, including, for example, the generalization and extension of previous results and the exploration of simple model problems. They will also have the opportunity to collaborate with scientists at other institutions and to present their work at conferences and in publications, making this research experience a very valuable preparation for graduate training and other future careers in the sciences and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
