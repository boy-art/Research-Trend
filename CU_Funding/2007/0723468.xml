    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to approximately fifteen graduate students in the&lt;br/&gt;United States to attend the 2007 SIAM Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2007), held in Minneapolis, USA from April 28th to April 30th, 2007 (http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm07/). This technical conference is the premiere venue for presenting new research results in the area of data mining, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attending this conference is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with other graduate students as well as hundreds of other leading researchers in the area of data mining. The travel support targets graduate students with accepted papers and in particular women and under-represented minority students in order to enhance their educational experience and foster diversity in the data mining research area.</AbstractNarration>
