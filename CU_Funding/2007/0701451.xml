    <AbstractNarration>The intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology is an exciting and&lt;br/&gt;data-driven field, where a combination of imaginative basic theory and observations has&lt;br/&gt;revolutionized our understanding of the Universe. The PI?s research focuses on several&lt;br/&gt;areas where the potential for new fundamental discoveries is particularly high: Dark&lt;br/&gt;Matter, Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays, and Galactic and Cosmic Magnetic Fields.&lt;br/&gt;Although Dark Matter (DM) is conventionally considered to be an as-yet-undiscovered&lt;br/&gt;particle arising in some extension of standard particle physics, instead, DM may be a&lt;br/&gt;manifestation of an entirely new world ? possibly as complex as our own ? whose&lt;br/&gt;properties we can only infer through gravity. For instance, if our world is a brane in a&lt;br/&gt;higher dimensional space, there could be other branes nearby in some new dimension,&lt;br/&gt;whose presence we could only discover through their gravitational effects.&lt;br/&gt;Although still inconclusive, evidence has been mounting that Dark Matter may have a&lt;br/&gt;long range interaction with itself, which the PI has recently shown would be a smoking&lt;br/&gt;gun for a disconnected Dark Sector. The PI, her collaborators and her students will&lt;br/&gt;extend simulations of cosmological structure formation and of the tidal stripping of dwarf&lt;br/&gt;galaxies bound to the Milky Way, to include the possibility of new forces in the Dark&lt;br/&gt;Sector. Detailed comparison with these and other observations will either show the&lt;br/&gt;presence of a new force and allow some properties of the Dark Sector to be inferred, or&lt;br/&gt;will put stringent limits on Dark Sector interactions. Related questions that will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated are: Do dark matter and dark energy interact with each other? Why is the&lt;br/&gt;abundance of dark matter about equal to that of ordinary matter?&lt;br/&gt;Another important topic of research is the highest energy particles in Nature ? ultrahigh&lt;br/&gt;energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The aim is to pin down what they are, and how and&lt;br/&gt;where in the Universe they are accelerated or created. The third main effort is to map&lt;br/&gt;out the Galactic Magnetic Field with much greater accuracy than ever before, by making&lt;br/&gt;a combined fit of many different types of observations.&lt;br/&gt;The PI is involved in an international collaboration to develop state-of-the-art techniques&lt;br/&gt;for optimizing fits involving many parameters and hundreds of millions of measured data&lt;br/&gt;points. The PI intends to take the New York Schools Cosmic Particle Telescope&lt;br/&gt;(NYSCPT) project to the next stage of its successful partnership with&lt;br/&gt;NYC schools by prototyping rooftop water tank detectors and designing a full-sized The&lt;br/&gt;PI is involved in mentoring high school students, teacher and student participants of&lt;br/&gt;NYSCPT, women graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty. She is&lt;br/&gt;also a founding participant of the NYU ?WINS? program to foster undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;women?s participation in science.</AbstractNarration>
