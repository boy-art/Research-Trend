    <AbstractNarration>PI: Carolyn Lawrence (Iowa State University; awardee)&lt;br/&gt;coPI: Taner Z. Sen (Iowa State University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maize researchers cannot easily leverage all available genetic and genomic data because the online locations of all resources are not easy to find and the sequence-indexed resources generated by individual projects must be searched independently. In addition, it is often the case that when a project?s funding period ends, the generated data are lost because they are not moved to long-term repositories: these once-funded project sites degrade over time and sometimes disappear entirely. This project will overcome these challenges in collaboration with the community of maize researchers by launching POPcorn (PrOject Portal for corn), a needs-driven resource and data pipeline. POPcorn will make available (1) a centralized Web-accessible resource to search and browse ongoing maize genomics projects, (2) a single, stand-alone tool that makes use of Web services and minimal data warehousing to enable researchers to carry out sequence searches at one location that return matches for all participating projects? related resources, (3) a set of tools that enable collaborators to migrate their data to MaizeGDB, the long-term model organism database for maize genetic and genomic information, at their projects? conclusion, and (4) generalized, freely available code that other research communities could use to meet similar needs. The development of the project portal, upload tools for maize data, and tutorials will serve as an outreach activity directly, support basic research, and accelerate the acquisition and utilization of new knowledge that translates directly into this important production crop?s agronomic improvement. Thus, POPcorn will aid in the identification of the molecular-level phenotypes manifesting as traits that plant breeders select for and will lead to improvements in food, fuel, and nutrition. In addition, project personnel will actively participating in the NSF?s Plant Genome Research Outreach to American Indian Undergraduates program at Iowa State University. Thus, these activities will promote research, education, and dissemination of maize data to a broad audience, while developing a new generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
