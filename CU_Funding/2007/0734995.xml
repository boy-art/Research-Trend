    <AbstractNarration>The BiosciEdNET (BEN) is deploying new services to benefit both its collaborators and the end-users. Additionally two new collaborators, the American Society of Human Genetics, and the Biotechnology Institute, are joining BEN. The new services being added include 'Dewey' digital library collection management, a peer-review system, and a community Sign-on that offers integrated services. The Software as a Service (SaaS) model of software delivery is being used. Dewey cataloging and peer review applications are continuing to help BEN attract, maintain and support collaborators with high quality biological sciences resources. The community sign-on service is making it possible for users to access the entire community with only one sign-in versus the necessity of multiple usernames and passwords. Greater security of personal data is resulting since the information is retained in only one place and is not transmitted as the user accesses multiple Web sites.</AbstractNarration>
