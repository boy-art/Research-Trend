    <AbstractNarration>0755389&lt;br/&gt;Willits, Rebecca K&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this study is to investigate the control of nerve outgrowth using defined mechanical, chemical, and spatial properties in three dimensional polymeric environments. The long-term goal is to develop an optimized, rationally designed, three dimensional scaffold to encourage and direct nerve growth in vivo. This guidance of nerve growth would advance medicine?s ability to repair nerve damage and potentially lead to a cure for paralysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially, mechanical properties and chemical composition will be varied&lt;br/&gt;independently to study the factors important for growth. These factors will then be combined in layered materials that will provide spatial as well as chemical and mechanical cues for growth. Polyethylene glycol gels will be used as the backbone for these scaffolds. Ease of chemical modification allows for covalent addition of molecules that will specifically interact with the nerve, such as extra-cellular matrix proteins. As this study will characterize the relative importance of&lt;br/&gt;chemical, mechanical, and spatial cues in three dimensional scaffolds instead of on two dimensional surfaces, this study will advance the development of scaffolds for nerve regeneration by providing an engineered environment in culture that mimics the body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this project under a mentored environment to explore research as a career option and a mechanism of integrating and applying their own engineering education. They will actively participate in research, analysis, presentation, and publication ranging from traditional discipline specific venues to more general science and engineering venues with an opportunity to interact and exchange ideas with other students, industry representatives, and researchers and to integrate their own specialty with others, thus enhancing scientific learning and understanding.</AbstractNarration>
