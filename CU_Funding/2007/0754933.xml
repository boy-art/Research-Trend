    <AbstractNarration>This project develops a new Research Experience for Undergraduates site focused on experimental research in wireless networks. The site provides students with opportunities to explore and study state-of-the-art solutions to many open challenges in wireless networking. Students receive hands-on experience in the design, implementation, deployment, evaluation, and measurement of wireless and mobile networks. The project focuses on recruiting students from diverse institutions with limited research environments. Undergraduate students participate in a ten-week summer research program at the host institution. The project includes mentorship by experienced computer science faculty members, experience with research and graduate life, and professional development opportunities for the participating students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The projects are in major current research areas that are of interest to the community at large and that have clear practical applications. The research in wireless networking, mobile computing, and pervasive systems may lead to technologies that provide for public safety and ubiquitous municipal wireless access, thus advancing the current research in these important areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups. The relationships developed during the project could lead to future collaborations among the institutions of the participating students that may enable the students to continue their research and professional growth after the summer experience. Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.</AbstractNarration>
