    <AbstractNarration>Technical. A conference on molecular photonics will be held at the University of Washington, Friday Harbor Laboratories, Friday Harbor, WA on August 28-31, 2007. The conference will focus on the interaction of light with nano-structured materials and will cover fundamentals of non-linear optical properties of molecules and materials from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Conference topics include materials processing, structure-function relationships, devices and applications. Organic electro-optic and light emitting diode materials hold promise for providing significant enhancement of performance over existing materials technologies with expected impacts on both the civilian and defense sectors. Organic electro-optic materials may significantly enhance telecommunications capabilities and information technologies. Organic third order nonlinear optical materials have significantly improved to the point that they hold potential for sensor protection, all-optical processing, and 3-dimensional photolithography. Similarly, organic optical amplifier materials and light harvesting solar cell coatings and photovoltaic materials hold technological promise. This is considered to be an important time to bring together key researchers to address such opportunities and challenges in this emerging field for assessment and realization of potential impacts. For example, it is necessary that key structure-function relationships are understood and materials properties improved to make them robust, reliable and reproducible. This conference will bring together the best ideas both for applications and for materials development so that full potential of non-linear organic materials can be realized.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical. An important impact of this conference will be to increase the attendance of students and young scientists from underrepresented groups. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established among universities, research institutions, and industry, and with researchers abroad, at this meeting. The requested NSF funds will be used to facilitate participation in the meeting by underrepresented groups including young faculty, postdoctoral research associates and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
