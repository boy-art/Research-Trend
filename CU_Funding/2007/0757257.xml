    <AbstractNarration>The asymmetry term affects nearly every macroscopic property of the neutron star. A long-term goal of the proposed program is to extend current understanding of the density dependence of the nuclear asymmetry energy to higher densities. In doing so, understanding of the macroscopic properties of neutron stars deeper into the core of the star will be achieved. The program combines multiple approved experiments with development of apparatus for future measurements via an international collaboration. By the end of the program period, a number of problems pertaining to the density dependence of the asymmetry term of the nuclear equation-of-state (EOS) at densities equal to the nuclear saturation density and below will have been solved. In addition to this, the measurement of the high-density (greater than normal nuclear density) behavior of the asymmetry term of the nuclear EOS will be approached. This program will be integrated with a strong international collaboration to establish high-level experimentation at world-class facilities to explore the isospin dependence of the EOS at densities greater than and less than the nuclear saturation density.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several strong collaborations will be engaged in this research; these are existing collaborations with the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, the National Astronomical Observatory in Mitaka, Japan, Washington University in St. Louis, and RIKEN in Tokyo, Japan. The proposed program provides training for students (graduate and undergraduate) in an environment that integrates research and teaching. At any given time during the program, at least one undergraduate and one graduate student will be employed. Students will be expected to participate in the experimental program at all levels including construction of apparatus, participation in large-scale experiments, and data analysis. This training will contribute to the next generation of physicists in a field important to radiation detection, education, American competitiveness, and national security.</AbstractNarration>
