    <AbstractNarration>The project provides partial funding for the U.S. participation in a workshop organized jointly by a group of scientists at the Mathematical Institute at the University of Bergen and at the University of South Florida. The workshop is planned as an interdisciplinary event to discuss several cutting edge problems on the border between modern mathematics and mathematical physics, more specifically, problems broadly associated with so-called Laplacian growth, stochastic and discrete Loewner evolutions, quadrature domains, gravitational lensing, Hele-Shaw flows, and integrable systems. The topics chosen for the workshop are "hot" topics which are on the borderline between mathematics and physics. Recently, most of these themes, long studied in mathematical physics, received an unexpected but dramatic insight from classical complex analysis based on the notion of Schwarz function of an analytic curve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding is intended for the U.S. participation in the planned workshop. The workshop is a step in a larger initiative conceived by the organizers to create a multi-facetted joint USA-Europe series of collaborative projects and will serve to increase internationalization of newly developed collaborations and promote the establishment of in-depth scientific partnerships. Supporting the travel of promising young researchers and graduate students to the workshop where scientists from Europe and the US, old and young, prominent and just beginning, are essentially spending 24 hours together in an inspiring and congenial environment, discussing appealing and important problems in mathematics and physics, will encourage many younger students to pursue some of these topics in their future research. Most of the funding is designated to support the travel costs of young scientists, graduate students and members of the underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
