    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Caroline C. Jarrold of Indiana University and her graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will investigate the electronic structure and chemical reactivity of small molybdenum oxide-based mixed metal clusters. The primary goal of these experiments is to understand catalytic activity on a level that could ultimately lead to improved selectivity, efficiency and stability of catalyst materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transition metal oxides are important in a wide range of industrially important catalytic processes. Improving the performance of these catalysts can have profound impacts in improving processes, making them more energy efficient, reducing wasteful byproducts, etc. The eventual outcome provided by the kind of basic research that Prof. Jarrold and her students are pursuing will be improved materials for catalysis. In addition to the broader societal impact of Prof. Jarrold's research work, she will continue her many and varied efforts to support women in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
