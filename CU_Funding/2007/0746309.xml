    <AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry program is supporting the research of Professor Peter Iovine of the University of San Diego. Professor Iovine will apply the diverse chemistry of arylboronic acids and arylboroxines to the synthesis of new materials. First, an operationally simple synthetic methodology will be developed to rationally control the substitution pattern in arylboroxine compounds. Second, small molecule arylboroxine chemistry will be applied to the synthesis of Lewis acidic dendrimers containing tripodal arylboroxine cores. The dendrimers are formed by the dehydration condensation of individual sticky-ended dendrons, which have at their focal point, a single arylboronic acid functional group. The reversible binding of Lewis basic guest molecules to the reactive core as well as the migration of these guests in and out of the dendrimer will be studied. In the final objective, boronic acid-tipped dendrons will be used as macromolecular reagents to chemically modify renewable materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Iovine will also initiate two educational projects that interweave research and teaching. The first project involves an outreach program targeting two local schools that serve predominantly underrepresented groups. After establishing working relationships with the local educators, Professor Iovine will design and teach a course to undergraduate science majors exploring the societal implications and best practices associated with scientific outreach. The second educational initiative infuses faculty or industrial partner research into upper-division lecture/laboratory courses. One third of a semester will be devoted to open-ended research projects that are cultivated from Departmental faculty or local industry partners.</AbstractNarration>
