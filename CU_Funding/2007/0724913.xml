    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop the process to fabricate magnesium-oxide (MgO) based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) sensor devices, which are simultaneously ultra-sensitive at high frequencies, small in size, with high output, and extremely low power consumption. The dual advantages of high sensitivity and low power consumption will separate these sensor devices from traditional Hall-effect and magnetoresistive sensor products, which are power hungry and typically not suitable for many high-performance and battery-powered sensing applications. This innovative approach combines the high resistivity tunneling and enhanced signal strength derived from magnesium oxide tunnel barrier technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact anticipated if this project is realized is a new class of MgO-based sensors with high sensitivity and low power consumption, and the development of a reliable fabrication process suitable for mass production. This project will advance the state of understanding of the emerging spintronic technology of magnetic tunnel junctions, a class of devices which forms the central component of a number of important commercial products in the high-tech semiconductor and data storage industries. Finally, the collaboration of physicists, electrical engineers, materials scientists, and students will result in a broader multidisciplinary training and education for all the participants in the field of spintronics.</AbstractNarration>
