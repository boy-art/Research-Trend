    <AbstractNarration>A 7th NSF-MEXT US Japan Workshop on Nanotechnology: Fuel Cell and Related Technologies is proposed with leading researchers and engineers for the United States and Japan in the targeted area of nanomaterials in fuel cells and hydrogen storage. The workshop will explore the opportunities of nanomaterials in overcoming barriers and challenges to hydrogen fuel cell commercialization. The focus will be on discussion of research progress in four primary areas: 1. Materials for Hydrogen production &amp; storage: 2. Cell components (electrocatalyst , electrolyte membranes, MEA etc.): 3. Fundamentals of electrocatalytic theory and electrocatalytic materials: 4. Understanding of material degradation processes on fuel cell performance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will come at an opportune time because of the international concern about the future supply and distribution of energy. The results of the workshop will be presented in a report to NSF and made available for wide distribution through a web presence, and will include presentation slides. The possibilities for international collaboration between the United States and Japan can be envisaged as a result of the Workshop.</AbstractNarration>
