    <AbstractNarration>PI: John Browse (Washington State University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Edgar Cahoon and Jan Jaworski (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center; subawardees), John Ohlrogge (Michigan State University; subawardee), John Shanklin (SUNY, Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory; subawardee)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Collaborator: Chaofu Lu (Montana State University; subawardee)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to use genomics to access the network of genes and proteins that operate chemical factories to synthesize and accumulate novel fatty acids in seeds. Evolution of new enzyme functions, together with the co-evolution of additional biochemical and cell biological traits, has provided hundreds of potentially useful chemicals in seed oils, including the hydroxylated, conjugated and cyclopropane fatty acids to be studied in this project. Providing a detailed description of genes and proteins required for optimal pathway function will require the integrated deployment of four strategies: a) Investigate and optimize the activities of enzymes for unusual fatty acid synthesis using bioinformatics and protein engineering. b) Carry out extensive sequencing of seeds sampled through the period of oil synthesis, and use functional genomic screens to identify co-evolved enzymes (and other protein functions) required for incorporation of the novel fatty acid into the oil. c) Perform biochemical analysis of the identified proteins and quantify their contributions to the accumulation of unusual fatty acids through expression in transgenic plants. d) Analyze protein-protein interactions in membranes to gain insight how these pathways are physically organized. Finally, the accumulated knowledge will be tested through experiments to reconstruct the native pathways in transgenic plants using expression of multiple genes and pathway engineering. The discoveries that result from this project will yield an understanding of the underlying principles of how pathways evolved for the synthesis of novel seed oils. Information and results will be available from the project website: www.genomics.msu.edu/Oilseeds &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic knowledge from this project will enable the design of a new generation of specialty crops that will become the green factories of the future, providing for the production of industrial lubicants, solvent oils and biodiesel. The project will help to educate young students and the general public through collaboration with the St Louis Science Center. Hands-on experiments will be developed in a new K-12 Learning Lab, and in the main gallery, exhibits on "Plants as Green Factories" will be developed. Through the project's REU program, that will continue to make special efforts to include underrepresented groups, undergraduate students will participate in multi-disciplinary research projects that bring plant genomics together with biochemistry to solve complex but exciting challenges.</AbstractNarration>
