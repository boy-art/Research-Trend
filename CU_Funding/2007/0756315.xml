    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0756315&lt;br/&gt;Girshick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanodusty plasmas are gas plasmas that contain nanoparticles. No comprehensive model of a nanodusty plasma presently exists that can predict the evolution of the nanoparticle-plasma system in both space and time. If such a model can be developed, it will both deepen fundamental understanding of the coupled phenomena involved and serve as a design tool. As a tool, the model could guide development of plasma processes that synthesize nanoparticles for a variety of nanotechnology applications or that seek to avoid formation and/or deposition of contaminant nanoparticles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop this model, simulations will be conducted to predict the effects of operating parameters on the behavior of the plasma-nanoparticle system. Model results will be compared to experiments that will be conducted concurrently at the University of Orléans, France. It is expected that this work will lead to fundamental insights into phenomena occurring in nanodusty plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model will focus on low-pressure argon-silane plasmas. Simulations will provide a description of the nature of coagulation in this system, of the effects on the system of different particle charging models, and of the effects of the nanoparticle evolution on plasma properties such as electron and ion density profiles, and electron temperature. The effects of operating parameters will be studied by conducting simulations that assume various values of applied voltage, electrode gap, total pressure, gas temperature and temperature gradient, and argon and silane flow rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education and outreach will be integrated into the proposed research at several levels. Funded graduate students will greatly benefit from the international interactions with the Orléans group as well as local interactions with Minnesota's multidisciplinary team of nanoparticle science and engineering researchers. The principal investigator will also participate in the Young Scientist Roundtable of the Wayzata, MN, public schools.</AbstractNarration>
