    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Hisahi Yamaoto from the University of Chicago. Prof. Hiashi's research concentrates on the development of new synthetic methods for the production of biologically interesting compounds. This research is focused on the development of catalytic systems for the enantioselective reactions using chromium complexed substrates in the preparation of novel compounds that may have useful biological activities. It is hoped that these complexes will mimic enzyme-like catalysts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this research is considered to be excellent, as the new synthetic methods and reagents developed by the PI are expected to mimic the mode of catalysis of enzymes. The PI plans to use his new synthetic methods for the production of medicinally interesting and useful compounds. No educational Broader Impacts were delineated.</AbstractNarration>
