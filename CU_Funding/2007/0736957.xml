    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;The performance of an asphalt pavement depends on various factors, the most important of which is how well the mix was designed against various environmental and traffic loads expected to act on it during its service life. In private industry as well as in governmental agencies, the use of superior performing hot mix asphalt, known as Superpave, has achieved widespread use resulting in a high demand for individuals with Superpave design experience. One of the integral parts of the Superpave system is a newly developed mix design methodology that has proven to be far superior when compared to traditional mix design methods. In this project, two existing undergraduate civil engineering courses are being modified to include modules on Superpave theory, design, and testing. Hands-on laboratory experiences are being developed and evaluated for learning effectiveness through this project. The modules are being inserted in two compulsory courses at the institution, ensuring that all civil engineering students learn about the Superpave technology to better prepare them for their engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
