    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry will support the CAREER development plan of Punit Kohli of the University of Southern Illinois. Professor Kohli and his students will develop an integrated research and educational approach for the design and fabrication of a novel programmable nanotube-array based lithography system. Array of individually addressed and programmable nanotubes will be fabricated in mechanical robust chips for controlled and high-throughput patterning of molecules and nanoparticles at sub-micron scale for potential applications in a wide range of fields including materials sciences, bioanalytical chemistry, medicine, and biochemistry. Some applications of the proposed research includes probing molecular interactions for catalysis; protein-protein and protein-drug interactions; chemical- and biological-sensors; applications in the areas such as light-emitting and imaging devices, and alternative energy source devices. The educational initiative involves the development and implementation of NSF-Encouraging Minority in Research (NSF-EMR) Program whose main objective is to encourage and involve minority students in research. More specifically, a ten week summer program will be implemented in which one minority student and one assistant professor from the Department of Chemistry of Claflin University (a historically black college) will perform research in the PI's laboratory. The NSF-EMR Program will provide an excellent environment for minority students and faculty to conduct interdisciplinary research in the nanoscience field.</AbstractNarration>
