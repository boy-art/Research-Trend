    <AbstractNarration>Polyploidy (whole genome doubling) is a major force in plant evolution, but relatively little is known about the role of polyploidy in shaping physiological or developmental processes. The objective of this project is to study the effects of polyploidy on the network of functionally interrelated genes underlying photosynthesis, a key determinant of the ecological success and economic utility of plants. All species of the legume genus Glycine, including the cultivated soybean (G. max), experienced two ancient rounds of polyploidy, and some wild Glycine species underwent an additional very recent event. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine how the two ancient events have shaped the structure and expression of gene families involved in photosynthesis, using the extensive genomic resources of soybean. Genomic and proteomic experiments will also be conducted on recent polyploids to study the early effects of polyploidy on photosynthesis gene networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to understanding of the emergent properties of polyploidy, which has shaped the genomes of major crop species. This interdisciplinary approach seeks to bridge the gap between genomic and physiological studies by achieving an understanding of the effects of polyploidy on genes underlying an important physiological process.</AbstractNarration>
