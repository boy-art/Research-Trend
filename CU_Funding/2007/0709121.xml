    <AbstractNarration>In order to achieve the functionality, reliability, and scalability of current microfabrication, DNA-based self-assembly should increase complexity of the nanostructures that it can construct, and control over nanocomponent placement. The key problem behind this significant hurdle is the lack of control over fundamental building blocks for self-assembly. This research explores DNA-based nanoscale building blocks (DNAnBLOCKs) to construct more complicated and controlled nanostructures through DNA-directed self-assembly. The DNAnBLOCK is a DNA-based nanostructure, in which strand sequence, location, and orientation are precisely controlled, enabling the 'controlled' functionality and directionality. With the well-defined functionality and directionality, self-assembly can lead to precisely controlled structures with greater complexity. In addition, DNA oligonucleotides used are non-crosshybridizing (NCH), and unplanned defects and errors are minimized. Furthermore, the DNAnBLOCK is capable of three-dimensional growth and is highly scalable. Thus, this research addresses the urgent need in nanotechnology to realize nanoscale materials and devices that have practical use and more capability than existing technologies. &lt;br/&gt;This research will benefit the society in several areas. Information gained from the research would benefit molecular electronic industries by making nanotechnology more practical and more functional. It would also be a useful resource to the researchers in other applications in biology, medicine, and sensors. Students will be educated through involvement in this research.</AbstractNarration>
