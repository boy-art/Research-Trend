    <AbstractNarration>Moore's work in infinite combinatorics concerns classification and basis&lt;br/&gt;problems for uncountable structures and their connection with cardinal&lt;br/&gt;exponentiation. On one hand, strong axioms such as the Proper Forcing&lt;br/&gt;Axiom and Woodin's Pmax axiom are invoked to build embeddings and&lt;br/&gt;morphisms between structures such as linear orders and topological&lt;br/&gt;spaces. Since these strong axioms themselves imply that the cardinality&lt;br/&gt;of the real line is the second uncountable cardinal, it is natural to&lt;br/&gt;ask whether the classification theorems which follow from them already&lt;br/&gt;fix the cardinality of the continuum. The research supported by this&lt;br/&gt;grant aims to prove new classification results from these strong axioms,&lt;br/&gt;to better understand the relationship between these classification&lt;br/&gt;results and the value of the continuum, and to improve our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the strong axioms themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oldest results in set theory concern the rigorous development of the&lt;br/&gt;"size" of an infinite set. The cardinal numbers provide a linear scale&lt;br/&gt;with which one can measure the number of elements a set has --- also&lt;br/&gt;known as its cardinality. One of the earliest questions in set theory&lt;br/&gt;was Cantor's Continuum Problem: Determine the cardinality of the real&lt;br/&gt;number line. In the 1960s, this problem was shown to be independent of&lt;br/&gt;the usual axioms of mathematics. Still, it is unclear whether some&lt;br/&gt;other compelling mathematical statement, also undecidable, might settle&lt;br/&gt;the Continuum Problem. Moore's research aims to both establish the&lt;br/&gt;independence of new classification results for infinite mathematical&lt;br/&gt;structures and to relate these results to the Continuum Problem.</AbstractNarration>
