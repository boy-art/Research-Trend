    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0748054&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Rutgers University New Brunswick&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM: PHY ? ELEMENTARY PARTICLE ACCEL USER&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Halkiadakis, Eva&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: CAREER: New Physics Searches in Top Pairs and Jets Channels, Silicon Pixel Operations at CMS and Particle Physics Outreach with Spark Chamber Stations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests partial support for a program of research in experimental elementary particle physics based primarily on the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and for an education and outreach program involving high school teachers and pre-college women students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past few decades, physicists have been able to describe with increasing detail the fundamental particles that make up the Universe and the interactions between them. Much of this success has been due to the Tevatron program at Fermilab with D0 and CDF making major contributions.. Professor Halkiadakis has been a major participant in the physics analysis for the CDF experiment, particularly in top physics, as well as in many leadership roles. Now the LHC and CMS will start operation in new regimes of energy and luminosity holding even greater promise for discoveries and measurements leading to revisions of our views on how the world is constructed and the nature of the laws that govern its operation. Professor Halkiadakis is now transitioning into the CMS program where she will parlay her wealth of experience in top analysis into a study of top pair production at CMS for new physics searches. With the Rutgers group making significant contributions to the CMS pixel detector and the pivotal role the detector plays in identifying b-quarks, Professor Halkiadakis also has assumed the responsibility for developing major portions of the pixel data quality monitoring (DQM) system. In addition, she plans to expand her searches to involve jets as a complimentary program to a study of decay signatures with leptons or missing momentum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Broader Impacts, she plans to use cosmic ray muons to bring particle physics to the public. The objective is to set up an experiment to test Einstein?s special theory of relativity and to demonstrate that high energy particles surround us. This project will be assembled by local high school teachers and pre-college women students from the Rutgers Douglass Project. Together with the PI, they will build particle physics detectors to measure the number of cosmic ray muons observed at different altitudes and study the effect of time dilation. The results of the experiment will be seen ?in action? via web-based displays at their schools, and exhibited in science museums around the state of New Jersey, such as at the Liberty Science Center.</AbstractNarration>
