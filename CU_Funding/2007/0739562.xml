    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues study several problems in the analytic &lt;br/&gt;theory of L-functions. The long term goal of these projects is to gain an &lt;br/&gt;improved understanding on zeros of L-functions, and on the distribution of &lt;br/&gt;values of L-functions and related number theoretic objects. In&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with Zeev Rudnick, the investigator is developing methods&lt;br/&gt;to obtain lower bounds in many families of L-functions. These lower &lt;br/&gt;bounds are of the same order of magnitude as the conjectured&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic formulae of Keating and Snaith. In related work, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator is developing a new method for obtaining extreme values of&lt;br/&gt;L-functions, and the emerging ideas seem to be of wide applicability.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will also work on finding new asymptotic formulae&lt;br/&gt;for certain moments of quadratic twists of L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, with Andrew Granville, the investigator will work on&lt;br/&gt;questions from multilplicative number theory, especially&lt;br/&gt;related to character sums. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator's area of research is analytic number theory. The&lt;br/&gt;central objects of study in number theory are L-functions. These&lt;br/&gt;are certain analytic functions built out of arithmetically interesting &lt;br/&gt;objects such as prime numbers. Understanding the zeros and values &lt;br/&gt;of L-functions is one of the major themes of modern mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;Apart from the intrinsic interest in these questions, progress in this &lt;br/&gt;area has practical implications for cryptography and coding theory.</AbstractNarration>
