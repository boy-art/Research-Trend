    <AbstractNarration>Bradley University is recruiting six undergraduate students to participate in a 10-week summer research experience in ecology. Students will be exposed to molecular, physiological, organismal, community and ecosystem approaches. Although individual students will be responsible for a particular project, they will also work collaboratively with other REU students and faculty mentors on related projects. REU participants will be expected to submit a final report and to present their results at an end-of-program research symposium. Participants will be immersed in a culture that (1) integrates research and educational activities throughout and beyond the classroom, (2) fosters and supports multi-investigator, multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary collaborations, (3) introduces students to the broader scientific community through multiple university collaborations and research at multi-investigator research sites and (4) shows the highest commitment to supporting faculty-student research. Selection criteria include (1) a minimum grade point average of 3.0 and the successful completion of two years of Biology and one year of Chemistry; (2) letters of recommendation; (3) a statement of research interests; and (4) a statement of career goals. Applicants not meeting the stated criteria will also be considered on a case-by-case basis. Minority students are encouraged to apply. REU students will be provided on-campus housing and will receive a stipend and meal allowance.
