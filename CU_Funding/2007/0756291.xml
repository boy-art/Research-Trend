    <AbstractNarration>Technical Summary. Professor Jeffery L. White's research group has developed new insights into the fundamental origins of complex phase behaviors in mixtures of polyolefins. Using advanced solid-state NMR experiments with chain-level resolution, his research first identified entropically-driven miscibility in multiple polyolefin blends. However, the direct connections between chain and constituent monomer structure and required positive configurational entropies of mixing in macromolecules have not been established, particularly for mixtures of polyolefins that are most commercially relevant. During the next funding period, Professor White and coworkers will use recently-developed advanced magnetic resonance methods on solid polymer blends, in concert with polymer synthesis and thermal analysis, to identify the structural parameters needed to create miscible blends in various mixtures of polypropylenes, polyethylenes, and their copolymers. Collectively, such polymers represent the most economically valuable class of macromolecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Summary. Professor Jeffery White and his research group have adopted a long-term strategy to understand how to create important polymer materials whose properties are attractive for economic applications. Using advanced experiments that unravel the most important fundamental aspects of complex organic materials, he has demonstrated how desirable new materials actually form stable structures from their individual components. This class of organic polymers, known as polyolefins, is extremely valuable to the U.S. economy, with new markets and applications accessible only through creation of new materials. Professor White and his research group use the techniques learned in the laboratory, as well as past industrial experiences, to educate elementary school students and their teachers on the benefits of science to society. Specifically, Dr. White has created a novel new teaching tool, called "I-PROD", to interest young students in pursuing science and engineering careers and help address future domestic competitiveness in technology, as highlighted in the recent American Competitive Initiative.</AbstractNarration>
