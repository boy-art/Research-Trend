    <AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of this proposed research project is to establish a high-resolution 3-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional cardiac electrical imaging technology from intra-cavity recordings, that can map&lt;br/&gt;cardiac electrical activity within the 3-dimensional (3-D) heart during clinical catheter ablation&lt;br/&gt;procedures. Sudden death from ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation claims nearly&lt;br/&gt;400,000 lives each year in the United States alone. Development of effective imaging technologies is critical in the evolution of interventional approaches to prevent and treat these malignant arrhythmias.Novel to the proposed approach is to image 3-D cardiac electrical activity from the intra-cavity catheter recordings which are currently widely practiced in clinical electrophysiology labs to manage cardiac arrhythmias. Preliminary results in an animal model, has demonstrated the feasibility of the reconstruction of activation sequence throughout the 3-D myocardium from catheter recordings and attest to the feasibility of the proposed studies.</AbstractNarration>
