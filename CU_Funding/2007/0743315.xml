    <AbstractNarration>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), slated to begin taking data in 2008, will engage a new energy frontier. However, there is great uncertainty as to what exactly will be seen. Nonetheless, there are strong indications that its discoveries will address fundamental questions. This proposal will leverage the data from this ambitious undertaking and other experiments to primarily explore two questions: What is the identity of the mysterious dark matter that permeates our universe? What is the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking? Disentangling the answers to these questions will be a decade-long program requiring cooperation between theorists and experimentalists. The PI has several particular focuses. One initial focus will be to examining exotic new physics signatures. As more data arrives, the emphasis will shift towards building models that answer these two fundamental questions in a way consistent with data. Deciphering these questions will require an understanding of not only particle physics data, but data from cosmological experiments. Taking advantage of the interplay between the celestial and terrestrial will allow the PI to gain additional insight into the fundamental questions he intends to explore. &lt;br/&gt;Another goal of this proposal is to ensure that the knowledge and excitement generated by current and upcoming discoveries in particle physics are broadly shared: from the general public through graduate students. The outreach effort under this proposal will be two-fold. First, an exhibit on particle physics and the LHC is planned at the Ruthven Exhibit Museum for Natural History in Ann Arbor. This exhibit should reach 20- 30 thousand visitors during its initial run, including over 10,000 school-age students, many from disadvantaged areas. Second, the general public will benefit from a series of Saturday Morning lectures (broadcast to a wider audience on cable television) on the physics of the LHC.</AbstractNarration>
