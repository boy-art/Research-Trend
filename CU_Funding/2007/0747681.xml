    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: ECCS-0747681&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: CAREER: Diagnostics and Prognostics of Electric Cables in Aging Power Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Shin, Yong-June &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: University of South Carolina, Columbia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research are to develop (1) an innovative reflectometry technique that can accurately detect and locate fully-developed and incipient defects in power cabling, (2) an interdisciplinary understanding of the failure mechanisms at a sufficient level of detail to use the reflectometry technique to assess cable aging, and (3) a quantitative prognostic algorithm that computes the probable remaining life of these cables. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Wires and cables are vital to safe and reliable operation of all types of power systems. However, it is not an easy task to determine the cable integrity and yet there is no known method for predicting when or where they will fail. The project seeks a comprehensive solution by (1) a signal processing-based effective reflectometry, and (2) a physics-based interpretation of aging phenomena. The expected findings from the project enable assessment and prediction of health conditions of the electric cables. This is expected to revolutionize breakdown or time-based maintenance practices in electric power systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Successful completion of the project will yield methods for assessing health conditions of the cabling portion in a broad spectrum of electric power infrastructures. This will increase public safety as it is related to reliable electric power in the terrestrial power grid, onboard aircraft or ships, nuclear power plants, or in underground utility power systems. The project includes plans to disseminate the research outcomes through distance education programs, enabling the new technology to be immediately applied in the field by industry workers pursuing higher education.</AbstractNarration>
