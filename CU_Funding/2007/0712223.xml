    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project seeks to develop a peroxide sensor for the detection of homemade explosives, addressing a critical capability gap in airport security technology. The concept involves self-assembly of a peroxide sensitive coating on a detector, featuring a chemically amplified response for high sensitivity and selectivity. The objective is to prototype a proof-of-concept peroxide detector and determine its limit of detection and false alarm rate, in order to assess the expected performance of an explosives detection system that consists of existing imaging and detection equipment coupled with the proposed peroxide sensor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homemade explosives derived from ordinary liquid peroxides have been central to recent terrorist plots to sabotage airliners and are not reliably detected by conventional trace explosives detection systems (EDS) in airports. They operate at temperatures that degrade peroxides into indistinguishable molecular fragments. The proposed development of a highly sensitive and selective peroxide sensor fills a critical gap for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is urgently seeking a sensor for the reliable detection of peroxide-based homemade explosives and their precursors. By incorporating reliable trace detection capabilities into baggage imaging equipment, the false alarm rate of the overall explosive detection system can be reduced to near-zero levels.</AbstractNarration>
