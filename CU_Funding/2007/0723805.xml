    <AbstractNarration>The white-throated sparrow has generated a great deal of interest among behavioral biologists because it occurs in two ""morphs"", or types, that have different social behavior. Dozens of behavioral studies, conducted in both field and laboratory settings, have established that individuals with a white stripe on the crown tend to be more aggressive, whereas birds with a tan stripe exhibit more parental care. By conducting the studies in this project, the neurochemical reasons why white birds are more aggressive than tan birds will be revealed. Because the steroid hormone testosterone is higher in white than tan males, investigating the biological ways in which testosterone may alter aggression and thus cause behavioral differences between morphs is an essential feature of this project. The approach used by the PI is powerful because it will comprehensively examine both behavior and neurochemistry in the same individuals, thus enabling detailed study of individual variation. Because the biological basis of aggressive behavior is similar in most vertebrate animals, the results from these studies will facilitated a better understanding of the neurochemical underpinnings for aggression in tens of thousands of species, including humans. A graduate student will receive training in behavioral biology, neuroscience, and molecular biology, and will thus be well prepared for career that integrates all three fields. The PI will also mentor several undergraduate students, and will encourage them to present their findings at national meetings and in published journal articles.</AbstractNarration>
