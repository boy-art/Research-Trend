    <AbstractNarration>Organic Semiconductor Spin Injection and Spin Transport&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to explore spintronic devices made from conjugated organic semiconductors. The possibility to integrate organic semiconductors with strongly ferromagnetic (even half-metallic) materials is a salient motivation for this project. The approach is to develop predictive physical models for organic semiconductor-based spintronic devices in order to provide a quantitative assessment of the true potential of these materials for that application. The University of Minnesota PI will work closely with researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity includes the advancement of the fundamental understanding of spin injection and transport, and the exploration of new devices and conceivable applications. A recently demonstrated feasibility to integrate organic materials with magnetic materials, together with certain intrinsic properties of organic semiconductors, create exciting opportunities to explore new devices with much greater functionality and performance than expected from conventional future electronics technology. The proposed predictive theoretical models are likely to acquire significant technological impact. However, the work is clearly exploratory and pursues long-term objectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have broad educational impact through the involvement of graduate students in an exciting interdisciplinary field. Research in this area crosses many boundaries by involving condensed matter physics, organic chemistry, and electronics. Furthermore, the proposed program attains additional educational scope through its ability to recruit women and students from traditionally under-represented groups due to the PI's participation in the University of Minnesota Materials Research Science and Engineering Center and its well-developed outreach network.</AbstractNarration>
