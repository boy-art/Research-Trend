    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Geosciences at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (UAF) is partnering with Northwest Arkansas Community College (NWACC) and the University of Arkansas, Pine Bluff (UAPB) to develop the relationships necessary to create pathways for underrepresented students to continue their education by pursuing undergraduate (in the case of NWACC students) and graduate degrees (in the case of UAPB students) in the geosciences at UAF. NWACC is a two-year college, whose Hispanic enrollment has increased dramatically during the past five years. UAPB is a Land Grant Institution and an HBCU with a 130-year history of academic excellence and tradition in undergraduate institution. UAF is the primary center of graduate education in the state of Arkansas. The program will lay the groundwork for the long-term strategic partnership among UAF, UAPB, NWACC and the US Geological Survey (USGS). NWACC and UAPB students will be involved in on-going research projects at UAF that focus on the use of geospatial technologies, such as Global Positioning system geodesy, GIS, and remote sensing, to examine geoscience problems of relevance to the students. The approach is two-pronged to maximize contact between UAF faculty and NWACC and UAPB students. Six NWACC students will be involved in research at UAF during the academic year. The proximity of NWACC to UA makes this approach feasible and ensures proper mentoring of the students. Two UAPB students will participate in an existing, NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program run by UAF during for eight weeks during the summer. The REU involves four weeks of research on the island of Dominica in the Caribbean and four weeks at UAF to analyze and interpret data. This permits daily contact between UAF faculty and UAPB students. UAPB students and faculty also will be trained to develop a research program at UAPB that uses geospatial technologies to assess ground subsidence and aquifer drawdown in central Arkansas. Additional activities for both NWACC and UAPB students include attendance at a regional scientific meeting and workshops on study habits and the application process to four-year institutions and graduate schools.</AbstractNarration>
