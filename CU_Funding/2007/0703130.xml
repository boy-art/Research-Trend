    <AbstractNarration>This project features seven interrelated activities designed to advance community college leadership in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields; to encourage the development of ATE-related programs in more community colleges; and to promote the value, accomplishments, and impact of the ATE program in and beyond the education field. The activities, which build upon the successes of previous efforts, include the following:&lt;br/&gt;(a) Three National ATE Principal Investigators (PI) Conferences in 2008, 2009, and 2010;&lt;br/&gt;(b) AACC MentorLinks program to help ten community colleges establish new programs or strengthen existing programs in STEM fields;&lt;br/&gt;(c) One special topic meeting focused on a prevailing issue in technician education;&lt;br/&gt;(d) Two AACC briefs, one focusing on the outcomes of the MentorLinks program, and the other focusing on the outcomes of the special topic meeting, that feature promising practices and resources;&lt;br/&gt;(e) A publication highlighting ATE projects entitled ATE Projects Impact;&lt;br/&gt;(f) Increased dissemination of information about ATE programs and their impact on the AACC web site; a public awareness and media outreach strategy; and publications, presentations, feature stories, and conference proceedings; and&lt;br/&gt;(g) Evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The activities advance the knowledge and understanding of various STEM disciplines and the strategies used to build and strengthen STEM programs. They are designed to enrich and expand the current network of institutions in the forefront of technological education reform; support that network by advancing opportunities for professional development and mentoring programs that provide venues and forums for identifying issues and solutions to challenging areas; and increase dissemination of information about successful programs and their national significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: These activities help community college leaders make the important connections and partnerships necessary to build and sustain STEM programs. The networking at previous ATE Conferences has led to numerous interactions among participants, involving the sharing of materials, the exchange of visits to campuses, and work on collaborative projects. This project is increasing this impact through development of additional targeted outreach and dissemination strategies. These activities are expanding, shaping, and focusing the future of the ATE program as it positions itself to meet the increasing demand for a trained technical workforce amid the challenges of maintaining U.S. competitiveness in a global economy.</AbstractNarration>
