    <AbstractNarration>This project will continue work on the development of new ligands for applications in asymmetric catalysis. Studies will be focused on the application of recently discovered oxazoline derived ligands in enantioselective addition of activated halides to carbonyl compounds. Additionally, the underlying controlling elements of ligand design will be explored using the modularity of the ligands investigated with the ultimate goal of more predictive power in catalyst design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Matthew S. Sigman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah. Professor Sigman's research focuses on the development of new, modular chiral ligands that will contribute to the rapid synthesis of chiral building blocks. Such building blocks will have an immediate impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.</AbstractNarration>
