    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to control the chemistry in dilute magnetic nanocrystalline semiconductors to manipulate exchange interactions that will lead to materials employable in future electronic architectures. By systematically investigating the magnetic, heat capacity, and optical properties of a series of manganese doped dilute magnetic semiconductor nanocrystals, a self-consistent magnetic exchange model will be developed. The exchange interactions probed by magnetic and heat capacity measurements are expected to correlate with the magneto-optical measurements. In combination these methods will allow an understanding of the size dependent changes of orbital interactions in these nanocrystalline materials and will help in the development of new materials for future spin-based electronics and memory-based technologies. The NSF program will support 3 graduate students, but 6 members of the research group. In addition the funding will be utilized in direct support of two under represented students to enhance their competitiveness in science by allowing exposure to cutting edge technologies. To enhance cultural diversity and outreach, both groups have historically attracted under represented students to their research and teaching programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops novel dilute magnetic nanocrystalline semiconductors. The science builds on the PI's leading developments in these unique materials exhibiting size dependent changes of orbital interactions, properties that may help in the development of new materials for future electronics and memory based technologies. The technology developed in the proposal will allow the competitiveness of our scientists and thus the US to compete globally. By systematically investigating the exchange interactions probed by magnetic and magneto-optical methods, the fundamentals of exchange and the control of exchange coupling can be developed. The NSF program will support 3 graduate students, but 6 members of the research group. In addition the funding will be utilized in direct support of 2 under represented students to enhance their competitiveness in science by allowing exposure to cutting edge technologies. To enhance cultural diversity and outreach, both groups have historically attracted under represented students to their research and teaching programs.</AbstractNarration>
