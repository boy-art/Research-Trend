    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award is co-funded by the Electronic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research and the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The project is to study three-dimensional (3D) metallodielectric metamaterials, which are fabricated using multiphoton direct laser writing, followed by metallization by nanoparticles binding and/or electrolessly plating of the scaffold surface. Using multiphoton direct laser writing, polymeric 3D lattices having virtually any micrometer-scale geometry can be created in a single photo-patterning step. Single nanoparticles, nanoparticles clusters, or continuous metal can then be deposited conformably onto the lattice, providing control over the metal nano-scale morphology. The objectives of the research are to investigate and learn to control processing, deposition, and growth phenomena relevant to preparing 3D optical metallodielectric materials and to develop predictive capabilities that relate the resulting nanometer- and micrometer-scale structures of these materials to their electromagnetic properties and device performance, thereby enabling new applications, which may include broad-band electromagnetic filtering and cloaking; sub-wavelength focusing; ultra-small and high-efficiency lasing; and low-intensity, all-optical switching.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science, chemistry, nanotechnology, and optics with high technological relevance, and is expected to provide a flexible new route to fabricate three-dimensional metamaterials, which exhibit fascinating optical properties, such as ultra-wide plasmonic band gaps, optical magnetism, extrinsically modified absorption/emission, and negative refractive index. The technical project is integrated with education via the PI's classroom teaching; research training; and a peer-to-peer outreach designed to attract middle-school, high-school, and community-college students to science and technical careers. The research is expected to generate exciting content for the outreach program and the PI's teaching. The outreach has the potential to impact a large number of youths across multi-ethnic Central Florida through partnerships with Orange Co. Public Schools, Valencia Community College, and Seminole Community College. The project will also provide a superb context for interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
