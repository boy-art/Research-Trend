    <AbstractNarration>This research employs a bio-cognitive perspective to consider the ways in which late life outcomes depend on other people's age-related stereotypes and older adults' responses to others' age stereotypes. Age stereotyping is often "benevolent" in nature; that is, it includes an image of older adults as child-like and in need of protection. This type of reaction -- although well-meaning -- demeans the competence of older adults and fails to recognize the strengths that also come with aging. The specific objectives of the project are to determine (1) the contexts and individual differences that either foster or limit age stereotyping of older adults, (2) the contexts and individual differences among older adults that lead them to be more or less vulnerable to (ageist) stereotype threat, and (3) the mediators of these processes with a particular attention to hormonal and cardiovascular responses associated with power or subordination. Several questions guide this research. First, do older adults show differences in measured competence when a task is posed as a measure of "memory" versus a measure of "wisdom." Second, what is the basis of the differences between those who stigmatize older adults and those more likely to show respect for them? Third, how does age bias among younger adults (and resultant condescension in their style of communication) operate to influence the actual performance of older adults? Findings from this work will demonstrate both the harmful effects of age stereotyping and the ways in which it can be prevented. Ultimately, this research will provide information that is useful within general educational programs, as well as for those who provide professional services to older adults.</AbstractNarration>
