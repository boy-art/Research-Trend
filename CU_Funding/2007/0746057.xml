    <AbstractNarration>With the universal deployment of mobile and cellular communications&lt;br/&gt;and the proliferation of wireless LAN technology, today's society is becoming&lt;br/&gt;firmly dependent on wireless networking technologies. As wireless networking&lt;br/&gt;continues to advance with new services and applications, researchers have an&lt;br/&gt;increasing interest in understanding the limits of current and future wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks. To a large extent, many of the performance limits associated with&lt;br/&gt;wireless networks are deeply intertwined with underlying physical layer&lt;br/&gt;technologies. From a research perspective, technology advances at the physical&lt;br/&gt;layer usually introduce new problems at the networking layer that cannot be&lt;br/&gt;addressed by simply extending existing theories and algorithms. In many cases,&lt;br/&gt;due to the disruptive nature of new physical layer technologies, problems at&lt;br/&gt;the network level are extremely challenging and call for the development of new&lt;br/&gt;theories and algorithms. Such new theoretical developments usually require&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary expertise in networking, wireless communications, algorithms,&lt;br/&gt;and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this workshop is to gather a group of researchers from&lt;br/&gt;multiple disciplines to explore the important issues involved in developing a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive future research agenda to bridge the gap between wireless&lt;br/&gt;networking technologies and advances at the physical layer. A final workshop&lt;br/&gt;documenting the presentations, discussions, summary, and recommendations of the&lt;br/&gt;two-day workshop will be made available for public dissemination via a web&lt;br/&gt;site. Our expectation is that such findings will offer timely input to the&lt;br/&gt;wireless networking research community, and will have a long-term impact on&lt;br/&gt;future research.</AbstractNarration>
