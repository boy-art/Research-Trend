    <AbstractNarration>PI: Michael R. Sussman &lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Jean-Michel Ane, Joshua Coon, and Gheorghe Craciun &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medicago truncatula is a nitrogen-fixing annual legume related to alfalfa that has emerged as an excellent research organism for studies of how plants perceive and adjust to changes in their environment. Its plasma membrane is the interface between the outside world and the cellular milieu; it is where special ""receptor"" proteins perceive diffusible extracellular signals and transduce this information into the critical intracellular changes needed for successful symbiotic nitrogen fixing nodule formation. Recent genetics studies have identified key proteins in the plasma membrane and nucleus required for this process, but the mechanism by which the signal traverses the cytoplasm remains unknown. The goal of this project is to develop and use cutting edge genomic technologies, including phoshoproteomics, metabolomics and DNA chips, to determine the important molecular events by which the plasma membrane transmits information on Nod factor occupancy within the receptor, to the underlying cytoplasm. Data generated through this project can be accessed through the Wisconsin Medicago Group web site (http://medicago.wisc.edu/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. In close collaboration with UW''s NSF-sponsored Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL) and the Delta program in Research, Teaching, and Learning, the project will develop TESci, a technology education (TE) program using novel pedagogy (K-12) to engage both academic and nonacademic students in science and technology. The goals of TESci are to: (1) foster an interest in the sciences among those least likely to become engaged in scientific research, (2) develop technology skills among college-bound science students, and (3) instill the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and diversity in science. To accomplish these goals the project will bring together faculty, students, and infrastructure from three institutions: Madison East High School, Madison Area Technical College (MATC), and UW-Madison, all of which are located within a 5-mile radius. Faculty and students from each of these institutions will engage in course development, classroom instruction, and program evaluation. By participating in the chemistry and outreach components of this proposal, graduate students supported by this award will formally learn how to integrate research and teaching so that they will be well positioned to become tomorrow''s leaders of research and education. It is the hope that, with TESci, this project will create a hub of excellence for the integration of science and technology education - one that will provide a model for Wisconsin and the nation.</AbstractNarration>
