    <AbstractNarration>There appear to be critical behavioral and neural differences between a parent and a non-parent, or a good parent versus a bad parent. Because of the vast diversity in paternal responses across mammalian species, paternal responsiveness will be the focus of this project which will determine the underlying brain and hormonal mechanisms of parental nurturing responses. Specifically, Peromysus californicus, a monogamous, bi-parental species that exhibits full paternal care toward their offspring will be compared to Peromyscus maniculatus, a species that typically does not exhibit paternal care. These studies will compare the neuronal activation of brain circuits following pup-exposure and will examine the number of newly proliferated cells in the brain. Since vasopressin and oxytocin are neuropeptides known to be involved in affiliation processes, vasopressin and oxytocin distributions in the brain will be measured and the levels of these neuropeptides in circulation will be assessed to determine the plasticity of the nurturing response, even in mammals that are not predisposed toward paternal affiliative responses. Information related specifically to the characterization of the paternal response or, more generally, to enhanced social motivation will have implications for understanding complex social responses (e.g., nurturing and affiliative responses) in various species. During the course of these studies, a high priority will be placed on the recruitment and training of undergraduate students in all phases of the project. Further, the PI will serve as a mentor for a post-doctoral assistant interested in a subsequent career establishing an engaging undergraduate neuroscience research program.</AbstractNarration>
