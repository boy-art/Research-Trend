    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide five years of support so that the United States can participate in the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) program of the Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP). SCOSTEP's main goals are to facilitate collaboration across nations and discipline areas in order to advance understanding of the Sun-Earth system, which includes space weather and climate. SCOSTEP was formed as a Scientific Committee under the International Council of Scientific Unions in 1978 and is charged with the long-term responsibility to promote international interdisciplinary programs in solar-terrestrial physics. SCOSTEP facilitates cross-project cooperation, cross-disciplinary conferences, and multi-national research collaboration with the scientific goal of advancing quantitative understanding of coupling mechanisms responsible for the transfer of mass and energy throughout the solar-terrestrial system. The practical goal is to improve predictability of the effects of the variable components of solar energy and disturbance on the terrestrial environment. These disturbances range from interference with satellite and aircraft communications systems, to blackouts of electric power grids. The project will allow SCOSTEP to continue to play an important role in advancing discovery in the field of solar-terrestrial physics, especially regarding international collaboration, as well as its efforts to integrate research and education in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate serves to facilitate U.S. input to SCOSTEP as needed and is the conduit for payment of required annual dues. SCOSTEP dues are critical to support the full range of SCOSTEP activities in promoting and coordinating international programs in the field of solar-terrestrial physics.</AbstractNarration>
