    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This CAREER project addresses a key materials science challenge of the nanoscale science and engineering: developing ability for precise control of nanomaterials structure, size and uniformity and their dopant distribution on the atomic level in order to achieve desired functionality. The research goals are to understand materials science that governs synthesis and doping of semiconductor nanowires and to explore their properties for nanoscale electronics and photonics. The project is comprised of the following interrelated sub-topics: (1) Growth of semiconductor nanowires and nanowire heterostructures with desired structural, optical, magnetic, and electronic properties. New growth facilities will be developed at MIT in order to rationally synthesize semiconductor nanowires and nanowire heterostructures in a controllable fashion. (2) Development of advanced electron microscopy techniques for direct correlation of structural and physical properties at a high spatial resolution. Heterostructure interfaces and dopant distribution will be studied, for example, using aberration corrected Z-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. (3) Development of devices such as nanowire-based electrical-injection single photon sources, lasers, and high-electron mobility transistors.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance, and is expected to provide new scientific understanding of the nanoworld and potentially contribute to the extension of the information technology revolution. The research component of the project is closely integrated with the educational component. The PI plans to develop a new course "Imaging of Materials" and to create three new laboratory modules for the class "Materials Laboratory" at MIT. She will design and create research and educational internship opportunities for students and high-school teachers, and organize a series of outreach seminars "Nanotechnology for Beginners." It is also planned that materials created through the education/outreach activities will be posted on an interactive Wiki-based web page.</AbstractNarration>
