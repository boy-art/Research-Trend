    <AbstractNarration>Cutkosky will investigate four projects: toroidalization, local monomialization and ramification&lt;br/&gt; of surfaces in positive characteristic, asymptotic properties of powers of ideals and semigroups&lt;br/&gt; of valuations on local rings. In toroidalization, the main conjecture is to show that any dominant morphism&lt;br/&gt;of varieties can be made into a toroidal mapping, or a local monomial mapping, by blowing up nonsingular&lt;br/&gt; subvarieties in the domain and range. Cutkosky will extend his recent work proving the conjecture for 3-folds,&lt;br/&gt;towards a general proof of the conjecture. On the problem of ramification in positive characteristic,&lt;br/&gt;the proposer has found with Oliver Piltant stable forms of mappings between germs of characteristic p surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;Cutkosky proposes to refine the formulation of these forms, and apply them to a study of ramification of maps&lt;br/&gt; of surfaces in characteristic p. Cutkosky will continue his work on computing asymptotic properties of Hilbert &lt;br/&gt;type functions on functors of powers of ideals. Cutkosky also seeks to understand the semigroups which can&lt;br/&gt;occur as the value semigroup of a (possible noetherian) valuation dominating a noetherian local domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebra is of increasing importance in modern science and technology. Cutkosky will investigate&lt;br/&gt;several problems of theoretical importance in the general area of Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The main objective is to understand the structure of polynomial mappings, and systems of &lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations. Cutkosky will train undergraduate and graduate students, and mentor young&lt;br/&gt; researchers through this project.</AbstractNarration>
