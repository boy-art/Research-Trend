    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to interface Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) nanoelectronics and conventional electronics. As scaling of CMOS nears its end it is imperative to find new devices to overcome the problem of power density. Quantum-dot cellular automata is a promising new paradigm, however, silicon transistors have so many advantages that nanoelectronics must be made to interface to CMOS. The approach, a collaboration of groups at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Virginia, is to integrate conventional amplification and interface circuitry on-chip with nanoelectronic circuits grown using guided self-assembly of SiGe quantum dot molecules. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is in its investigation of the little-explored interface of nanoelectronics and CMOS. Although power dissipation will limit CMOS in high-performance circuits, it will be used in circuit blocks far into the future. This project will move the field forward by integrating the growth of GeSi QCA cells into the CMOS fabrication sequence. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed project will have a broader impact in both technology and education. Interfacing nanoelectronics and CMOS circuitry should enable the electronics industry to move beyond CMOS. The project will shape the experience of the graduate and undergraduate students through research, study, and mentoring others. An important component is an outreach program targeting middle school students through classroom activities, and field trips to bring students to the Notre Dame labs. Middle school aged children are an excellent group for outreach since they are still making choices about their areas of interests.</AbstractNarration>
