    <AbstractNarration>Current model predictions show radically altered forest compositions in North America occurring in response to global climate perturbations over the next 100 years. These predictions are predicated on our current understanding of how global climate changes will alter certain fundamental ecosystem parameters (e.g. temperature, soil moisture) and how individual tree responses are likely to manifest themselves in tree recruitment, growth, and mortality given those changes. Prior studies show that urbanization causes interspecific differences in regeneration, growth, and mortality patterns compared with similar rural forests and mathematical models predict that forests under urban conditions will develop distinct compositions and overall biomass loss unlike those of forests currently existing or predicted by forest theory. This proposal requests support for a new faculty member to develop a research program that will untangle the relationship between North American forests and impending changes associated with global climate change. The long-term research plan being developed utilizes a combination of research techniques to train undergraduate student researchers to advance student appreciation and application of environmental issues encountered in modern society. The proposal requests funding to build a forest research laboratory at Endicott College, which will include funding for equipment, supplies, and funds to support undergraduate research at Endicott College and field work in Louisville, Kentucky.</AbstractNarration>
