    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is to hold a Grantees Workshop from April 30 thru May 2, 2007 on the University Nevada-Reno campus in support of the Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) Division of NSF. University researchers who received ECCS grants in FY2004 will be provided travel funds to participate. Underrepresented faculty members from minority serving institutions in the State of Nevada and surrounding areas will be identified and invited to attend. The workshop proceedings will be made available to NSF and participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The workshop provides opportunities for researchers supported by the ECCS Division to highlight their research to an audience that would otherwise not be reached. It will provide a forum for open discussion and establish a dialogue between current and future ECCS supported researchers. The faculty members from minority serving and EPSCoR institutions will have an opportunity to interact with other Division grantees and facilitate future collaborations. The organization of poster sessions will provide ample opportunity for interaction among the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The workshop will provide significant opportunity for exchange of ideas and for forming collaborative activities between researchers with differing technical and institutional backgrounds. There will be a focus on enhancing diversity to enable ECCS program directors as well as participants to interact with faculty members of minority serving institutions that is not easily achievable through other means.</AbstractNarration>
