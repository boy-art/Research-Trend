    <AbstractNarration>Most studies examining the consequences of biodiversity loss focus on plant species and assume that all species have an equal likelihood of extinction. The goal of this proposal is to understand how biodiversity loss of animals affects the ecological properties of temporary pond ecosystems. Furthermore, this work considers the consequences of biodiversity loss by recognizing that species of lower abundance are more likely to become locally extinct than more abundant species. The investigator will achieve this goal over a five-year period by 1) conducting surveys of natural ponds, 2) conducting experimental reductions of biodiversity in artificial ponds, and 3) using survey data and experimental results to develop models describing how biodiversity loss affects ecological processes operating in natural ponds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The loss of biodiversity is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing our planet. The work outlined in this proposal will advance our understanding of how natural patterns of biodiversity loss will affect temporary pond ecosystems. Furthermore, the work in this proposal focuses on 1) a type of ecosystem (temporary ponds) that is being destroyed or substantially altered at large scales as the result of human activities, and 2) a group of animals (amphibians) that has recently been experiencing a rapid decline in abundance and diversity. Finally, this project will also offer research opportunities for middle and high school students.</AbstractNarration>
