    <AbstractNarration>The project studies the long time behavior of solutions of nonlinear wave equations. It focuses on finding minimal hypotheses under which the solitary wave solutions of Schr√∂dinger, Hartree, and Klein-Gordon equations are asymptotically stable. In addition, the work will investigate the decomposition of solutions into solitary and scattered waves (asymptotic completeness), as well as energy transfer among these waves. The research will not only develop new dispersive estimates for the semigroup of operators generated by the linearization around solitary waves whose shape is changing in time, but will also develop mathematical techniques to translate these estimates into results on the long time dynamics of the full, nonlinear equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wave equations are ubiquitous in quantum mechanics, statistical physics, optics, and acoustics, and they model certain phenomena in fluid dynamics, mechanics, and biology. Nonlinear wave equations support solitary waves, which are the building blocks for modeling such diverse phenomena as Bose-Einstein condensates, the propagation of information through optical fibers, and the formation of tsunamis. The detailed dynamics of these physical systems are still not fully understood. This project aims to create a mathematical theory for these phenomena and, more generally, for the long time propagation and interaction of solitary waves. It will focus on specific models from statistical physics and nonlinear optics, but the theory is expected to be sufficiently robust to apply to wave equations arising from models in other areas of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
