    <AbstractNarration>The Arkansas EPSCoR research infrastructure improvement project builds on the research strengths of its universities and supports State goals for an entrepreneurial economy fueled by a highly skilled workforce and innovative knowledge-based industries. The Arkansas ASSET (Advancing and Supporting Science, Engineering and Technology) Initiative builds two statewide infrastructure platforms: the Wireless Nansoensors Center and the Plant-Powered Production Center. Both multi-institutional Centers conduct interdisciplinary, cutting edge research with relevance to industry. Both Centers have significant technology transfer potential and use cutting edge technologies that can position them for regional and national prominence. A broad array of educational and training programs focus on improving learning, attracting top scholars, and forming new connections with industry that enhance the training of Arkansas' next generation of science and technology workers. Each Center includes researchers from the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville, the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, and Arkansas State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wireless Nanosensors Center establishes an infrastructure to design and develop arrays of nanosensors that are integrated with wireless systems and can be fabricated on specialized low-cost nanofabrication technology. Its foci are development of nanosensors and technologies onto organic electronic systems for power generation; preservation of food, enhancing of flavor, and sensing of spoilage; and large scale wireless networking of nanobiosensors and nanoneural devices. The Wireless Nanosensors Center is intended to be a user facility that fosters collaborations among academic research and industry partners. The Plant-Powered Production Center employs multi-institutional, cross disciplinary teams that use diverse technologies to explore key research challenges in plant-based production of proteins, metabolic engineering and bioproduction of important phytochemicals, and plant stress responses both to direct and to optimize biosynthetic capabilities. This Center is intended to be a statewide virtual facility with direct implications for the agricultural economy Arkansas, the Delta region of the Southern states and nationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ASSET Initiative makes significant investments in a broad range of programs to strengthen human capacity across the State and to ensure a pipeline of scientifically and technically literate students and employees for the 21st century. The Human Resource Development and Community Outreach Plan coordinates a variety of capacity building programs with economic impact. Several programs cultivate the "entrepreneurial mindset" and expand the knowledge base required for enabling researchers to pursue commercialization of intellectual property and innovative devices. Other programs focus on strengthening Arkansas' science and technology pipeline to address State and regional workforce issues by increasing numbers of women and individuals from underrepresented minority populations. These pipeline programs include activities that integrate research and education for K-12 students and teachers, as well as for undergraduate and graduate students. Education capacity is also strengthened through new faculty hires, mentoring programs, "Room and Board" sites at each campus to facilitate inter-campus faculty and graduate students exchanges, an Access Grid seminar series, discipline-specific regional and national meetings, and electronic access to scientific journals.</AbstractNarration>
