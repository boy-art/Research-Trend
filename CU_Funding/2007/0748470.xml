    <AbstractNarration>In this CAREER proposal the PI proposes to further investigate how nature harnesses and controls light energy to meet the diverse demands of life processes using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) that has only recently become possible at optical frequencies. 2DES provides femtosecond time resolution, allowing the fastest processes to be captured, while containing the information derived from conventional nonlinear spectroscopies as a subset. With this tool, the PI will study the design principles of two key biological systems: the reaction center of photosystem II, and DNA. 2DES studies of photosystem II aim to unravel the complex sequence of energy and charge transfer that enable oxygenic photosynthesis, while in DNA, 2DES promises a detailed view of the mechanisms that furnish its genetic robustness. The educational component of this proposal aims to encourage students, educators, and the general public to appreciate the biophysical questions surrounding them and to help them make connections to the underlying physics. The PI will target introductory physics classes where hands-on demonstrations illustrating such connections will be used in an interactive teaching context. To help physics students appreciate biophysics, several experiments will be added to the advanced undergraduate laboratory, including an optical tweezers setup. The proposal also aims to promote a positive image of science through public education, and in particular to encourage women and minorities to enter careers in science through outreach activities and mentored undergraduate research. The proposed research will have impact on the design of artificial light-harvesting systems as well.</AbstractNarration>
