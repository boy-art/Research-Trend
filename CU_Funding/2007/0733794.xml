    <AbstractNarration>The Noyce Mathematics Education Teaching Scholars (Noyce METS) aims to increase the number of highly qualified mathematics teachers prepared at North Carolina State University (NCSU) with a major in a mathematical science and a major in mathematics education that emphasizes content and pedagogical content knowledge in a way that builds understanding of mathematics needed for teaching. These scholars are prepared to become leaders in technological innovation to improve student understanding in mathematics classrooms, and are committed to working with students in high-needs schools. One goal of the Noyce METS program is to increase the number of undergraduate students pursuing a double major that results in a B.S. in Mathematics or Statistics and a B.S. in Mathematics Education -- an option currently available at NC State. The Noyce METS program also enables STEM professionals with a bachelors or masters degree in a mathematical science to earn 9-12 mathematics licensure, either through a licensure only track to earn an initial license, or through a masters program where they earn initial and advanced licensure. The project is supporting 17 undergraduate Noyce Scholars and 15 post-baccalaureate Scholars. During their participation in the NC State programs, the Noyce Scholars engage in special seminars which draw upon the expertise of faculty in the Mathematics Education, Mathematics and Statistics Departments, and the College of Education. Seminars highlight uses of technology for teaching mathematics (particularly in Geometry, Calculus, and Statistics), culture and diversity in the classroom, and issues of teaching in rural and urban settings. The design of the project is purposeful in helping teachers develop strong content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and specialized mathematical knowledge for teaching. The NCSU Mathematics Education program includes a strong component of high quality, rigorous content courses from the mathematical sciences departments and requires mathematics education courses that, by far, exceed the number required at most institutions. The mathematics education courses integrate research on teaching and learning mathematics and the pedagogical content knowledge specific to mathematics education.</AbstractNarration>
