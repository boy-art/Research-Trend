    <AbstractNarration>LAURA JONES BOTTOMLEY North Carolina State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Laura Jones Bottomley has been a mentor and supporter of students from underrepresented groups since 1991 beginning at Duke University and continuing in 1997 at North Carolina State University. Dr. Bottomley has created a mentoring pipeline that can serve as a national model for K-12 outreach and support of underrepresented students at all levels. Dr. Bottomley initiated science curriculum reform for all elementary schools in Wake County, North Carolina. She conceived of and leads the statewide "Engineering on the Road Program". Through a tiered-mentoring process, with the help of undergraduate engineering students, she provides hands-on engineering activities to 25,000 students annually. Her N.C. State engineering students act as mentors to K-12 students. Training resources are also provided to the K-12 teachers to improve student success in the study of mathematics. She has developed elementary and middle school camps that support underrepresented students. She instituted "Family Math Nights" at churches and schools for underrepresented families and mentors fifteen third, fourth and fifth grad underrepresented students weekly in science. She also implemented the peer-mentored Women in Engineering Program at North Carolina State University.&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Bottom and a colleague envisioned and implemented a K-12 division within the American Society of Engineering Educators governance structure. She has disseminated her work through many publications and through invited talks, seminars, and workshops. Dr. Bottomley has impacted tens of thousands of students and teachers at all levels: K-12 students, undergraduate students, graduate students, K-12 teachers, university instructors and university researchers through mentoring, teaching and advising.</AbstractNarration>
