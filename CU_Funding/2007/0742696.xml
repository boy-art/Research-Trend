    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: Dispersal Limitation as a Primary Factor in &lt;br/&gt;Determining Ectomycorrhizal Community Structure &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-Berkeley &lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 12/04/07 &lt;br/&gt;Ectomycorrhizal fungi are obligate mutualists with temperate forest trees such as pines, &lt;br/&gt;oaks, aspens, and birch. These fungi provide mineral nutrients to the trees in exchange &lt;br/&gt;for sugars, and trees require them for growth and survival. Following severe &lt;br/&gt;disturbance such as forest fires or logging, trees need to reestablish their relationships &lt;br/&gt;with mycorrhizal fungi in order to survive. Prior work has shown that these fungi arrive &lt;br/&gt;in an ordered sequence, or "succession", after such disturbances. A new model is &lt;br/&gt;proposed to explain this observed pattern through differences in spore dispersal and &lt;br/&gt;competitive interactions among mycorrhizal fungi. Four key predictions of this model &lt;br/&gt;concerning limitations to aerial spore dispersal and effect of tree root density on fungal &lt;br/&gt;competition will be tested through a combination of field sampling and manipulative &lt;br/&gt;growth-chamber experiments. The broader impacts of this work are that it will help us &lt;br/&gt;understand an essential biotic process necessary for tree establishment, and will build a &lt;br/&gt;foundation of basic ecological knowledge for an important group of understudied &lt;br/&gt;organisms. Training of graduate and undergraduate students will be an important &lt;br/&gt;component of this research. In addition this work takes advantage of its location within &lt;br/&gt;Point Reyes National Seashore by feeding back into management decisions within the &lt;br/&gt;park and through outreach efforts directed towards public education.</AbstractNarration>
