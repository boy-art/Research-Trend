    <AbstractNarration>EEC-754117&lt;br/&gt;Amy W. Lang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award provides support for a three-year REU Site at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa (UA). The proposed REU site will engage undergraduate students in cutting-edge research in fluid mechanics with projects implementing both computational and experimental analysis tools. This topic of study is an ideal choice for a cross-disciplinary program because fluid dynamics is highly relevant to a wide array of research areas in engineering. Ten faculty will participate as research mentors. These faculty mentors represent the departments of Aerospace Engineering &amp; Mechanics, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Construction and Environmental Engineering and Chemical &amp; Biological Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will include seminars on defining the experimental method, lab safety, ethical conduct in reporting data, discussion of error analysis and how to formulate a research plan. To enhance the hands-on research experience, a variety of professional development activities have been incorporated in the program. These include: 1) technical report writing; 2) oral presentations; 3) the application process for graduate school and preparation for taking the GRE. In addition, students will participate in several field trips including a tour to the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), the most advanced and largest complex of flight simulation test facilities in the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program incorporates and aggressive recruitment plan for attracting 50% female and other underrepresented groups as students into the program. It is the goal of this REU to expose students to a diversity of research areas, while providing a venue where students can disseminate their results and interact with other professionals in an enriching environment. One of the primary objectives of the program is that students attend and present an abstract (oral or poster) at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS DFD) annual conference held each year in November. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The involvement of students in exciting research in fluid mechanics enhances the likelihood that they will consider post-graduate study and broaden the base of the Nation's technical manpower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EHR/EPSCoR).</AbstractNarration>
