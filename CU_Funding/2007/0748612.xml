    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award funded by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program supports work by Professor Jared Anderson at The University of Toledo to develop novel microextraction approaches to study the solvent properties of ionic liquids - low melting point salts that possess many useful chemical and physical properties. Dr. Anderson's group examines the interactions of molecules with ionic liquids in order to study and design new classes of task-specific ionic liquids for applications in separation science. They also explore the ion-exchange properties of ionic liquids, with an aim of tuning extraction selectivity. The knowledge gained from this research will aid in the development of newly designed ionic liquids for various interdisciplinary applications, such as extracting sulfur-containing compounds from diesel fuels, selectively removing environmentally toxic metal ions, sequestering carbon dioxide, and regenerating cellulose for the production of bio-fuels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Anderson is also working to expand the undergraduate- and graduate-level chemistry curricula at The University of Toledo by modernization of the chromatography and separations laboratory. Professor Anderson is an active participant of the American Chemical Society Project SEED program, and actively recruits women and minorities through participation in various outreach programs. He is developing an internet-based interactive program to provide demonstrations of various science-related topics as a means of enhancing the public image of chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
