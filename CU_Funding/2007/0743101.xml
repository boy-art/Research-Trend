    <AbstractNarration>Interactions between species that benefit both species are known as mutualisms. Mutualisms are integral components of many communities and have been directly and indirectly involved in creating earth's biodiversity. Despite their importance and widespread occurrence, there is still a need to understand how mutualisms are influenced by the local community in which they exist. Mutualisms are thought to be carefully balanced interactions where the benefits of the interaction exceed the costs. This project will empirically test theoretical predictions concerning how community members affect the costs and benefits received by mutualists. The well-known pollination mutualism between yuccas and their pollinating moths will be used to test these predictions. Researchers will conduct experiments in natural populations and make genetic estimates of plant reproduction to examine how the presence of other species influences the cost-benefit ratio of this mutualism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the study will provide important tests of how mutualisms persist when mutualists simultaneously interact with a variety of species. The research will also incorporate a community perspective into a well-known interaction that is commonly used in biology textbooks as an example of mutualism and pollination. Furthermore, the research will support an educational outreach project aimed at creating a web-based teaching module for 3rd-5th grade students and will provide Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test format material for educators.</AbstractNarration>
