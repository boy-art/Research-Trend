    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE), with co-funding from the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), supports the renewal of an international Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site between the Syracuse University (SU) and Graz University of Technology (TUG) in Graz, Austria for the summers of 2008-2010. The U.S. program will be directed jointly by Professors Karin Ruhlandt-Senge and Michael Sponsler of SU. In Austria, Frank Uhlig, head of the Inorganic Chemistry institute at TUG, will be responsible for running the TUG program. Twelve U.S. undergraduates will travel to TUG to participate in a ten week chemistry research program. Six of the U.S. students recruited will be supported with NSF funds and SU will support an additional six U.S. students. In addition, TUG will support ten Austrian students to travel to the U.S. to do summer research at SU. The Austrian students will be included in the domestic REU program at Syracuse University. U.S. students will be able to choose a chemistry research project in the area of inorganic, organic, physical, theoretical, analytical, biochemistry, radiochemistry, or chemistry and technology of inorganic and organic materials. Student activities in Graz are modeled after the domestic SU REU program. Near the end of the program, students will present their results both orally and in poster sessions. A capstone event held in October will reunite the U.S. students for a reception and a symposium in which they will describe their scientific accomplishments and cultural insights.</AbstractNarration>
