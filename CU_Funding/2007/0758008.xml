    <AbstractNarration>The understanding of the non-perturbative aspects of gauge theories, such as confinement and the mass gap, are two outstanding problems in theoretical physics. The PI and collaborators have developed a Hamiltonian approach for Yang-Mills theories in (2+1) dimensions The PI proposes to further study higher order corrections to the calculated string tension and the corresponding effect on the Casimir scaling rule. She hopes to improve preliminary analytic results on the glueball spectrum of the theory, and apply these ideas to study deconfinement at finite temperatures. Another project that the PI will investigate is the Quantum Hall effect (QHE) in higher dimensions. It is hoped that this research will provide a rich framework for studying new ideas on fuzzy spaces, noncommutative field theories, matrix models and bosonization in higher dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;The completion of this project is expected to contribute considerably to our understanding of the nonperturbative aspects of gauge theories; the emerging connections between QHE, fuzzy spaces, noncommutative field theories, matrix models and bosonization in higher dimensions open up new interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;paths between different areas such as quantum field theory, string theory, condensed matter physics and mathematical physics. Lehman College, CUNY, is a predominantly undergraduate institution with a large number of female (72%) and minority (78%) students. The PI acts as a role model for the students and is very involved in curriculum development. She has developed a course on the Physics of Sound which has attracted many Music Majors at the College as well as Speech Majors.</AbstractNarration>
