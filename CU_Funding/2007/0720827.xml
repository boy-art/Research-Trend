    <AbstractNarration>Parallel machines of high capability are being designed and built to run Software for scientific and engineering modeling. This project is conducting research to create a simulation environment that allows applications to be developed, tested and tuned via simulation of the future machine, while allowing machine designers to tune their architectural choices to benefit a specific collection&lt;br/&gt;of applications. It aims at simulating petascale machines with over a million processor cores. The project builds upon previous research on migratable objects, and a preliminary simulation system developed in earlier research. The software developed in this project is being distributed via the Internet, and consists of an emulator and a simulator. The emulator allows application developers to develop and test their application in a realistic petascale environment and generate traces for the simulator. The simulator uses the traces, along with a model of the architecture, to generate detailed performance data that can be used to tune the applications and to analyze the architectural choices under realistic application loads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software for Scientific and Engineering modeling can make a significant impact on society through better understanding of physical phenomenon and improved design of engineered artifacts. The results of this project, including the simulation software, will lead to effective use of the petascale computing facilities being developed and deployed nationally, for such software. It will reduce delays in software tuning. The project will also help train a new generation in techniques for effectively harnessing large parallel machines to society's goals.</AbstractNarration>
