    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I research project proposes the enhancement of an existing set of modeling, analysis, design, and monitoring tools for use in the medical domain so that safe, reliable systems can be assembled from plug-and-play medical devices. This project addresses important problems in building medical systems out of medical devices. The existing toolset which draws upon theory in several fields with the goal of formalizing the design and evaluation process, is important for providing quantitative analysis of systems built from medical devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to impact the medical device plug-and-play standard. By providing tools for the design and analysis of medical systems, the project has the potential to improve the quality of such devices and perhaps expand the development of such systems.</AbstractNarration>
