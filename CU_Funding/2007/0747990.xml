    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program supports work by Professor Joshua Coon at the University of Wisconsin - Madison to develop new technologies to characterize the many isoforms and modified versions of gene products generated within living cells. Adaptation of top-down proteomic technologies will provide rapid, robust characterization of whole proteins on a time-scale of less than ~2 seconds/protein. A novel electron transfer dissociation (ETD) enabled linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer recently constructed in the Coon laboratory will be enhanced by a new high capacity linear RF quadrupole, which will serve as a dedicated ion/ion reaction cell to allow the needed rapid analyses, enabling routine coupling of top-down proteomic measurements for proteins up to at least 70 kDa with chromatographic separations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program also entails development of novel K-12 pedagogy that demonstrates the synergy between design (technology) and inquiry (science) in a format that engages both academic and non-academic students. This program ("TESci") combines a diverse group of students and educators to tightly link technology education (TE) and the sciences through an interdisciplinary, team-learning environment. The program is cross-cutting and aims to: (1) foster an interest in the sciences among those least likely to become engaged in scientific research, (2) develop technology skills among college-bound science students, and (3) instill the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and diversity in science. The TESci program will create a hub of excellence for the integration of science and technology education - one that will provide a model for Wisconsin and the nation.</AbstractNarration>
