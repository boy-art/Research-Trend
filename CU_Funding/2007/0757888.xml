    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on the detection of exoplanets from gravitational microlensing events. Towards this end, a series of activities will be undertaken as extensions to Dr. Gould's previous work and in support of ongoing searches for new exoplanets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gould leads the Microlensing Follow Up Network (micro-FUN), a collaboration of amateur and professional astronomers that searches for planets in high-magnification microlensing events. Micro-FUN has detected 5 of the 7 microlens planets, including a 'cold Neptune' and the first Jupiter-Saturn analog system, both from parameter space that is not accessible to other planet-search methods. Dr. Gould will continue this work, both organizing observations and leading the interpretation of the rather complex light curves that bear planetary signatures. The detection rate is expected to increase from the current level of 2 per year because of improved surveys as well as work carried out here. Because microlensing is probing regions of parameter space not covered by other methods, new surprises can be expected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this project, a semi-automated pipeline for high magnification events will be developed. This will in part allow the collaboration to concentrate resources on high magnification events. It will speed up the extraction of planetary parameters from the light curve data as well. Dr. Gould will also begin a careful analysis of selection effects required to begin to draw statistical conclusions on planet frequencies from microlensing detections. Additional projects include searches of all publicly available data for short-timescale events that otherwise might be missed and a new investigation of parallax effects on high magnification events. Finally, the PI will continue to seek target of opportunity spectroscopy of bulge dwarfs during magnification events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects here will lead to the training of a graduate student who will be an integral part of the program. Also, under Dr. Gould's guidance, microlensing has become one of a handful of areas in which amateurs are making a major contribution to astronomy. Dr. Gould will focus substantial effort on raising the public's scientific awareness of microlensing and exoplanets through the continued participation of amateurs in microlensing studies.</AbstractNarration>
