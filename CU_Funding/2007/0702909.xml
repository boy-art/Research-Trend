    <AbstractNarration>This project is delivering a series of professional development workshops designed to assist community college science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty in preparing successful proposals to the National Science Foundation (NSF) programs. The project represents collaboration between the Council for Resource Development (CRD), an affiliate council of the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), and the National Center for Telecommunications Technology (NCTT). NCTT brings its expertise in the delivery of online and web-based professional development programs to support expanded faculty outreach via special content webinars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The activities continue a highly successful model of faculty professional development focusing on NSF grant programs and the production of high quality grant applications by community college faculty. CRD is using its regional structure to leverage the identification of host colleges while ensuring the participation of large numbers of STEM faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The selection of sites and the scheduling of workshops are national in scope. Particular attention is being given to those states whose community colleges are underrepresented among NSF awardees. A key goal is to increase the submission rates of faculty as well as increase the likelihood of success. An evaluation is assessing the longitudinal impact of the project. A research study is designed to assess factors that promote faculty success.</AbstractNarration>
