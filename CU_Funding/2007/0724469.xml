    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes the development of ultracapacitor devices that combine the use of nanostructured carbon electrodes with organosilicon electrolytes. These innovative ultracapacitor devices are expected to provide higher working voltages than existing devices, yielding significantly increased energy and power density. This Phase II project will use laboratory results to develop prototype devices and address issues associated with scale up and development of procedures for creating prototype devices. These ultracapacitor devices will be characterized for long-term use by evaluating their physical properties and stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The size of the ultracapacitor market, already surpassing $200M, continues to grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 15%. The development of improved ultracapacitor energy storage devices should accelerate this growth by facilitating the commercial development of low-emission vehicles, which should reduce the overall demand for energy. Organosilicon-based electrolytes should improve the overall safety profile of ultracapacitor devices due to their low flammability and low vapor pressures. The improved safety and improved physical characteristics will expand opportunities for the use of ultracapacitors as robust energy storage devices in consumer electronics and industrial applications. This work will also assist in the development of a trained workforce by involving graduate students and postdocs in the research and development effort.</AbstractNarration>
