    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the researchers will pursue new algorithmic and mathematical tools that may redesign the basic components of a new Internet architecture, starting from a clean slate, rather than finding incremental solutions, compatible to the legacy infrastructure. This approach will introduce rather radical and unconventional approaches. In fact, the work is inspired by the work that is done, almost entirely, outside of the networking community. Specifically, they plan to leverage a number of algorithmic breakthroughs in the fields of learning theory, combinatorial optimization, distributed computing, and online algorithms that provide a different perspective for designing many components of a new Internet architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the topologies, traffic patterns, and application requirements on future clean-slate networks are highly uncertain at the moment, this suggests creating a technology-independent architecture of the future Internet, with the emphasis on solving basic intellectual challenges in a rigorous analytical way. The researchers will thus pursue a systematic study of technology-independent, theoretically-validated, and model-independent components of the future Internet architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the researchers will focus on the basic architectural components, such as maintaining the Routing Metric and designing proper flow control mechanisms. These components must be capable of supporting heterogeneous resources allocation, including the wireless periphery. Additional important consideration is security: protecting the routing structure against Denial-of-Service (DoS) and potentially even Byzantine attacks. They issues are closely related to each other. For example flow control must ensure stability of distributed load sensitive re-routing which is essential for security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: As a result of this work, the future Internet will be much more robust, both in terms of security and in terms of ability to support applications with quality of service guarantees. Many applications, e.g., medical teleconferencing, virtual classrooms, military applications and others will be enabled by new Internet architecture. These new applications will have broad impacts on society as a whole.</AbstractNarration>
