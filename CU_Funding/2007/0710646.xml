    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the technical and commercial viability of a state-of-the-art enabling system for measuring sheet resistance in thin films and nanostructures for microelectronics applications at the nanoscale. The proposed micromachined four-point probe (FPP) overcomes the resolution limitations of other techniques. The team's goal is to develop a FPP with electrode widths &lt;1 micron, electrode spacing &lt;1 micron, ultra-low spring constant for non-destructive measurements, and the ability to scale up to multiprobes for higher throughput. The company leverages experience in AFM probe microfabrication and strong industry contacts. In this proposal key engineering and application challenges will be addressed. A 6-mask microfabrication process will be used to batch manufacture probes with predictable and repeatable performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology is a very promising emerging field and the US Government is actively investing in it. Measurements in nanometer scale devices and structures are of both scientific and industrial importance. The proposed tool will facilitate basic research by enabling the observation of electrical phenomena that are not well understood at the nanometer scale by providing an inexpensive and simple to operate tool for electrical characterization. The short length scales give rise to unique electrical properties, which cannot be observed using existing methods. The proposed system offers much in terms of educational and scientific benefit by advancing the study of nanotechnology and by helping in better understanding electrical phenomena at the nanoscale. The FPP fills a critical need in integrated circuits and nanotechnology that rely on sub-micron microscopy, as it provides the user with a superior measurement system to aid researchers in studying new properties.</AbstractNarration>
