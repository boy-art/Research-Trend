    <AbstractNarration>The growth in globalization across traditional language boundaries suggests a need for efficient second language (L2) acquisition training regimens. One of the most significant challenges for adult language learners is learning to hear fine distinctions among non-native sounds not used in the native language; such learning may require decades of experience with the second language. A classic example is the difficulty native Japanese have learning English /r/ and /l/, a sound contrast not present in Japanese. With prior NSF support, Drs. Holt and Lotto have uncovered principles of auditory learning using controlled experiments with non-speech sounds and have used these principles to design optimal training regimens. This project uncovered how characteristics of training, feedback and presentation mode affected auditory learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present project will apply these findings to adult learning of non-native speech sounds, with the aim of producing more efficient L2 learning. One series of studies will investigate the benefits of video-game-based training (found to foster non-speech category learning) in learning non-native speech sounds. Another series of experiments will test whether manipulation of the variability of sound cues, found to be important in non-speech auditory learning in prior research, is effective in shifting the attention listeners give to these cues in second-language learning. Such shifts appear to be important for many cases of L2 learning, such as native Japanese speakers learning English /r/ and /l/. Beyond practical application in adult second language learning, the project has important theoretical implications for understanding human auditory perception and language processing. Such understanding is a prerequisite to developing rehabilitative techniques for disorders such as autism, dyslexia, central auditory processing disorder and specific language impairment.</AbstractNarration>
