    <AbstractNarration>The eighteenth in a series of Atomic Physics Gordon Research Conferences will be held at the Tilton School in Tilton, New Hampshire from July 1 to July 6, 2007. This meeting will continue the tradition of dealing with emerging areas of research and major advances in existing areas of atomic physics and related fields. The areas to be addressed include both theoretical and experimental developments, with emphasis on topics that offer significant challenges and opportunities. The conference will emphasize the continuing trend in atomic physics of strong intersections with other areas of physics. One objective of the conference is to bring together internationally leading scientists as well as young researchers and students active or specially interested in the field of Atomic Physics. This award provides support for student and postdoctoral fellow participation in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
