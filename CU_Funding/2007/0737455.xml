    <AbstractNarration>Assessment/Research (91)&lt;br/&gt;This project is engaged in the validation of a measurement model and the development of an assessment tool for measuring quantitative literacy of undergraduate students. Notions of quantitative literacy have been studied in several international studies (e.g., TIMSS). Many colleges and universities in the US have quantitative literacy requirements for all undergraduate students; however, in both research and educational situations, quantitative literacy is most often conceptualized and measured solely in terms of mathematics achievement. Such a conceptualization assumes that achievement alone can indicate a person's preparedness to function in a quantitative society. A more complete measure of quantitative literacy requires capturing both cognitive and affective aspects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are both analytical and community focused. The analytical goals are: (1) to validate a current measurement model of quantitative literacy, and (2) to develop and make available a reliable and valid tool for assessing quantitative literacy. In addition, this project is nurturing a collaborative infrastructure for current and future research and development between four- and two-year college faculty and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Although the notion of quantitative literacy is familiar within the mathematics community, there is no current measurement model or assessment tool that captures both the cognitive and affective aspects of this construct. This project is working to remedy that lack, thereby improving the assessment of student quantitative literacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Findings from this project will expand the ideas of mathematics education beyond traditional notions of achievement to encompass other aspects of learning associated with students' mathematical maturity. A better understanding of quantitative literacy will make it possible to better prepare teachers and teacher educators to provide meaningful learning experiences within mathematics and other quantitative courses that promote all aspects of quantitative literacy.</AbstractNarration>
