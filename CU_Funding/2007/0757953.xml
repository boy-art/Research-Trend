    <AbstractNarration>This project involves a series of precision measurements of individual atoms interacting with ultrastrong laser pulses. In these laser pulses, the electric field is much stronger than the electric fields holding the atom together. The studies will result in a set of detailed, high-dynamic range measurements of the field-atom interaction. The science has direct bearing on topics fundamental to ongoing experiment and theory efforts in atomic, molecular, and optical physics including multi-electron phenomena, magnetic field-atom interactions, relativistic dynamics, and ultrafast X-ray radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The frontiers of ultra-intense laser science stretch across plasma physics, fusion science, atomic physics, optical science, laser technology, and attosecond X-ray radiation. Practical future applications of the research include providing measurements for processes within laser fusion and laser based accelerators. These basic science measurements also provide a footing for future radiation source development and applications. Radiation from ultrastrong fields has characteristics not possessed by traditional X-ray sources. Such new X-ray sources are needed to visualize reaction pathways and dynamics at the molecular and electronic level not observable with conventional techniques. Teaching and training in modern optics is enhanced by developing undergraduate laboratory and lecture demonstrations. These new resources include holography, diffractive and micro-optics for students in engineering and physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
