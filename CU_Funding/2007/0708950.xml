    <AbstractNarration>Understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way''s present spiral structure must necessarily begin with observations. However, the Galactic structure is not easy to interpret because of the multiple choices of tracer objects and varied observational approaches used in many studies. To spatially separate distant stellar structures is a complex experiment in which the quantity, quality, and completeness of the observational data and their reliable interpretation play a critical role. In this context, Dr. Kaltcheva (University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh) will employ a precision photometry approach, utilizing uvby-Beta photometry of two types of tracer objects, OB associations and clusters and A-F-G bright giants/supergiants, with complete homogeneous samples and careful consideration to calibration that will result in a greatly improved determination of some aspects of the Galactic spiral structure, particularly regarding the star formation processes along the spiral arms and tracing the Galactic features to large distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this research has a potential broad contribution to the field of astronomy, the program itself is also feasible for execution by faculty and students in a primarily undergraduate institution, where the work will take place. The individual projects in the program are designed such that small parts can be isolated as independent research tasks, which can be accomplished by students of varying skill levels in reasonable amounts of time. A primary goal is to provide students with a positive learning experience and an introduction to the process of scientific investigation. In addition, the special Stromgren-HBeta filters (to be acquired as part of this project) will also be made available to the astronomical community.</AbstractNarration>
