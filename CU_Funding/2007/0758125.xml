    <AbstractNarration>We seek to develop computationally feasible theoretical methods that provide a model-independent, microscopic description of atomic nuclei with controllable theoretical errors across a wide range of nuclei. This project is highly relevant to forefront problems in nuclear physics, such as the physics of nuclei far from stability, where controlled extrapolations away from stability are essential but have been lacking in theoretical approaches to date. The development of improved calculations with theoretical error bars will be necessary to provide guidance for the next generation of rare isotope beam facilities and reliable nuclear physics input for astrophysical applications. Our primary tools to accomplish the objectives of this project will be the Renormalization Group, which enables the forces between nucleons to be evolved to a softer form that is more convenient for large-scale computations, and Effective Field Theory, which provides a model-independent and systematic organization of inter-nucleon forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broader impacts by fostering inter-disciplinary connections and helping to build a strong and youthful scientific community in the United States. The complementary techniques of Effective Field Theory and the Renormalization Group are widely used in many areas of theoretical physics due to their universality and power of simplification. Therefore, our use of these modern and general techniques will enhance interactions with other disciplines such as condensed matter, atomic, and high energy theory. Similarly, the use of coupled-cluster and energy density functional methods for nuclei in this work will foster connections with quantum chemistry. Finally, the current project will provide graduate students and postdocs with a good balance of formal (analytical) and practical (numerical) work, which will serve as excellent preparation for a career in industry or academia.</AbstractNarration>
