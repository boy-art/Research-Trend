    <AbstractNarration>This study will characterize fluid composition and microbial community structure, define chemical and biological processes at South Chamorro Seamount, and constrain background physical and hydrogeologic conditions. Collection and analysis of the suite of samples and data will provide the foundation to (1) address pathways for mantle alteration and microbial functioning (e.g., AOM, H - oxidation), (2) constrain rates of abiotic and biotic mineral alteration and alteration mechanisms, (3) describe microbial abundance, diversity, metabolic rate, and ecological roles in this naturally occurring highly alkaline (pH 12.5) and sulfide-rich solution, (4) conduct culture enrichment studies, and (5) begin to understand how the hydrologic and mud flow systems respond to tectonic forcing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impacts of this project include incorporation of education in research, through the involvement of graduate students. There is also a significant potential benefit to the broader scientific community in this work, and there is an important growing international collaboration as well.</AbstractNarration>
