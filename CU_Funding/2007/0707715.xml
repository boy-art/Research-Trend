    <AbstractNarration>Healey&lt;br/&gt;0707715&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies several multi-phase problems of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear elasticity, with applications to lipid-bilayer&lt;br/&gt;membranes, shape-memory alloys and thin films. A common thread&lt;br/&gt;running through these problems is the following mathematical&lt;br/&gt;structure: a non-convex potential energy in the lower-order&lt;br/&gt;terms, which includes the loading, in addition to a small,&lt;br/&gt;higher-order regularization (or singular perturbation),&lt;br/&gt;characterized by a small parameter e &gt; 0. The main goals of this&lt;br/&gt;work are: (1) to provide classes of rational models --&lt;br/&gt;particularly in the case of multi-phase lipid-bilayer membranes&lt;br/&gt;-- for understanding the often exotic behavior of such&lt;br/&gt;structures; (2) to systematically find equilibria corresponding&lt;br/&gt;to local minima of the total potential energy or meta-stable&lt;br/&gt;solutions. In addressing (1), observe that mechanical&lt;br/&gt;experiments on real materials often begin with a homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;specimen that progressively develops increasingly complex&lt;br/&gt;patterns or micro-structure under steady, quasi-static changes in&lt;br/&gt;loading. The investigator employs rational continuum models,&lt;br/&gt;characterized by general constitutive functions, and looks for&lt;br/&gt;thresholds of bifurcation and exchange of stability to compare&lt;br/&gt;with experiment. In particular, meta-stable solutions are the&lt;br/&gt;ones presumably observed in quasi-static experiments. &lt;br/&gt;Accordingly for (2) he considers a new methodology based upon:&lt;br/&gt;(a) rigorous existence of solutions for arbitrarily small e &gt; 0&lt;br/&gt;via symmetry-breaking global bifurcation methods and a-priori&lt;br/&gt;bounds; (b) efficient and reliable global numerical&lt;br/&gt;path-following to find meta-stable states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project focuses on fundamental modeling and predictive&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis for the quantitative characterization of&lt;br/&gt;shape and deformation patterns of certain micron-scale structures&lt;br/&gt;under applied loading, namely, lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles,&lt;br/&gt;shape-memory alloys and thin films. Each of these has direct and&lt;br/&gt;important connections to basic science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;Lipid-bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems;&lt;br/&gt;understanding and predicting their mechanical behavior is crucial&lt;br/&gt;for understanding cell function. The project focuses on simple,&lt;br/&gt;man-made membranes or liposomes. The future promise of liposome&lt;br/&gt;vesicles (closed membranes) as vehicles for drug delivery demands&lt;br/&gt;a fundamental understanding of their mechanical behavior under&lt;br/&gt;loading. Likewise for phase transitions in shape-memory alloys&lt;br/&gt;and wrinkling/blistering of thin films -- a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;understanding and the mathematical prediction of their behavior&lt;br/&gt;are important for characterizing the mechanical properties of&lt;br/&gt;novel materials and for potential sensing and actuation at the&lt;br/&gt;micron scale.</AbstractNarration>
