    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0748063, Pasaogullari&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC) are among the strong candidates for next generation, clean, and potentially fossil fuel independent energy conversion technologies. Membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) consists of multiple thin film media, and is the heart of a PEFC. The electrochemical reactions and bulk of the transport phenomena that govern PEFC operation occur in this assembly of thin film media. In thin film media, surface to volume ratio is very high; therefore surface properties and interfacial transport have significant impact on transport processes, and consequently on PEFC operation, performance and durability. The goal of this project is, through a combined computational and experimental study, is to develop an understanding of the effects of interfaces and surfaces on the transport phenomena and operation of PEFCs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This CAREER development plan will explore the fundamental transport processes that occur at the interfaces and surfaces of PEFC thin film media. The research will focus on two different length-scale interfaces: (i) a micro-scale interface between the thin films, e.g. micro-porous layer ? gas diffusion layer interface; and (ii) a nano-scale interface within the catalyst layers, Pt catalyst-ionomer-gas pore interface. The project will be approached in the following manner:&lt;br/&gt;1. Both micro-scale and nano-scale interfaces will be characterized by imaging facilities operated by several national laboratories, and digital reconstruction of these interface using the obtained images will be performed. The digital reconstruction enables the computational analysis on actual microstructures of the interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;2. Built on the digital reconstruction of the actual microstructure of the interfaces, computational models describing the multi-phase transport processes will be developed. These models will describe the processes at the interfaces at a detail that is currently impossible to experimentally investigate. The models developed for micro-scale interfaces will be validated by non-intrusive neutron imaging experiments.&lt;br/&gt;3. Educational Integration: The research program will be integrated into an existing senior level undergraduate elective course on fuel cells, as well as into a newly developed course focusing on the transport phenomena in fuel cells. In addition to course development, research programs that are designed for hands on research experience will be developed for high school students.&lt;br/&gt;Through the proposed computational and experimental study, a detailed knowledgebase on the transport phenomena across the interfaces will be built, which will enhance the current understanding of the transport phenomena in PEFCs, and will aid the fuel cell component designers in developing durable, low cost and high performance membrane-electrode assemblies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research will result in an improved understanding of the effects of the interfaces and their role on operation and performance of PEFC systems. This understanding will provide a significant leap in further development of polymer electrolyte fuel cells, which reduce the need for foreign energy resources, provide energy security and environmentally friendly energy generation technology. The research efforts are integrated with the education and outreach activities, which targets not only undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Connecticut, but high school students and teachers as well as general public, by developing educational modules that focus on benefits of fuel cells and renewable energy.</AbstractNarration>
