    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0754078, Russel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our recent work offers a solid understanding of the mechanics controlling consolidation and cracking of immobilized, i.e. close packed, colloidal dispersions that deform nonlinearly and viscoelastically due to contact or interfacial forces. Our model identifies, in terms of appropriate dimensionless groups, the conditions under which air-water, polymer-water, or polymer-air interfacial energies suffice to form homogeneous void-free or porous films as thin layers of aqueous dispersions dry on a rigid substrate. The model also predicts the capillary pressure above which cracking becomes favorable, when deformation is too slow to keep up with evaporation, as the elastic energy recovered when a crack opens exceeds the additional surface energy expended. Complementary experiments with polymer latices and inorganic oxide colloids in a pressure filtration cell permit direct measurement of the negative capillary pressures required for cracking, demonstrating that many packings do not crack until the capillary pressure exceeds significantly the minimum predicted for an infinite crack. Further experiments and theory establish the importance of flaws to nucleate cracks, as for linearly elastic solids under tension. This work provides a foundation for addressing a remaining puzzle and two related challenges. &lt;br/&gt; First, crack tips following a drying front in a thin film develop a characteristic spacing and often advance in the direction of the gradient in capillary pressure in a stick-slip fashion. This suggests an additional dynamical process, which some attribute to the flow of water driven through the particle packing by gradients in the capillary pressure. To elucidate the pattern selection process we propose two experimental geometries with controlled propagation of gradients, complemented with analysis of the dynamic process through an extension of the existing model. A thin rectangular channel confines evaporation to the open ends and allows cracks propagating in from the ends to be viewed through the flat faces via a microscope. Alternatively, the pressure filtration cell mentioned above can be tilted slightly to create a gradient in thickness of a thin layer with a free surface but without the lateral flows caused by nonuniform evaporation. Cracks nucleated by notches at the thick edge then should propagate toward the thin edge with increasing capillary pressure. &lt;br/&gt; Second, some technologies require highly porous films that cannot be dried at the desired thickness without cracking, raising the question of how to maintain capillary pressures for cracking above those attainable with menisci at the surface of the film. For this purpose we propose to study films formed with colloidal rods for which random packing creates pores larger than the rod diameter, thereby reducing the maximum capillary pressure relative to random close packing of spheres of the same diameter. Success will depend on whether the effective modulus of the packing, which controls cracking, does not fall enough to negate the benefit. Experiments with colloidal rods of boehmite, either bare or stabilized with a silica coating, in the pressure filtration cells will determine the critical capillary pressures as a function of film thickness to assess the potential. &lt;br/&gt; Third, we intend to explore film formation and cracking in the pressure filtration cell for binary mixtures of hard and soft spheres with interactions tuned to delay percolation of the hard phase to as high a volume fraction as possible. This effort, using the same experimental tools as above, will be guided by theory being developed to understand the recently discovered ?halo? effect due to electrostatic attractions between small highly charged polymer latices and larger electrically neutral inorganic spheres. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies in the creation of a solid fundamental basis of understanding and using that to devise new avenues for the technology. Success in understanding these phenomena should benefit drying processes important to technologies ranging from conventional (but always improving) architectural coatings, through tape casting processes for fabricating ceramic substrates and multilayer devices, to carefully tailored particulate coatings for inkjet papers. The research provides broader impact by posing a stimulating vehicle for educating graduate students and undergraduates for careers in the chemical and related industries.</AbstractNarration>
