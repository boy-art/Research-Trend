    <AbstractNarration>This award is to support a workshop sponsored by the NSF Engineering and Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorates, to be held in Arlington, VA on June 7-8, 2007. This workshop will bring together theorists, experimentalists, and engineers from industry, academia and national laboratories to assess the state-of the-art in the field of molecular electronics, to identify the best path forward, and to delineate the challenges along that path. Specifically, the workshop will begin with a series of plenary talks followed by breakout sessions in three main areas: Theory; Molecular Measurements; and Pulling it Together: Molecules and Self-Assembly. The goal is to produce a web-accessible report that will detail the current challenges and opportunities in the field of molecular electronics, and the expected progress that a multidisciplinary approach can achieve. This workshop will have a broader impact in that many of the high profile accomplishments to date in the field of molecular electronics are the result of single investigators working on a small part of a large interdisciplinary program. This workshop will enable synthetic chemists, device engineers, theorists, and researchers in industry and national laboratories to work together to advance the field.</AbstractNarration>
