    <AbstractNarration>When the Internet protocols were standardized in the late 80s, most distributed applications were point-to-point, such as email, telnet, and ftp. Over the last few years, the nature of Internet traffic has changed dramatically. Driven by the production and distribution of vast amounts of user-created content, current Internet traffic is overwhelmingly many-to-many, leading to a mismatch between application demand and the underlying protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to develop a peer-to-peer solution, called OneSwarm, to serve as a universal communication layer for multi-point communication. By relying solely on software running on end-hosts, OneSwarm will avoid the high operational cost of infrastructure solutions and the deployability issues of clean-slate redesigns to the network architecture. Among the open questions that need answers: can swarming techniques work and meet desired levels of service quality when content files are no longer large, when there are strict deadlines on delivery, when the communication is not all-to-all, or when different nodes have different needs, all without working at cross-purposes to ISP objectives? This proposal will also investigate incentives to encourage end hosts to contribute resources to support demanding applications, by allowing users to trade resources across time, across swarms, and across applications.</AbstractNarration>
