    <AbstractNarration>Translation of mRNA into protein is an essential molecular process of cellular metabolism. Plant protein synthesis is similar to that of other eukaryotes, but there are differences. The presence of the isozyme form of eIF4F and the apparent lack of regulation by 4E binding proteins (primary regulatory point in mammalian translation) suggest that plants have some fundamental differences, particularly in the regulation of initiation of translation. Elucidating the roles of the isoforms of eIF4F in plants will provide a better understanding of how plants regulate the production of proteins which will lead to improved plants that resist environmental insults or virus infection, and provide better quality protein for food. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will be used for the training of high school, community college, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students and the results disseminated through publication and the Factors In Arabidopsis Translation (FIAT) website. The training of undergraduates will be through the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI). The FRI teaches freshman about research and trains them to do research in what are called "research streams". The PI is a stream leader for 25 freshmen students. The students are trained in methods relevant to the PI's research and contribute to the PI's overall research and specifically will contribute to the proposed project. One of the goals of the FRI is to attract and retain students in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
