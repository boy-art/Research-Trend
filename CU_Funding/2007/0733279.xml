    <AbstractNarration>This project will undertake exploratory research on the relationships between digital conversion guidelines for Image Digital Libraries (IDL) and end-user judgments about the quality, integrity, and value of IDL content. The locus of the research is on significant collections of digitized surrogates of photographic resources in the Library of Congress's American Memory collection, a very large, internationally significant library. The focus of investigation in this exploratory research is the judgments of ""visually intelligent"" expert-scholars in several distinct disciplines, an area that has received little or no attention in the research literature but that is becoming increasingly central to the assessment of the value added through the creation of image digital libraries.</AbstractNarration>
