    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;An experimental study into the origins of anisotropic thermal conductivity of solid&lt;br/&gt;polymers is proposed. In particular, a relationship between the molecular structure of&lt;br/&gt;the polymer and the resulting macroscopic properties is sought. It has already been&lt;br/&gt;established that (1) deformed, cross-linked elastomers exhibit an anisotropic thermal&lt;br/&gt;conductivity tensor, k (2) the tensor k is linearly related to the extra stress tensor,&lt;br/&gt;for the polymer in the same state, and (3) the constant of relation for these two&lt;br/&gt;quantities exhibits a universal value of 0.03, independent of chemistry for the few&lt;br/&gt;systems studied, when properly made dimensionless. In this work a set of experiments&lt;br/&gt;has been designed that will distinguish between competing theories to describe these&lt;br/&gt;observations. A non-invasive optical technique called Forced Rayleigh Light Scattering&lt;br/&gt;to examine novel material states is used. Results will necessarily distinguish between&lt;br/&gt;competing theories on the origins of the effect.&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study will have broad impact on the transport modeling of advanced&lt;br/&gt;materials containing plastic. While previous work showed how non-isothermal&lt;br/&gt;modeling of liquids requires an additional complexity because of anisotropy, it also&lt;br/&gt;suggested that this complexity could be easily modeled through use of a phenomenological&lt;br/&gt;relation to stress. The current work, if successful, should determine if similar&lt;br/&gt;principles apply to the solid polymer during cooling.&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;An experimental study into the origins of how heat flows differently in different&lt;br/&gt;directions for solid polymers, such as plastic, is proposed. In particular, a relationship&lt;br/&gt;between how the molecules are behaving and the resulting heat-flow properties&lt;br/&gt;is sought. In this work a set of experiments has been designed that will distinguish&lt;br/&gt;between competing theories to describe these observations using a non-invasive optical&lt;br/&gt;technique called Forced Rayleigh Light Scattering. Results will necessarily distinguish&lt;br/&gt;between competing theories on the origins of the effect.&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study will have broad impact on the modeling of advanced materials&lt;br/&gt;containing plastic. While previous work showed how temperature modeling of these&lt;br/&gt;liquids requires an additional complexity, it also suggested that this complexity could&lt;br/&gt;be easily modeled through use of a simple relation to stress which is typically calculated&lt;br/&gt;already. The current work, if successful, should determine if similar principles&lt;br/&gt;apply to the solid polymer during cooling.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, as part of the project, a display explaining the key optical technique employed&lt;br/&gt;will be provided to the Holography Museum in Chicago. Visitors will learn that&lt;br/&gt;holography is used to study material properties, and how the technique is employed.</AbstractNarration>
