    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program Prof. Pavel Anzenbacher seeks the preparation of sensor arrays for analyzing multiple anionic analytes utilizing single-molecule assembly composed of an anionic dye tethered to a receptor moiety. While in the resting state the anionic dye is bound by the receptor, in the presence of an analyte the dye is displaced from the receptor. The receptor-bound and free dye have different optical properties (color, fluorescence), the Indicator-displacement sensor will change color or fluorescence, thus signaling the presence of analyte.&lt;br/&gt;The dye-displacement sensors will be cast into multi-sensor arrays either as blends with the inert polymer or covalently attached to beads designed to form polar hydrophilic environment that resembles biological environments (proteins, membranes). The performance (limit of detection, dynamic range, linearity, discriminatory capacity, etc.) of the sensors will be tested in water and in competing electrolytes, and applied to analysis in biological fluids. The results will be compared to data obtained by ion chromatography as a reference method. The sensing data will be processed using pattern recognition methods, quantitative analyses will be performed using artificial neural network analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This design of sensors for complex anionic analytes could result in the development of assays for multiple anions as well as other analytes in complex environments such as biological fluids. Developing this concept and answering related fundamental questions regarding the synergy between receptors and polymeric carriers in the sensing process is of fundamental importance as well as of interest to the scientific community. The information on ion transport in organic quasi-monolayers and thin films will contribute to the knowledge on artificial ion-transport channels. Technological implications could be harnessed in diverse fields including education, chemical industry (aqueous environments analysis), and medicine (e.g. drug analysis in biological fluids). The ease of preparation and flexibility of the method is perceived as a major asset as it would allow for rapid screening and low-cost materials and sensor devices.</AbstractNarration>
