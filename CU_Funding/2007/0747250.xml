    <AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to study constraint satisfaction problems like&lt;br/&gt;Max-Cut, Max-2-Sat, Vertex-Cover, and Chromatic-Number. For many of&lt;br/&gt;these problems, the boundary between efficiently-achievable&lt;br/&gt;approximation ratios and NP-hard approximation ratios is unknown. The&lt;br/&gt;PI has a 3-point plan to determine these boundaries:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Use recent connections between semidefinite programming algorithms,&lt;br/&gt;integrality gaps, and property testing to determine precise&lt;br/&gt;boundaries, assuming the "Unique Games Conjecture."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Define and explore new, more efficient property-testing--based&lt;br/&gt;hardness reductions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Prove the Unique Games Conjecture, using the new&lt;br/&gt;property-testing--based reductions along with ideas from the theory of&lt;br/&gt;Parallel Repetition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader goal of this line of research is to give more efficient&lt;br/&gt;and more effective algorithms for the fundamental algorithmic tasks&lt;br/&gt;like network partitioning, constraint satisfaction, and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will explore the limits of how well efficient algorithms can&lt;br/&gt;solve these problems. Proving "hardness results" or limitations on&lt;br/&gt;the capabilities of efficient computation has positive practical&lt;br/&gt;consequences. For one, it prevents wasted effort in trying to improve&lt;br/&gt;unimprovable algorithms. More importantly, by carefully isolating the&lt;br/&gt;aspects of algorithmic tasks which make them difficult, we are often&lt;br/&gt;led to new, effective algorithms for solving the tasks when these&lt;br/&gt;aspects are not present.</AbstractNarration>
