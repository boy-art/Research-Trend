    <AbstractNarration>Herschel A. Rabitz of Princeton University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop new theoretical concepts for the control of quantum phenomena and the extraction of mechanistic and other physical information from the control process. The main components of this research program are theoretical analyses of controlled quantum phenomena and developments of laboratory executable algorithms for the control and analysis of quantum phenomena. The research involves fundamental studies to identify the relevant topological features of the control cost function landscapes. New experimental control algorithms are under development to enhance efficiency, identify control mechanisms, extract molecular interactions, examine quantum electron transport in semiconductors, and control single-molecule quantum control experiments. This work is having a broader impact in its associated implications and applications in the laboratory. Interdisciplinary collaborations are underway with researchers in the chemistry, physics and applied mathematics communities in several countries worldwide. A new course on quantum control for science and engineering students is in preparation.</AbstractNarration>
