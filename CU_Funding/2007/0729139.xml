    <AbstractNarration>Gravity and seismology are often used as predictive tools in volcano monitoring, but usually are not integrated. This SGER project will investigate gravity and seismic signals that are potentially useful for monitoring but thus far have received relatively little attention: continuous microgravity and seismic emissions. The researchers' hypothesis is that, because both are deformation related (albeit at different time scales) there could be a correlation between the two, and that combined analysis of the two signals will be a more effective predictive tool than either one is alone. Analogous correlations between seismic emissions and global positioning system [GPS] in different tectonic environments provide motivation as well. They will study the summit crater of Kilauea volcano. In particular, there is abundant evidence for active fluid flow well documented as transient deformation events, very long period seismicity, and seismic tremor. They will collect continuous relative gravity and GPS data and analyze it with seismic information. If successful, the work could spark interest in extended microgravity arrays and more comprehensive seismic analysis. The project will support a new, female researcher, undergraduate research experience, and bring new insights into volcanic hazards.</AbstractNarration>
