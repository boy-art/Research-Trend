    <AbstractNarration>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) control many different processes in cells including cell death, stress responses, aging and cancer. Because the potential risk of oxidative stress is common to all aerobic organisms, elucidating the ROS-signaling network of plant cells would have a significant impact in medicine and agriculture. The long-term goal of the project is to dissect the ROS signaling network of cells and determine how ROS signals are sensed and transduced in plant cells. The experimental approach employed in the program will be to use a combination of genetic, molecular, biochemical and bioinformatic research tools to identify, clone and characterize different genes involved in ROS signaling in cells. The identification of genes involved in ROS sensing, the pathway for ROS signaling, and the collection of ROS-mutants, generated during the course of the proposed research, would serve as a valuable resource for the entire scientific community. The information generated from the project will enhance overall understanding of plant biology, and help determine to what extent and in what manner ROS are involved in different biological process. Broader impacts. To increase interest and understanding of science in young people, high school students and undergraduates, including minorities, will be recruited into the project and trained in ROS biology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. This project will provide training to 2 graduate students, 8 undergraduates and 8 high school students. In addition, four 1 week summer workshops, 25 high school students each, are planned for the duration of the grant. The proposed project will provide interdisciplinary training that has become imperative for success in plant sciences. To enhance the awareness of high school students, teachers and undergraduates, two teaching-oriented websites targeted to high school students and undergraduates, and an online presentation targeted to high school teachers will be developed to share knowledge and enhance awareness to ROS metabolism in plants, mammals and other organisms.</AbstractNarration>
