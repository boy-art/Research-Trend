    <AbstractNarration>This research builds a unified computational framework for scalable and high &lt;br/&gt;efficiency solution of elliptic partial differential equations. The &lt;br/&gt;investigators develop a novel high-order multiscale multigrid computation &lt;br/&gt;methodology, which combines high accuracy computation and fast computing methods &lt;br/&gt;in a seamless way. This research work may impact many computational science &lt;br/&gt;and engineering and industry modeling and simulation applications. As U.S. &lt;br/&gt;high-tech industry moves from experiment-based design and development to &lt;br/&gt;computer-assisted design and development, higher performance numerical &lt;br/&gt;methods and faster computer simulation techniques will benefit U.S. industry &lt;br/&gt;by enabling design and development engineers to conduct quick verification &lt;br/&gt;to test their new ideas on computers, before committing to expensive &lt;br/&gt;experiments. These technologies are essential for the U.S. industry to &lt;br/&gt;maintain its leadership position in the competitive world market. Graduate &lt;br/&gt;students, including members from underrepresented groups, are trained to &lt;br/&gt;become the next generation researchers and educators with solid scientific &lt;br/&gt;computing skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technique simultaneously advances the numerical solution &lt;br/&gt;of partial differential equations in two fronts. One is to compute high &lt;br/&gt;accuracy solution by using high-order discretization methods, another is &lt;br/&gt;to compute the discrete solution in a minimum amount of computer time &lt;br/&gt;by using the fastest sparse linear system solvers. This unified framework &lt;br/&gt;advances the two fronts collectively by fusing the ideas and advantages &lt;br/&gt;of multiscale discretization and multigrid computations, to achieve &lt;br/&gt;the ultimate goal of computing accurate numerical solution at the &lt;br/&gt;minimum computer costs. It is the convergence of years of research work &lt;br/&gt;by many researchers in several different areas. This computational &lt;br/&gt;framework possesses high accuracy, high speed, high scalability, and &lt;br/&gt;delivers optimal efficiency for computing the numerical solution of &lt;br/&gt;elliptic partial differential equations.</AbstractNarration>
