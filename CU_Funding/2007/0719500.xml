    <AbstractNarration>Graduate student Anna Pagano, supervised by Dr. James Holston, will undertake research on the social effects of the increasing medicalization of "race" in Brazil. She will investigate the relationships between a new focus on racial health disparities within Brazilian health policy, social movement discourses, and Brazilian perceptions of racial and cultural difference. Her test case will be a large social movement that propagates the government's new stance on race and health within communities across Brazil. She will conduct a comparative ethnographic study of this movement in Sao Luis and in Sao Paulo, two strikingly diverse cities in the Northeast and Southeast of Brazil. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will employ a variety of ethnographic data collection methodologies, including participant observation, semi-structured interviews, surveying, focused group interviews, and textual analysis. These data will be used to test four major hypotheses concerning the movement's uses of race and religion to construct a collective health-related identity, the movement's linkage of race to health outcomes, the movement's reception by local communities, and the impact of regional demographic variations on community reception. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There exists an extensive social science literature on emic understandings of race in Brazil, frequently described as a racial democracy because it rejects a bipolar black and white view of race. However, little is known about how these understandings may be altered through recent exposure to race-medicalizing discourses. By investigating how a social movement links race to health outcomes, this research will advance social science theory concerning the relation between collective identities and contemporary practices of genomics and re-biologized theories of race. The research will improve understanding of how race-medicalizing discourses take shape through policy initiatives, processes of social mobilization, and resulting transformations in citizens' attitudes concerning race and health. The research also will contribute to the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>
