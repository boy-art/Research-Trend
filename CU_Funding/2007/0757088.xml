    <AbstractNarration>This historic Hispanic Serving Institution is acting as a strong conduit for students from local high schools to four year schools. Recruitment and retention efforts include concurrent enrollment in high school and college courses with credit available for both, a summer enrichment program and other remedial programs particularly in mathematics, opportunities for industry internships with local industry, and a mentoring program as well as workshops to help faculty gain mentoring skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is based on successful pilot efforts to increase science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) major enrollment and retention. It is expanding the talent pool of STEM students by providing a proactive project that creatively utilizes the resources of a regional four-year college and of the local school districts. An underserved population of students, many of them minorities and with little financial resources, is receiving baccalaureate level training at minimal expense and in a culturally friendly environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project has specific activities designed to interest a local population to enroll in STEM related programs and to interest them in and prepare them for enrollment and graduation from affiliated four year schools. They are targeting as potential students not only high school students but also, through association with local unemployment offices, people who might be able to consider a STEM education as a pathway to a new career. This geographic area is among the poorest economic regions of the country and contributes heavily to the state's low standing in per capita income. The project is making strong efforts to make the local population aware of the potential of a STEM career and of the project's activities.</AbstractNarration>
