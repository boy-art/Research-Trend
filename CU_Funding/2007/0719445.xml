    <AbstractNarration>The evolution of molecular mechanisms controlling embryonic development remains poorly understood. Previous research points to parallelisms, convergences and character reversals. Although these evolutionary phenomena are potentially widespread, attempts to explain them at the molecular level are hampered by limited knowledge of the developmental genetic context in which they occur. Embryonic pattern formation of Drosophila is widely used as a reference system to understand the evolution of genomic regulatory networks. Extensive knowledge about axis specification and early development in Drosophila provides an excellent starting point for comparative developmental genetic studies. A closely related species that exhibits significant developmental genetic differences has not been available, but would strengthen this young discipline. Previous work points to a conserved role of the gene bicoid in patterning the anterior embryo of higher flies (Cyclorrhapha), but new results strongly suggest that within this group, Episyrphus (a representative member of hover flies, i.e. Syrphidae) lacks this gene. Episyrphus shares this and other developmental traits with lower flies, raising the question of how to merge phylogenetic and developmental genetic data into a consistent picture of fly evolution. Dr. Schmidt-Ott''s research focuses on the developmental genetic characterization of genes likely to be involved in axis specification in Episyrphus, and on developing technology to functionally compare regulatory DNA of this and other fly species. His long-term goal is to advance understanding of evolutionary mechanisms at the molecular and genetic level. He also strives to provide research opportunities for undergraduate students, which he recruits from a spring course on ''''Developmental Genetics and Evolution''''. This course is designed for biology majors who intend to pursue research careers and he has successfully recruited undergraduates from this course to work in his laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
