    <AbstractNarration>This award supports research on improving optical coatings for next generation interferometric gravitational wave detection, Advanced LIGO and beyond. The peak sensitivity of Advanced LIGO is limited by thermal noise from the optical coatings applied to the Advanced LIGO test masses. In other words, the rate at which we can expect to detect gravitational wave events with Advanced LIGO goes up as coating thermal noise is reduced. Another significant noise source due to the optical coatings and affecting the rate of potential detections is thermo-optic noise from the optical coatings. In addition to the significant effect on Advanced LIGO, these noise sources place serious limits on the potential for future ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors. This award supports research to characterize and reduce the level of both thermal noise and thermo-optic noise from prototype coatings for Advanced LIGO and for potential future upgrades to Advanced LIGO. Other coating properties, such as optical scatter are also investigated when appropriate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is a technically oriented institution attracting a large number of undergraduate physics students interested in participating in faculty research. This award enables a number of those students, particularly in the space physics degree program, to engage in a very significant way with LIGO-related research. Several Embry-Riddle students involved in the P.I.'s research have gone on to participate in external LIGO-related internships such as the LIGO SURF program at Caltech and as undergraduate researchers at Glasgow University in Scotland. These experiences help to propel our students to fruitful carears in science and research.</AbstractNarration>
