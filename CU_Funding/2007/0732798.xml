    <AbstractNarration>Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and associated universities are developing a practice-based curriculum for the professional education of preservice and practicing secondary mathematics teachers that 1) focuses on reasoning and proving, 2) has narrative cases as a central component, and 3) supports the development of knowledge of mathematics needed for teaching. This curriculum is comprised of eight constellations of activities that focus on key aspects of reasoning and proving such as identifying patterns; making conjectures; providing proofs; and providing non-proof arguments. Each constellation is a set of practice-based activities that are anchored by a mathematical task or set of related tasks. The activities are developed as cases that portray events that unfold in a high school mathematics classroom. Teachers analyze and discuss the cases with other teachers as a way to increase their mathematical knowledge and to develop their ability to understand how students will react to specific tasks. The cases are pilot tested, revised, field tested and revised again before being published. Dissemination includes collaboration with professional organizations and publication.</AbstractNarration>
