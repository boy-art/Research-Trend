    <AbstractNarration>Securing Active Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When multiple parties attempt to collaborate, they often end up having to&lt;br/&gt;compromise the confidentiality of their private information. Cryptographic&lt;br/&gt;primitives like secure multiparty computation and obfuscation are aimed at&lt;br/&gt;mitigating this situation. We view many such problems as part of a unifying&lt;br/&gt;paradigm that we call Active Information: various parties in a system can have&lt;br/&gt;access to prescribed actions of the information in the system, but nothing&lt;br/&gt;more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first focus area of the project is secure multiparty computation, which&lt;br/&gt;lets mutually distrusting parties emulate a commonly trusted party, by means&lt;br/&gt;of a protocol. We identify and investigate crucial properties required for&lt;br/&gt;this to be useful in practice: "network-awareness" addresses issues that arise&lt;br/&gt;in a realistically complex environment, and a new class of "context-awareness"&lt;br/&gt;features are vital in integrating secure multiparty computation into a larger&lt;br/&gt;application. We also derive insight into the fundamental nature of various&lt;br/&gt;multiparty computation tasks by classifying them into complexity classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another focus of this project is on "secure active objects" that offer far&lt;br/&gt;more flexibility in their use, compared to protocols. We study well-known (but&lt;br/&gt;little understood) concepts like obfuscation, as well as new tools we develop&lt;br/&gt;like "remotely primed obfuscations," and "active encryptions," and also&lt;br/&gt;features like anonymity and unlinkability that are important for applications.&lt;br/&gt;Secure active objects also serve as a platform to integrate the study of&lt;br/&gt;hardware-based security solutions into the theory of cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools developed span a wide spectrum, ranging from low-level algebraic&lt;br/&gt;techniques used in constructions, to high-level frameworks for conceptualizing&lt;br/&gt;security definitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards bringing the subtle concepts from theoretical cryptography to a&lt;br/&gt;broader audience of current and future practitioners, two online resources are&lt;br/&gt;being developed: (1) a wiki-based tutorial/reference website, and (2) a blog&lt;br/&gt;aimed at students and a non-specialist audience.</AbstractNarration>
