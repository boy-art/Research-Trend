    <AbstractNarration>The main objectives of this project are: (A) the development of a parameterization method to determine particle nucleation rates with uncertainty bounds from vertically resolved field data, including the 2004 New England Air Quality Study (NEAQS); (B) a sampling campaign that ties together extensive ground-based measurements with information from aircraft vertical profiles; and (C) application of the method to new and existing data to predict new particle formation (NPF) in the continental troposphere. The sampling plan will leverage existing ground-based measurements and utilize vertical profiling tools from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in particular their light aircraft Airborne Aerosol Observatory, AAO. The project includes ten months of ground-based sampling of ultrafine particle concentrations, size distribution, physical properties, sulfur dioxide, and ammonia concentrations and a one-month intensive campaign with the addition of measurements of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and speciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These will be supplemented by vertical profiles of a smaller suite of aerosols and gases using the AAO. The measurements will be conducted in Bondville, IL to take advantage of naturally occurring horizontal and vertical concentration gradients, as well as other existing measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will be achieved as improved simulation and measurement capabilities for NPF are applied to ongoing efforts to separate the health effects of particles by size (e.g., ultrafine vs. fine) and by source (e.g., in situ nucleation vs. combustion). Collaborations with researchers from both the particle health effect and aerosol-climate fields will allow them to benefit from the results of this project. Additionally, an outreach program for high school science teachers will improve science education in Iowa.</AbstractNarration>
