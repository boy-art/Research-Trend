    <AbstractNarration>Sensory systems must change over time to support changing behavioral requirements. Such transformations provide a window for understanding how sensory organs and the underlying neural processing evolve. Praying mantises are the only animals with a single ear in the middle of the body (an auditory cyclops). It exclusively detects ultrasound (30 kHz; above the range of human hearing), and warns the mantis of hunting bats that use ultrasonic sonar. A few mantis species, like Creobroter pictipennis, have evolved a complete, second auditory system. It also has a single ear in the middle of the body (a double cyclops) but detects only 3-5 kHz sound. Comparing species with and without the second ear, this project will study 1) what internal changes lead to the second ear; 2) how the two auditory systems interact; and 3) how these mantises use low-frequency hearing. Synchrotron x-ray imaging will show the progressive anatomical changes that lead to hearing. This technique provides views of internal structures analogous to MRIs, but with 1000 times greater resolution. Laser vibrometry will link minute changes in vibration to the altered anatomy. Neurophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques will determine how the nervous system processes information from each ear. The behaviors requiring a second ear are a puzzle to be addressed by allowing mantises to interact in natural conditions under video and microphone surveillance. Unexpectedly, changes in the respiratory system may be most important in evolving the second, completely independent auditory system. Although previously unknown, sound communication is the probable function of mantis low-frequency hearing. This project brings together for the first time two ultrahigh-resolution techniques to study structure/function changes in the evolution of an auditory system. Over 20 undergraduate research students will receive support to participate in this project.</AbstractNarration>
