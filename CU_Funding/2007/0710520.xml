    <AbstractNarration>This award supports US-Africa cooperation project on the design and development of novel fluorinated polymers with a large variety of functional groups for potential applications in electronics. The study of structure, thermomechanical and dielectrical properties of these polymers may lead to better understanding of structure-property relations which guide the advanced materials design. The project will link DePaul University through effective partnership with two African universities, Cadi Ayyad University (Morocco) and Sfax University (Tunisia), and an industrial partner (STMicroelectronics, Morocco) which enhances the research capacity of the partners. The project will focus on research and education in the area of polymer materials design-- an area that can promote global economic development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the project is to capitalize on extensive experience of the US team in the synthesis and characterization of functional nitrile polymers and expertise of the African team in the design of fluorinated polymers for potential dielectric applications. In addition to synergistic design and synthetic effort of both teams, the resulting copolymers will be investigated by thermomechanical techniques (US team) and by dielectric analysis (African team) to gain better understanding how polymer structural functionality affects properties. The unique feature of the project is the special emphasis on development of an innovative discovery-based training in polymer design helping to inspire and advance learning and which can be adapted in other institutions. The three-year project will impact a significant number of undergraduate (about 50 per year) and graduate students (2 per year) in providing the opportunity to participate in an international research and educational experience through the diversity of learning perspectives as they prepare and characterize about 150 new polymers for potential electronics materials applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US/African partners will use web-based tools to provide access to virtual laboratories and classrooms and web-cast project meetings. Teaching modules (web-based modules, multi-media presentations, and interactive lab manuals) will be developed to support the education of African and U.S. scientists and engineers in polymeric materials design. The modules will be made widely available on the world-wide-web. They will also be integrated into the teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses at DePaul University and collaborating African universities. The collaboration project includes exchange of researchers and students between the partners. Changes in the research culture in the participating institutions in context of global materials network are expected with the continuing collaboration after the funding cycle is completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
