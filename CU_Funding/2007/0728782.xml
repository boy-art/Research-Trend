    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to obtain new algorithms and insights for&lt;br/&gt;some fundamental problems in graphs and networks with a focus on&lt;br/&gt;routing and network design. A prototypical question in routing is to&lt;br/&gt;find paths that connect a given set of source-destination pairs while&lt;br/&gt;obeying the link and node capacity constraints of an underlying&lt;br/&gt;network. Similarly, a prototypical question in network design is to&lt;br/&gt;build a minimum cost network to support a given communication&lt;br/&gt;pattern. Problems in these two areas are at the core of combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;optimization with many applications. They also play a crucial role in&lt;br/&gt;the development of algorithms and structural graph theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems considered in this project are NP-hard and the approach&lt;br/&gt;is to obtain polynomial time approximation algorithms as well as&lt;br/&gt;bounds on the integrality gaps of linear programming based&lt;br/&gt;relaxations. Questions central to the agenda are disjoint paths&lt;br/&gt;problems in undirected graphs, buy-at-bulk network design, and&lt;br/&gt;orienteering. In addition to improved algorithms for these and&lt;br/&gt;related problems, new broadly applicable algorithmic techniques are&lt;br/&gt;expected to be discovered. There are several applications that can&lt;br/&gt;directly benefit including VLSI design, bandwidth and resource&lt;br/&gt;allocation in networks, design of optical networks, and vehicle&lt;br/&gt;routing. The project will support and train PhD students and help in&lt;br/&gt;the dissemination of advanced algorithmic ideas via new classes and&lt;br/&gt;lecture notes.</AbstractNarration>
