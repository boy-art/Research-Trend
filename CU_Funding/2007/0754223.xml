    <AbstractNarration>The National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO offers to six undergraduate students each year the opportunity to engage in challenging research activities with scientists working at the forefront of astronomy and astrophysics. REU students are hired as full-time research assistants to work with Tucson-based NOAO astronomers on selected research projects for a period of twelve weeks over the summer. As part of their research activities, REU students gain first-hand experience with KPNO's state-of-the art telescopes and instrumentation, and develop expertise in the tools of data analysis specific to astronomical research. All REU students are encouraged to attend (at the expense of the KPNO REU program) the American Astronomical Society winter meeting following their program to present a poster or to deliver a paper. In addition to the research project, the KPNO REU site program features weekly scientific lectures and colloquia by NOAO and visiting astronomers, informal lunches and group discussions, field trips to other telescope facilities in the Southwest, and a variety of recreational and social activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KPNO REU site program is a vital part of NOAO's ongoing commitment to meet the nation's need for the training of future scientists. This program provides its REU participants valuable exposure to non-Ph.D. options for those interested in astronomy, such as instrumentation, technical support, education, and public outreach. The broadest goals of the KPNO REU site program are (1) to encourage undergraduates to pursue careers in science, (2) to foster high levels of scientific literacy among the future science, education, and technology workforce, (3) to stimulate general awareness of the remarkable achievements of U.S. astronomy, and (4) to inspire interest in the future progress and welfare of U.S. science. For the KPNO REU site program the emphasis is placed on recruiting women or students from minorities that are underrepresented in the scientific community, as well as students from institutions lacking access to first-rate research staff and facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the National Science Foundation REU program.</AbstractNarration>
