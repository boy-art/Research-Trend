    <AbstractNarration>WSIM is an eight-week research experience hosted by Wabash College in Indiana. Twelve undergraduates will spend a summer immersed in either Commutative Ring Theory or Applied Mathematics. Participants will be introduced to both of these areas and will form teams that investigate an open problem in one of these areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WSIM participants will take part in weekly seminars investigating the ethics of research and ethics more broadly defined. In addition, participants will give weekly presentations and attend the Indiana Undergraduate Mathematics Conference in late July where they will present the results of their research. Participants will also attend weekly talks given by both graduate students and graduate professors from research institutions in the area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The director of WSIM is Mike Axtell who along with JD Phillips and Chad Westphal, both of Wabash College, will serve as research mentors to the participants. In the summer of 2008, Joe Stickles of Millikin University will take JD Phillips' place.</AbstractNarration>
