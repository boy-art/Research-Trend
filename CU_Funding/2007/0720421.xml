    <AbstractNarration>Primary Investigators: Jodi A. Quas and Lindsay Malloy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: Maltreated and Non-Maltreated Children's Evaluations &lt;br/&gt;of the Consequences of Disclosing Negative Events&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0720421&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prosecution of child maltreatment is an especially challenging endeavor, in part because children are typically reluctant to reveal abuse and corroborating evidence rarely exists. Victims may fear negative consequences of disclosure, which may lead to nondisclosure, delays, or inconsistent reporting- all of which affect the likelihood of successful prosecution. The purpose of the proposed study is to advance understanding of maltreated and nonmaltreated children's perceptions of the consequences of disclosing negative events. Findings will concurrently improve intervention and prosecution of child maltreatment cases and make theoretical contributions to understanding development in vulnerable children. Research questions include: (1) Are there age-related changes and ethnic differences in children's perceptions of disclosure consequences?; (2) Do maltreated and nonmaltreated children's perceptions vary?; (3) How does the perpetrator's relationship to the victim affect children's evaluations?; and (4) Do children's perceptions vary as a function of self-blame or how the caregiver reacts to disclosure? To answer these questions, a large, ethnically diverse sample of 4- to 9-year-old children will take part in the current study. Half of the children will have been removed from their homes due to maltreatment deemed true by Department of Children and Family Services. The remaining children will be recruited from schools in neighborhoods similar to ones in which maltreated children reside. Children will be read scenarios that describe a child character telling his/her mother about the wrongdoing of an adult (either a father or stranger). In some vignettes, children will be asked about how the mother will react to the story character's disclosure. In other vignettes, children will be told how the mother reacts to the story character's disclosure and asked to predict the subsequent consequences and the story character's feelings. Findings will be widely disseminated to scientific and nonscientific audiences. By identifying factors that affect children's perceptions of the consequences of disclosure, results will provide insight into potential reasons for nondisclosure and inconsistent reporting. This insight, if conveyed to judges, jurors, and frontline investigators, will significantly advance the pursuit of justice when allegations of maltreatment arise. Also, to intervene effectively, it is necessary to take into account children's expectations regarding others' reactions so that misperceptions can be corrected. Results will benefit particularly vulnerable victims involved in the justice system, maltreated children, who are disproportionately from low income ethnic minority backgrounds and at risk for a host of later negative outcomes (e.g., juvenile delinquency).</AbstractNarration>
