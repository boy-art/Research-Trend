    <AbstractNarration>This project involves the development of new synthetic methods for the preparation of heterocyclic ring systems and their functionalized derivatives. The chemistry exploits the high reactivities of superelectrophilic species to accomplish the synthetic objectives. Other aspects of the project examine the critical structure-activity relationships of the superelectrophiles. These mechanistic studies (including theoretical calculations) will help to better understand the chemistry of the superelectrophiles. As a result of this project, the potential impact of superelectrophiles in biochemical transformations can also be established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Douglas A. Klumpp of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Northern Illinois University. Professor Klumpp's research centers on the chemistry of highly reactive electrophiles. Electrophilic chemistry is of broad importance in biological processes, in the actions of medicines and drugs, and in facilitating the chemical conversions in the chemical industry. Successful completion of the proposed research will consequently have an impact in these areas of science, medicine, and industry.</AbstractNarration>
