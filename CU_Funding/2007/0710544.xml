    <AbstractNarration>This Materials World Network project focuses on structure and properties of a broad and important, yet currently poorly understood class of liquid crystals - the so-called lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs). The award promotes collaborative research among an interdisciplinary group from Kent State University (Physics and Chemical Physics departments) and the Institute of Physics in Kiev, Ukraine. LCLCs are remarkable in that their building blocks are stacks of plank-like molecules, often derived from dyes, that self-assemble in aqueous solution and subsequently, as stacks or bundles of stacks, form orientationally ordered liquid crystalline phases. Because of their unique structure, LCLCs demonstrate extraordinary properties, which are useful for novel technological applications, including (1) optical polarizers and compensators that would not require the mechanical stretching during fabrication typical of conventional polymer films and so could be utilized on substrates of virtually any shape; (2) biological sensors in which the LCLC serves as the detecting as well as the amplifying medium; and (3) longer range applications such as light harvesting. The MWN project goal is to establish the basic physical properties and molecular structure - physical property relationship of LCLCs through measurements of their viscoelastic parameters, optical / spectral characteristics (including time and frequency resolved optical response), and phase behavior as a function of concentration, dopants, ionic content of the solution, and temperature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research conducted under this MWN will advance basic knowledge of mechanisms of nanoscale aggregation and self-organization via non-covalent bonding and of the collective behavior ensuing from these mechanisms. The proposed research will leverage broad facilities and expertise available at Kent State's Liquid Crystal Institute, and will utilize national laboratory resources such as the National High Magnetic Field Lab. The rich physics and chemistry of LCLCs (and liquid crystals in general), and the wide range of characterization facilities and techniques to be used, will ensure a broad research experience for graduate students and strong foundation for careers in the burgeoning field of soft materials science and engineering. The MWN team will develop new LC-based laboratory exercises for general undergraduate labs designed to establish an intellectual connection between basic physics concepts and LC technology ubiquitous in everyday life. The expected societal benefits include the availability of new materials and technologies that would improve the quality of life in areas ranging from telecommunications and displays to biological sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of International Science and Engineering</AbstractNarration>
