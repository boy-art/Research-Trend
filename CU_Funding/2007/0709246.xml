    <AbstractNarration>AST-0709246&lt;br/&gt;Gammie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a program of numerical modeling of Sgr A*, the luminous plasma surrounding the black hole at the center of our Galaxy. These models will incorporate self-consistent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and general relativistic radiative transfer, including synchrotron emission and absorption by thermal and non-thermal electrons, Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and the dynamical effects of the black hole spin. These models will be used to predict the results of imaging Sgr A* by Very Long Baseline Interferometry, and the spectrum, polarization, and variability of Sgr A* from far infrared to gamma-rays. This work will lead to later modeling of systems where cooling and radiation forces are more important than they are in Sgr A*. Accurate models such as these are essential for understanding current and future observational data, and for evaluating the approximations used in present-day studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning through the involvement of two students, through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. The mixture of graduate and undergraduate students with postdoctoral researchers and the Principal Investigator will benefit everyone involved. Results of this research will be broadly disseminated through public release of code on the web and through public outreach.</AbstractNarration>
