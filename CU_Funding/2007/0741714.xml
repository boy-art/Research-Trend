    <AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0741714&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Vikram Kapila&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Polytechnic University of New York&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Applying Mechatronics to Promote Science (AMPS)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMPS is a collaborative relationship between Polytechnic University and six New York City middle schools involving professors, graduate Fellows, and middle school faculty. An array of exciting activities will (1) engage middle school students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) studies through mechatronics-enabled science labs and robotics competitions; (2) entice students to pursue STEM education and careers; and (3) provide technology literacy and professional development to teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMPS will enrich graduate education of 9 Fellows, annually, by enabling them to seamlessly integrate their mechatronics and robotics focused education and research into middle school curriculum. Fellows will use mechatronics-enabled science labs and robotics-based lesson plans to engage middle school students in hands-on scientific explorations. This will allow Fellows to develop a deeper understanding of STEM concepts and their research and an ability to recognize connections between their research and societal needs. Moreover, the project will impart pedagogical, communication, leadership, and team-building skills to Fellows. Finally, AMPS will encourage cross-pollination of education research and technical concepts among the university and school faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of AMPS include: (1) reinforcing STEM education of a diverse and underserved inner-city student body and preparing them for higher education and productive careers; (2) addressing the educational needs of the emerging innovation economy by developing technology-enhanced STEM instruction and lab infrastructure; and (3) broadening Polytechnic?s ties with local school districts to sustain and grow its outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
