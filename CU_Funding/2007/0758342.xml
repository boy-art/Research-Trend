    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0758342&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM: PHY - PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Sokolsky, Pierre V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Telescope Array Operations and Data Analysis by the University of Utah Cosmic Ray Group&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests support for the Telescope Array (TA) operational responsibilities and activities of the Utah cosmic ray group. One of the goals of TA is to resolve the discrepancy between the measurements of the ultra high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) spectrum in the region above 5 x 10**19 eV by the HiRes and AGASA experiments. This project is a successor to both the AGASA and HiRes detectors and, as such, draws on the experience of both groups. The TA detector is a hybrid of the air fluorescence and ground array techniques used to measure the properties of UHECRs. The improved angular resolution will help in identifying possible sources and measuring anisotropies in the arrival directions of UHECRs. These data will help address the fundamental questions in astrophysics of what are the sources of the highest energy particles and how are these particles accelerated to such fantastic energies? One suspected source is Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) which are among the most energetic objects known in the Universe. There are tantalizing hints of correlations with BL Lac objects which are AGNs with their jets pointed towards us. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TA is located near Delta, UT. Like HiRes before it, the Utah group serves as host to the experiment and has numerous critical responsibilities in the design, integration, deployment, operation and management. After commissioning finishes later this year, TA will be the most sensitive cosmic ray detector in the Northern Hemisphere. The group plans to continue their activities in support of detector installation, commissioning, and operation and to take a leading role in the analysis of TA data, especially the fluorescence analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 1997, the Astrophysics Science Project Integrating Research and Education (ASPIRE) has been creating some of the Web?s most engaging and interactive science lessons and labs. In addition to creating and maintaining the website, ASPIRE provides direct outreach to area teachers, students, and the public. Such efforts include providing outreach and support to local groups (especially those underrepresented in the sciences), running summer workshop sessions for students, and visits to rural schools such as Millard and Delta, UT.</AbstractNarration>
