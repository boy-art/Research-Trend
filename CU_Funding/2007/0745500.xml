    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor John F. Berry at the University of Wisconsin - Madison to study the interaction of metal-metal multiply bonded groups with other metal atoms held in close proximity. A new class of coordination compounds will be synthesized that feature heterometallic interactions between a transition metal and an electron-rich metal-metal multiply bonded group. Donation of electron density from the metal-metal multiply bonded group will be probed using multiple physical methods with the aim of discovering new avenues for multi-electron redox reactivity promoted by these compounds. Chemical information will be collected and assembled into pedagogically useful data-based exercises in the form of computer-based hands-on learning modules as supplements to graduate and undergraduate coursework. These data will also be presented to the entirety of the chemical community in the form of an online interactive website or wiki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heterometallic interactions are important in multi-electron biological processes that are essential to life and are also of industrial importance from the standpoint of energy conversion. The discovery of new oxidative transformations that function via the use of molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide is relevant to improving the environmental impact of industrial-scale oxidative chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
