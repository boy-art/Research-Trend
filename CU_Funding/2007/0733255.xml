    <AbstractNarration>Rutgers University seeks support for a 4-year full-scale project in Bioinformatics. This project addresses two grand challenges-Cutting-edge STEM Content and K-12 Science Assessments. Using DNA Sequencing Analysis Program (DSAP) that will be modified by the proposed project, high school students and teachers will learn molecular biology and modern genetics by working with authentic genomic sequences, and submit their findings for review by scientists. The objective of this project is to develop state-of-the-art web-based tools and resources that will make it possible for high school students to conduct authentic research in bioinformatics. To accomplish this objective the project will employ the following methods: First scientists from Rutgers University Waksman Institute will team with educators from WestEd, a nonprofit research, development and service agency, to produce an online embedded assessment tool that will be used to provide feedback about student understanding of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related subjects. The project will also take advantage of experienced high school teachers in this regard. Secondly, the DSAP tool (consisting of five separate yet interrelated components: (1) a student DNA sequence analysis scaffolding program; (2) an administrative program that allows teachers to view student work, students to evaluate peers, and teachers to communicate with their students; (3) a staff administrative program that allows the researchers to observe student and teacher work, and interact with both groups; (4) an embedded assessment tool that will monitor and measure student learning; (5) a series of tutorials and "help modules" that will guide students through their DNA sequence analysis. Thirdly, over a four-year period the DSAP tool will be field-tested, revised, piloted, and disseminated guided by formative assessment, project evaluation, and teacher/student feedback. These programs will be designed to be used in two settings: locally, with teachers and students who attend a summer institute at Rutgers University, and remotely, with teachers and students over the Internet.</AbstractNarration>
