    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT for the award DMS-0400386 of Stein &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and Mazur's notion of&lt;br/&gt;visibility of Shafarevich-Tate groups motivate the computational and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical goals of this research project. The computational goals&lt;br/&gt;are to develop new algorithms, tables, and software for studying&lt;br/&gt;modular forms and modular abelian varieties. The PI hopes to create&lt;br/&gt;new computational tools, including a major new package for computing&lt;br/&gt;with modular abelian varieties over number fields, and enhance the&lt;br/&gt;modular forms database, which is used by many mathematicians who study&lt;br/&gt;modular forms. The theoretical goals are to prove new theorems that&lt;br/&gt;relate Mordell-Weil and Shafarevich-Tate groups of elliptic curves and&lt;br/&gt;abelian varieties. These investigations into Mazur's notion of&lt;br/&gt;visibility, and how it links Mordell-Weil and Shafarevich-Tate groups,&lt;br/&gt;may provide new insight into relationships between different cases of&lt;br/&gt;the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elliptic curves and modular forms play a central role in modern number&lt;br/&gt;theory and arithmetic geometry. For example, Andrew Wiles proved&lt;br/&gt;Fermat's Last Theorem by showing that the elliptic curve attached by&lt;br/&gt;Gerhard Frey to a counterexample to Fermat's claim would be attached&lt;br/&gt;to a modular form, and that this modular form cannot exist. Our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the world of elliptic curves and modular forms is&lt;br/&gt;extensive, but many questions remain unresolved. The first goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to provide theoretical and computational tools to make&lt;br/&gt;modular forms and objects attached to them very explicit, so that&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians can compute with them, test their conjectures on&lt;br/&gt;them, and gain a better feeling for them. The second goal is to use&lt;br/&gt;these tools and other ideas to gain a deeper understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;conjecture of Bryan Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer about the arithmetic of elliptic curves.</AbstractNarration>
