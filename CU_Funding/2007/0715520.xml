    <AbstractNarration>This award will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the Research Vessel Wecoma in support of marine research. The program provides support for such items as communications and navigation equipment, safety equipment, overboarding equipment (winches and cranes), and upgrade studies (Stability and Inclining). The proposal as submitted requested seven items of which six were safety items and the seventh was for a study on the replacement of the crane and a-frame. At the recommendation of the Panel Oregon State University will do two group purchases for safety equipment and distribute the items to other ships in the academic fleet. The R/V Wecoma is an important component of the OSU public outreach and education programs supporting shipboard tours for Oregon schools, student training at sea and webased programs from the ship.</AbstractNarration>
