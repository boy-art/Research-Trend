    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests continuing support for a program of research for the Brock/Abolins group at Michigan State University (MSU) in experimental elementary particle physics based primarily on the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron collider and the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past few decades, physicists have been able to describe with increasing detail the fundamental particles that make up the Universe and the interactions between them. Much of this success has been due to the Tevatron program at Fermilab with D0 and CDF making major contributions.. This MSU group has made major contributions to the D0 experiment in its construction and in the physics questions proposed as well as in many leadership roles. Currently, the group is investigating the single top quark production mechanism which is sensitive to possibly new physics beyond the Standard Model. It participated in the initial measurements of the production rate a measurement many consider the single most important result from the Tevatron program. At the same time the LHC and ATLAS will start operation in new regimes of energy and luminosity holding even greater promise for discoveries and measurements leading to revisions of our views on how the world is constructed and the nature of the laws that govern its operation. This group is now transitioning into the ATLAS program where it will parlay its wealth of experience in single top physics into a leadership role in a similar study as well as other areas such as construction of trigger algorithms and installing trigger supporting hardware and its supporting infrastructure. In addition, MSU and the University of Michigan are building a new Tier 2 computing center and faculty research efforts will be directed in part to management and usage of this facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Broader Impacts, the group will continue its work primarily within the QuarkNet program as well as an innovative non-science student honors course emphasizing Elementary Particle Physics and Cosmology and a course on modern physics for the Division of Science and Math Education during the summer term which typically draws ~20 high school teachers. Science Days and permanent exhibits in an atrium setting at MSU related to the ATLAS program are planned.</AbstractNarration>
