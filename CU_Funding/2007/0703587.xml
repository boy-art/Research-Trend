    <AbstractNarration>Kostelich&lt;br/&gt;0703587&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this CSUMS project is to build a diverse group&lt;br/&gt;of undergraduate students in the computational mathematical&lt;br/&gt;sciences program at Arizona State University, each of whom&lt;br/&gt;participates in cutting-edge research projects during the last&lt;br/&gt;two years of their undergraduate programs. At any given time,&lt;br/&gt;two cohorts of 11 students each participate: they begin the&lt;br/&gt;program at the start of their junior year and complete it at the&lt;br/&gt;end of their senior year (i.e., after 4 semesters). Incoming&lt;br/&gt;students, whose expected preparation includes multivariable&lt;br/&gt;calculus, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;participate in a 1-credit seminar course for two semesters to&lt;br/&gt;prepare them for the upcoming summer's projects. Summer projects&lt;br/&gt;consist of 8 to 10 weeks of full-time work on a research project&lt;br/&gt;under the supervision of an experienced faculty mentor. Students&lt;br/&gt;who have completed their projects give practice talks in the&lt;br/&gt;seminar and are expected to present their work at appropriate&lt;br/&gt;professional conferences as well as to write an honors thesis or&lt;br/&gt;research paper. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Student research projects involve timely problems in&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric sciences, including weather and climate forecasting;&lt;br/&gt;supply-chain modeling; mathematical techniques for improved&lt;br/&gt;medical imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging); and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical biology (e.g., models for human cellular processes). &lt;br/&gt;The students, who must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents,&lt;br/&gt;have an opportunity to work on massively parallel (2000+&lt;br/&gt;processor) machines through ASU's Fulton High Performance&lt;br/&gt;Computing Initiative and to do high-performance graphics at ASU's&lt;br/&gt;Decision Theater. These experiences prepare students for&lt;br/&gt;advanced work in climate dynamics, drug discovery, aerospace&lt;br/&gt;design, and similar topics at top graduate schools across the&lt;br/&gt;United States. Special efforts are made to recruit students who&lt;br/&gt;are first-generation college students, women, and members of&lt;br/&gt;other underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences. The&lt;br/&gt;project is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical&lt;br/&gt;Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the&lt;br/&gt;EHR Division of Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>
