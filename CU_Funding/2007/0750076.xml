    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a novel high-speed Atomic Layer Deposition technology comprising an ALD reactor and associated thin film processes for GaN thin films required for fabrication of high-brightness Light Emitting Diode (HBLED). The proposed effort is based on successful demonstration of operation of the ALD reactor in phase-I SBIR project at 5x speed of commercially available ALD reactors. The unique ALD reactor concept can process atomically thin films and also micron thick films in one chamber. Furthermore, point-of-use, safer and low-cost generation of chemical precursors combined with low temperature processing promises low defect density thin films of a variety of compound semiconductors including GaN. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low defect density, low cost GaN thin and thick films are building blocks of an HBLED. An HBLED bulb that consumes 15 Watts, lasts 10+ years and costs a few dollars can effectively replace a fluorescent tube consuming 30 Watts and an incandescent bulb consuming 100 Watts. The proposed ALD technology promises to reduce process cost, and improve the HBLED quality critical to realize ultra-large scale production of affordable HBLEDs for worldwide lighting applications leading to 50% potential electricity savings and tremendous associated environmental benefits.</AbstractNarration>
