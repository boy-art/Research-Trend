    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this SGER project is to pursue novel and radical approaches to investigate fundamental issues related to critical infrastructure protection and enable reliable delivery of legitimate traffic to end-users, even when the system is under attack. It is the tenet of this research project that these goals are best met using the concept of Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS), as it provides the foundation for the development of a dynamic, data-driven intrusion detection systems for high-performance collaborative environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed exploratory research focuses on four fundamental research thrusts: Dynamic, collaborative defense infrastructure for intrusion detection and response, comprising of a network of peers, dynamically and collaboratively defend against intrusions and denial of service attacks based on resource efficient algorithms for probabilistic inspection of packets for detection and algorithms for collaborative sentinel deployment to guarantees optimal network coverage for scalable response to attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data Driving the IDS -Intrusion Assessment Information Base (IAIB): We propose development of an information base (repository of assessment trees) that will be used to assist the detection and defense process. And Algorithms and Framework for Collaborative IDS for Disruption Detection, Containment &amp; Recovery, explored within the paradigm of DDDAS, allowing exploration of the feasibility and design requirements of distributed mechanisms for intrusion isolation, damage containment and adaptive recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network security is of increasing concern, and static methods to address security are limiting. The project brings technical aspects traditionally disjoint, and integrates interdisciplinary work from various disciplines including probabilistic algorithms, AI techniques, data bases, networks and collaborative systems, and driven the DDDAS concept. The proposed methods and systems software capabilities can have impact on fundamental issues how to architect security in systems in an adaptive way. The project includes education and outreach plans. Additional broader impacts include advancing the state of the art in the stated scope of the project is important, and the project has the potential to set directions for future and novel methods.</AbstractNarration>
