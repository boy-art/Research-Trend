    <AbstractNarration>The existing multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is beginning their second 5-year cycle. The mission of the center is to solve integrated design and analysis problems in logistics and distribution via simulation and mathematical modeling, analysis, and the development and application of powerful, intelligent, real-time algorithms. By integrating resources at the multiple campuses, CELDi has promoted a fundamental paradigm shift from the traditional compartmentalized logistics and distribution research approach to an examination of the problem as a whole. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I/UCRC expects to grow in regard to partner universities and member companies during this second phase of funding. Several member organizations are actively involved with the partner universities to provide real-life logistics and distribution problems to graduate and undergraduate classes. The center's research holds the promise of creating new practice based education models that can be used to augment this undergraduate and graduate instruction.</AbstractNarration>
