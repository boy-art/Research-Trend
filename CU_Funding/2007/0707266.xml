    <AbstractNarration>AST-0707266&lt;br/&gt;Strauss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use the superb photometric and spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study the clustering of Active Galactic Nuclei at intermediate and high redshifts. The clustering of such highly biased populations measures the typical mass of their host dark matter halos. This will result in the first definitive measurement of the large-scale clustering of quasars at redshifts beyond three, as a function of their luminosity and black hole mass. A survey of close quasar pairs at high redshift should determine whether these objects form in rare, high-density peaks, while targeted deep imaging will test for the frequency of such rare peaks, as well as for the existence of the predicted host clusters of galaxies. In addition, this study will make the first determination of the fraction of obscured quasars at high luminosities, and determine whether the census of high luminosity objects is close to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supports a full-time graduate student, continuing a strong record of undergraduate and graduate training. As part of a long-running quantitative introductory course in astrophysics, the principal investigator for this project has been distributing essays describing recent exciting developments in the field. This will continue, describing from an insider's perspective how science is done, and how astronomers use data and quantitative reasoning to reach their conclusions. These essays will become more widely available through a web site under development, taking advantage of the natural excitement and curiosity that the public feels for this fast-moving field.</AbstractNarration>
