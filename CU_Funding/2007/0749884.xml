    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop differentially protected orthogonal lanthionine technology (DPLOT) to synthesize novel antibiotics. Lanthionines are found in nature and have been isolated from a variety of sources. Although amino acids, lanthionines are not components of proteins. They are however, constituents of a group of naturally occurring peptide antibiotics called lantibiotics, which includes nisin (a food preservative), subtilin, epidermin (an anti staphylococcus and streptococcus agent), and ancovenin (an enzyme inhibitor). Due to their mechanism of action, resistance to lantibiotics is uncommon and as such they can be of value for treating antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology under development would allow the synthesis of novel lantibiotics that may be effective against the growing number of antibiotic resistant bacteria and would expand the therapeutic arsenal available for treating such infections. It would therefore have a profound impact on public health and the control of infectious diseases caused by bacteria.</AbstractNarration>
