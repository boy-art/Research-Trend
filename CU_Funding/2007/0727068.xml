    <AbstractNarration>The Montana Minds program is awarding 20 academically prepared financially challenged students' with $6,500 renewable scholarships in biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, or software engineering. Recruitment of scholarship students involves the collaboration of Montana Tech, TRiO and GEAR UP staff working with 21 of Montana's impoverished high schools, including all 13 tribal high schools. Special features include establishment of Learning Communities, enrollment in a College Success course, advising, the use of mentor tutors, travel to national science and engineering laboratories, assistance in attending national meetings, and encouragement in undergraduate research. The PI is actively teaching as full professor of chemistry with 30 years of classroom experience and is the Dean of the College of Mathematics and Sciences. The Co-PI's from the Technical Outreach Department have a combined 15 years experience working with low income, disadvantaged and minority students. The scholars in this program are returning to their home high schools to give presentations and to help educate secondary school staff about the opportunities available to students in the STEM disciplines so that the teachers and staff can provide continued encouragement of students in these fields. This program is improving opportunities for students and increasing graduation rates by creating a more student focused culture at Montana Tech.</AbstractNarration>
