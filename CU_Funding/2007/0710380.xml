    <AbstractNarration>In an era of rapid climate change, human-modified environments, and a world-wide biodiversity crisis, correctly identifying species has never been more critical. This proposed research will utilize a newly-developed genomic library to develop, test, and apply rigorous state of the art molecular data to identify species boundaries in an endangered group of North American freshwater turtles. With 12 recognized species, the map turtles (genus Graptemys) are currently considered the most species-rich, and endangered group of turtles in the United States. The results from this work will combine genomic data with new statistical approaches to allow us to test the reality of these species and to determine whether additional, unrecognized species may exist in nature. &lt;br/&gt; The proposed research has broad impacts in conservation, education, and policy. All of the currently recognized species of map turtle are protected in some or all of their ranges, and our research will help determine if they are well differentiated species, and which are the most deserving of protection. This study involves field research in rural parts of the Midwestern and southern US, where local students will be involved and trained how to study local conservation problems. At the policy level, most map turtles occur in rivers on public land, and this research will help land managers rank these turtles in terms of conservation priorities on their lands.</AbstractNarration>
