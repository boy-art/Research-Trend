    <AbstractNarration>The human spine can be considered as a dynamical system of enormous complexity. Isolated from its supporting muscles and ligaments, the spinal column would fail to stay erect, and an imbalance in the muscle forces (and the moments they supply) can severely disable the spine and result in physical pain. One of the goals of the proposed research is to use modern analytical and modeling methods to develop an improved understanding of the dynamics of the human spine. A second goal of the research is to quantify the effects of two surgeries: one where the vertebra are fused, and the other where the intervertebral disc is replaced with a prosthetic device which is known as a total disc replacement (TDR). The final goal of the research is to develop a comprehensive framework for spinal dynamics that can be used for such applications as design guidelines for TDR's. The research conducted towards these goals, will feature numerical, analytical, and experimental components, and involves the collaboration between the Department of Mechanical Engineering at U.C. Berkeley (UCB) and the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at U.C. San Francisco (UCSF). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A substantial health issue that plagues society motivates the broader impacts of this project. The project will directly train both graduate and undergraduate students who will materially participate. The results from this research will also be incorporated into courses on both campuses (engineering at UCB) and (orthopaedic surgery at UCSF) and on a dedicated website.</AbstractNarration>
