    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Oregon Eugene for the summers of 2008-2010. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program in the Division of Chemistry (CHE). The program will be directed by Geraldine Richmond, a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry, and run through the University of Oregon's Materials Science Institute. This REU site will bring ten students to campus for a ten-week period each summer to conduct cutting edge research in chemistry and physics. Students will be recruited from predominately undergraduate institutions around the country and local community colleges and are expected to have completed coursework in chemistry or physics at the undergraduate junior or advanced sophomore level. REU participants will be able to choose their research projects among the laboratories of 17 faculty members in chemistry and physics. To further enrich the students' experience, activities outside of the laboratory have been planned throughout the ten-week period including mentoring and training in professional development and career decision-making. At the end of the program, each student will provide a presentation on the results of their project and submit a written report that summarizes their research activities.</AbstractNarration>
