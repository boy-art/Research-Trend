    <AbstractNarration>Plants and herbivorous insects have intimate relationships. Plant divergence and speciation lead to divergence of the herbivorous insects that feed on them. Plant species often hybridize in nature; therefore hybrids could create "bridges" facilitating mating among insect populations that typically use only one host species. The amount of host plant hybridization, and subsequent intermating of host plant specialized insects may differ among locations. Host plant hybridization may thereby slow or reverse the process of speciation of the plants and the insects involved. Genetic markers will be used to test whether there is more gene flow between populations of Phytomyza glabricola, a native leaf mining fly in areas of higher host plant hybridization. This addresses the influence of plant biodiversity on the development of herbivore and natural enemy biodiversity, key features of stable and productive ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work include advancing scientific inquiry of undergraduates, collaborating with outside agencies, and presenting work to the lay community. Undergraduates will aid in laboratory and fieldwork. Collaborators at the USDA will test for parallel host race formation in parasitic wasps attacking the leafminers. Lastly, the student will present the work to knowledgeable amateurs at the national meeting of the Holly Society of America.</AbstractNarration>
