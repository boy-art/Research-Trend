    <AbstractNarration>The breeding strategy known as nest association is exhibited by many North American minnows and is regarded as a symbiotic relationship between a nest-building species and an array of associate species which spawn in the host's nest. Examination of the evolution of host specificity within a closely related group of North American minnows will provide insight into the evolution of symbiotic breeding behavior. This study will incorporate multiple techniques (genetics-based phylogenetic, behavioral, and experimental), and will be the first to include variations in host specificity, associate assemblage, and larval development in the context of the evolution of nest association. In particular this will be the first study to explicitly investigate the specialist-generalist evolutionary trends in this breeding system. &lt;br/&gt; Reproductive strategies of fishes are highly diverse compared to those of terrestrial vertebrates and provide the perfect arena in which to test evolutionary hypotheses which have been historically biased towards terrestrial systems. A major goal of this project is the dissemination of the results through presentations at scientific meetings and publications in peer-reviewed journals. Due to the dual field and laboratory components of this study, there are ample opportunities for underrepresented student participation. It is the goal of the researchers to not only expose students to research but to encourage them to expand and form their own research goals.</AbstractNarration>
