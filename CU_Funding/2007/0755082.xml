    <AbstractNarration>This award is to support the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program at the University of Oklahoma Norman Campus. Ten undergraduate students will be supported by NSF to do nine weeks of summer research in the areas of theoretical and experimental astrophysics, atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter physics, and high energy physics. The primary goal is to bridge the gap from student to scientist, through substantive, consequential research mentored daily by a faculty member in an area in which the student is interested. There is also a semi-weekly seminar series covering the language of quantum mechanics, career options, and career development. The final seminars will be given by the REU students themselves, and there will be a series of voluntary courses, field trips, and seminars that expose the students to real research tools.</AbstractNarration>
