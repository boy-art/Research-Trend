    <AbstractNarration>0700306&lt;br/&gt;Bhaduri&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop surface engineered bisphoshonate (BP)-coated reticulated Ti foam scaffolds for the treatment of bone loss (such as osteoporosis). This objective is based on the effectiveness of BPs in preventing bone-loss, and as an alternative to the oral-administration of BPs to avoid side-effects while acting much more quickly. The proposed work builds upon the biomimetic coating of Ti foams with BP-loaded CDHA as it helps bone-loss treatments in a dual manner by increasing the bone-building osteoblasts and by causing apoptosis of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. This research will address the following objectives: (1) use the parameters obtained from the investigators previous research to produce crack-free BP-loaded coated flat substrates, (2) determine the chemical characteristics of the as-coated BP-loaded substrates, (3) based on the results, coat reticulated Ti foams, and (4) perform in vitro tests to examine both osteoclast and osteoblast response of the BP loaded substrates and foams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The local and selective delivery of drugs is seen as part of the future of medical treatments. Thus, the proposed work would contribute towards drug implant technology for the treatment of osteoporosis. The project will involve underrepresented undergraduate students and K-12 outreach.</AbstractNarration>
