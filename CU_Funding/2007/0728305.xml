    <AbstractNarration>A basic goal of biological oceanography is to understand the abundance and distribution of organisms in the sea. Although the newest generation of ocean observing systems promise higher spatial and temporal sampling rates than heretofore possible, our capability to sense the ocean, in-situ, especially when considering animals of millimeter to centimeters could certainly be improved upon. Acoustic techniques hold promise for fulfilling this goal, however, when used in the traditional manner to monitor only animal backscatter amplitude suffer from many ambiguities. This proposal requests funds to explore a new option: Sensing the reflected sound from a number of different points of view in order to judge size and shape. The theory of tomographic inversion from multiple views suggests that this approach has potential to succeed. If successful, the project will point the way to a next generation of acoustic sensors with increased specificity over existing ones and help to bridge the gap between our ability to characterize marine populations and our interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a nice educational component to this that includes research experiences for high school students and their teacher plus curriculum development. The development of a functional prototype with a path towards commercialization will be of benefit to the community. This technology could revolutionize our ability to remotely assess zooplankton in the ocean. One graduate student will be trained in acoustic theory and technology development and several undergraduate students will be supported.</AbstractNarration>
