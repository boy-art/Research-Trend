    <AbstractNarration>This "Produced in Virginia" implementation project is combining the efforts of Central Virginia Community College, Danville Community College, and the University of Virginia (with a third community college partner added during the second year of the project) to provide undergraduate connections in engineering education with the goal of increasing the number of students enrolling in and graduating from engineering associate and baccalaureate degree programs. The partnership is achieving this goal through the following strategies: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Adapting and replicating the proven Priming the Pipeline model that encourages students to consider STEM careers and prepares them for success in college STEM courses with a new addition of delivering the university's introductory Explorations in Engineering course by distance education. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Implementing new and upgraded curricula at all three community colleges, leading to an Associate of Science degree in engineering and guaranteeing students with a 3.4 average seamless transfer into the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Offering courses at the transfer and graduation level at the community colleges for engineering students from the University of Virginia's Bachelor of Science in Engineering Degree program as well as offering transfer courses at the University's main campus. &lt;br/&gt;(4) Offering tuition assistance for students pursuing undergraduate engineering degrees and engaging those students in technical employment.&lt;br/&gt;(5) Implementing a distance degree program pilot enabling students graduating from the Central Virginia A.S. degree program to earn undergraduate engineering degrees from the University of Virginia. &lt;br/&gt;(6) Developing an academic mentoring program using Web 2.0 technology solutions. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is in serving as a viable and reproducible model for collaborations between community colleges and universities to facilitate student success in an era of rising costs. It is also contributing to the country's capacity in science and engineering in an increasingly competitive and changing global labor market.</AbstractNarration>
