    <AbstractNarration>This integrative systems proposal focuses on developing serializer/deserializer (SERDES) circuit for high-speed data communication systems. Recent progress in devices has already opened the door for terahertz applications. One difficulty that remains is the transmission of high-speed data streams over the channel. A key-component for high-speed data transmission is the SERDES circuit. The jitter of the SERDES output data must be considerably lower than what we have now. It is expected that some of the results derived from this project will also be beneficial for millimeter wave wireless systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: To achieve this goal, a top-down approach is proposed including the integration and optimization of the following components: (1) the development of various high-speed serializer/deserializer design techniques for millimeter wave mixed-signal applications that can possibly be applied to future terahertz applications; (2) the design of jitter free and fully symmetrical multiplexers/demultiplexers that will help reduce the jitter and phase noise in many communication systems; (3) the modeling and simulation of the entire digital-locked-loop/phased-locked-loop component, together with voltage-controlled oscillator capacitor arrays which may contribute to faster acquisition and enhanced noise reduction; (4) the application of the deep trench isolation sharing technique, which can significantly reduce the layout area and interconnect parasitic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The successful implementation of this project is anticipated to significantly benefit high speed data communication systems that require very high throughput, such as those used in terahertz imaging and chip-to-chip communications. It will also benefit a number of other important applications such as biological imaging, radio astronomy, upper atmosphere research, and plasma diagnostics. These design techniques will be incorporated into the Computer Engineering curriculum, and they will also be employed in promoting the field of computer engineering as the Department seeks to recruit high school students, especially women and minority students, and retain them throughout their undergraduate study.</AbstractNarration>
