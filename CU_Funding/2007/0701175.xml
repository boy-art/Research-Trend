    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on two areas where combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;and other parts of mathematics meet:&lt;br/&gt;correlation inequalities, and applications of entropy to&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial problems.&lt;br/&gt;Correlation inequalities deal with positive and negative&lt;br/&gt;reinforcement among events in a probability space&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. how does knowing event A has occurred&lt;br/&gt;affect the probability of event B?).&lt;br/&gt;Questions of this type are fundamental for probability&lt;br/&gt;and statistical mechanics, and also play important&lt;br/&gt;roles in, e.g., statistics, computer science&lt;br/&gt;and discrete mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Nonetheless, despite a great deal of activity over the&lt;br/&gt;last forty-five years, some basic insights seem to be lacking,&lt;br/&gt;and even some of the simplest questions remain open.&lt;br/&gt;The project contains a mix of old and new problems,&lt;br/&gt;some quite specific, others more general,&lt;br/&gt;but all intended to push in the direction of some of those&lt;br/&gt;missing insights.&lt;br/&gt;Shannon entropy, introduced in&lt;br/&gt;1948 for coding-theoretic purposes,&lt;br/&gt;has, mostly in the last ten or fifteen years,&lt;br/&gt;turned out to be a valuable tool&lt;br/&gt;for certain kinds of combinatorial extremal problems.&lt;br/&gt;(For example: how many independent sets---i.e. sets&lt;br/&gt;of vertices spanning no edges---can one have in a regular&lt;br/&gt;graph with given degree and number of vertices?)&lt;br/&gt;The project considers a number of problems of this type,&lt;br/&gt;each thought to be both of independent interest and&lt;br/&gt;likely to force further development of entropy&lt;br/&gt;techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One theme common to the two parts of the project is an interest&lt;br/&gt;in applying ideas and methods across mathematical boundaries,&lt;br/&gt;meaning, on the one hand, bringing the principal investigator's&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial perspective to bear on problems from other areas that have mostly been considered by specialists in those areas, and,&lt;br/&gt;on the other, using extra-combinatorial ideas to attack&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial problems.&lt;br/&gt;Many of the problems proposed seem quite hard, but also&lt;br/&gt;quite fundamental, as evidenced in particular by the fact that&lt;br/&gt;they arise in so many disparate contexts.&lt;br/&gt;(This last refers especially to the first part of the project,&lt;br/&gt;but not entirely; for instance, though recent applications have&lt;br/&gt;been mostly combinatorial, the PI's original contributions to&lt;br/&gt;entropy methods were developed to attack problems&lt;br/&gt; in probability and statistical mechanics.)&lt;br/&gt;It is also true that the difficulties underlying some of&lt;br/&gt;these problems appear to show up elsewhere, for instance in&lt;br/&gt;the now very active area of "Markov chain Monte Carlo,"&lt;br/&gt;and in "Mason's Conjecture," a celebrated, 35-year-old problem&lt;br/&gt;in matroid theory. So it seems likely that progress on some of&lt;br/&gt;the present questions would have further repercussions.</AbstractNarration>
