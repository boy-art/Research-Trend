    <AbstractNarration>In this CAREER project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jared H. Delcamp of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Mississippi will design and synthesize novel organic materials for the conversion of solar energy to electricity. This program will focus on the rapid synthesis of organic dyes absorbing into the near-infrared solar region and converting this energy to electricity in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) devices. This research could lead to the more efficient harvesting of abundant solar energy and helps to reduce our reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels. As part of the funded project, an undergraduate survey course will be developed to promote awareness of active STEM research areas including solar energy research. Both undergraduate students and high school students will be encouraged to participate in original research projects focusing on the development of DSC materials, exposing them to the excitement of STEM-related research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A crucial challenge facing the DSC field is the discovery of efficient sensitizers for the conversion of light in the near-infrared (NIR) range beyond 750 nm. Ideally, these sensitizers should be readily accessible (in fewer than 10 synthetic steps), rely on sustainable organic materials and utilize strongly anchoring functionality to promote long solar cell stabilities. This project will focus on the introduction of pro-aromatic sensitizers to DSC devices. Pro-aromatic materials are known to promote low-energy absorptions from low-molecular weight building blocks by stabilizing excited-state energy levels. Additionally, multiple conjugation pathway scaffolds will be developed for precise tuning of dye energy levels through the use of multiple donors and acceptors. Multiple semiconductor anchoring structures in conjugation with the sensitizer will be employed for both strong binding to the semiconductor and to promote efficient electron injection. Rapid synthetic routes to these materials will be a focus, with C-H activation routes being strategically employed to reduce the number of synthetic steps.</AbstractNarration>
