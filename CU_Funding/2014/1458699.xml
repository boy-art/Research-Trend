    <AbstractNarration>Growth in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are critical to the advancement of Missouri State University (MSU), the State of Missouri, and the United States of America. This Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project aims to significantly increase the quality and number of graduates in the STEM fields of computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physics at MSU. This will be achieved with the use of scholarships that attract and retain students interested in STEM fields, seminar classes, volunteer opportunities, and tutoring in Calculus II and III and Physics I and II. The core of student support services will be a one credit a semester seminar course. Topics will emphasize other student support opportunities, student success strategies, internships, undergraduate research, employment, and graduate school. Scholarships will be provided to 15 sophomore and 6 transfer students each year based on academic talent and financial need. These scholarships will last two years, provided progression toward graduation. More than 84 computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physics students will be directly impacted by these scholarships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance student retention, performance, breadth of understanding, and student peer support networks as well as enhance the understanding of cohort seminars, course specific tutoring, mentoring, and group building among STEM disciplines on the MSU campus. Each of these areas will be evaluated by an external evaluator associated with this proposed S-STEM project. The evaluation will be conducted using surveys and performance in specific courses to gather both quantitative and qualitative information about all aspects of the project. The results will be used to improve all aspects of the project, many of which will continue beyond the project's duration.</AbstractNarration>
