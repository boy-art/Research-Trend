    <AbstractNarration>This proposal extends the highly successful Injury Science Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with the long-term objective of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally engaged science and engineering workforce with a focus on pediatric injury prevention. The REU Site will conduct fundamental research on the causes and consequences of injury in youth and translational research to apply this scientific foundation into evidence-based prevention products, programs, policy, and interventions. Noting a dearth of funding for research training in injury prevention as a major barrier to the development of the field of injury prevention research, the National Academies called for increased injury prevention research training opportunities. This site will train a cadre of talented interns to help to ensure the growth, innovation, and continuity of the field to reduce injuries and death in youth. The comprehensive training will prepare diverse, internationally-competitive, and globally-engaged leaders in science and engineering. Their research findings will inform interventions to reduce injuries and deaths in youth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU program will offer a 10-week intensive summer research experience for a total of 33 interns over a three year period (8 interns per year funded by the NSF plus 3 interns funded by CHOP and Drexel) which includes: 1) individual research projects with a faculty mentor, 2) ethics training, 3) intern meetings, 4) seminars, 5) field trips, 6) student presentations, and 7) career guidance, networking opportunities, and mentorship. Recruitment will focus on interns from schools with limited STEM opportunities. Disciplines that will be targeted include engineering, behavioral science, population science, and statistics. Training will draw upon the multi-disciplinary expertise of a NSF I/UCRC and an internationally recognized research organization, the Center for Injury Research and Prevention. The site includes faculty and resources from the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University. REU interns will gain rigorous research experience, learning the value of interdisciplinary work and applying research results to real world prevention.</AbstractNarration>
