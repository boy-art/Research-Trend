    <AbstractNarration>This award to the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will provide technical assistance to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) to facilitate successful participation in the NSF HBCU-Undergraduate Program and the NSF Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. Five workshops will be held for faculty from HBCUs; three of these workshops will include faculty from other MSIs. Workshops will focus on enhancing the ability of faculty to prepare competitive proposals to the NSF HBCU-UP and MRI programs. Experienced consultants will assist QEM in the conduct of the workshop series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will involve a minimum of 160 STEM faculty from HBCUs and 90 STEM faculty from other MSIs to provide a strong foundation for institutions to pursue and successfully receive support for HBCU-UP implementation projects, targeted infusion projects, broadening participation research projects, research initiation award projects, and NSF MRI projects. The anticipated outcome is the increased potential for faculty from MSIs to strengthen their research portfolio and improve their research infrastructure at these institutions. The longer term broader impact is the production of the Nation's next generation of highly qualified and diverse STEM educators and researchers.</AbstractNarration>
