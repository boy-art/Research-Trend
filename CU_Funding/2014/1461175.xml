    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate at NSF are funding Professor Kevin Caran and colleagues in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at James Madison University (JMU) to host an REU site entitled 'A Regional Summer Research Program Integrating Deaf and Hearing Participants in Chemistry Research. This REU site provides research opportunities for regional, and deaf and hard of hearing students. The students include those from JMU as well as students from outside institutions that do not have extensive research infrastructure. All undergraduate researchers have access to a range of research opportunities in disciplines including biophysical, organic, environmental, inorganic, and materials chemistry. Undergraduate interpreting students, working under the direction of a professional interpreter, research topics relevant to the challenges of interpreting in a scientific environment. All students participate in hands-on research, seminars and research group meetings. Students are exposed to good practice guidelines for writing papers and making scientific presentations. These experiences are designed to help participating students acquire valuable skill sets for future careers in the sciences. External faculty participants from regional colleges both add to the program and presumably will take elements of the research culture surrounding this program back to their home institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deaf and hard of hearing students perform research under the direction of a faculty mentor and have access to professional interpreters and interpreting students who are fully integrated in the research laboratory, seminars, and social activities. Deaf students gain experience in a hearing environment that may help in their success after completion of their four year degree. Hearing participants also gain experiences that will help in their future success as they benefit from the diversity and novel atmosphere provided by the program that results in a better understanding of the unique challenges and skills of the deaf and hard of hearing participants. The inclusion of student interpreters is expected to be mutually beneficial and enhance the experience in the research laboratory with the goal of promoting the pursuit of STEM careers by deaf students.</AbstractNarration>
