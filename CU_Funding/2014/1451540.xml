    <AbstractNarration>Humans have a fundamental need to feel they are respected by others. In some cultures (termed "honor cultures"), the concern for having others' respect and positive moral standing is so central to individuals' identity that it can take primacy over other motives. As a result, serious conflicts can arise if individuals feel that they have received an insult or threat to their honor. In such cultures, the importance of defending one's honor can lead to behavior that can seem irrational and excessively aggressive to outsiders, with members of honor cultures striving to assert and protect their honor even when it leads to costly consequences such as injury or death. The objective of the proposed research is to understand and attempt to reduce the dangers that arise when those from honor cultures feel their honor has been threatened by an insult or false accusation. The proposed studies compare members of honor cultures within and outside the U.S. to members of cultures that lack strong honor norms. The research tests the hypothesis that concern over maintenance and protection of honor among members of honor cultures can interfere with other goal-related behavior, and that these behavioral consequences can be reduced by interventions that restore honor. The proposed research seeks to develop a better understanding of the seemingly "irrational" ways that members of honor cultures respond to perceived affronts and is therefore relevant to people involved in public policy and economic interactions with members of honor-based cultures. Moreover, a better understanding of honor with respect to goal-related behaviors has important implications for organizational behavior, negotiation, and conflict management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves a collaboration of researchers based in different regions of the U.S. and researchers from a non-U.S. honor culture. Two studies test whether individuals from honor cultures are more likely to use economic incentives to punish someone who impugns their honor (by calling them dishonest) even when such punishment is costly for the actor. Three studies examine whether honor threats derail goal attainment by creating a distraction which affects goal setting, initiation, and persistence. Two final experiments examine whether an honor threat's negative consequences for goal pursuit can be reduced by brief experiences in the lab that allow participants to behave honorably and receive recognition for doing so, or by recalling experiences when they were accorded honor by others. By understanding these honor-related processes, this research will help U.S. businesses, governmental agencies, and non-governmental organizations deal with conflict and miscommunication when working in honor-based cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international component of this research was supported by co-funding from the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>
