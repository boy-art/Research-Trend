    <AbstractNarration>Project UTM S-STEM at the University of Tennessee Martin (UTM) will provide 35 scholarships for four years averaging $4,800 each year to academically promising students with financial need. Students will be incoming freshman and transfer students majoring in Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, Computer Science, and Mathematics. This project will provide the resources needed to recruit, support, and retain more students, including minorities and women, in STEM fields that will improve the nation's capacity for innovation and provide regional industry with needed STEM talent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will recruit STEM students that have demonstrated financial need as well the desire and capability to major in an underrepresented STEM field: Chemistry, Mathematics, Engineering, Computer Science, or Geology. The UTM student body is largely first generation college students that come from rural areas and many come from economically challenged areas of Tennessee. The average family income of West Tennessee is lower than the US average and many of these students that come to UTM are under-prepared for STEM studies. A number of support mechanisms will be provided to aid these students. A major focus of the project will be the development of a STEM academy. This two week intensive academic course will be collaboratively taught each summer by all STEM disciplines and will review material from the previous year and introduce new material students will see in the upcoming year. The STEM academy will help to remedy areas where UTM S-STEM Scholars are struggling and give them a jump start on the upcoming year. It will serve as a method to reinforce material and concepts students learn in their classes and help them to retain this knowledge throughout their academic career. The project will also establish a learning community. This community will provide both scholarly and social activities to support the S-STEM students to persist in STEM and aid in career exploration. Activities will include monthly lunches with faculty, field trips to industrial sites and other areas specific to each of the disciplines involved, seminars, and involvement in service learning. Scholarship students will be guided in career exploration through exposure to opportunities in government, industry, research, academia, and education through field trips and speakers. Scholarship students will be encouraged to participate in research projects with mentoring faculty to broaden their STEM experiences and to apply to internships, summer experiences, and REU programs. This scholarship program will directly affect the success of the students involved as well as impact how science education is conducted in the future. The project will be evaluated through attitudinal surveys, graduation and retention rate data, STEM course performance, and questionnaires on all project components. Project results will be disseminated to the campus community and at national meetings focused on STEM education as data is evaluated yearly. S-STEM scholars will make YouTube videos to showcase their experiences throughout their time at UTM. The incorporation of the STEM Academy will serve as a model for all STEM and ideally other disciplines within the university and at other 4-year institutions with similar demographics.</AbstractNarration>
