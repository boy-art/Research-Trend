    <AbstractNarration>Loyola University Maryland aims to increase STEM graduation rates through the Computer Science - Physics, and Mathematics Statistics (C-PaMS) scholars program. The C-PaMS program will enroll two cohorts, in consecutive years, to major in STEM disciplines. Scholars will receive a rigorous education taught by faculty with a passion for undergraduate teaching, a focus on interdisciplinary science, and a strong grounding in the liberal arts. Scholars will develop as a cohort, through a first-year pre-orientation program and a living-learning program. These programs will include shared mentors to orient scholars to college life and to advise them about STEM opportunities. In subsequent years, each cohort will continue to develop, as the scholars enroll in a colloquium that connects them with local STEM professionals and an interdisciplinary project-based course. Throughout their four years, the scholars will be advised and encouraged to participate in STEM research and internship opportunities. Through these experiences, scholars will gain the knowledge, skills, and confidence necessary to succeed in STEM careers and graduate education.Scholarships for academically strong computer science, physics and mathematics students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, have an impact on the number of STEM graduates prepared to help national, regional, and local companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will work with the admissions and financial aid departments at Loyola to recruit and select students for the program. To recruit locally, connections will be made with Baltimore City High Schools. Recruitment strategies will be designed to encourage participation from women and underrepresented groups by focusing on local magnet high schools, where over 75 percent of the student population is from these groups. The objectives of the program will be to: (1) increase the affordability and access to STEM degrees, (2) Build cohorts to support student success, (3) provide interdisciplinary STEM opportunities, and (4) increase graduation rates in STEM by providing academic support for scholars. Through evaluation and assessment, the project team will be able to determine which objectives correspond with high levels of success in STEM at Loyola. Results from the evaluation and assessment components of the program will be disseminated at professional conferences and journals to encourage the development of similar programs at other higher education institutions.</AbstractNarration>
