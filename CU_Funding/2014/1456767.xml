    <AbstractNarration>An international workshop entitled, "Micro and Macro Systems in Life Sciences", will take place June 8-13, 2015, at the Stefan Banach International Mathematical Center of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IM PAN), in Bedlewo, Poland. The workshop's goals are to bring together applied mathematicians and researchers working on various levels of systems describing phenomena in the life sciences along with some medical doctors and biologists in order to exchange ideas and initiate and promote collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding problems in the life sciences is a complex issue and involves the analysis of systems on a variety of micro and macro levels. The topics under consideration will include micro and macro systems in cancer biology, multi-scale modeling in physiology, intracellular and intercellular signaling as well as epidemiology and infectious diseases. Over the past years, the list of mathematical tools that has proven useful in analyzing and understanding biological phenomena has grown tremendously. They include new multi-scale techniques in system theory that bridge across different spatial and temporal scales, new directions in dynamical systems, partial differential equation, control theory and computational techniques. The workshop will emphasize the mathematical tools currently available as well as focus on new tools to be developed in order to address current challenges in the life sciences. The workshop will also bring together researchers from the United States and Europe which will facilitate the establishment of more sustained relationships and catalyze new collaborations. A special effort is made to ensure participation of Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers who are in the early stages of their careers to expose them to the wealth of possibilities of research in this field and to discuss career and funding opportunities. The workshop will have substantial participation of women and minorities. Proceedings of the workshop will be published as a special issue in the journal "Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering"</AbstractNarration>
