    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Paresh Ray and colleagues at Jackson State University (JSU), to host an REU site called "Chemistry of Nanoscale Architectures for Imaging and Environmental Applications at Jackson State University Serving Minority and Disadvantaged Students." This REU site will provide ten weeks of research and educational experiences for eight undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented minorities and non-research intensive universities. Built around a theme of understanding the imaging and environmental applications of nanoscale architectures and their environmental implications, this REU site is led by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, nanotechnologists, environmental engineers, and environmental scientists. The REU students will be provided with career and educational activities that include nanoscience-related research projects, short courses on nanoscience and workshops on scientific writing. There will also be training in presentation skills and counseling on graduate study in chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site, hosted at the fifth largest HBCU (Historically Black College and University) in the nation, seeks to promote diversity in the future scientific workforce in nanoscience. Through their experience at JSU, the participants will be provided with valuable educational/research experiences as they consider career pathways in science. For the students from non-research intensive institutions, this will be an experience that they might otherwise not have. The principal broader impact of this REU site is on the training and mentoring of African American and disadvantaged students with great potential for careers in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
