    <AbstractNarration>Given the growing importance of Federal administrative agencies in the United States government, it has becoming increasingly interesting and important to study the political activity and management of non-elected Federal employees. Elected politicians are delegating increasing levels of policy-making authority to non-elected Federal employees. This increased level of delegation provides opportunities for the Federal employees to manipulate policy to serve personal agendas, which in turn poses a challenge for the elected politicians. This project will measure the political activities of non-elected public employees and use these measurements to develop and test three new theories concerning the legislative control of federal agencies, the job performance of appointed and non-appointed federal employees, and the stability of workforces within different federal agencies. First, regarding legislative control of agencies, this project will examine how Congress perceives the political dispositions of different federal agencies and how these perceptions influence Congress' willingness to delegate and entrust significant regulatory authority to certain agencies more than others. Second, regarding the job performance of federal employees, this project examines whether more politically diverse agencies perform better than agencies with a politically homogenous workforce and leadership. Finally, regarding workforce stability, this project will examine which types of agencies are prone to being more politically stable across presidential administrations. Together, these studies will help us understand how the political ideas and ideals of the individual federal employees are different from the agencies they work within. We will examine how these differences may or may not impact political control and the functioning of bureaucracy. The work will also seek to provide insight into how elected politicians decide to delegate work or not, how differences in political ideas and ideals of non-elected Federal employees impacts policy, and insight into some of the reasons for serving as Federal employees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops new substantive theories concerning the political activity of federal agency employees and legislative control of these agencies. The project also produces the necessary data products, statistical tools, and methods to empirically evaluate these new theories. Existing research on bureaucracies has suffered from difficulties in measuring and understanding the political ideas and ideals of individual non-elected employees within Federal agencies. While recent studies have made significant progress in estimating these political ideas and ideals of these individual employees, the studies have not considered the variation in political ideas and ideals among the non-elected employees at all of the various levels within federal agencies. This project will help scholars to better study bureaucratic political ideas and ideals not only at the Federal level but in other contexts, such as at the state level, in an accurate way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce public datasets that scholars can use to study not only these issues, but also other topics related to public bureaucracies. Furthermore, the study will produce educational materials that help teachers incorporate the data into class lesson plans related to public bureaucracy and campaign finance. The undergraduate and graduate students that work on the project will gain valuable skills in data organization, analysis, and the research process, and in-depth knowledge about how to study the public bureaucracy scientifically. Finally, the study will provide information that policy makes can use to think about the structure and design of Federal agencies and personnel practices, with potential benefits being improving access to government services, and improving access to government services by underserved populations including minorities</AbstractNarration>
