    <AbstractNarration>Above 70 miles over the ground, the near-Earth's environment (Geospace) is mostly organized by the Earth's magnetic field, which at a greater distance interacts with the solar wind (charged particles, plasma, flowing with a great speed from the Sun) and interplanetary magnetic field (extended Sun's magnetic field). Geospace is mostly populated by plasma that originates either in the atmosphere or in the solar wind. Interaction of the these two major players - magnetic fields and charged particles - takes various forms and produces many interesting electromagnetic phenomena such as aurorae (Northern and Southern lights), plasma waves, natural electromagnetic radiation and currents, etc., especially in the polar areas where this interaction is most intense and reaches close to the Earth. Studying these phenomena is important since they affect satellite instrumentation and communication, as well as important technologies such as GPS (Global Positioning System). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A research effort previously funded by NSF and performed in Antarctica within the last few years made new discoveries related to natural electromagnetic phenomena in the polar areas. These discoveries are: (1) correlations between powerful auroral kilometric radiation observed at ~200,000 km above the Earth and analogous signals observed simultaneously at the South Pole Station; (2) discovery of radiation at a high harmonic of the electron cyclotron frequency (an important frequency at which charged particles oscillate in a magnetic field); and (3) discovery of a new type of radio emission of auroral origin. These phenomena are best observed, and in most cases can only be observed, using instruments deployed in Antarctica where a manmade electromagnetic interference is minimal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new research built on these discoveries will significantly advance our knowledge of the Earth's natural electromagnetic environment, which in turn has significant impact on the broader Geospace environment and space weather because of how interconnected these systems are. Furthermore, the new discoveries probed by this research represent outstanding questions of Geospace research that have escaped scientists' attention so far. The research is a cost-effective investment that will advance the state of knowledge of the Geospace domain and provide students at Dartmouth College with an opportunity to obtain good skills and experience with experimental measurements and data analysis.</AbstractNarration>
