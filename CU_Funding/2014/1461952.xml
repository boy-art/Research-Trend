    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and educational activities in the area of strongly interacting electron matter. The key problem motivating this study is the physics of materials exhibiting high temperature superconductivity. These materials, which were discovered in 1987, conduct electricity without any power loss when cooled below a critical temperature which is much larger than temperatures required for "conventional" superconductors. Even though close to 3 decades has passed since their discovery, no clear understanding of these high-temperature superconductors has emerged. The problem is that the physics of these materials requires the solution to some of the key unsolved problems in theoretical physics and mathematics. The research activity discussed in this project focuses on some of these problems with an eye for making predictions for new superconducting materials. The PI and his research team will solve models that are relevant to high temperature superconductors and geared toward unlocking the long-standing puzzle of what the electrons do before they enter the superconducting phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support graduate students seeking their PhD degrees in theoretical solid state physics. In addition, the PI will 1) continue with his recruitment activities of underrepresented minority students to the graduate program in physics at the University of Illinois, 2) enhance scientific literacy by giving elementary physics demonstrations to local public and private schools, and 3) continue with his public lectures on strongly coupled systems at universities in developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and educational activities in the area of strongly interacting electron matter. The key problem motivating this study is the physics of materials exhibiting high temperature superconductivity. These materials reside in parameter space where traditional perturbative methods in field theory fail. To solve this problem, the PI and his research team will use newly developed methods in string theory to bridge the gap between where perturbative methods fail and strong coupling physics resides. The specific goals are 1) to provide an explanation for the power-law optical conductivity in the copper-oxide superconductors, 2) to develop a model for Fermi arcs in the normal state, 3) to find a solution to the problem of strongly coupled fixed points, 4) to propose a realistic model for superconductivity in the presence of Fermi arcs and 5) to develop computational tools for strongly coupled systems in the presence of disorder. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support graduate students seeking their PhD degrees in theoretical solid state physics.
