    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the Community College of Aurora in Aurora, Colorado will provide scholarships to students enrolled full-time in STEM disciplines. Twelve scholarships will be offered at the beginning of each academic year to begin a new cohort of STEM scholars. The program includes comprehensive support and transition services, with a particular emphasis on cohort development and support. These activities will increase STEM course success, program retention, and graduation and four-year transition rates. Program graduates will contribute to the continued success of the aerospace, software, and other technology-based industries in the region. Scholarships for academically strong students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will increase the number of graduates prepared to support national, regional, and local companies. The success of the program will produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic growth of Colorado and the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this S-STEM program the Community College of Aurora (CCA) will conduct a five-year effort to recruit, support, and graduate students with academic talent and demonstrated financial need. The program will provide twelve scholarships in years one and five of the program, and twenty-four in years two, three, and four. A new cohort of STEM scholars will begin at the start of each academic year. Scholarships will renew for a second year provided scholars meet academic targets and other program requirements. CCA will encourage applications from first generation, women and students from groups currently underrepresented in STEM professions. Improved retention and increased graduation rates will be achieved through comprehensive support and transition services, with a particular emphasis on CCA-based STEM faculty and cohort support. Mentoring will include regular meetings with an assigned STEM faculty mentor. Learning community activities organized around cohorts will focus on study and tutoring needs, guest lectures on STEM careers, visits to STEM companies and four-year academic programs, and other career development activities. Lessons learned and effective practices that emerge from the program evaluation will be disseminated to the STEM education community and help increase widespread understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs.</AbstractNarration>
