    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Matt Shores and James Neilson of Colorado State University are leading a summer research program to engage undergraduate students in chemistry research applied to real world challenges, spanning problems concerning the environment to energy to medicine. Nine students each summer, for three summers, participate in a 10-week research program. Broader impacts are addressed by providing opportunities for scientific discovery to students who might not otherwise have that access. The fundamental research experiences are augmented with activities directed toward educational and professional development, including writing workshops, career panels, presentation opportunities, field trips to industrial sites, and scientific ethics modules. Graduate students and postdocs interacting closely with REU participants are trained in effective mentoring techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in this REU program perform research with one of 27 faculty mentors at CSU, some in collaborative and cross-disciplinary projects. Research thrusts include nanomaterials development for batteries, magnets and solar cells; (asymmetric) catalysis and organic and peptide syntheses for precise control of fine chemical molecular structures; and development of spectroscopy and spectrometry techniques for energy exploration and environmental sensing. Training on multiple techniques through CSU's Central Instrument Facility and presentations at interdisciplinary research meetings are key aspects of helping students translate basic research to addressing real world challenges. Research results are disseminated widely in student presentations and as manuscripts published in competitive chemistry journals. The REU program activities are integrated with several research collaborations and ongoing initiatives at CSU, greatly broadening the overall reach of their program.</AbstractNarration>
