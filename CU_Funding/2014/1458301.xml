    <AbstractNarration>For the Growing Opportunities in Technology and Engineering Careers (GO TEC) project, the project will award at least 10 scholarships annually to academically talented, financially needy students pursuing associate degrees in technology and engineering at Indian Hills Community College (IHCC). GO TEC will target eleven academic programs, including Agricultural/Biofuels Process Technology, Bioprocessing Laboratory Technology, Electrical and Renewable Energy Technology, Computer Software Development, and Engineering. In terms of broader impacts, important goals include increasing to 80% the proportion of GO TEC participants earning an associate's degree in one of the targeted programs, and increasing to 90% the proportion of GO TEC participants enrolling in further education or becoming employed after earning an associate's degree. Diversity goals will seek to increase underrepresented minority student enrollment by 25% and female participation in the targeted programs by 20%. The overarching outcome goal of the project will be to increase the number of students obtaining postsecondary degrees and pursuing careers in technology and engineering in rural southeast Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the scholarship award, participants will receive comprehensive academic and personal support. These added support structures include faculty mentoring and participation in an active learning community through a series of STEM-related courses and activities for participants. The project design takes into account research on successful scholarship programs and utilizes best practices such as establishing an active learning community for participants. Primary project activities include: recruiting and selecting academically promising students with financial need; linking participants to program-specific faculty mentors; providing a community of learning and support for participants through a required series of courses and activities for participants; and ensuring participants have the tools and resources needed to further their education or enter the workforce in a related field after graduation. The project team from numerous areas of the College includes faculty and staff who each play an integral role in ensuring the success of the project.</AbstractNarration>
