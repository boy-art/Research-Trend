    <AbstractNarration>Changes in the upper atmosphere and in its ionized part (ionosphere) can be detrimental to human activities. They can affect satellite drag, which in turn affects satellite lifetimes. Short term changes can lead the formation of storm-enhanced densities, rising atmospheric bubbles, solar flare-induced ionization enhancements, and propagating atmospheric holes and plasma patches. These upper atmospheric disturbances have adverse effects on GPS navigation systems, power grids, over-the-horizon radar systems, and High Frequency (HF) communications used by the military, emergency responders, and airlines. This research is focused on elucidating the physics that governs these processes, leading to improved specification and forecast models, and better mitigation strategies for adverse upper atmosphere weather disturbances. Space 'climate' studies will involve the use of long-duration radar and satellite datasets and model studies to determine the reasons for long-term upper atmosphere changes. &lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of this research are to study the effects that various plasma and neutral gas transport processes have on the ionosphere-thermosphere system, and to study coupling mechanisms that are relevant to the near-Earth space environment. The research involves an extensive use of data from NSF-funded and other ground-based facilities and satellites, including data from Incoherent Scatter Radars [Arecibo, Millstone Hill, Poker Flat (PFISR), Resolute Bay (RISR) and EISCAT], SuperDARN radars, ionosondes, and satellites (DMSP, ACE and SDO). The research will be conducted with the aid of high-resolution, global-scale, physics-based models of the ionosphere, thermosphere, and electrodynamics. The project will focus on long-term ionospheric changes and observation and modeling of the space-atmosphere interaction region.</AbstractNarration>
