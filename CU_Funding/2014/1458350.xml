    <AbstractNarration>This project will build a learning community for STEM students at Raritan Valley Community College through faculty mentoring, career development activities, cohort building and access to key student services. Approximately 34 scholars will participate in the learning community, which is designed to improve students' educational experiences and connection to peers, faculty and the college, all with the objective of increasing STEM retention, degree achievement and successful transfer to four-year institutions. Partnerships among multiple stakeholders (high schools, 4-year institutions, community organizations, and local employers) will support a well-rounded plan for recruitment, retention, and then placement in the workforce or colleges and universities that grant bachelor's degrees. This project is expected to have an impact on the number of STEM graduates prepared to help national, regional, and local companies compete and innovate in the global economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the influence of i) improved academic and social integration and ii) improvement in economic circumstances on educational outcomes for academically talented STEM students with demonstrated financial need. In addition to expanding efforts to nurture a STEM learning community (see activities above), the quality and rigor of assessment and evaluation activities will be enhanced in order to test whether efforts to help students assimilate and financial assistance can explain their retention and commitment to complete STEM majors. Formative evaluation will address scholars' satisfaction with the project and its contribution towards their satisfaction with the institution, their educational progression, and their career development. Summative evaluation will consist of an analysis of the alignment of retention and enrollment with the project objectives. In addition an analysis will be done on the long-term effects of the project on student placement in college or in the workforce and persistence in STEM fields. Dissemination of the results of evaluation will be done through conferences and workshops focused on higher education and pedagogy. Potential conferences include the Faculty of the Future conference held annually at Bucks County Community College and Best Practices Conference in New York City sponsored by the Institute of International Education.</AbstractNarration>
