    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Eastern Oregon University (EOU) will provide scholarships and support services to academically-talented students majoring in biology, chemistry-biochemistry, computer science, and mathematics who demonstrate financial need. EOU is a 4-year, public institution serving economically and technologically disadvantaged rural communities across Oregon. Thus, the project will recruit potential scholarship recipients via visits to local high schools and community colleges, as well as community outreach to other Pacific Northwest regions and events that bring prospective students and parents to the EOU campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the Advancing Science and Technology in Eastern Oregon (ASTEO) S-STEM project are to (a) increase the enrollment of academically talented students with financial need in STEM majors; (b) increase retention and graduation rates, while reducing time to graduation, for ASTEO scholars relative to similar populations within the university; (c) increase the number and diversity of STEM graduates from EOU who enter and remain in the STEM workforce or enter graduate school in a STEM discipline; and (d) contribute to regional economic development by preparing well educated graduates who enter STEM-related professions. The program will support a total of 23 students, including 11 incoming freshmen (four-year awards) and 12 transfer students (two-year awards). Key elements of the program will include opportunities for residential students to live together; a freshman seminar; academic support services; faculty and peer mentoring; high-quality enrichment activities; opportunities for research and internships; and a STEM Ambassadors program, in which more senior ASTEO scholars serve as peer tutors and participate in recruiting, mentoring, and networking for the S-STEM project. Evaluation of the success of the project will inform institutional practices for recruiting, design of first-year courses, and student enrichment and academic support services.</AbstractNarration>
