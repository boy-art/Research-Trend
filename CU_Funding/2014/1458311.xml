    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to Tulane University to reconstruct the field notes of R.D. Suttkus and associate them with specimens in the fish collection. The collecting efforts of Suttkus and his collaborators amassed over 6 million specimens that is recognized as a National Center for Ichthyology Research. The field notes documenting critical environmental and locality characteristics for collected specimens were destroyed as a result of flooding by Hurricane Katrina. This project will facilitate the addition of rich sampling and environmental data, of the kind Suttkus and his associates recorded in their field notes, with the specimens housed in the Tulane University fish collection. This will enhance the value of the collection allowing researchers to use the data to address important scientific and societal needs such as research on fish species distribution, habitat conservation, environmental restoration, and species response to global change. The project will build on the researchers achievements in student training and broadening participation in collections-based endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R.D. Suttkus Fish collection database at Tulane University, currently hosted on a Microsoft SQL Server, will be extended to support the additional fields and tables needed to capture the images and information contained within the field notes and logbooks. Field logbook and transcribed data sheet images will be captured using a NIKON Coolpix p90 v.1.0 camera mounted on a copy stand. Each image will be 4,000 pixels wide by 3,000 pixels wide with a bit depth of 24, horizontal resolution of 300 dots per inch and vertical resolution of 300 dots per inch. The RAW image file for each page photographed as well as an uncompressed TIFF will be preserved. A project technician and a number of student interns working in the summer will enter data from the field notes to the fish collection database and produce web content of Suttkus's professional career for an expanded Suttkus Memorial Website.</AbstractNarration>
