    <AbstractNarration>Learning by observation and through social interaction is common in humans and other animals. Yet, the neural circuits involved in this complex form of learning are still poorly understood. The goal of this research is identify the brain circuits involved in learning from social experiences. This research is challenging because it requires methods for monitoring and manipulating neural circuit activity during social interactions, and ideally, during interactions that result in quantifiable changes in behavior. Songbirds and humans are among the very few animals that learn their vocalizations (song or speech) by imitating their parents or other social models. Juvenile songbirds memorize the song of an adult model through social experiences and use this memory to accurately imitate this song later in life. The PI is using optical methods for manipulating neural circuit activity in juvenile songbirds as they memorize the song of an adult model in order to identify the brain regions involved in this complex form of learning. Because the brain circuits involved in song and speech are analogous, this research can provide fundamental insights into the neural basis for complex human behavior, such as speech learning and social communication. Further, through designed outreach programs this research will help increase the quality of science education in the Dallas/Fort Worth region. The Principal Investigator and staff in his laboratory are working to train middle school and high school science teachers, and high school students through hands on systems neuroscience research. This training involves analytical, behavioral and biological methods as well as cutting edge behavioral and genetic methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juvenile songbirds memorize the song of an adult model through social experiences and use this memory to accurately imitate this song later in life. The Principal Investigator has developed behavioral, and optogenetic methods for manipulating neural circuit activity in juvenile songbirds as they memorize the song of an adult model, thus providing the necessary methods to dissect the brain circuit involved in learning from social experience. This research will test if the memory of a vocal model is stored in motor circuits involved in producing the learned vocal behavior, as suggested by mirror neuron models of speech and language learning, or in auditory circuits, as suggested by auditory template models. Using optogenetic inhibition of neural activity in the juvenile brain, this research will test the necessity of individual cell types in the encoding of tutor song memory.</AbstractNarration>
