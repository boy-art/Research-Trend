    <AbstractNarration>This project is to design, develop, construct, operate and analyze the results of a dual spacecraft CubeSat mission named "Terrestrial RaYs Analysis and Detection" (TRYAD). The purpose of TRYAD is to help solve the mystery of a phenomenon that's linked with lightning: terrestrial gamma rays, or TGFs. Bursts of gamma rays usually occur far out in space, near black holes and other high-energy cosmic phenomena. Scientists were surprised when, in the mid-1990s, they found strong gamma-ray flashes happening in the skies over Earth. Powerful natural particle accelerators in the atmosphere are involved in creating lightning but the exact process is not yet known. TGFs result from this particle acceleration. The specific objective of TRYAD is to observe TGFs from two separate points within their beams. All other existing and planned TGF observations are single-point. With a pair of CubeSats, therefore, TRYAD will make unique, first-of-its-kind TGF observations that are crucial for being able to distinguish between several existing models for the acceleration process that is a key part of lightning. In this way, the project will help advance the fundamental understanding of this intriguing and important phenomenon in the Earth atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond its impact on lightening physics, TRYAD will pursue extensive hands-on learning and training objectives for undergraduate students at both Auburn University and University of Alabama in Huntsville. Building on the experiences from the successful, established CubeSat program at AU, the Auburn University Student Space Program (AUSSP), most of the tasks throughout the project will be carried out by student teams under the expert supervision of teams of professors at both institutions. Further, the project will be supported through for-credit classes at both universities. Students from outside AU and UAH will be offered an opportunity to participate via UAH?s existing Heliophysics Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. Likewise, CubeSat and TGF-related activities will be included in the annual Summer Student Institute for High School Students at AU, which is an effective way to attract high-achieving students into the program. The new, largely unproven technology involved in cubesat missions, inherently makes the project associated with significant risks. On the other hand, the project has tremendous potential to be transformational not only within its own research area of lightening physics but also for the larger field of space science and atmospheric research as well as within aerospace engineering and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the TYRAD Mission is to measure the beam profiles and tilts of TGFs in order to distinguish between various classes of TGF initiation models. The results will advance our understanding of the physical process involved in TGF particle acceleration as well as of the thunderstorm electric fields. A pair of 3U CubeSats separated by several hundred km in low Earth orbit will provide the measurements. TRYAD is a focused mission that maximizes the gamma-ray sensitivity by carrying only gamma-ray detectors. Control of the satellite separation is essential to the success of the mission and this is achieved by using ionospheric differential drag on the two satellites, actively changed through modifying the orientation of the deployed solar panels.</AbstractNarration>
