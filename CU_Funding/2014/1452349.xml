    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award supports the research and education program of the Principal Investigator in the general area of "transport phenomena." Transport phenomena are ubiquitous in nature, whether at the large scale of our macroscopic world or at the very small scale of microscopic particles. They describe interactions and exchanges between systems, and how quantities of interest are transported from one location to another. This project focuses on two important instances of these phenomena: the transport of light or sound waves in complex environments, and the transport of particles in devices at the nanometer scale. These two topics have many applications in various fundamental domains such as telecommunications, non-destructive testing, medical imaging, and nanoelectronics. Very often, transport phenomena are multiscale, in the sense that the underlying physics involves various spatial or temporal scales of very different orders of magnitude. As a consequence, the description and the computer simulation of transport processes are extremely difficult, and this is where mathematical analysis plays a central role. By identifying a set of important parameters, the original models can be simplified into reduced models, more amenable to analysis and computations. This notion of asymptotic analysis is the common thread of the two topics of the project. The project will advance new mathematical models and techniques, as well as new computational methods for transport phenomena in complex media and in quantum systems. The research will impact, in particular, the field of target or defect localization in disordered media, as well as the modeling of semiconductors. The project integrates research with an educational plan that is designed to reach various generations, from high school to doctoral students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses two topics related to transport phenomena. The first one concerns quantum hydrodynamical transport models for nanodevices, which offer a reduced yet accurate macroscopic description of the dynamics at the quantum scale. The main objectives are to build a complete mathematical theory for recent formal models, to develop numerical methods for their simulations, and to validate the models for future applications. A key ingredient in the theory is the "quantum moment problem," which is a generalization to density operators of the classical moment problem for measures. The second topic concerns inverse problems in random media. The main goal is to develop transformative transport-based methods for imaging in strongly diffusive environments for which no efficient techniques are available as of today. Such methods are based upon understanding the transfer of information from the microscopic scale to the macroscopic scale. The stress will be put on random media with long-range correlations, such as the turbulent atmosphere, which offer an ultimate benchmark for the methods proposed in the project. The problem of fast intensity imaging algorithms using optimization techniques will also be addressed.</AbstractNarration>
