    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical sciences (21) This project is developing a model course of study that integrates teachers' knowledge of mathematics, technology, pedagogy and student thinking. The central course materials consist of two suites of modules, one on Data Analysis and Probability, and a second focusing on Geometry that can function as key components within larger teacher preparation programs. The modules provide opportunities for prospective middle and secondary mathematics teachers to develop: 1) deeper conceptual understanding of school mathematics topics, 2) proficiency in using technology tools, 3) effective pedagogical techniques, and 4) abilities to analyze students' thinking when using technology tools to solve mathematical tasks. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its alignment with calls from leading professional bodies, e.g. the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences, that advocate for not just the blind use of technology in learning K-16 mathematics, but for an understanding of its appropriate and effective use to promote conceptual learning. Enhancing such understanding at the pre-service level is thus an important strategy. Because of their modular design, the materials exert a broad impact across different settings, for example: i) in a methods course focusing on the use of technology in the teaching of mathematics, ii) as a unit within a mathematics course, or iii) as part of a professional development for in-service teachers. Developing faculty expertise is also a key project activity and further increases the project's broader impacts by preparing faculty at a diverse set of institutions to implement the modules and form a national network of expert technology-using mathematics teacher educators.</AbstractNarration>
