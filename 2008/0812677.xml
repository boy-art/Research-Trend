    <AbstractNarration>The Social Web is changing the way people create and use information. &lt;br/&gt;Sites like Flickr, Del.icio.us, Digg, and others, enable users to &lt;br/&gt;publish and organize content and participate in communities. &lt;br/&gt;The information they create while interacting with content and &lt;br/&gt;other users is called social metadata. Tags, one example of social &lt;br/&gt;metadata, were introduced as a means for individuals to organize their &lt;br/&gt;content by assigning freely-chosen keywords to it. Some Social &lt;br/&gt;Web sites now also allow users to organize content hierarchically. &lt;br/&gt;The photosharing site Flickr, for example, allows users to group &lt;br/&gt;related photos in sets, and related sets in collections. Although&lt;br/&gt;social metadata lacks formal structure, it captures the collective &lt;br/&gt;knowledge of the community. Once extracted from the traces left by &lt;br/&gt;many users, such collective knowledge will add a rich semantic layer &lt;br/&gt;to the content of the Social Web. This project will develop a &lt;br/&gt;probabilistic framework to combine diverse types of social metadata &lt;br/&gt;to construct a common concept hierarchy. In addition, the methods &lt;br/&gt;developed by the project will use social relations, in the form of &lt;br/&gt;community participation, to discover community-specific vocabularies &lt;br/&gt;and concepts, and identify facets of multi-dimensional concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the future, Social Web sites and data management tools will allow &lt;br/&gt;users to express ever richer types of knowledge, including complex &lt;br/&gt;predicates and semantic relations. The ability to aggregate &lt;br/&gt;individually expressed knowledge into a unified whole will &lt;br/&gt;transform the way people use information. Global concept hierarchies, &lt;br/&gt;for instance, can help users visualize how their content relates &lt;br/&gt;to that of others and allow for more efficient browsing, search &lt;br/&gt;and discovery. By linking content to a common concept hierarchy, &lt;br/&gt;the methods developed by the project could also be used to integrate &lt;br/&gt;disparate data and align it across domains. The proposed work, &lt;br/&gt;therefore, addresses one of the more important emerging questions &lt;br/&gt;in AI, namely, how to harness the power of collective intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information about this project, please see the project &lt;br/&gt;Web site at http://www.isi.edu/~lerman/projects/folksonomy.html.</AbstractNarration>
