    <AbstractNarration>This project establishes a science-based protocol for optimizing processing and heat treatment routes to produce a new class of materials (electrodeposited Ni-base superalloys) that will dramatically improve the functionality of electrodeposited LIGA materials. An international research team from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) collaborate on this task. Overarching scientific issues addressed by this team include: (i) control and optimization of electrodeposition parameters to uniformly entrain Al nano-particles in electrodeposited Ni micro-components, (ii) development of heat treat schedules required to transform the as-deposited green composites into ?×?{?×¡¦ superalloy microstructures, and (iii) characterization of the resultant microstructures and attendant mechanical properties. Close interaction of the research groups allows for optimization of the process flow and result in the creation of novel high temperature LIGA electrodeposited Ni-base superalloys for MEMS applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technological motivation for this collaboration is derived from the opportunity to expand the temperature capability of current MEMS materials. To date, the majority of commercial MEMS devices have been thin film sensors manufactured using chemical and vapor deposition processes. The availability of LIGA Ni-base superalloys would greatly expand the design space for next generation MEMS devices. Development of a process flow for electrodeposition of Ni-base superalloys will also lay the foundation for electrodeposition repair strategies that would provide tremendous technological and economic advantage in the repair of turbine blades for both jet propulsion and power generation. International exchanges of graduate students and senior personnel fuel and enable this collaboration and provide a unique educational experience for all participants. Moreover, the proposed inclusion of Baltimore city high school students through mentoring at JHU and a foreign visit to KIT will greatly expand their academic and cultural horizons.</AbstractNarration>
