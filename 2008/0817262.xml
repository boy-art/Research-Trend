    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project for "Improving National acceptance of Computing Intensive Statistical Techniques (INCIST)" is developing, field testing, and disseminating materials for teaching computationally intensive techniques for almost all of the topics in introductory statistics. This project is designed to study the ways in which these materials enable students to develop a deeper understanding of statistical concepts. These comprehensive modules are web-based, utilize the low-cost yet computationally powerful statistical software StatCrunch, contain interactive multimedia presentations for students, and include extensive instructor materials. While the materials can serve as a stand-alone course, they are also modular so that parts can also be integrated into a course which is taught using a typical introductory statistics textbook. The INCIST resources are useful for statistics instructors at a large number of institutions including those teaching at community colleges and smaller liberal arts colleges. This project also holds workshops to train instructors on using the modules in their courses.</AbstractNarration>
