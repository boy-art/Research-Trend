    <AbstractNarration>The increasing problems of power, heat dissipation, and design&lt;br/&gt;complexity have caused a shift in processor technology to favor&lt;br/&gt;multicore multiprocessors. Along with that shift, the sharing of&lt;br/&gt;memory hierarchy becomes deeper, heterogeneous and more complex,&lt;br/&gt;causing cache contention, increased conflicts, and also, synergy&lt;br/&gt;sharing. Without understanding the implications of this change,&lt;br/&gt;current multicore systems suffer from considerable performance&lt;br/&gt;degradation, poor performance isolation and inferior fairness&lt;br/&gt;guarantees. The urgency of these issues increases as the degree of&lt;br/&gt;processor-level parallelism increments rapidly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior studies, mostly in areas of architecture and operating systems,&lt;br/&gt;rely on simple heuristics to estimate cache requirement of corunning&lt;br/&gt;programs; the inaccuracy and overhead limits their scalability and&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness. This work tackles these challenges uniquely from the&lt;br/&gt;compiler aspect by constructing predictive behavior models for&lt;br/&gt;corunning processes, developing cache-sharing-aware program&lt;br/&gt;transformations and loop scheduling, and combining the program-level&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of programming systems with the proactive resource&lt;br/&gt;management by runtime systems. Specifically, this work proposes&lt;br/&gt;inclusive reuse signatures to characterize inclusive locality---the&lt;br/&gt;memory behavior of corunning programs on shared caches, and&lt;br/&gt;inter-thread affinity models to capture data locality among parallel&lt;br/&gt;threads. It tackles the challenges facing the measurement, prediction&lt;br/&gt;and exploitation of inclusive locality. The analysis opens new&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for shared-cache optimizations by both compilers and&lt;br/&gt;runtime systems. The PI develops a series of program transformations,&lt;br/&gt;such as inter-thread memory reorganization and cache-sharing aware&lt;br/&gt;loop scheduling, to increase inter-thread spacial locality and&lt;br/&gt;ameliorate conflicts, contention and false sharing. For runtime&lt;br/&gt;systems, this work invents proactive cache management which partitions&lt;br/&gt;caches or schedules processes according to predicted inclusive&lt;br/&gt;locality proactively, overcoming the limitations of current reactive&lt;br/&gt;schemes on scalability, accuracy and effectiveness.</AbstractNarration>
