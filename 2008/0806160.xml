    <AbstractNarration>Professor John Simons of the University of Utah is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study the molecular mechanism for electron capture dissociation (ECD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectrometry using theoretical methods. These studies seek better understanding and predictive capability for these relatively new and important approaches to mass spectrometric characterization of biomolecules. They are expected to have important impact in the fields like proteomics, where they may eventually provide means to better control and application of mass spectrometric characterization of the structure of peptides and proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through collaborations with experimental groups, Prof. Simons' work provides valuable training in both theoretical and analytical methodology to a diverse group of graduate students and postdocs. More broadly, he has been active in providing training opportunities to a wide audience through Internet-based materials and the establishment of summer schools aimed at enhancing the teaching of theoretical physical chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
