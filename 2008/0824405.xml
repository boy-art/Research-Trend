    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research and educational efforts focus on the development and application of a new class of image sensor architectures with transformative effects on biomedical optical diagnostics. The aim is to further advance the field of near-infrared spectroscopy by developing miniaturized, multi-spectral, imaging sensors with pixel-level RF detection and signal processing. The proposed work will improve image resolution, reduce acquisition time, and enable portability of frequency-domain diffuse optical tomography (FD-DOT) systems. A mixed-mode design methodology for high-sensitivity optical imaging sensors optimized for phase-sensitive detection of RF-modulated optical signals will be explored. The optical and electrical performance of photodetector structures in nanometer-scale VLSI technologies will be evaluated with an emphasis on the affect of new high-k dielectric materials and metal layer stacking on photoresponse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting research will have broader impacts in many areas, including medical optical diagnostics, high-performance image sensor technology, and the semiconductor industry workforce. A central focus of the proposed activities is to broaden opportunities to students from underrepresented groups and engage students at all levels in interdisciplinary research and integrated circuit design training. A summer enrichment program will be launched, incorporating IC CAD tool training, coursework, a team-based research project, and visits to labs/companies in the greater Boston area. There is a strong mentoring and training component for students at all levels.</AbstractNarration>
