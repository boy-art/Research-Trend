    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Award funds an education and research program aimed at the exploration of new quantum phenomena in graphene nanoelectronic devices. Electrons in graphene, a single-atom thick sheet of graphite, behave very differently from electrons in conventional metals or semiconductors. In particular, their behavior mimics that of ultra-relativistic particles. This results both in many exciting fundamental physics phenomena and also unique electronic properties, such as the world's record electron mobility, with great potential in future nanoelectronic technologies. This project includes a strong interaction between education and research, which will result in excellent materials research training for graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, modern teaching methods, such as computer simulations will be introduced, in the introductory quantum mechanics lectures. These simulations will be translated into Spanish to reach out to the Hispanic community in the US and abroad. Outreach activities, via laboratory visits and public lectures, will have a special focus on science communication to the general public and to the media. Recruiting efforts will contribute to the integration of women, minorities and international students, especially from developing countries, into the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This NSF Career award supports a project aimed at understanding the conceptually new behavior of electrons in solids whose effective Hamiltonian is described by the Dirac equation instead of the usual Schrodinger equation. In particular, the research objective is to investigate novel quantum phenomena in graphene, a single-atom thick sheet of graphite, due to its unique relativistic-like electronic structure. Some of these exciting phenomena include the relativistic Josephson effect, Klein tunneling or high-temperature excitonic condensation. To study these phenomena, new nanofabrication methods will be developed to shape graphene into desired nanostructures and the devices will be probed by low-noise variable-temperature transport techniques. This project includes a strong interaction between education and research, which will result in excellent materials research training for graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, modern teaching methods, such as computer simulations will be introduced, in the introductory quantum mechanics lectures. These simulations will be translated into Spanish to reach out to the Hispanic community in the US and abroad.
