    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary(99) This project investigates a radical approach for delivering laboratory courses while utilizing the benefits of emerging computer and web technology (software and hardware) in education. The work brings together an engineer, an educational psychologist and a pedagogical design expert in the design and development a universal Internet-based remote laboratory environment where students can proceed at their own pace with more flexibility. The customizable environment brings together an embedded assessment and monitoring facility (progress of a student and the class as a whole) to a range of laboratory courses, so that faculty/facilitator from STEM disciplines can integrate their laboratory courses with very little effort. Students experience engaging laboratories and a means for developing skills of self-monitoring and reflection, while working from pre-existing knowledge of each student. The concept blends emerging Internet technology, software, computer interfacing, cutting edge graphical user interface, effective pedagogical designs, assessment and evaluation schemes. The developed environment has five important features: a) learning through remote laboratory; b) ease of integration with a range of STEM courses; c) real-time video and audio link with experiments; d) frequent student feedback; and e) faculty/facilitator monitoring of student progress and activities. The remote laboratory entails physical (real) laboratory equipment that is controlled&lt;br/&gt;remotely. The developed environment is validated by using two undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;level laboratory courses (advanced digital design laboratory and control systems laboratory). Advances in cross discipline integration and inquiry into unique challenges posed by an unpredictable arena of human learning are combined with emerging technologies to achieve the highest possible performance in learning. The activities build on knowledge developed during a previous NSF grant and advance this remote laboratory to the next level by making it flexible and more effective for utilization in range of STEM subject areas. The project is potentially transformative because it is converting traditional production-line style laboratory delivery systems to a personalized and individualized approach to learning.</AbstractNarration>
