    <AbstractNarration>non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superconductivity is probably the most widely known example of a&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanical phenomenon manifested at a macroscopic level.&lt;br/&gt;The physical properties attributed to the superconducting state&lt;br/&gt;are spectacular and include the flow of electrical current without&lt;br/&gt;loss and the expulsion of magnetic flux from the interior of a&lt;br/&gt;superconducting sample. These same properties make&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity uniquely useful for many applications. Of&lt;br/&gt;important scientific and technological importance is to understand&lt;br/&gt;how superconductivity survives to high magnetic fields. Many years&lt;br/&gt;ago, it was predicted that this is possible through a mechanism&lt;br/&gt;producing a state of matter inhomogeneous on a microscopic level.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, magnetic resonance techniques will be used to study &lt;br/&gt;superconducting systems for which there is evidence for formation &lt;br/&gt;of a new phase at high fields, including an exploration of their &lt;br/&gt;physical properties, with the aim of identifying the inhomogeneous &lt;br/&gt;phase and characterizing its properties. This work will be complemented&lt;br/&gt;by investigations of new forms of field-induced magnetic states in&lt;br/&gt;a class of magnetic insulators. Magnetic resonance is suitable for&lt;br/&gt;this type of problem because it is sensitive to the environment&lt;br/&gt;locally proximate to the nuclear spins being probed. Graduate&lt;br/&gt;students will engineer and carry out the experimental program&lt;br/&gt;under a range of extreme conditions, including very low&lt;br/&gt;temperatures and high magnetic fields. Undergraduate students will&lt;br/&gt;assist in the design and construction of specific components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of magnetic field-induced phases in superconductors and&lt;br/&gt;quantum spin systems, stabilized by large magnetic fields, will be&lt;br/&gt;studied using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. In the case&lt;br/&gt;of the superconductors, the materials are organic superconductors&lt;br/&gt;with highly anisotropic superconducting properties which weakens&lt;br/&gt;orbital pair-breaking. Evidence exists for distinct high-field&lt;br/&gt;phases in each case, making them excellent candidates for&lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneous superconductivity in a form predicted forty years&lt;br/&gt;ago but not yet confirmed, and for which its properties remain&lt;br/&gt;untested experimentally. Magnetic resonance accommodates easily&lt;br/&gt;the necessary extreme conditions, and it is a local probe&lt;br/&gt;sensitive to inhomogeneities. The quantum spin dimer system is an&lt;br/&gt;S=1 system in which the dimers sit on a layered hexagonal lattice,&lt;br/&gt;and for which thermodynamic measurements give evidence for&lt;br/&gt;multiple phase transitions as the field is varied at temperatures&lt;br/&gt;T&lt;1K. Graduate students will design and carry out the experimental&lt;br/&gt;program, and are assisted by undergraduates who will learn how to&lt;br/&gt;engineer specific components. Evidence for inhomogeneous states&lt;br/&gt;will be looked for, from which new quantum effects are expected to&lt;br/&gt;emerge.</AbstractNarration>
