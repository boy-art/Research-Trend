    <AbstractNarration>Frank M. Horodyski&lt;br/&gt;Molecular and Functional Characterization of the Allatotropin Receptor&lt;br/&gt;IOS-0821930&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neuropeptides are important chemical signals that bind to receptor proteins on their cellular targets. This binding elicits biochemical changes that lead to profound effects on the development and physiology of organisms. The focus of this project is to identify the receptor protein for the insect neuropeptide, allatotropin (AT), by using a combination of molecular biological, biochemical, and bioinformatics approaches. AT has multiple functions which include the regulation of ion transport across the midgut. Ion transport is a fundamental process which is an essential component of every eukaryotic cell, and the identification of the receptor for AT will provide a unique approach to determine the mechanisms by which ion transport is controlled through interfering with its action by using RNA interference technology. This project will provide the experimental tools to clarify the responsiveness of the known target tissues to AT, investigate its interactions with other neuropeptides, and identify novel targets. The results might lead to the development of safe and novel methods to control insect pests by targeting pathways that are specific to AT action. This project includes a significant training component in which a postdoctoral fellow and undergraduate researchers will receive multidisciplinary and integrative training that will encourage the development of independence and problem solving skills that are necessary for a successful career in science.</AbstractNarration>
