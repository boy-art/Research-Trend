    <AbstractNarration>Balan&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807896&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops a new mathematical framework for&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear signal processing and wireless communication channels. &lt;br/&gt;The nonlinear signal processing problem addressed here is signal&lt;br/&gt;reconstruction from the magnitude of a redundant linear&lt;br/&gt;representation. When the linear redundant representation is&lt;br/&gt;associated to a group representation (such as the Weyl-Heisenberg&lt;br/&gt;grgoup), the relevant Hilbert-Schmidt operators inherit this&lt;br/&gt;invariance property. Thus a fast (nonlinear) reconstruction&lt;br/&gt;algorithm seems possible. A wireless communication channel is&lt;br/&gt;modeled as a linear operator that describes how transmitted&lt;br/&gt;signals propagate to a receiver. For ultrawide band (UWB)&lt;br/&gt;signals, the Doppler effect no longer can be modeled as a&lt;br/&gt;frequency shift. Instead it is captured as a time dilation&lt;br/&gt;operator. A continuous superposition of time-scale shifts is&lt;br/&gt;used to model a UWB communication channel, and consequences to&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-differential operator theory are analyzed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator takes up two problems related to signal&lt;br/&gt;processing. In the first he considers how to represent signals&lt;br/&gt;in ways that allow more effective reconstructon of them from&lt;br/&gt;limited information. In the second he analyzes properties of&lt;br/&gt;wireless communication channels, aiming at improvements in&lt;br/&gt;transmission. The solutions to these problems have a strong&lt;br/&gt;impact in the strategic area of information technology. &lt;br/&gt;Important applications such as signal processing, X-ray&lt;br/&gt;crystallography, and quantum computing are affected by solutions&lt;br/&gt;to the first problem. High-impact applications related to the&lt;br/&gt;second problem include ultrawide-band through-wall imaging&lt;br/&gt;systems, higher-throughput 802.15 Wireless Personal Area&lt;br/&gt;Networks, and wireless sensor networks.</AbstractNarration>
