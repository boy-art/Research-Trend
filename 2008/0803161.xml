    <AbstractNarration>Global climate changes are affecting subarctic and arctic ecosystems and peoples more &lt;br/&gt;significantly than anywhere else on the globe. Rural Alaska Natives who subsist in these &lt;br/&gt;ecosystems naturally have close ties to the land and are deeply involved in science-based &lt;br/&gt;research and land management through tribal organizations, governmental, and research- &lt;br/&gt;oriented institutions. To date, rural Alaska Natives have had limited access to quality STEM &lt;br/&gt;education addressing their unique cultural and geographic needs and have, therefore, not been &lt;br/&gt;engaged in helping to find solutions to these complex ecological issues. We sorely need their &lt;br/&gt;input in this day of rapid change. The underlying philosophy behind the Interior-Aleutians (IAC) &lt;br/&gt;and Chukchi Campus (CC) Gaalee?ya project is that integrating culture and place into all &lt;br/&gt;aspects of their academic STEM experience will support the engagement, capacity, and &lt;br/&gt;continuity (Jolly et al. 2004) of rural Alaska Native STEM students. &lt;br/&gt;The Gaalee?ya STEM project will build a rigorous and culturally relevant STEM program &lt;br/&gt;through the Associate?s level for students in the IAC and CC regions. Gaalee?ya STEM will &lt;br/&gt;incorporate cultural values and perspectives and local interests in ecosystem changes with &lt;br/&gt;scientific coursework, research, and analysis from a Western academic perspective while &lt;br/&gt;allowing students to take courses by distance so that they may remain in their home &lt;br/&gt;communities. Mathematics and science courses, which are delivered primarily via audio- &lt;br/&gt;conference to rural students, will be enhanced through this project with culturally responsive &lt;br/&gt;pedagogies, face-to-face learning intensives, academic tutoring, and increased contact with &lt;br/&gt;STEM faculty. Students will also gain research experience through projects designed around &lt;br/&gt;the theme of ?ecology of place? to engage, educate, and retain rural Alaska Native students in &lt;br/&gt;STEM degrees. Elders and STEM faculty will work together to support the students using an &lt;br/&gt;integrative approach. Program objectives are built around gains in student participation, &lt;br/&gt;persistence, grade point averages and graduations of rural Alaska Native students with a &lt;br/&gt;replicable model for reaching underserved populations as a primary goal of evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
