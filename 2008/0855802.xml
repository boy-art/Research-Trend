    <AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Water and Environmental Technology (WET) Center &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0855881 Temple University; Rominder Suri &lt;br/&gt;0855786 University of Arizona; Ian Pepper &lt;br/&gt;0855802 Arizona State University; Morteza Abbaszadegan &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Water and Environmental Technology (WET)" with a focus on water quality and emerging contaminants. The lead of the proposed Center will be Temple University (TU) with site locations at the University of Arizona (UA) and Arizona State University (ASU). The objective of the proposed Center is to advance the knowledge and understand the effects of emerging contaminants on water quality. Emerging contaminants generally refer to pharmaceuticals, personal care products, as well as pathogens detected in the source water environment; thereby posing a potential or real threat to human health or the environment. The proposed research aims at developing technologies to detect, understand, mitigate and/or control emerging contaminants in the environment as well as other traditional contaminants that can adversely impact water quality. Center engineers and environmental scientists using microbial, chemical, hydrologic and mathematical approaches will work collaboratively to conduct this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center and its research activities will involve faculty, undergraduate and graduate students and industrial representatives; and the industrial-focused research program will enhance the scientific understanding and help address a potentially significant health and environmental problem. Many of the companies of the proposed Center have overseas installations; thus, students will be exposed to regulatory, social and cultural aspects of different countries, enhancing their global experiences. All three institutions plan to engage K-12 students and teachers, and will enhance the ongoing efforts of integrating research in classroom teaching. WET has a strong diversity plan that ensures the participation of underrepresented groups in all levels of the Center. The Center plans to publish results in various publications as well as present at Conferences.</AbstractNarration>
