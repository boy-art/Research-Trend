    <AbstractNarration>Research and development of organic semiconductors for electronic applications have shown intense growth in the last few years. Versatile attributes, such as solution processability and low cost, render these materials particularly attractive for applications such as electronic displays on flexible substrates, organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and large-area photovoltaics. However, carrier mobilities in organic semiconductors are much lower than their inorganic homologues. Evidence now indicates that carrier mobility in these systems depends on molecular structure and organization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Our objective is to achieve better understanding of structural ordering effects on carrier mobility in polymer-based electronic devices. We propose to focus on optimizing the performance of OFETs based on polymers using novel synthesis and processing techniques that will achieve both amorphous and highly crystalline polymer morphologies. Our approach will include correlations of materials structural changes and device architecture with device performance. While the device applications will be focused on OFETs, the conclusions will pertain to a wide range of conducting polymer technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: It is the aim in this project to train two graduate students and three undergraduate researchers in the area of structure-property-performance relationships needed for breakthrough technologies in electronic polymer-based devices. The students will have opportunities to interact with Plextronics, a local company and a technology leader in commercialization of organic light-emitting diodes and photovoltaics. The investigators will also collaborate with teachers in the Pittsburgh Public Schools (~60% minority students) on projects to experiment with conducting polymers.</AbstractNarration>
