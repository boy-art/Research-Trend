    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates program at the Santa Fe Institute. The aim of the program is to enrich the education and research career preparation of six undergraduate students through participation in a trans-disciplinary approach to science. At the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), this approach is used to gain a transformative and integrative understanding of complex adaptive systems in the biological, social, and physical sciences. Students are immersed in a trans-disciplinary and multigenerational scientific environment; in this context they team up with one or more mentors at SFI to work on meaningful complexity science research problems to which they can make a significant contribution. Activities include: participation in the Complex Systems Summer School; development of individual research projects; participation in on-going SFI workshops, working groups, symposia and colloquia;participation in the Summer Internship/Mentorship Program, acquiring teaching and mentoring skills; and presentation of research results in peer-review settings.</AbstractNarration>
