    <AbstractNarration>In 2004, the Oklahoma Center for Information Assurance and Forensics Education, which was subsequently renamed the Cyber Security Education Consortium (CSEC), was established as an ATE regional center for cybersecurity education (NSF Award No. 0355246) serving the state of Oklahoma and sections of surrounding states. Following four successful years of operation, the current grant renews the center for a second phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With broad support from business and industry, government agencies, law enforcement, the military, and the intelligence community, CSEC is creating a high-tech workforce in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas. The goal is to bring jobs to this eight-state region, where the quality of life is good and costs are low, and to reverse the tide of outsourcing and offshoring that has sent so many specialized high-tech jobs and facilities overseas. The center is implementing high-quality cybersecurity education programs in 19 metropolitan areas (31 educational institutions), which comprise eight of the 50 largest cities in the country (Dallas, St. Louis, Denver, San Antonio, Kansas City, Nashville, Memphis, and Oklahoma City) and 11 other mid-sized cities (Tulsa, Knoxville, Little Rock, Colorado Springs, Wichita, Shreveport, Chattanooga, Fayetteville [AR], Springfield [MO], Fort Smith [AR], and Topeka).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSEC is a cohesive partnership of technology centers, community colleges, and the University of Tulsa, one of the premier NSA Centers of Excellence for Information Assurance Education, which serves as a mentor to the other institutions. The center offers courses, certificate programs, and degree programs for college students and professional development for faculty members. In addition, the center provides education and training opportunities to transitional adults and high school students. Articulation agreements provide students with seamless educational pathways, allowing them to move from associate degree programs to bachelor's degree programs to master's and doctoral programs. The center's faculty development initiative incorporates an effective "train the trainer" model, which trained 105 instructors during the center's first four years. Faculty have access to a year-long residency program at the University of Tulsa, in which they receive intensive training and may pursue MS or PhD studies; a 25-day certificate program, which prepares instructors to teach courses in each of five core cybersecurity areas; multi-day workshops offered at locations around the country; and quarterly curriculum working group meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSEC institutions implement a comprehensive, nationally recognized cybersecurity curriculum covering five core areas: information assurance, secure electronic commerce, network security, enterprise security management, and digital forensics. The curriculum blends theory and practice, legal and ethical issues, and an intense laboratory component. It is incorporated in degree and certificate programs and maps to industry (Cisco, Microsoft), vendor-neutral (Security+, SCNP/SCNA), and federal (CNSS 4011-16) certifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major focus in the center's second phase is the creation of curricula in the strategic areas of secure coding, automation and control systems, and mobile communications devices--areas in which a significant demand for experts has emerged. Each of these three specialized curricula involves a foundational course, one or more advanced courses, and a capstone course, which culminates in students (including incumbent workers) receiving a certification in the technical area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An organizational focus of the center's second phase is the creation of "centers of excellence" in every major city in the eight-state region. These centers focus on a curricular area (such as secure coding, automation and control systems, or mobile communications devices) driven by local industry needs, and serve as hubs for education, training, and outreach activities in their focus area, catalyzing job creation and economic development.</AbstractNarration>
