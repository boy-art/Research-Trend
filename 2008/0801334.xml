    <AbstractNarration>Proposal No. 0801334&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fabrication of the NEM and NEMFET Logic Gates&lt;br/&gt;via Top-Down and Bottom-up Processes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H.-S. Philip Wong&lt;br/&gt;hspwong@stanford.edu&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;250 Word Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to demonstrate for the first-time ultra-low power logic gates based on nanoelectromechanical (NEM) switches and NEM field-effect transistors. The proposed devices will solve the ever aggravating leakage and static power consumption problem of the CMOS technologies. The approach is to pursue simultaneously the lithography-based top-down processes and the nanowire/carbon nanotube-based bottom-up techniques. The proposed research aligns well with the EPDT program which aims at improving the fundamental understanding of devices and components based on the principles of electronics and electromechanics. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit resides in the experimental realization of extremely low power ULSI logic systems combining two traditionally distinct domains (MEMS and CMOS logic). Micron-sized MEMS devices will be extended into the nanoscale regime. The ultra-low power operation of the proposed devices follows from the fact that the signal propagation is based not only on the movement of charge but also on the displacement of a solid rod. This distinguishes the NEM relays and the NEMS-based transistors from the conventional MOSFETs. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts will advance diversity in the nanoelectronics workforce and provide intellectual technology transfer, integration of research and education, public education, minority student outreach, and promotion of partnerships. Specifically, collaboration with the producers of the award-winning Silicon Run Film Series will result in new educational films on MEMS and nanoelectronics. They will serve as a resource to educators teaching in these new fields and assist with the professional development of instructors in supporting disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
