    <AbstractNarration>Objective: &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to demonstrate an efficient single photon wavelength converter based on a classical linear effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Quantum-optical communication systems have the promise to revolutionize how&lt;br/&gt;data is transmitted and processed. In the future it will be desirable to process qubits in various information channels. In such a system the ability to transfer single photons between information channels using optical wavelength conversion is desirable. However, wavelength conversion has traditionally required a non-linear effect, which inherently means a very large number of photons at another frequency must be present in order to assist the conversion of the single photons. In contrast, the goal of this project is to demonstrate a single photon wavelength converter on a silicon chip based on a recently demonstrated low-power linear adiabatic wavelength conversion process. Theoretically this process has a 100% conversion efficiency, therefore, every single photon will change its energy. The process will be achieved by low-power optical or electrical tuning of an on-chip silicon resonant cavity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will have broad impacts in the fields of quantum optics and quantum information systems. The device will lead to complex quantum integrated circuits for studying quantum computation and light-matter interactions. Furthermore, the project will have significant educational impact by involving undergraduate students in the required senior design course sequence. Current research results will also be integrated into a graduate level course in Microsystems Engineering. Lastly, the developed fabrication processes and experimental techniques will be made available to other researchers at RIT and small companies.</AbstractNarration>
