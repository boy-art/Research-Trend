    <AbstractNarration>Fishes comprise approximately 24,000 existing species and are among the most diverse and successful groups of vertebrates. These organisms represent an extensive array of biological characteristics and maintain considerable genetic diversity. It appears that much of the complexity of these organisms is a result of successive rounds of genetic duplications resulting in multiple copies of many important genes. The presence of multiple gene copies is believed to have had a large impact on the evolution of fish and their diversity. The retention of multiple genes in fish provides the opportunity to gain insights into how genes evolve through specific processes. This research will examine whether multiple vitamin D receptor genes (VDRs) present in most fish species have evolved new functions and/or partitioned ancestral functions subsequent to duplication. Through three specific aims, critical vitamin D receptor structure-function dynamics, spatial-temporal patterns of VDR gene expression, and role of vitamin D receptor during embryo development will be investigated. The proposed approach provides a systematic and comprehensive investigation that enables a detailed evaluation of functional change of the vitamin D receptor across a number of evolutionary diverse fish species. Results of this work will support a scientific understanding of the evolution of fish endocrinology by enhancing the conceptual framework of how retention, loss or diversification of gene duplicates contributes to endocrine innovation in these species. Training of undergraduate and graduate students as part of this research plan will provide a unique opportunity to educate and engage young scientists. In addition to yearly training, students will participate in the summer research program at the Mount Desert Island Biological laboratory (MDBL) in Maine. The MDIBL facility has a long-standing dedication to undergraduate education with an emphasis on the exploration of timely questions involving marine and freshwater biology in a diverse array of aquatic fauna.</AbstractNarration>
