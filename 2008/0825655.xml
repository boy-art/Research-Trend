    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop methods for improving the diagnosis and prognosis of complex engineered systems. Real world systems are inherently subject to faults, and information on abnormal behavior of components and processes can be obtained through measured signals. The aim of this research is to exploit the information provided by sensor signals together with deep knowledge of the physical behavior of a complex system to create a unified framework for the systematic design of diagnostic and prognostic algorithms and for the prediction of system aging. Today, there are few, if any, general results concerning system prognosis and aging; the research, if successful, will result in methods that are general enough to be applied to engineered systems in different domains, for example automotive, aerospace, chemical processes and manufacturing. Deliverables for this project include software for the design and analysis of diagnostic algorithms, experimental data, mathematical models, and educational materials for engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GOALI project is conducted in close collaboration with a major automotive manufacturer, General Motors, and aims to apply the new methodology to the diagnosis of automotive electrical systems and to the prognosis and life prediction of automotive batteries. If successful, the research will result in significantly greater reliability of future automotive electrical and energy storage systems. This may eventually result in reduced warranty costs and increased customer satisfaction, with the potential of touching millions of automobile owners around the world. The research may also have a positive impact on accelerating the introduction of advanced electrical and energy storage systems in future electric and hybrid automobiles by increasing their reliability and serviceability. Further, the educational outcomes of the project will affect undergraduate and graduate engineering students at two major universities as well as practicing engineers in the automotive industry through distance education programs.</AbstractNarration>
