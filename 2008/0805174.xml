    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The family of compounds that exhibit ferroelectric properties contains exciting materials that are enabling current and future generation wireless communications, information storage in consumer electronics, etc. This class of materials is inspiring exciting new strategies for catalysis, hybrid sensors, and as the basis of novel nanofabrication routes. Recent results have shown that the reactivity of these surfaces depends upon the orientation ferroelectric domains. Exploiting this and the future potential of ferroelectric materials requires that the atomic interactions at ferroelectric surfaces be understood. This project is using atomic-resolution probes to study molecular interactions at ferroelectric surfaces. In conjunction with this, a study of on gender equity in engineering is being undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This program uses advanced scanning probe microscopy in conjunction with surface scattering and spectroscopic tools to determine the origin of surface structures on non-metallic perovskite oxides, specifically ferroelectrics, and the effect of local polarization on surface behavior. The interplay of atomic polarization and surface structure/reactivity is becoming critical in electronic devices such as those enabling wireless communications as components become smaller. It has recently been shown that ferroelectric domains exhibit domain specific surface reactivity. This has led to new concepts for nanofabrication, catalysis, and electronic devices. In order to develop a fundamental understanding of domain specific behavior, the structures of BaTiO3 (100) surfaces will be determined and the effect of domain orientation on adsorption will be quantified. In addition to training students on advanced atomic imaging in the context of important technological materials, a study on gender equity in engineering is being carried out.</AbstractNarration>
