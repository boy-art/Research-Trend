    <AbstractNarration>In response to the critical need for K-12 teachers of mathematics and science in Southwest Texas, the University of Texas of the Permian Basin (UTPB) is recruiting and preparing at least 40 highly qualified STEM majors and STEM professionals over a four-year period to become effective teachers in high-need school districts. UTPB serves a geographically remote area with a large Hispanic population, and females and Hispanics comprise more than 60% of the university's enrollment. By reducing the financial barriers and fostering a supportive infrastructure, the project is facilitating the success and retention of teachers of science and mathematics, especially those who are historically underrepresented in STEM fields. Students admitted to the program have enhanced academic support and mentoring from STEM faculty and experienced K-12 STEM teachers and participate in a high quality, nationally recognized preparation program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UTPB Noyce Scholars are recruited from among currently enrolled STEM majors, qualified students at local community colleges, and STEM professionals who may not have considered a career in teaching. Scholars participate in high quality, research-based teacher preparation activities and are mentored by a faculty member and by an experienced K-12 teacher in their content area. Scholars attend annual state professional conferences and participate in a virtual (online) community and monthly seminars. The pre-service teachers are placed in math and science classrooms with exemplary teachers to observe model teaching methods and strategies during the academic year and work in a Science and Math Institute for high school students as a strand of the summer bridge program. During their first year of teaching, program graduates continue to be mentored by a UTPB faculty member in the content area and an experienced teacher. During and after the first year of teaching, they continue to connect with their peers through the online networking system and monthly seminars hosted by the science and mathematics education faculty at UTPB. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the proposed mentoring activities in which scholars will participate, the project has the potential to have transformational results for UTPB and area schools. In addition, the project provides a support system, including a virtual community, which helps retain teachers in remote districts. The project is examining factors that motivate STEM majors and professionals to pursue teaching careers, barriers that interfere with the pursuit of a teaching career, and factors that facilitate the success and retention of new mathematics and science teachers.</AbstractNarration>
