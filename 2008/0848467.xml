    <AbstractNarration>This project will continue work on the development of methods for the formation of C-C bonds using organozinc reagents, as the formation of C-C bonds is of fundamental importance in organic synthesis. New and efficient methods will be studied for the direct conversion of aldehydes into enals, which are among the most important starting materials for organocatalytic reactions. Methods for the stereospecific synthesis of enantioenriched enamines will also be explored. Finally, new classes of enantioenriched cyclopropanes will be prepared through novel halocyclopropanations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Patrick J. Walsh of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Walsh's research efforts involve the development of novel and practical methods for the formation of C-C bonds. Such chemistry will allow multiple reactions to be performed without isolation or purification of intermediates, thus reducing the environmental impact of chemical synthesis. Successful development of these methods will positively impact organic synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.</AbstractNarration>
