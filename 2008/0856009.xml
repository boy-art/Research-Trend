    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Division of Materials Research to University of Houston is to study the role of microscopic heterogeneities in the corrosion of metal alloy surfaces. This Materials World Network award is cofounded and managed by the Metals and Metallic Nanostructures program. This proposed research involves the use nonlinear optical spectroscopy and scanning probe techniques to study the atmospheric corrosion of a model metal alloy surface based on Cu:Zn alloy. Main objectives of the project are: 1) Study the local atmospheric corrosion of Cu:Zn alloys; and 2) Compare the reactions on protected alloys surfaces with the initiation of corrosion reactions. To probe local regions of the alloy surface, Sum Frequency Generation Imaging Microscopy will be used as a local probe on the surface species formed under reaction conditions. This technique has the ability to identify sub-monolayer of surface adsorbates based on their vibrational spectra. In addition, Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy will be used to identify cathodic and anodic regions of the surfaces where the corrosion process occurs. These techniques will be applied to bare and protected surfaces to study the effect of inhibition on local corrosion. These studies will be carried out in collaboration with scientists at Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. The results from these studies are expected to provide chemical maps of corrosion activity related to molecular speciation in those locations, and thus a molecular-level description of local corrosion events. Students on this project will be developing experimental and scientific skills through designing of the research project, and writing and presenting results at national meetings. International exchange, travel, research experience by students and faculty in the collaborating institutions are salient features of this collaborative multidisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multidisciplinary research program is expected to positively impact both undergraduate and graduate student members of the research team In addition, students will be exposed to in the use and application of a number of analytical methods including advanced spectroscopic methods to study the atmospheric corrosion at the surface. They also will be trained in material surface characterization with an emphasis on the chemistry of corrosion at a microscopic level. Finally, this project will greatly enhance our younger scientist skills and development using modern laser techniques. The knowledge gained will provide a detailed model on the local chemistry of corrosion that has been very difficult to characterize until now. The planned International collaboration with Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden will provide opportunities for students and faculty to do research in the collaborating laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
