    <AbstractNarration>Unlike current telecommunications based on electrical or optical signals, the biological communications technology uses chemical signals as carriers of information. This technology exhibits various distinct features such as biocompatibility and energy-efficiency, potentially enabling new Bio-ICT (Information and Communications Technology) applications that are not likely achieved by current silicon-based technology. For example, molecular communication can be applied to biocompatible information systems in which implanted biological devices chemically interact with tissues and organs in the human body. It is also applicable to unconventional information systems in which biological cells chemically coordinate to grow into a three dimensional structure that functions as information processing and storage systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the investigator is exploring biological cells and cell-to-cell communication mechanisms. The specific objectives in this project are fourfold; (1) design and engineering of system components - designing, engineering and characterizing necessary building blocks of molecular communication systems (e.g., repeaters and switches), (2) system integration - developing a microplatform that can integrate independent components into a working system, (3) application designs - demonstrating novel applications using an integrated molecular communication system, and (4) establishment of information theory - addressing the theoretical basis such as channel capacity and coding mechanisms of molecular communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to provide new insights and findings into science and engineering. It examines how information is communicated, processed and stored in biological systems from a communication and engineering view point, which may help enhance current engineering principles as well as advance bio-inspired information technology. It is also expected to address a number of unanswered questions on design principles of biological systems.</AbstractNarration>
