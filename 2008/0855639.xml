    <AbstractNarration>The primary objective of this project is to explore the physics of heteronuclear models: coupled atom-molecule systems where heteronuclear or polar molecules are formed from atoms of distinct species via interspecies Feshbach resonance or photoassociation. The technique of the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage will be generalized to multi-level atom-molecule systems for the purpose of an efficient generation of polar molecules. The same technique is also applied to create a large angle atom-molecule beam splitter, which serves as the building block for an atom-molecule interferometer, capable of measuring changes that are phase sensitive not only to atomic but also to molecular beams. Electromagnetically induced transparency is studied as an tool for detecting exotic phases in two-states fermionic models, taking advantage of the exceptionally high spatial and frequency resolving powers of modern lasers. Phase separation in which different phases repel each other into separate spatial regions is studied with a new attitude, in which phase separation is considered as offering new opportunities for building quantum devices of practical importance. A separated quantum phase inside an optical cavity is studied not only as a fundamental nonlinear system for the exploration of cavity quantum electrodynamics but also as a tool for precision measurement of quantum phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to provide more competitive research programs to students at Rowan, a predominantly undergraduate public institution. Students are provided with chances to collaborate with the PI's former students (currently at other graduate institutions), and visiting Ph. D students or scholars from collaborating institutions, all of which represent opportunities that are traditionally only accessible to students at large research universities. The goal is to equip Rowan students with the research experience and the skills that will enable them to compete with those from nationally-recognized universities in future graduate studies or other scientific careers. This project also aims to motivate the PI to further his effort in integrating research into teaching while advancing discovery and understanding through his active research program. The goal is to provide undergraduate students with a more direct path to advanced research topics in atomic physics and quantum optics, while at the same time to lay groundwork that enables the students to expand comfortably into any advanced areas of study in the future.</AbstractNarration>
