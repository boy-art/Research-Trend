    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Research suggests that chronic activation of the stress response system may have deleterious effects on many of the neurological structures that are believed to mediate decision-making processes. As a result, in addition to the adverse consequences chronic stress can pose for physical and mental health (e.g., cardiovascular disease, depression) it may pose a significant threat to decision-making capabilities. These effects may be especially detrimental at the extreme ends of the developmental spectrum. For instance, in older adults, chronic stress may further tax systems that may already be declining as a function of normal cognitive aging. At the other end of the spectrum, the effects of early life stress may result in maturational delays in the development of adaptive decision-making for young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research examines the association between chronic stress and decision-making. It combines research on the neural structures that support decision-making with new techniques for studying risky decision-making. It also examines the developmental trajectory of adaptive decision-making (i.e., the ability to make choices that are more likely to result in a gain/reward, and avoid ones which pose greater danger for loss/punishment). The research will also identify individual difference variables that may influence adaptive decision-making across the lifespan. Three studies will be conducted. Study 1 investigates how age-differences in older adults may influence risky choice behavior for decisions involving potential gains and ones involving potential losses, and how chronic stress may further compromise decision-making abilities. Study 2 examines the effects of chronic stress on decisions posing extreme uncertainty. Study 3 examines adaptive decision-making abilities of children currently in foster care, who were exposed to significant early life stress. Together, these studies will provide insights regarding the effects of chronic stress on human decision processes, both with respect to cognitive aging and neuropsychological development. This increased understanding may assist in identifying specific vulnerability factors associated with age-related changes in decision-making abilities and provide important insights that may help researchers develop interventions to promote better decision-making in older adults and children.</AbstractNarration>
