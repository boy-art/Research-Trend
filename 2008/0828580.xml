    <AbstractNarration>Housing development within forests has reduced and modified bird habitat through loss and alteration of the vegetation structure. Because measuring vegetation structure is difficult and time consuming even at small scales (several hectares), little is known about how houses alter forest structure at larger scales, and in-turn how this affects birds. The goal of this study is to understand the effects of houses on bird populations and communities in forests by coupling information on housing density and forest structure. High resolution, three-dimensional estimates of forest structure will be calculated for North Carolina using laser altimetry (LiDAR), and analyzed with housing density data from the U.S. Census to provide estimates of habitat quality. Bird measures will be derived from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and modeled against habitat quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will be the first ever to integrate housing data and three-dimensional forest structure information over multiple landscapes for the purpose of understanding their relative effects on birds in order to benefit conservation and management. The research will also result in creation of the largest three-dimensional forest map ever produced at a fine resolution (10 meter) and this will be shared with agencies and other organizations. The work is inherently interdisciplinary in nature and bridges fields of ecology, sociology, and geography. There are also education opportunities that will benefit undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, such as Native Hawaiians.</AbstractNarration>
