    <AbstractNarration>Enterprise data centers consume an alarmingly-high fraction of the energy produced in the United States. The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that data center energy consumption will reach over 100 billion kWh by 2011, 2.5% of US power generation, resulting in an estimated annual electricity cost of $7.4 billion. As much as 40% of this energy is wasted because of two key inefficiencies: (1) the substantial energy used by idle equipment that is powered on, but not performing useful work, and (2) inefficiency in data-center cooling infrastructure arising from a poor match between where heat is generated and where cool air is supplied. This project proposes research on a data-center-wide management system that controls IT equipment, power, and cooling infrastructure in real time to save energy in two ways. First, it actively consolidates computing tasks onto fewer systems, allowing idle systems to be powered down. Second, it moves computing tasks to systems that can be cooled most efficiently. The project addresses the key challenge of modeling temperature in large-scale data centers and designing an autonomous system that makes correct decisions on where to place tasks.</AbstractNarration>
