    <AbstractNarration>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is developing and implementing a project to identify and disseminate information about effective practices and strategies for attracting, selecting, and preparing new K-12 STEM teachers and retaining them in the STEM teacher workforce. Project components include: 1) Co-sponsoring and implementing the 2009 and 2010 NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program annual conferences for faculty, administrators, student scholars, and STEM teachers who were supported by the program; 2) Producing a journalist style general publication that highlights the accomplishments of the NSF Noyce Program, including highlighting awardees; 3) Developing and maintaining an NSF Noyce Program Web site that includes conference information; project descriptions and accomplishments, including an online project locator; and evaluation and research reports from awardees; and 4) Conducting three outreach workshops to disseminate information about programs, practices and strategies and to increase proposal submissions for the NSF Noyce Program. The project includes an external program planning committee of leaders in recruiting, preparing, and retaining K-12 STEM teachers. Project products include conference program guides with abstracts and a general publication summarizing the accomplishments of the NSF Noyce Program. The Web site includes a project locator with descriptions and accomplishments of the projects. Outreach workshops disseminate information about programs, practices, and strategies and the NSF Noyce Program solicitation.</AbstractNarration>
