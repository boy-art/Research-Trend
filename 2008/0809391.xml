    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor W. Carl Lineberger of the University of Colorado, together with his postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student researchers, will study the time-resolved photoelectron spectra of a number of anions/radicals in solvent cages, as well as anions whose photoionization result in radicals with multiple radical centers. Some of the interesting molecular anions to be studied include HOOO- and 1,3,5 dehydrobenzene anion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular molecular systems chosen for study are of broad interest to the scientific community. The research of the Lineberger group will have impact in the fields as diverse as polymer science and atmospheric chemistry. A number of the molecular targets will provide useful data with which to challenge computational chemists. In addition to training advanced research students, Prof. Lineberger will continue in his leadership of the Science Education Initiative on his campus. This program brings undergraduate students in selected courses into research laboratories for short periods of time during the academic year.</AbstractNarration>
