    <AbstractNarration>The need for technicians with traditional skill sets as well as with experience in programming, networking, and systems integration knowledge is well-documented and technicians who can manage controls present an emerging and rapidly expanding market of high-wage employment for community college graduates. The lack of technicians qualified in building automation systems constitutes one of the greatest barriers to rapidly implementing energy efficiency, greenhouse gas reduction, and sustainability targets in commercial buildings. This project builds on previous efforts aimed at upgrading technician education to meet today's challenges for energy efficiency in buildings. Courses are being developed in the area of building automation and sustainability and a new associate's degree program will be offered in building automation, filling a critical gap in degree offerings. The project involves extensive collaboration with national ATE centers, with industry, and with four-year institutions. A Physics for Building Science and Sustainability high school summer program is being expanded and a teacher training component is being added through this project. Results from the project are being rigorously evaluated and disseminated on a national scale.</AbstractNarration>
