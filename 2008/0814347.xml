    <AbstractNarration>Engineering Other -(59)&lt;br/&gt;Microfluidics is a branch of physics and biotechnology that studies the behavior of fluids at the microscale and the design of Micro-Electronic Mechanical Systems (MEMS) that takes advantage of such behavior. Fluids on these small scales behave differently than do fluids at the macro-level because factors such as surface tension, energy dissipation, inertia, and electrokinetics begin to predominate. The objective of this project is to adapt and implement an undergraduate course on microfluidics at partnering institutions. The course consists of inquiry-based modules supplemented with lectures and reading materials employing educational uses of technology exploring the latest research in microfluidics. The courses will be offered in a variety of engineering programs including the electrical, mechanical, and biomedical disciplines. Students are collaborating on a group project that follows the full-cycle microfluidic system design approach. The course materials are being compiled to produce a textbook on microfluidic theory and practice that is suitable for undergraduate instruction. In addition to the textbook, the results from this project will be disseminated through several engineering education venues.</AbstractNarration>
