    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the theory group involved in this proposal is to understand how the world works at the smallest distances. The group seeks to understand the nature of the space we live in, of the matter and energy that move through it, of the vacuum that fills it, of its history since the beginning of the universe and its fate in the far future, and of the dimensions that might lurk outside it. Soon the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva will begin operating and looking for various new particles predicted by generalization of the standard model of particle physics. The group seeks to deepen our understanding of the new physics we may begin to see at the LHC. The questions that will be addressed in the group's research include the following:&lt;br/&gt;. Can we see "unparticles" at the LHC? Research by this group has suggested that the LHC could produce an exotic state of matter that cannot be described in terms of&lt;br/&gt;particles with definite mass hence "unparticles." This is provides a new example of a&lt;br/&gt;very unconventional phenomenon that might appear at the LHC.&lt;br/&gt;. Can we use topology to understand Black Holes? The group has recently &lt;br/&gt;shown that purely topological aspects of string theory can capture highly non-trivial&lt;br/&gt;quantum gravitational corrections to the black hole entropy. The implications of this to better understanding entropy and holography will be pursued in the future research program.&lt;br/&gt;. Can we find the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in String theory? The group will pursue new directions that may lead to a very natural embedding of the MSSM in string theory. The broader implications of this research is the hope of better understanding the fundamental nature of space and time at the shortest and largest distances. The group is active in broadening participation of underrepresented groups which include both women and African Americans in cutting-edge research</AbstractNarration>
