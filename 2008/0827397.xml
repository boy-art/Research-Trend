    <AbstractNarration>This project explores connections between computational logic and polyhedral combinatorics through the paradigm of Quantified Polyhedral programming. Quantified Polyhedral programming encompasses Quantified Linear Programming (QLP) and Quantified Integer Programming (QIP); both the programming paradigms are extremely useful in modeling environment-dependent actions in real-time scheduling problems. Quantified Integer Programs can also be used to formally verify the correctness of programs through the mechanism of Abstract Interpretation. This project aims to provide a framework in which traditional notions of duality and convexity can be extended to the 2-person game setting. For instance, a typical optimization problem is defined by an optimization function and a convex set, called the domain of feasibility. In real-world applications, such as robot navigation, the domain is not fixed but varies continuously as a consequence of events initiated by the environment. Thus, the concept of optimality needs to be defined in a 2-person setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a broader front, the investigator plans to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in Quantified Polyhedral Programming through a combination of innovative research and the integration of research themes into graduate and undergraduate education. This work will have the added benefit of increasing the participation of women and under-represented minorities in computer science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by West Virginia EPSCoR.</AbstractNarration>
