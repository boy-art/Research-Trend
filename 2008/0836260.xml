    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;Within undergraduate engineering education, programming is often a fundamental skill course included in the curriculum. Unfortunately, students often learn to program and then do not apply the skills they have acquired in follow-on courses. The lack of integration of programming in upper division courses means that students perceive that programming is of no value in engineering practice and that they are unable to apply this tool effectively to solve complex problems. Through this project, programming topics and techniques are being integrated vertically throughout the undergraduate industrial engineering curriculum. The curricular materials being developed are focused on case studies in the service and automotive industries. The integration is being designed so that students are able to identify situations where programming skills are required and to apply these skills appropriately in the solution of problems. The essential outcome is that students proactively consider programming solutions when faced with an engineering problem. The project is being rigorously evaluated through a variety of techniques.</AbstractNarration>
