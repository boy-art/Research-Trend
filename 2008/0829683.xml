    <AbstractNarration>The United States continues to face a crisis in the development of highly-skilled workers in science, engineering, and technology. Computing has deeply permeated every aspect of our society, and every field has been transformed by the recent arrival of affordable high-performance computing. Despite this pervasive growth of computation throughout engineering and science, university level computing education is still largely separated from other disciplines. It is crucial to develop a scientific and engineering workforce with a thorough understanding of the fundamental conceptual ideas from computer science and software engineering that pertain to a specific domain and the skills necessary to apply them to their field of expertise. The University of Texas at El Paso proposes a Conceptual and Development Planning (CDP) project that will support the institutional groundwork to develop synergistic multidisciplinary curricula combinations across the departments of Computer Science, Biological Sciences and Economics and Finance that will provide students with substantive content in domains not typically provided by traditional academic degrees. The overarching goal of this project is to support the conceptual design and planning for the creation of a computing-centric, interdisciplinary, and cross-fertilizing model that spans the institution?s academic structures. This proposal addresses these needs by developing a comprehensive approach to developing skills in relevant aspects of computation and algorithm design in students in a wide variety of scientific disciplines. The team will develop a new computational curriculum suitable for students whose careers will overlap. The principal focus is the development of multidisciplinary academic programs, built from collaborative work between the involved constituents, rather than the creation of new academic units. These multidisciplinary academic programs will convey sufficient depth to prepare students to make significant contributions in their respective fields. This project will permit the investigation of the assertion that collaborative work between computer science, and disciplines where the participation of women is more reflective of the population, e.g., biology and social sciences, can help reverse the trend of a small proportion of women graduating with a computing related degree or an engineering degree.</AbstractNarration>
