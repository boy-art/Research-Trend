    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Princeton Gravity Group's continued exploration of gravitational physics and cosmology through the experimental and observational study of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The speci&amp;#64257;c experimental work includes: (1) Observations and data analysis for the Atacama Cosmology Telscope (ACT). ACT is fully functional and taking data. (2) The &amp;#64257;elding and analysis of the Atacama B-mode Survey (ABS) experiment to measure the signature of gravitational waves from the early universe through their imprint on the polarization of the CMB. (3) The completion of the QUIET project, also targeting the CMB polarization, but at lower frequencies, which is just entering its observation and analysis phase. These experiments are complementary to both the existing WMAP satellite and the upcoming PLANCK satellite as well as to other ongoing work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurements of the CMB are at the foundation of the standard cosmological model and probe gravitational physics at extreme length and temperature scales. The CMB is the cleanest probe of the physics of the nascent universe. In addition to unveiling fundamental physics during the first instants of the universe, the CMB provides information about the dark energy causing the present-day acceleration of the universe, is sensitive to the sum of the neutrino masses, can help locate the baryons that we know must exist but wich have not yet been found, and tells us how cosmic structure emerged in the early universe. This research program includes substantial educational development for students, continued public outreach, extensive international collaboration, and strong interagency collaboration (especially with NIST). The Princeton group will continue its vigorous program of hands-on research for undergraduates and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
