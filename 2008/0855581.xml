    <AbstractNarration>This award will support the participation of younger scientists (postdocs, graduate students and possibly undergraduates) at the 10th Conference on the Intersection of Particle and Nuclear Physics (CIPANP 2009). This triennial conference covers all areas of particle and nuclear physics, as well as particle and nuclear astrophysics and cosmology. CIPANP 2009 will be held at the Torrey Pines Hilton in San Diego CA on May 26-31, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Broader Impacts, the Conference will address the fields of particle and nuclear physics, as well as particle/nuclear astrophysics. The Proceedings of this conference will be published so that many others can take advantage of the talks. The conference is particularly interested in those topics that overlap more than one area, particularly topics of interest to physicists in all three areas.</AbstractNarration>
