    <AbstractNarration>A digital camera capable of 5400 frame-per-second time resolution will be equipped with diffraction gratings previously built by the investigator to document optical emissions from naturally occurring lightning flashes beneath thunderstorms. Spectral data will be obtained in the 380-850 nm range from the entire visible portion of lightning channels encompassing flash elements that may include return strokes, stepped and dart leaders, M-strokes, and episodes of "continuing current" (thought to be responsible for a disproportionate amount of lightning damage to structures and equipment) at spatial and temporal resolutions of 10's of meters and microseconds, respectively. These data will be analyzed to provide measures of channel temperature, electron density, and other thermodynamic information. Observing activities will be conducted during the climatological springtime thunderstorm maximum at a primary site located at the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma, and during the off-season at the principal investigator's home institution (Texas A&amp;M University) in southern Texas. Extensive supporting meteorological facilities and special measurements are available at the Oklahoma site, and include finely resolved (nanosecond-scale) optical imaging of lightning channels recorded by another NSF-supported investigator based at the University of Oklahoma. Both sites are encompassed by the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) as well as more specialized lightning mapping array (LMA) equipment. Together, these ancillary systems will provide contextual 4D information on lightning channel location, geometry and propagation (both visible and in-cloud), as well as the polarity, estimated peak current and flash multiplicity (i.e. number of return strokes) for lightning channels reaching the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research centers upon improved understanding of the spectroscopically-derived properties of natural lighting viewed at fine spatial and temporal resolution, which will lead to improved understanding of the physics of natural lightning. Additional insights are also possible concerning lightning's contribution to key atmospheric chemical processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work will include training of university graduate and undergraduate students, outreach to K-12 educational institutions, and increased collaboration between multiple university and government facilities involved in lighting research.</AbstractNarration>
