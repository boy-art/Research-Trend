    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). It will provide continued support to perform operations and to analyze data from the VERITAS Observatory. It will also support the group's role in the ongoing maintenance and upgrades of the VERITAS telescopes located at the F.L. Whipple Observatory in Amado, AZ. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Observatory uses an array of four 12-meter diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) to record faint flashes of Cherenkov light generated by Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-rays interacting with the Earth's atmosphere. These gamma-rays provide a direct probe of relativistic, non-thermal process in jets associated with Active Galactic Nuclei. The group will use VERITAS observations to probe astrophysical phenomena such as starburst galaxies, low surface brightness companions to the Milky Way/Andromeda, and diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, a tracer of cosmic ray origin in our Galaxy. They will also pursue multi-wavelength observations and analysis of VERITAS data in conjunction with other surveys. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the program will include Education and Public Outreach programs. The group has been the driving force behind the creation of the state of Utah's first graduate Astronomy degree program and has created a regional/national consortium to develop and operate a new high altitude optical/IR observatory in Southern Utah.</AbstractNarration>
