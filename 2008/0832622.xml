    <AbstractNarration>Prof. Kevin Belfield at the University of Central Florida, and collaborators Florencio Hernandez and Artem Masunov at UCF and Tatiana Timofeeva at New Mexico Highlands University are supported by the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program to develop a predictive capability for the design of stable supramolecular aggregates that will exhibit specific two- and three-photon absorption properties. The work entails a multidisciplinary approach involving materials synthesis, characterization (NMR, linear and non-linear absorption, fluorescence, excitation anisotropy, and X-ray crystallography), and theory. Use of these aggregates represents one of the most promising avenues for developing practical multiphoton-based photonic materials and devices. With the knowledge and data gained in this research, an expanded multiphoton absorption-supramolecular structure-property database will be developed, leading to scaling relations, validation or modification of theory, and a predictive capability for materials design and behavior yet to be realized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach taken in this program involves highly collaborative laboratories in which undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers receive cross-disciplinary training, positioning them to make significant scientific and technical contributions in the photonic materials fields. The PI and co-PIs actively recruit and engage students that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, facilitating the preparation of a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Through this collaborative research program, a "Pathway to the Ph.D." will be developed for NMHU students to pursue their Ph.D. at UCF and elsewhere. Through participation of high school chemistry teachers in the proposed research, along with partnerships with Space Florida and NHMU/Gear Up, a network of teachers will be created to help disseminate the project's findings and incorporate appropriate content into the curriculum, extending the impact to younger students.</AbstractNarration>
