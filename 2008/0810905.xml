    <AbstractNarration>In the wake of new sequencing and genotyping technologies, &lt;br/&gt;whole genome studies are now being undertaken to understand &lt;br/&gt;the genetic basis of phenotypes. Many of the principles underlying &lt;br/&gt;the measurement of genotype-phenotype relationships, &lt;br/&gt;as well as computing related population genetic parameters, &lt;br/&gt;are relatively well understood. However, the upcoming technologies &lt;br/&gt;dramatically change the scale and scope of these studies, &lt;br/&gt;which already encompass tens of thousands of individuals &lt;br/&gt;over a genome-wide region. The analysis of this data requires novel &lt;br/&gt;algorithmic and statistical techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses&lt;br/&gt;on a subset of the problems that could arise in a typical &lt;br/&gt;whole-genome based association study. These include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(a) Phasing of genotypes into haplotypes using overlapping sequence data, &lt;br/&gt;and the application of this algorithm to phasing individual human sequences; &lt;br/&gt;the availability of high coverage long sequence data will make this approach &lt;br/&gt;the method of choice for phasing in the near future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(b) Fast filtering for pairs of loci that interactively influence a &lt;br/&gt;phenotype and its application to multiple-locus testing of common &lt;br/&gt;disease phenotypes. The proposed work reduces the computational &lt;br/&gt;bottleneck in multiple locus testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(c) Detection of regions under balancing selection. Available tests &lt;br/&gt;are focused on detection of regions under positive selection. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research looks for evidence of balancing selection in &lt;br/&gt;the genome, with specific attention on genes associated with bipolar disorder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(d) Reconstruction of regulatory pathways using associations between genetic &lt;br/&gt;variation and gene-expression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All software from this research is freely available as source-code, &lt;br/&gt;or as web-tools for academic, research and non-commercial purposes &lt;br/&gt;in accordance with University policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on the project may be found at the project web site: &lt;br/&gt;http://bix.ucsd.edu/algen</AbstractNarration>
