    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Aaron Massari of the University of Minnesota will employ two-dimensional infrared vibrational echo spectroscopy (2D-IR VES) to understand how the molecular motions within conducting polymers influence the mobilities of electrical charges. This research project will utilize polymer samples incorporated into electrode arrays, which will allow for the in-situ study of molecular motions and charge mobilities in polymer structures in the presence of an external electric field. These studies will provide molecule design and polymer processing information that will be immediately relevant to future photovoltaic or molecular electronic technologies that are based on organic molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will help to advance not only the aforementioned technologies, but our understanding of structure-function relationships in electronic materials in general. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project will receive training in a highly multidisciplinary environment which includes not only laser optics and fundamental molecular spectroscopy, but materials science, electrochemistry, and theory. Prof. Massari will work with on-going programs at the University of Minnesota such as the Multicultural Summer Research Opportunities Program (MSROP) and the Lando Fellowship Program to recruit undergraduate students from area community colleges to participate in chemical research.</AbstractNarration>
