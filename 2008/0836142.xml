    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the sources of observed perturbations to the F region ionosphere due to upward propagating gravity waves at two incoherent scatter radar sites, Poker Flat and Arecibo. A by-product of the research will be the extraction of time-varying F region neutral winds. The research activities include making gravity wave observations using a new technique at the two radars, modeling of secondary gravity wave excitation as well as the propagation and dissipation of these gravity waves, and reverse ray tracing studies. The F region of the atmosphere frequently exhibits medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances that are thought to be gravity waves propagating upwards from the lower atmosphere, but their sources are generally unknown. Of particular interest is determining the role of secondary gravity waves in producing the ionospheric disturbances. Two types of secondary wave generation will be investigated in this project: those excited by mountain wave breaking in the wintertime thermosphere at high latitudes and those excited by the breaking of gravity waves in the mesosphere. One of the tools used to address the identification of gravity wave sources is reverse ray tracing. The essential information needed for the ray tracing approach is: 1) an accurate gravity dispersion relation, and 2) knowledge of the gravity wave's horizontal and vertical wavelengths and its period. Recently, an accurate viscous gravity wave dispersion relation which accounts for realistic thermospheric dissipation was derived and incorporated into a 3D ray trace model under a previous grant. Meanwhile, information on gravity wave wavelengths and period have recently become available from new multi-beam experiments at the Poker Flat and Arecibo radars. As part of this project, observations of electron density perturbations associated with the passage of gravity waves will be made at the two radars. These measurements will be the basis for the modeling studies, which emphasize gravity wave (GW) coupling between the lower atmosphere and the thermosphere. The specific tasks and objectives include: determining wavelengths and periods from the density and velocity perturbation profiles for selected gravity waves at Poker Flat and Arecibo; extracting the temporal evolution of the neutral winds and accelerations in the F region from these profiles using the viscous gravity wave dispersion relation; calculating the secondary gravity wave spectra excited from breaking mountain waves, and characterizing the scales and amplitudes of the GWs in the F-region via ray tracing; determining the lower-atmospheric sources of the gravity waves observed in the thermosphere for three case studies at Poker Flat and one or two case studies at Arecibo; testing the accuracy of the viscous GW dispersion relation by comparing the extracted neutral winds with the measured neutral winds along the magnetic field at Arecibo.</AbstractNarration>
