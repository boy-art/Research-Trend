    <AbstractNarration>The primary research objective of this project is to investigate the behavior and design of reinforced concrete (RC) wall structures under elevated temperatures due to fire. To achieve this objective, the research will: (1) experimentally investigate the out-of-plane axial-load-moment-curvature-temperature behavior of RC wall cross sections under elevated temperatures; (2) evaluate the effects of geometric, material, reinforcement, and loading parameters on these structures; and (3) develop a rational, predictive fire-resistant structural design procedure based on the test results. The project will result in experimental evidence demonstrating the fire performance of RC walls and validated design models using the test data. In addition, the experiments will investigate the application of a cost-effective test method using ceramic fiber radiant heaters to subject the specimens to elevated temperatures. The ultimate project deliverables will be the ability to evaluate the structural performance of a RC wall under fire and the ability to design a wall that can withstand uncontrolled fires until burnout. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of the project tasks will provide important data for fire-resistant design of reinforced concrete walls commonly used in building structures, with ancillary contributions to fire engineering and materials engineering/science fields. Wall structures designed using this information will facilitate emergency response activities by protecting elevator cores and stairwells, and contribute towards the resistance of buildings to prevent catastrophic overall collapse. The project will train a graduate student in fire resistant design of structures and encourage undergraduate students to study structural fire engineering, strongly focusing on underrepresented groups. The researchers will utilize the project to educate future engineers through K12 activities as well. The research results will be disseminated widely for utilization by practicing engineers, other researchers, and other end users.</AbstractNarration>
