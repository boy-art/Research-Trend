    <AbstractNarration>Glasner&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807423&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator considers fluid and solid interfaces that&lt;br/&gt;have multiscale behavior, spatiotemporal interaction and large&lt;br/&gt;scale organization. One component of this project focuses on the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of gravitational and surface tension induced free&lt;br/&gt;surface instabilities in viscous fluids, which give rise to&lt;br/&gt;coherent structures like fluid droplets, ridges and jets. &lt;br/&gt;Perturbative techniques and computational studies lead toward a&lt;br/&gt;description of large-scale condensation and geophysical&lt;br/&gt;processes. A second component of the project involves dynamical&lt;br/&gt;models of material microstructures. Patterning in systems with&lt;br/&gt;nonlocal interactions, such as block copolymer mixtures, is&lt;br/&gt;studied from the point of view of dynamical development,&lt;br/&gt;utilizing formal and numerical approximations, and homogenization&lt;br/&gt;techniques that yield statistical descriptions. The motion of&lt;br/&gt;grain boundaries in crystalline surface evolution and pattern&lt;br/&gt;formation equations also is investigated, seeking to characterize&lt;br/&gt;the singular structures that emerge both from energetic and&lt;br/&gt;geometric perspectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies how fluid and solid interfaces move&lt;br/&gt;and interact in complicated, large systems. Models and&lt;br/&gt;simulations are developed that are used to explain laboratory&lt;br/&gt;observations and that have capabilities to predict and control&lt;br/&gt;dynamics for design and manufacturing. Fluid flows that are&lt;br/&gt;studied have applications ranging from industrial coatings to&lt;br/&gt;geophysical morphology, such as cave formations. The solid&lt;br/&gt;systems of interest include block copolymers, "designer"&lt;br/&gt;materials that hold considerable promise for nano-engineering. &lt;br/&gt;The project also includes educational aims that expose&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates to modeling and computation and train graduate&lt;br/&gt;students for scientific careers.</AbstractNarration>
