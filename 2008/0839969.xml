    <AbstractNarration>Full center proposal to join the I/UCRC in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0839969 Arizona State University; Jesus Villalobos &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University (ASU) seeks to join as an additional site the I/UCRC in Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). ASU should complement CELDi research by focusing on two major areas of research: (i) supporting the development and implementation of efficient and effective International Logistics practices, and (ii) enabling further productivity improvements as well as state-of-art supply chain and logistics practices in the regional industry. Research housed by the ASU site will contribute to improvements in the cost, quality, and responsiveness of a regional industrial base that is increasingly global. This effort will focus on increasing the relative and absolute competitiveness of this industry, by providing access to leading-edge knowledge, tools, systems, and benchmarking opportunities. The initial activities at ASU will focus on efficient international logistics practices, as well as productivity and cost improvements in production and supply chain operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will be a catalyst for the regional economic development and also for increasing the number of students who decide to pursue advanced degrees in logistics and productivity related fields. Students will not only have direct access to research initiatives at ASU, but will also have the opportunity to interact with students and researchers from other institutions, listen to visiting speakers, and become involved in a variety of projects directly sponsored by CELDi. The center plans to include undergraduate, women and minority students in research teams. It is anticipated that every project will have at least one undergraduate student participating in it. ASU has a clear commitment to diversity.</AbstractNarration>
