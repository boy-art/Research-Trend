    <AbstractNarration>Advancing Computing Curricula and Expanding Learning Experiences through Reengineered and Accelerated Technology Education (ACCELERATE) is a Conceptual Development and Planning Project for the Institutional Transformation track that moves the undergraduate computing education at Fairmont State University (FSU) and Pierpont Community and Technical College (PC&amp;TC) toward transformative learning. ACCELERATE brings together the Information Systems, Information Technology, and Computer Science (IS/IT/CS), programs at FSU and PC&amp;TC to explore the infrastructure changes needed to realize the implementation of the institutional transformative vision. The ACCELERATE team includes faculty and administrative members from the IS/IT/CS departments who will work closely at the department and institution levels to lay the foundation for an integrated approach to computing curricula. During this planning period, the team will also formalize communication networks with the West Virginia High Technology Consortium Foundation, an organization representing over 200 local high technology companies in North Central West Virginia, to ensure the infrastructure is in place to achieve the long-term goal of directly aligning revised curricula with industry needs. The proposed ACCELERATE activities have dual curriculum reflections: across computing disciplines and across general education. While some efforts in computing fields have been made to transform higher education computing, little research has been conducted into the merits of shared resources and cross-computing discipline efforts. As a long-range project, the implementation of the planning findings have significant potential for transforming the way computing education is learned nation-wide by creating a synergy across computing disciplines. Maintaining the scholarly focus in content area but creating shared teaching strategies, courses, and dialog among computing disciplines will significantly transform computing education and allow it to rapidly respond to the needs of the 21st Century workplace.</AbstractNarration>
