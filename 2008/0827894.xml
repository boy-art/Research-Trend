    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0827894&lt;br/&gt;Mathews&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations Program supports work by Professor Alexander P. Mathews of Kansas State University to investigate methods and mechanisms to enhance gas-liquid mass transfer and reaction rates using nanoparticles and nanoshells as shuttles. Nanoparticles and mesoporous nanoshells possess unique properties such as high surface area and mobility, and these can be used to advantage in changing bubble properties in gas-liquid mass transfer. Nanoparticle sizes are in the range of hydrodynamic boundary layers, and can be used to transport mass across the boundary layer. Moreover, adsorbent nanoparticles can sorb solutes from the liquid phase and rapidly shuttle the solutes to the gas phase. This process is expected to provide several fold increase in mass transfer rates due to (1) a parallel liquid-solid-gas transfer mechanism in addition to liquid-gas mass transfer, (2) increased bubble residence time, and (3) cavitating bubbles and under ultrasonic fields. This research will examine the mechanisms by which inert and adsorbent nanoparticles will affect mass transfer rates in the transfer of dissolved organic contaminants from water to the air phase in the presence and absence of ultrasonic fields. Gas-liquid mass transfer processes are important in natural and engineered systems. The application of knowledge gained from this work will provide more efficient means of conducting mass transfer operations in drinking water purification, multiphase reactions in the process industries, and in the removal of volatile organic compounds from contaminated groundwaters and wastewaters.</AbstractNarration>
