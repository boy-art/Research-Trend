    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds for the base support for the Utah Cosmic Ray group that serves as host to the Telescope Array (TA) experiment. TA is a large international endeavor, located in central Utah near the town of Delta, aimed at the study of Ultra?High Energy Cosmic Rays. The High Resolution Fly?s Eye (HiRes), the previous successful enterprise of this group, has observed the long anticipated GZK cut?off in the spectrum due to interactions with the microwave background. The first data from the Auger Observatory now appear to confirm this. However, the sources of the highest energy particles and questions about how they are accelerated in the first place are among the most important topics in particle astrophysics today. One suspected source is Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) which are among the most energetic objects known in the Universe. There are tantalizing hints of correlations with BL Lac objects which are AGNs with their jets pointed towards us. The TA experiment draws on the highly successful experience of HiRes and utilizes fluorescence telescopes, a technique developed by the Utah group. TA is a hybrid experiment with the world?s largest surface scintillator array measuring the footprint of the extensive air shower when it reaches the Earth and with multiple fluorescence telescope observatories measuring the shower in the space above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After commissioning finishes later this year, TA will be the most sensitive cosmic ray detector in the Northern Hemisphere. This group plans to continue their activities in support of detector installation, commissioning and operation. With extensive experience with HiRes, the group is also taking a lead role in the analysis of TA data, especially the fluorescence analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASPIRE is the Astrophysics Science Project Integrating Research and Education. Since 1997, ASPIRE has been creating some of the Web?s most engaging and interactive science lessons and labs and provides direct outreach to area teachers, students, and the public. Efforts include providing outreach and support to local groups, running summer workshop sessions for students, and visits to rural schools such as those in Millard and Delta, UT. As an outreach program, ASPIRE has been able to effectively and affordably have a great impact for a number of students and educators.</AbstractNarration>
