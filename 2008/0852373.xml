    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT: SOUTHEASTERN LIE THEORY WORKSHOP SERIES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lie theory represents a major area of mathematical research. Besides its increasing importance within mathematics to geometry, topology, combinatorics, and algebra, it has important applications outside of mathematics in areas such as physics, chemistry and computer science. Over the last 30 years, the universities in the southeastern region of USA have hired a steady stream of mathematicians working on different aspects of Lie theory and its applications. This project focuses on using the current infrastructure to build a sense of regional unity and foster cohesive research collaborations in the region. Annual regional workshops (for 3-4 days) in Lie theory will be held. These workshops will bring together senior and junior researchers (including graduate students), and create an academic environment which will encourage the exchange of ideas along with the awareness of research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also setup a regional network of researchers in Lie Theory to improve communication and collaboration. This network will significantly strengthen the recruitment and retention of graduate students in mathematics, the placement of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who have been trained in the southeast, the visibility of area mathematics departments at both the national and international levels, and the quality of graduate education and research in mathematics. Funding from this grant will support the first three annual workshops in Lie theory. These will be held at the North Carolina State University (2009), the University of Georgia (2010), and the University of Virginia (2011).</AbstractNarration>
