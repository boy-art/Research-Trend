    <AbstractNarration>This project combines research and educational activities in several areas of theoretical ultracold atomic physics, focusing on the superfluid properties of cold atoms. Superfluidity is a novel quantum phase of matter, usually occurs at very low temperatures, in which particles flow without friction. The same physics also underlines the mechanism of superconductors. Ultracold atoms offer an ideal platform to study this quantum phenomenon. Particles in nature, being fundamental or composite, can be categorized into two classes --- bosons or fermions --- depending on whether their spin is integer or half integer. Both kinds can become superfluid under proper conditions. However, the properties and formation mechanisms of bosonic and fermionic superfluids differ greatly. The goal of this project is to investigate the novel properties of bosonic and fermionic superfluids, as well as their mixtures, in the context of ultracold atoms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is both of fundamental importance and of great relevance to current experiments in the field of cold atoms. They serve the purpose of providing theoretical guidance and support to cold atom experiments. The specific topics to be explored span a wide spectrum of fundamental problems in the field of cold atoms with close ties to solid state physics. These studies will shed new light on many outstanding problems in superconductors which are materials of technological significance. Students and postdoctoral fellows involved in this research will receive a solid training in theoretical cold atom physics which will be very valuable for their future career in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
