    <AbstractNarration>Number theory has seen many significant advances in the past few years. &lt;br/&gt;Results from arithmetic geometry and the theories of modular forms and &lt;br/&gt;Galois representations have yielded a proof Fermat's Last Theorem and &lt;br/&gt;fundamental advances towards the $p$-adic Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer &lt;br/&gt;Conjecture (BSD), to name two. The research proposed in this project aims to &lt;br/&gt;continue this progress. The PI's propose to investigate many aspects of the &lt;br/&gt;connections between automorphic forms, Galois representations, and &lt;br/&gt;values of their $L$-functions, with the particular aim of making advances &lt;br/&gt;towards BSD, Bloch-Kato conjectures, and the Iwasawa Theory of automorphic &lt;br/&gt;Galois representations, as well as answering fundamental questions about the &lt;br/&gt;Galois representations associated to automorphic forms. Their project &lt;br/&gt;focuses on $p$-adic methods in the theory of automorphic forms and &lt;br/&gt;Galois representations. By combining their various expertise, they propose to &lt;br/&gt;consider a number of specific problems that fall under the following &lt;br/&gt;headings: $p$-adic Eisenstein measures and their specializations, &lt;br/&gt;Iwasawa's $\mu$-invariants, Non-vanishing modulo $p$ of $L$-values, &lt;br/&gt;Eisenstein ideals for unitary groups, Geometric construction of $p$-adic &lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms, $p$-adic construction of Euler systems, Endoscopic &lt;br/&gt;congruences, Galois representations and Shimura varieties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance our knowledge of the deep links between &lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms, Galois representations, and their $L$-functions - a &lt;br/&gt;central focus of number theory - as well as have significant &lt;br/&gt;consequences for our understanding of mathematics in general. Two workshops, a final &lt;br/&gt;conference, and graduate and post-doctoral advising will have an &lt;br/&gt;important impact on the formation of new researchers in the field and on &lt;br/&gt;the promotion of new collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
