    <AbstractNarration>Much has changed in the geological sciences since the NRC's report "Basic Research Opportunities in the Earth Sciences" which started ten years ago. This new project, "New Earth Science Research Opportunities at the National Science Foundation," has the same objectives and will use the same methods as the previous study to identify and make recommendations about the next generation of basic research opportunities at the NSF's EAR. A committee of experts will be asked to come to a consensus on new research opportunities and it will be aided in its deliberations by published literature, input from scientists at committee meetings, as well as through symposia held at major Earth science meetings, e.g., annual meetings of the AGU and GSA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth scientists tend to work on highly specific projects in specialized subdisciplines. The fundamental research questions underlying these projects are often implied or stated in technical terms. It will be challenging to think beyond these subdisciplines to develop the next generation of research opportunities likely to drive the field as a whole. This study will seek to overcome this challenge by careful choice of a committee of experts in the Earth sciences. Committee members will be well-respected individuals who have a reputation of thinking broadly and beyond their individual specialties. Some will be members of the National Academy of Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this report is to communicate the importance of Earth science to nonspecialists, including members of Congress, university administrators, and the general public. Members of these groups may not have a sophisticated understanding of the complexity and excitement of Earth science. A wide dissemination of the final NRC report may increase the visibility of and funding for the field.</AbstractNarration>
