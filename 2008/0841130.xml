    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research program of Professor Mary Elizabeth Williams in the Department of Chemistry at The Pennsylvania State University. Professor Williams and her students focus on a project titled "Magnetic Manipulation and Selective Isolation of Nanoparticles and Nanoparticle Assemblies." Small particles that have nanometer scale dimensions have unique properties that make them interesting for biomedicine, catalysis and sensing. The Williams research group is particularly interested in small magnetic particles, which can be pulled and trapped using magnets. When these are chemically linked together, the particles are expected to form new materials with improved properties for the above applications. This research project focuses on magnetically manipulating and pulling particles with a high level of control based on their size, magnetic properties, and number of linked particles. The study provides excellent training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral research associates in the highly multidisciplinary and cutting edge research field of nanoscience and nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
