    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Bethany Cobb is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of California-Berkeley. Dr. Cobb will make progress toward understanding gamma-ray burst (GRB) progenitors by examining GRB afterglows, GRB-related supernovae (SNe) and the host galaxies of dark bursts. GRBs have the potential to serve as powerful tools in many areas of astronomical research because they probe regions of the universe that are otherwise hidden from view. However, exactly how and why GRBs form is still not understood. This investigation will make use of the 1.3-m Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) in Chile and the 1.3-m robotic Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL) in Arizona for rapid and long-term follow-up of GRB afterglow and GRB-related SNe, as well as the WIYN and Keck observatories for deep imaging of GRB host galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Cobb will also develop and teach a series of 6-week courses through the UC Berkeley Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and the Berkeley Adult School to promote life-long learning and to bring the excitement of astronomy to adults 50+. These centers focus on helping seniors develop skills and interests that will enrich and enhance their quality of life. Dr. Cobb will make the materials produced for these classes publicly available and extensively document the challenges and rewards of teaching astronomy to mature students.</AbstractNarration>
