    <AbstractNarration>Many behaviors are the output of a complicated web of interactions in the brain. Some of these behaviors, such as mate choice, have important consequences, yet our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying this critical behavior is remarkably minimal. This project will use molecular techniques to explore the neural control of mate preference behavior by examining where in the brain specific genes associated with preference behavior are expressed, and whether behavior can be manipulated by manipulating gene expression. The research tests specific hypotheses drawn from recent work by the PI that identified candidate genes for female preference behavior in a classic mate choice system (the swordtail fish). Using pharmacological, molecular and neurobiological techniques, the investigator will test whether these genes (i) are directly involved in mediating preference response, (ii) are expressed in a neural pathway distinct from other social neural behavior networks, and (iii) account for inter-individual and inter-specific variation in female preference behavior. The expected outcome of this research will include the first functional test of candidate gene influence on preference behavior, elucidation of the neural circuitry governing preference behavior, and the first mechanistic comparison of choice versus coercion mating systems. The results of this research will shed light on the dynamic control of social interactions with the opposite sex by the vertebrate brain. Such research is a fundamental first step in understanding the influence of genes on human behavior, and will likely be a catalyst for further studies in human. The project also represents a major advancement in the field of animal behavior and sexual selection. The research is at the forefront of sexual selection studies by identifying potential molecular and neural targets for sexual selection. The project will also provide broad educational impacts through the integration of results into an undergraduate course in Animal Behavior.</AbstractNarration>
