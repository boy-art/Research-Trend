    <AbstractNarration>The University of California Berkeley REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during summers of 2009-2012. Ten students will be selected each year to participate in an intensive 10-week research program in Cell, Developmental, and Evolutionary Biology. The goals of this intensive program are (1) To foster an appreciation of how interwoven concepts unite the field of biology across many layers of organizational complexity. Students will participate in a series of faculty seminars including cell, developmental, evolutionary biology and bioinformatics. (2) To foster independent research capabilities. Students will participate in individual research projects based on their interests and the availability of participating faculty. The research experience will be shaped by faculty and doctoral students from the 3 participating units of Molecular &amp; Cell Biology, Integrative Biology and Plant &amp; Microbial Biology. (3) To enhance student success and guide them toward graduate studies. Students will participate in professional development workshops including scientific ethics, writing an effective research statement/application, making effective oral presentations, understanding the funding structure of biology, and more. (4) To become familiar with life at a large research university. Students will interact with undergraduate peers from the Biology Scholars Program (http://bsp.berkeley.edu). Applications from ethnic minority students underrepresented in the sciences and from those who have little opportunity for research experience at their home institution are especially encouraged. Participants will receive a stipend, plus housing, meals and travel costs. Participating faculty are committed to facilitating student success and a diverse bioscience community. More information and application materials are available at http://mcb.berkeley.edu/nsfreu/, or by contacting the Program Director, Professor David Weisblat (reuapplic@lists.berkeley.edu, 510 642 8309).</AbstractNarration>
