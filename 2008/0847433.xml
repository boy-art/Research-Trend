    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award funds a project to image electron spins in complex&lt;br/&gt;materials. Although electrons in metals mind their own business, barely&lt;br/&gt;interacting with each other, in so-called 'strongly correlated electron'&lt;br/&gt;materials the interactions of electrons drive unique properties that are&lt;br/&gt;fascinating and often useful. For example, so-called high-Tc&lt;br/&gt;superconductors carry electricity without loss at economically feasible&lt;br/&gt;temperatures; multi-ferroic materials allow electronic data storage using&lt;br/&gt;a magnetic field and magnetic data storage using an electric field; heavy&lt;br/&gt;fermion materials boast electrons behaving with thousands of times their&lt;br/&gt;actual mass; simple sheets of carbon called graphene allow electrons to&lt;br/&gt;zip along as if they had no mass at all. These materials have in common&lt;br/&gt;that their electrons interact strongly, and that those interactions are&lt;br/&gt;poorly understood. This project will employ a spin-polarized scanning&lt;br/&gt;tunneling microscope to measure the energies and locations of electron&lt;br/&gt;spins with atomic resolution, starting with superconductors. The project&lt;br/&gt;will also use this technology to educate three deserving groups: Harvard&lt;br/&gt;students will benefit from a new undergraduate course on scanning&lt;br/&gt;tunneling microscopy; local elementary school children will be invited to&lt;br/&gt;see a working science lab viewing real electrons; interested citizens will&lt;br/&gt;be able to browse a colorful website explaining the fascinating variety of&lt;br/&gt;materials under investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award funds a project to image electron spins in high-Tc&lt;br/&gt;superconductors, both cuprates and pnictides. The common feature to these&lt;br/&gt;exotic materials is that their electrons interact strongly, and there is&lt;br/&gt;no broadly successful theoretical language to describe these so-called&lt;br/&gt;'correlated electron materials'. Great strides have been made through&lt;br/&gt;various methods of imaging the interactions of electron charges, but&lt;br/&gt;understanding has been limited by the lack of effective tools to image the&lt;br/&gt;interactions of electron spins. This project will employ a low&lt;br/&gt;temperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscope to measure the&lt;br/&gt;spin-resolved density of electronic states with atomic resolution. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, a comparison will be made between spin interactions in&lt;br/&gt;cuprates and pnictides, the only two known families of high-Tc&lt;br/&gt;superconductors, discovered in 1986 and 2008. The project will also use&lt;br/&gt;this spin imaging technology to educate three deserving groups: Harvard&lt;br/&gt;students will benefit from a new undergraduate course on scanning&lt;br/&gt;tunneling microscopy; local elementary school children will be invited to&lt;br/&gt;see a working science lab imaging real electrons; interested citizens will&lt;br/&gt;be able to browse a colorful website explaining the fascinating variety of&lt;br/&gt;strongly correlated materials under investigation.</AbstractNarration>
