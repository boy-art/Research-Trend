    <AbstractNarration>Assessment/Research (91)&lt;br/&gt;This project is one component of a collaborative effort to develop and pilot the National Statistics Teaching Practice Survey (NSTPS), which is based on the Statistics Teaching Inventory, which was designed as part of the NSF-funded ARTIST project (DUE-0206571). This project is evaluating and refining the instrument and working with researchers from other STEM disciplines to align this project with similar efforts in other fields. A sister project (National Statistics Teaching Practice Survey: Planning and online logistics) based at the Ohio State University is creating the mechanism for administering the survey online, creating a data base and report structure, and administering the instrument. Working jointly, the instrument is to be used to gather and examine pilot data over multiple time points, including settings where change is anticipated (e.g. in gauging instructional changes for participants in a best practices workshop). Together these two projects are preparing the way for follow on work to gather longitudinal data on the teaching of STEM undergraduate courses in order to track changes over time and measure the alignment of teaching with data-based recommendations for improvement in teaching methods and materials.</AbstractNarration>
