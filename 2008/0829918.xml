    <AbstractNarration>Quantum Control of Polar Molecules for Quantum Information and Quantum Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum computers promise to revolutionize our ability to perform computation and solve complicated problems. However, quantum computers are difficult to build. It remains unclear what quantum systems will eventually be used for implementation of a ?scalable? quantum computer, which needs to operate on a large number of quantum bits (qubits) in order to outperform classical computers. This research develops a novel technology using quantum coherent control to produce and manipulate a large number of cold polar molecules. Such polar molecules have many appealing features to be used as qubits. The investigators use all-optical methods to achieve parallel yet local and individual control of many polar molecules. This work can lead to new approaches toward scalable quantum computing. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this research in an interdisciplinary team and learn at the forefront of optics and photonics, atomic and molecular physics, and quantum information science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops a novel technology using quantum coherent control in the production and manipulation of cold polar molecules, motivated by potential applications of such polar molecules in quantum information processing and computing. The investigators combine two powerful techniques in modern molecular physics, photoassociation and phase coherent control, to explore novel methods of quantum control of polar molecules, using an optically-based approach to achieve local yet massively-parallel individual control of both the density and orientation of polar molecules. This work could lead to the development of new protocols and schemes of scalable quantum information processing and computing.</AbstractNarration>
