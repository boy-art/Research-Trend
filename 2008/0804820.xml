    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0804820&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: John B. Etnyre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is to better understand the intriguing&lt;br/&gt;nature of contact structures in all (odd) dimensions, with&lt;br/&gt;special attention given to dimension three and to apply contact&lt;br/&gt;geometric techniques to questions in topology. The first main&lt;br/&gt;theme of the proposed research is open book decompositions. The&lt;br/&gt;connection of contact geometry and these specially fibered links&lt;br/&gt;have provided a fount of information concerning contact&lt;br/&gt;structures and low-dimensional topology. As part of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;this fundamental connection will be exploited to define and study&lt;br/&gt;new invariants of contact structures and special knots in them -&lt;br/&gt;specifically, Legendrian and transversal knots. From prior work&lt;br/&gt;it is clear these invariants have subtle connections to the famed&lt;br/&gt;tight vs. overtwisted dichotomy in dimension three and properties&lt;br/&gt;of symplectic fillings of contact structures, which in turn are&lt;br/&gt;crucial to applications to topology. Some of the major outcomes&lt;br/&gt;expected from this part of the project are various classification&lt;br/&gt;results for Legendrian and transversal knots in tight and&lt;br/&gt;overtwisted contact structures and a better understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental process of contact surgery. The project will also&lt;br/&gt;study the connection between contact structures and open books in&lt;br/&gt;high dimensions with the goal of illuminating existence questions&lt;br/&gt;in high dimensions and trying to generalize the notion of&lt;br/&gt;overtwistedness here as well. Similar to the connection with open&lt;br/&gt;books, contact structures are also related to foliations. This&lt;br/&gt;connection has been instrumental in applications of contact&lt;br/&gt;geometry to low-dimensional topology. Many of the outstanding&lt;br/&gt;questions concerning this connection will be explored. A second&lt;br/&gt;main theme of the proposal is the development and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;Legendrian contact homology in higher dimensions. There is a&lt;br/&gt;great deal of beautiful analytic and algebraic structure in this&lt;br/&gt;theory, much of which is yet to be discovered. Moreover, through&lt;br/&gt;the elegant conormal construction one can then use this to define&lt;br/&gt;invariants of manifolds and of their embeddings in Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;space. These invariants appear to be extremely powerful and will&lt;br/&gt;be thoroughly investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact structures on manifolds are very natural objects, born&lt;br/&gt;over two centuries ago, as a natural language for geometric&lt;br/&gt;optics, thermodynamics and classical mechanics. Everyday, one&lt;br/&gt;encounters contact structures when parallel parking a car,&lt;br/&gt;skating, or watching the prismatic play of light in a glass of&lt;br/&gt;water. Contact structures have been studied by many&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and seem to touch on diverse areas of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and physics, but only recently have they moved into the&lt;br/&gt;foreground of mathematics. This is due to the many remarkable&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and&lt;br/&gt;beautiful theory with many far reaching applications to areas&lt;br/&gt;such as three and four dimensional topology (that is the&lt;br/&gt;structure of space and space- time), string theory and large N&lt;br/&gt;dualities in modern physics, and fluid dynamics. The Principal&lt;br/&gt;Investigator will study the relation between contact geometry and&lt;br/&gt;various topological objects (such as open book decompositions and&lt;br/&gt;foliations). In addition he will develop analytic and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;tools for studying contact structures in high dimensions. As a&lt;br/&gt;whole it is expected that at the conclusion of this project we&lt;br/&gt;will have a much better understanding of contact structures in&lt;br/&gt;all dimensions and see many more surprising implications for low-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional manifolds.</AbstractNarration>
