    <AbstractNarration>Regular monitoring of known Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) from Rwanda has continued since the Karisoke Research Center was established by Dian Fossey in 1967, and has contributed substantially to knowledge of gorilla behavior, ecology and demography. However, there exists a critical need for the preservation and management of skeletal remains of deceased mountain gorillas from this population. Research on these remains will contribute significant insight into the biology of these critically endangered great apes. The availability of behavioral and veterinary records associated with each of the skeletons greatly enhances the uniqueness of this resource for scientific discovery. The major objectives of this project are to recover skeletons from approximately 100 mountain gorillas of known identity, many of which were previously buried, and to provide training and help build local capacity for their curation, long-term preservation and management as a resource for research and education in Rwanda. An international team of scientists and Rwandan wildlife authorities will carry out this multidisciplinary effort, which includes: location and excavation (where necessary) of recent mountain gorilla skeletal remains; cleaning and preservation of these remains, skeletal curation at the Mus√©e d'Histoire Naturelle in Kigali; and online data-basing of the collection and associated data. Individual skeletal identities will be confirmed using DNA analysis, where necessary. Project personnel will work closely with Rwandan staff, to build local expertise in skeletal preparation, curation, conservation and management practices, and implement post-necropsy protocols for preservation of future remains. This project will yield significant broader impacts for the scientific community and society at large. This unique skeletal collection will serve as a resource for local and visiting students and scientists alike, interested in all aspects of gorilla biology. Of note, this resource will be the focus of collaborative research between Rwandan and US-based scientists, to examine the effects of disease, environmental factors such as human disturbance, and stress on skeletal tissue growth, development, lifetime health and well-being of mountain gorillas. The educational potential is also profoundly important; this resource will play a key role in disseminating knowledge and enhancing public understanding of Rwanda's wildlife and other natural resources, and building community support for conservation initiatives.</AbstractNarration>
