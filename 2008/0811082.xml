    <AbstractNarration>Proposal No: 811082&lt;br/&gt;Title: Robust Performance Characterization in Complex VLSI Design Under Variations &lt;br/&gt;PI name: Davoodi, Azadeh &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;Design of Integrated Circuits is highly impacted by the imperfections of the nano-scale manufacturing process. These imperfections translate into variations in the characteristics of devices and their interconnections. These variations tend to become more random and less systematic as technology further scales down into sub-45nm domain. Only partial statistical information might be known about these variations, such as their average, variance and range. Furthermore, depending on the stage in the hierarchical design flow, correlations in the variability of the components on the chip may be partially known. Given this partial information, robust performance estimation is required to obtain more predictability during the design process. A robust prediction should include all scenarios that match with the partially available variability data. The PI proposes to investigate the novel applications of two statistical and optimization-based approaches for robust modeling of the performance of VLSI circuits. The PI suggests investigating the applicability of these approaches for large circuit sizes and large number of die-to-die and within-die variations at different stages of the design flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful implementation of the proposed research allows a more predictable design flow which can make a significant contribution in the development of next generation Integrated Circuits by shortening design cycles, thereby allowing a faster time-to-market. Reducing the time-to-market can prevent losses of 5-10% magnitude per month in major manufacturing industries. In addition, the PI plans development of a graduate-level course which will likely appeal to the students outside the Computer Engineering area towards meeting their secondary and minor area requirements, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This research will catalyze the PI?s efforts to increase the diversity in engineering by encouraging women to study computer engineering and choose it as a career, either at industry or academia.</AbstractNarration>
