    <AbstractNarration>A firm understanding of the mechanisms that allow multiple species to coexist is necessary in order to explain patterns of biodiversity. Several researchers have addressed this challenge by developing theory, while others have collected natural history or experimental data. This creative project joins these two separate approaches by explicitly addressing the intersection of theory and data. The proposed projects focus on the interactions between a beetle and its parasitoid wasp; parasitoids can play an important role in limiting insect populations in natural and agricultural habitats. First, the theoretical prediction that heterogeneity in parasitoid attack rates can promote coexistence of predator and prey will be tested experimentally. Second, new theory will be developed to pursue the idea that interactions between demographic stochasticity and resource heterogeneity promote population persistence. Third, the intersection of theory with data will be addressed through the development of efficient experimental designs, with an emphasis on response surface experimental designs. Through simulations, the investigators will study relative efficiencies of alternative experimental designs for quantifying the functional relationships that underlie species interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is potentially transformative in that it will accelerate the use of new experimental designs and analyses to compare alternative model structures, as opposed to the standard practice of rejecting null hypotheses. The investigator will develop open-source software to evaluate experimental designs in specific contexts. This project will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students in research techniques, data analysis, computer programming, and in independent research. Florida State University serves a diverse undergraduate population, and the investigator plans to recruit students from groups currently under-represented in science and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
