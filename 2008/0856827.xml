    <AbstractNarration>This partnership encompasses three large urban commuting schools, two community colleges (City Colleges of Chicago Kennedy-King College and Olive-Harvey College) and the Chicago State University (CSU). It is fostering an increase in the number of students persisting in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses and majors by focusing directly on the quality of student learning and engaging students in research projects early in their academic careers. The program: 1. enables students at community colleges to matriculate directly into the CSU baccalaureate STEM programs; 2. gives students support through programs that include facilitated learning, on-line tutoring, career counseling, seminars, development workshops, and faculty and peer mentoring programs; 3. puts early emphasis on developing student skills in mathematics and writing; and 4. uses CSU's local prairie garden for ecological and environmental field research as a base to expand opportunities for student research opportunities early in their undergraduate years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Contributing to the intellectual merit of this project are: the strong emphasis on academic excellence through strengthening student skills in mathematics and writing; affording early research experiences on something that students can see is a part of their world; and the close attention to support through cohort class participation, faculty and peer workshops, group study, seminars, and hands-on instruction in mathematics and science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: These institutions have long successful records of increasing diversity throughout their academic programs and have worked diligently with the public schools, community colleges and public institutions to do so. The goals are to increase undergraduate research by 20% and transfer rates from community college to baccalaureate institutions by 25%. The results of the program are being widely disseminated.</AbstractNarration>
