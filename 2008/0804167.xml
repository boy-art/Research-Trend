    <AbstractNarration>This exploratory research program is directed towards the identification, synthesis, and characterization of mixed-valent transition metal oxides with charge ordering which results in coupling between electrical and magnetic properties. In this project, the emphasis is on the discovery of new classes of compounds where charge ordering can lead to ferroelectricity and magnetic order. The materials discovered in the program will have major impact in magnetic storage and sensing systems that are needed in next generation high-speed computers. Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this program and will acquire education and training in cutting-edge research techniques used in the materials synthesis, crystal structure analysis and electrical characterization using state-of-the-art research tools. Students will report research progress locally as well as give presentations of finished work at scientific meetings at national and international levels. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;One area of intense research in solid state chemistry is the discovery of new compounds that can simultaneously exhibit various properties leading to multifunctional miniature electronic devices. A striking example is the coexistence of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in a single material platform that will revolutionize high speed computer industry by enabling devices that can read and write data simultaneously and is the subject of this program. Our exploratory research focuses on the identification, synthesis, and characterization of new and known oxide based materials containing transition elements with an ordered arrangement of electronic charges giving rise to strong coupling between electrical and magnetic properties. This program provides training for both undergraduate and graduate students in synthetic materials chemistry, crystal structure analysis and electronic properties. It will also provide these students with the intellectual challenge of understanding the complex behavior of newly synthesized materials and help forge links between chemistry, physics and material science. Connections to high school students will be extended via presentations and by making available hands-on research experiences in PI laboratories. Students participating in this research program will have an experience that will prepare them well for the modern industrial environment.</AbstractNarration>
