    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Patricia Gregg is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University. Dr. Gregg will investigate the role that magma injection and dike propagation have on the break up of continents along rift zones. The research goals will be accomplished by examining data from local arrays of seismic stations, GPS networks, and InSAR deformation data. These data will be integrated in computer models that take into account changes like temperature and strength of the rocks with increasing pressure and depth into the crust. The results from this investigation contribute to better understanding of the rift systems and they will help in the assessment of hazards like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Dr. Gregg will work with undergraduate and graduate students in assisting with their mentoring in research projects. This investigation will contribute to a larger international effort.</AbstractNarration>
