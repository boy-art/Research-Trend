    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed here is a three-part-cross analysis and thematic report on 15 year-olds focusing on knowledge and attitudes about the science of Earth and its environment done in collaboration between an American team, consisting of educational analysts and an early-career environmental scientist, and the PISA Unit of the Directorate for Education of the OEDC. This project will conduct statistical analysis of a large international survey, PISA, to describe student understanding of environmental topics. The goal is to advice the development of curriculum policy, teacher education and science education. The analysis will include a description in variations in students' knowledge of, and attitudes towards the environment. The OEDC's PISA 2006, a testing and survey of 15 year-olds in over 50 nations, is a yet to be analyzed rich source of information on the outcomes of secondary school education in environmental sciences.</AbstractNarration>
