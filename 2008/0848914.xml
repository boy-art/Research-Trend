    <AbstractNarration>To support the funding for travel of eligible graduate students from US institutions of higher learning to the 6th ACM Conference on Embedded&lt;br/&gt;Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys 2008). Grant recipients will be required to attend the conference and participate in a bird-of-a-feather session to discuss their experience. The goal of the grants is to encourage research interest and involvement of students who are not well-funded, under-represented, or otherwise not likely to be able to attend high-profile conferences in the field. By financially facilitating attendance and generating discussion the grant will encourage such students to become active in the latest research directions in this important field. The Sensys conference will take place in Raleigh, NC, in November 2008. Sensys is a highly selective, single-track forum for the presentation of research results on systems issues in the area of embedded, networked sensors. It provides an ideal venue to address the resear ch challenges facing the design, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. Sensor networks require contributions from many fields, from wireless communication and networking, embedded systems and hardware, distributed systems, data management, and applications, so we welcome cross-disciplinary work. The author of this proposal is the General Chair of the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To interest young researches in the field of networking technology and systems,&lt;br/&gt;this proposal is to create a number of travel grants for student travel to Sensys. Grant recipients will be required to attend the conference and discuss this experience in a special session. The purpose is to encourage under-represented and under-funded students to become more actively engaged in research of interest to networking technology. An announcement to that effect will be made at the conference web page with an acknowledgement to NSF as the sponsor of the student travel grants. The proposal is to create 25 NSF-sponsored student travel grants of approximately $600 each, for a total of $15,000. This amount is payable as registration fees to cover participation cost. Eligibility criteria, listed in the project description, will be announced and a procedure will be put in place to select the most appropriate applicants in accordance with these criteria.</AbstractNarration>
