    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0847759 PI: Detamore, Michael ORG: University of Kansas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Gradients and Umbilical Cord Stem Cells in Osteochondral&lt;br/&gt;Tissue Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The long-term scientific objective is to apply a gradient-based approach to the field of tissue engineering to regenerate tissues in the joints of patients suffering from sports injuries and arthritis. The first step toward this objective is to apply methods for generating 3D bioactive signal and mechanical stiffness gradients to accelerate osteochondral tissue formation. The overall strategy will be to measure the responses of stem cells to specific combinations of signal and stiffness gradients. The stem cells to be evaluated are human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal stem cells (hUCMSCs), an exciting new cell source in musculoskeletal tissue engineering. Gradients will be achieved by one of two means: a diffusion-driven hydrogel system and a novel microparticle-based scaffold. Combinations of signal and stiffness gradients will be explored, culminating in a construct in the shape of a mandibular condyle. Gradients have been used in a variety of other disciplines, and are crucial to guiding cell behavior in fundamental biological processes such as embryonic development and wound healing, but have yet to be investigated in musculoskeletal tissue engineering. hUCMSCs remain virtually unexplored in musculoskeletal tissue engineering, and will have broad application. Successful completion of this project will lead to a better fundamental understanding of hUCMSCs and gradient strategies, which will have a tremendous impact, offering the deliverable of a new cell source and a new paradigm of chemical and mechanical gradients for musculoskeletal tissue engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The educational objectives of the proposal are to (1) create a new project for high school girls at an existing summer engineering camp, (2) establish a formal link between the School of Engineering and an existing undergraduate research program (IMSD) for underrepresented groups, and (3) expand the burgeoning bioengineering graduate program at KU. The PI took an active leadership role in spearheading a multidisciplinary bioengineering graduate program that began in the Fall of 2007 at the University of Kansas. Graduate students recruited for this project are likely to be from this degree program, identified as an educational and economic priority for Kansas. The aforementioned undergraduate initiative will impact underrepresented groups across the School of Engineering. Elements of the research project will be incorporated into the tissue engineering course already developed by the PI, and will provide a new hands-on experiment in the PI?s annual ?Project Discovery? program, a week-long engineering summer camp for female high school students.</AbstractNarration>
