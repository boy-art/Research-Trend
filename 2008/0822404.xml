    <AbstractNarration>The Ana G. Mendez University System (AGMUS), a non-profit organization serving 36,000 underrepresented, economically disadvantaged students in Puerto Rico at three main educational campuses, Universidad Metropolitana (UMET), Universidad del Turabo (UT) and Universidad del Este (UNE) in partnership with the Department of Education of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and research institutions and mentors in the US mainland has designed the NSF/AGMUS Institute of Mathematics. The Institute will continue the successful best practices of the Model Institutions for Excellence (MIE) program developed very successful best practices to motivate economically disadvantaged pre-college and undergraduate students to select science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields as their professional careers at college and at graduate school. The intellectual merit of the NSF/AGMUS Institute of Mathematics is to offer exceptional research opportunities to talented youngsters from Puerto Rico to become the next generation of mathematicians and leaders. The implementation of the research activities of the Institute at the pre-college and undergraduate levels will enhance the intellectual capability and motivate science and mathematics majors to pursue careers at the graduate level (Master's and Ph.Ds) in mathematics. This program together with a scholarship program for math majors, the creation of a BS degree program in biomathematics, a summer research experience at institutions in Puerto Rico, the US mainland and abroad, and a bridge to graduate school for math majors are the major components of the activities of the NSF/AGMUS Institute of Mathematics. The goal of this proposal is the creation of a Center to foster the study of mathematics among the youth of Puerto Rico. The objectives of this proposal are to: (1) develop a pre-college program in mathematics for 625 middle and high school students and for 60 science and math teachers from Puerto Rico; (2) develop a math scholarship program for 20 undergraduates/year from the Ana G. MÃ©ndez University System; (3) develop a biomathematics curriculum at the BS level offering 136 credit hours; (4) develop a summer research experience program in mathematics for 25 middle and high school students, 50 undergraduates and 60 math teachers in research institutions, national laboratories, universities, and industry in Puerto Rico, the US mainland and abroad; (5) develop a Bridge to Graduate School initiative to enhance transfer to graduate studies in mathematics for undergraduates from Puerto Rican colleges and universities; (6) disseminate the outcomes of the project locally, nationally and internationally. The greater impact of the NSF/AGMUS Project lies on the large number of educational opportunities offered to 625 pre-college students, 50 undergraduates and 60 math teachers for the period of the grant. This proposal will have a significant impact on the life of economically disadvantaged students, mentors and administrators by creating a researchoriented community of scholars willing work for success and excellence in mathematics. The results of the project and research outcomes of the scholars will be disseminated through conferences and publications by the PI, Co-PI and participants to the communities at the universities, nationally and worldwide by internet through the AGMUS webpage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be managed by Dr. Juan F. Arratia, a senior scientist and administrator, and supported by an External Advisory Committee formed by distinguished scientists and scholars from the United States of America.</AbstractNarration>
