    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;DRL-0822128&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Ristvey&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Mid-Continent Research for Education and Learning (McREL)&lt;br/&gt;Title: NanoTeach: Professional Development in Nanoscale Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is exploring the introduction of nanoscience curriculum into high schools. It is creating and studying a professional development model based on two products, the NanoTeach Teacher's Guide and the NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide. The NanoTeach Teacher's guide is being designed for self study by teachers (low treatment group) and for use in a facilitated development model (high treatment group). The NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide outlines the professional development experiences and provides guidance for facilitators. The professional development model combines (1) a design framework (Designing Effective Science Lessons based on the C-U-E model: content, understanding, and environment); (2) nanoscale science content from NSF-funded curriculum projects; and (3) multiple delivery methods. Twenty teachers are being recruited to carry out the pilot testing of the professional development materials. 75 teachers in the high treatment group are experiencing a 2-week summer workshop, asynchronous sessions while they implement their first lesson, Versatile Classroom (a synchronous, online video technology), implementation of a second lesson, and a final 2-week summer workshop. 75 teachers in the low treatment group experience a brief orientation to nanoscience resources, have access to the NT Teacher's Guide, implement two lessons, and debrief. The NanoTeach partnership includes Aspen Associates, the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility, and the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network. The research study is being carried out by Aspen Associates, and project evaluation is conducted by Dr. Doug Huffman of the University of Kansas.</AbstractNarration>
