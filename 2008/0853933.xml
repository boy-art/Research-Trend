    <AbstractNarration>0853933&lt;br/&gt;Wamser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to provide data that will advance the ability to design integrated green roof - photovoltaic array systems that can be optimized for multiple purposes on urban roofs. The fundamental research question to be addressed is: Can green roof design and/or management be altered to enhance both photovoltaic energy production and green roof function in a combined technology system. The research will use the Portland State University (PSU) Photovoltaic Test Facility, but the concepts and results generated should be broadly applicable to other urban systems, based on the project's modeling efforts. A suite of experimental green roof microcosms will be established to test hypotheses examining the relationship between green roof properties (species composition and evapotranspiration) on photovoltaic energy production and roof carbon gain. In addition, the impact of these technologies (separately and in combination) on building energy consumption and the development of the urban heat island effect will be investigated. Direct use and implementation of results will build upon collaborations with the City of Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, Portland General Electric, Oregon BEST (Built Environment and sustainable Technology Center), Gerding Edlen Development, and GreenWorks, with planned outreach components with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. The project will provide interdisciplinary research training for 8 to 10 undergraduate research assistants and three graduate students from PSU. Through development of a senior capstone course, engineering students will participate in key design aspects of the project. The research will support an emerging collaborative relationship among faculty members in multiple departments at PSU, an important aspect for research progress in environmental sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
