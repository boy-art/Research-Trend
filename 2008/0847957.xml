    <AbstractNarration>Professor Richard M. Crooks of the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct research on the synthesis and characterization of novel dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) containing less than 250 atoms. More specifically, alloy and core/shell bimetallic DENs consisting of one noble metal and one non-noble metal, and DENs consisting of one metal and one metal oxide will be synthesized and characterized by EXAFS, high-energy XRD/pair distribution function analysis, and near-atom-resolved STEM/X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy methods. The materials are specifically chosen to be model nanoparticle catalysts that are small enough to accommodate discrete Fourier transform (DFT) calculations, allowing comparison of the experimentally determined properties of these structurally-complex nanoparticles with theory. This establishes a route to the fundamental understanding of catalyst operation through structure-function relationships, which is a central challenge in the field of catalysis. This research will expose students and postdoctoral researcher to high quality research through training on state-of-the-art instruments, workshops and other innovative educational activities.</AbstractNarration>
