    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT HRD 0811379&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central State University (CSU), through a prior HBCU-UP grant, has introduced an Environmental Engineering (ENE) Program at the baccalaureate level in response to the need for environmental engineers globally beginning in Fall of 2007. The department, under the ENE Program has identified industrial water/wastewater treatment as an emerging area with an increasing global focus. This is also a signature area where ultra pure filtration of emerging pollutants identified by the US EPA using nanotechnology offers immense research possibilities. Education and research experience in this area would allow our students to compete for opportunities both in the domestic and international water sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Center for Water Resources Management (ICWRM) at Central State University (CSU ICWRM) is unique amongst the HBCU institutions in the Nation in having an interdisciplinary program in WRM at the undergraduate level. CSU ICWRM is enhancing the quality of its current program through infusion of industrial wastewater treatment into its curriculum. This is being accomplished by revamping existing course content and instructional delivery in the areas of water and wastewater treatment and by expanding current capabilities of the Water quality laboratory through acquiring additional analytical instrumentation. The enriched curriculum allows students to gain an understanding of the fate and transport of heavy metals and other inorganic ions in the environment, particularly in the industrial effluents. Other areas benefiting include the Environmental Science minor offered jointly by ICWRM and Biology area of the Natural Sciences Department and the Biotechnology initiative of the Biology area. It supplements the analytical support required for the Forensic science program being conceived within Chemistry and Biology departments. In anticipation of future work force needs in industrial water treatment, ICWRM also proposes to conduct undergraduate educational research on feasibility of using nanofibers in ultra pure filtration of trace metals from drinking water and industrial effluents.</AbstractNarration>
