    <AbstractNarration>This project is increasing the success rate of financially needy students in the Master of Marine and Environmental Science (MMES) program at the University. The MMES program serves an environmentally fragile and economically disadvantaged region whose residents are predominantly racial minorities. The S-STEM project's objectives are to (1) eliminate barriers that hinder financially needy students from participating in the MMES program and (2) increase participation by students from under-represented groups. Academically talented and financially needy undergraduates or working professionals, especially Virgin Islanders, black and Hispanic students, and women, are recruited through seminars, opportunities for assisting in hands-on research, and financial support once enrolled. To guide students from acceptance to graduation and career placement, a dedicated S-STEM Faculty Mentor is working with students. S-STEM Scholars have access to tutoring, the opportunity to participate in paid internships, and financial support for completing their Masters thesis research. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is the contribution that the students make to scientific knowledge through their original thesis research within the context of a tropical island ecosystem. The intellectual challenge for the students is to approach environmental issues through a joint scientific and management perspective. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal are that the MMES program is training the next generation of diverse environmental leaders to respond to the need for creative, well prepared managers and scientists to address Caribbean and global environmental crises. There is a clear benefit to society as people depend on the ecosystem services provided by coral reefs and the other systems of the Virgin Islands.</AbstractNarration>
