    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;04 August 2008&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0813606&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;PI: P. Zerr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support items for Oregon State University for use aboard the R/V WECOMA; namely a replacement deck crane. Two additional items were initially requested (mooring recovery winch and replacement A-frame), but the panel felt there was not enough justification to support a dedicated mooring recovery winch at OSU, and the A-frame design was not sufficiently advanced to support award. The replacement deck crane will replace an aging unit and will provide greatly improved support capabilities to science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V WECOMA, as part of OSU?s College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences, supports federally funded scientific research throughout the north Pacific. The operation routinely exposes students and the general public to seagoing oceanography through the ?Teachers at Sea? program and open houses such as ?HMSeaFest?. In 2007, WECOMA supported eleven NSF-funded cruises for a total of 140 days. Eight NSF-funded cruises totaling 85 days are planned for 2008.</AbstractNarration>
