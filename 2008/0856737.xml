    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop a methodology for examining system-theoretic aspects of semi-autonomous networked system. These systems consist of a collection of dynamic units that evolve according to a predetermined interaction protocol over an information-exchange network, and a set of units that act as interfaces between the networked systems and its exogenous operational environment. The system-theoretic attributes of particular interest in this project include controllability, observability, and feedback performance of semi-autonomous networks, as well characterization of most influential interfaces- which in this project- will be examined with respect to graph-theoretic and algebraic structures of the underlying network. In this venue, the network features that are interest include its symmetry, degree sequence, diameter, centrality of its nodes, connectivity, and incidence relationship between its spanning trees and cycles. This framework will be developed in the context of a canonical dynamic model, namely, diffusion-like models of interactions and their extensions. Deliverables include a documentation of research results in terms of journal and conference publications, modeling and analysis tools for semi-autonomous networks, engineering student education, and curriculum development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide a framework for augmenting a variety of networked systems for improved performance, including engineering realizations of formations, distributed sensor networks, as well as synthetic lattice-like structures in nano-systems. This award will lead to developing a new course with the aim of bridging a gap between networked systems analysis and control and their scientific and engineering realizations in science and engineering. This goal will further be facilitated by organizing a workshop on networked systems during the final year of the project and the development of a new curriculum for graduate program in systems and control.</AbstractNarration>
