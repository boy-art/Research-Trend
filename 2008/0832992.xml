    <AbstractNarration>The Virginia Teach project is providing scholarships to a cumulative total of 23 mathematics majors who commit to teaching middle school or high school. Scholars complete a BS in Mathematics, a Masters in Education degree, and Virginia teacher certification requirements, in order to become highly qualified teachers in high-need schools. Project goals concern the recruitment, preparation, support, and retention of Noyce scholars as they progress through Virginia Tech's mathematics education program and into professional teaching. The project is a collaboration between Department of Mathematics faculty and School of Education faculty. Project activities include inreach to students already enrolled at Virginia Tech and outreach to local schools. For example, the project introduces internships for STEM sophomores to spend spring break investigating teaching by working in a Montgomery County, VA school. Noyce interns, scholars, mentors, and personnel form a community of support through participation in classrooms, conferences, colloquia, meetings, and a listserv. In addition to adding 23 talented mathematics teachers to schools in need, Virginia Teach is strengthening Virginia Tech's secondary mathematics certification program. The university's program relies on partnership with local schools and mentor teachers, and the project strengthens that partnership by increasing teacher involvement in the program while increasing university students' involvement in the schools. Data gathered in monitoring the progress of Noyce scholars informs decisions on altering course requirements, course revisions, and the design of field experiences, at Virginia Tech and elsewhere. Data also generates research on effective recruiting and retention practices, especially concerning teacher candidates from groups that are underrepresented in mathematics classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
