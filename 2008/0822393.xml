    <AbstractNarration>Proposal number IOS-0822393&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project fuses genetic, evolutionary, and functional approaches to understand the co-evolution of plants and pathogens at the molecular level. Protein-protein interactions will be analyzed in yeast and in plants to build an interaction network of receptor (NBS-LRR) proteins, plant signaling components, and virulence effector proteins from bacterial and oomycete pathogens. The functional significance of these interactions to disease will be studied by a variety of cell biology and disease assays. The project will reveal whether targets of effectors represent a limited number of points of weakness in the plant that are exploited by multiple effectors and pathogens and whether protein complexes that determine the infection phenotype co-evolve. Libraries of genes encoding NBS-LRR proteins and their domains as well as signaling proteins that are candidate plant targets of effectors studied will be distributed through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.&lt;br/&gt;The global approach will generate large amounts of data that will impact many labs focused on understanding the molecular basis of disease resistance in plants as well as contribute to the functional characterization of numerous genes in Arabidopsis. Data from the project will be broadly disseminated through the project web site (http://niblrrs.ucdavis.edu ) and through The Arabidopsis Information Resource. Deciphering the molecular determinants of resistance has practical importance as well as fundamental interest. A greater understanding of the mechanisms of perception and responses will provide new possibilities for developing disease resistant plants. Consequently, this project will expand the options available to plant breeders to achieve more durable resistance. Researchers involved in the project will benefit from inter-disciplinary training that includes the molecular genetics and cell biology of the defense response components and protein-protein interactions involved in pathogen-host interactions. Outreach efforts will include dissemination of genomics approaches to high schools through curriculum development, workshops and internships.</AbstractNarration>
