    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0828852&lt;br/&gt;Baertsch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOBXB storage reduction (NSR) catalytic reactors are currently being developed as after treatment systems to reduce NOBXB emissions from lean burn diesel engines to meet stringent EPA regulations to be imposed in 2007 and 2010. Predictive models based on fundamental reaction kinetics and detailed heat and mass transfer within transient non-isothermal monolithic reactors will provide a mechanism for engine manufacturers to rapidly develop, optimize, and ultimately control diesel engine emission reduction systems to meet these demanding regulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of such models for complex, cyclic NSR systems requires experimental investigation and validation of transient and spatially variant kinetic and thermal behavior within a monolith after-treatment system. However, methods for incorporating catalyst surface characterization techniques and thermal measurement capabilities into monolith reactor geometries are not available. Both the catalyst surface and the reactor temperature vary as a function of time and position in the monolith during NSR cycles, and a rigorous predictive model needs to capture these spatial and temporal phenomena. Thus, such spatial and temporal reaction information must be available and measurable experimentally for model validation and parameter estimation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI aims to take advantage of opportunities emerging from silicon microfabrication technologies developed for MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) to develop a novel microreactor for the characterization of dynamic NSR catalytic systems. An integrated microsystem will be developed to enable combined Uspatially resolved and transient FTIR analysis Uof high-surface area nanostructured supported metallic and oxide catalysts during NSR catalytic cycles, simultaneously with Uspatially resolved and transient temperature measurementsU of the non-isothermal NSR process and Uwithin a geometry and at reaction conditions and space times replicating after-treatment monolith reactorsU. This work will directly impact a collaboration between faculty and students at Purdue University and a research and development team at Cummins Inc. working to develop improved engine/catalyst systems for reducing NOBXB from diesel engines to meet impending EPA standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this work new capabilities for incorporating catalyst surface characterization techniques (specifically in-situ FTIR at elevated temperatures) and thermal measurement capabilities into monolith and packed-bed reactor geometries for improved catalyst design and analysis will be developed. Additionally, on-going efforts by the PI to recruit, retain, and support women and minority students in engineering through the Women in Engineering Program, mentoring relationships, and K-12 outreach programs including the Purdue EDGE summer camp will continue. Engineering teaching resources will be developed by undergraduate students in the form of MEMS learning modules and disseminated on the NSF funded nanoHUB (HTUwww.nano.orgUTH) as part of its on-line nanoelectronics curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
