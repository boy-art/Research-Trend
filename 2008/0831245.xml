    <AbstractNarration>Layer-8 attacks (e.g., spam and phishing) are launched from a malicious service platform, e.g., botnet, which consists of a large number of infected machines (or bots). Such an attack platform relies on lower-layer network services to achieve efficiency, robustness, and stealth in communication and attack activities. These services include look-up (e.g., DNS), hosting (e.g., Web servers), and transport (e.g., BGP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main research goals and approaches of the CLEANSE project are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1. Control-plane monitoring. Much of the infrastructure for mounting layer-8 attacks involves abuse of the control plane in core network services (e.g., DNS and BGP).&lt;br/&gt;The CLEANSE project develops control-plane anomaly detection sensors that are distributed, online, and real-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 2. Data-plane monitoring. The project develops new and general network anomaly detection algorithms based on traffic sampling and clustering for monitoring high-speed traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 3. Improved security auditing capabilities. The CLEANSE project develops packet "tagging/tainting" techniques to enable tracking and clustering of network traffic flows (e.g., that are generated by the same bot program). The project also develops improved traffic sampling capabilities that are attack-aware and distributed network-wide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By focusing on monitoring of core network services, the CLEANSE framework can detect future layer-8 attacks and new forms of large-scale malware infections. The project also creates educational contents, including new textbooks and on-line course materials, which directly benefit from the research activities. The CLEANSE project team also work with industry partners (including the ISPs) to organize focused workshops that bring together researchers from academia and practitioners from the industry/ISP, government, and law enforcement agencies to foster the exchange of ideas, data, and technologies.</AbstractNarration>
