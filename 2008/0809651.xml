    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professors Dudley Herschbach and Igor Lyuksyutov of Texas A &amp; M University, together with their graduate student colleagues, will study the reactions of hydrogen atoms with molecules in crossed-beam experiments at ultra-low collision energies -- energies where the deBroglie wavelengths exceed 250 Ã…. Initial molecules to be studied will include halogens and nitrogen dioxide. In addition to these studies of reactions of ultra-slow chemical species, Herschbach and Lyuksyutov propose to conduct crossed-beams studies of a number of reactions involving atmospherically important HOx species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By carefully controlling the collision energies of reactions, experiments like those being conducted here reveal important details for how chemical reactions occur -- details that are lost when studying reactions under normal laboratory conditions. In addition, by slowing normally speedy reactant molecules (ca. 1000 mph) to "school-zone" speeds, extreme quantum effects will become dominant -- resulting in unique behavior. Profs. Herschbach and Lyuksyutov will continue to lead a number of high profile outreach projects, including television work and a summer school for high school students entitled the "Coolest Place in Texas."</AbstractNarration>
