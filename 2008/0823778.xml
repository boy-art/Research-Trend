    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;We will create a new generation of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) with widths below 50 nm, thus improving dramatically on demonstrated detector efficiency at both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We will develop and test narrower wires by using improved nanofabrication and low-temperature characterization. We will simultaneously develop improved understanding of the superconductive nanowire device physics to enable further advances in nanowire-photodetector technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Superconducting nanowires are an interesting physical system for studying quantum mechanical, thermodynamic and electromagnetic interactions. Structures at the widths that will be explored in this work will provide new insights as the quantum mechanical wavefunction of the superconducting charge carriers is restricted from two, toward just one dimension. Additionally, this work will stress the limits of nanofabrication, requiring large-area structures to be developed with tens-of-nanometer widths and line-width uniformity of a few-nanometers. This work will also provide near- and mid-infrared single-photon detectors, and even photon-number-resolving detectors, with exquisite timing resolution that will advance research in quantum optics, remote sensing and astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Development of SNSPDs with increased efficiencies, both in the near- and mid-infrared, will provide sensors for applications ranging from astronomy to environmental monitoring. Also, this work will provide valuable educational opportunities in nanofabrication, nano-optics, and solid-state physics to graduate students and undergraduates in the classroom and in the laboratory. Finally, this project will create an opportunity for the general public to learn about one of the important applications of nanotechnology through a public lecture.</AbstractNarration>
