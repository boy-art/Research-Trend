    <AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Science Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy (COSEPUP) is charged to "to deliberate on initiatives for new studies in the area of science and technology policy, taking especially into account the concerns and requests of the President's Science Advisor, the Director of the NSF, the Chairman of the National Science Board, and the chairmen of key science and technology-related committees of the Congress." Its work has addressed issues of critical importance to Federal Agencies and the Nation. Among its recent studies is the widely publicized "Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future", which has since helped to focus renewed attention on science and technology as a driver for U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. Since its inception, the National Science Foundation has supported COSEPUP activities. This award will provide funds for core support of COSEPUP, to continue its work as an independent advisor on issues relating to national science and technology policy.</AbstractNarration>
