    <AbstractNarration>The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international organization&lt;br/&gt;in the field of natural language processing. The ACL's annual conference is the major international&lt;br/&gt;conference in this field. This project is to subsidize travel, conference, and housing expenses of&lt;br/&gt;students selected to participate in the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Student&lt;br/&gt;Research Workshop, which is part of the ACL conference on June 15-20, 2008 in Columbus, Ohio.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop consists of two tracks: full paper presentations and poster presentations. All selected&lt;br/&gt;work has only student authors. The full paper sessions are composed of paper presentations followed&lt;br/&gt;by a discussion panel led by respected researchers in the field. The workshop is organized and run by&lt;br/&gt;students. The workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of natural language&lt;br/&gt;processing researchers to enter the computational linguistics community. It allows the best students&lt;br/&gt;in the field to take their first important step toward becoming professional computational linguists&lt;br/&gt;by receiving critical feedback on their work from external experts, and by making contacts with&lt;br/&gt;other students and senior researchers in their field. The students who are involved in running and&lt;br/&gt;selecting papers for the workshop also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction&lt;br/&gt;with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference. The workshop contributes&lt;br/&gt;to the maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics and natural&lt;br/&gt;language processing workforce, helping to produce a pool of researchers with the scientific and&lt;br/&gt;engineering knowledge for natural language processing.</AbstractNarration>
