    <AbstractNarration>Stanescu&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0810890&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project helps support U.S. participants in the 2008&lt;br/&gt;Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium Summer School. The school&lt;br/&gt;educates graduate students and junior faculty on the recent&lt;br/&gt;developments in computational methods for partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations. This topic is of major importance in applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and is key in developing a better understanding of,&lt;br/&gt;and prediction capability for, complex physical systems. Topics&lt;br/&gt;to be covered at the intensive two-week summer school include:&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods for time-dependent problems, nodal&lt;br/&gt;Discontinuous Galerkin Methods (theory and implementation),&lt;br/&gt;high-accuracy and spectral element methods on structured and&lt;br/&gt;unstructured meshes, introduction to parallel computing and&lt;br/&gt;high-performance computing on present-day architectures, and&lt;br/&gt;various applications such as fluid flow and weather prediction. &lt;br/&gt;The lecturers include Jan Hesthaven (Division of Applied&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics at Brown University, and Director of the Center for&lt;br/&gt;Computation and Visualization), Amik St-Cyr (National Center for&lt;br/&gt;Atmospheric Research), Henry Tufo (Colorado University-Boulder&lt;br/&gt;and National Center for Atmospheric Research), and Tim Warburton&lt;br/&gt;(Rice University). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The school has an impact on the U.S. maintaining its&lt;br/&gt;leadership role in computational science, by equipping U.S.&lt;br/&gt;graduate students with an understanding of the latest&lt;br/&gt;computational methods, preparing students to be able to perform&lt;br/&gt;parallel computations on developing architectures, and enhancing&lt;br/&gt;their understanding of the important role that mathematical&lt;br/&gt;modeling and simulations plays in science. The summer school is&lt;br/&gt;held just prior to the thematic year-long program on&lt;br/&gt;Computational Geosciences at NCAR, and thus prepares graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and junior faculty to participate more beneficially in&lt;br/&gt;this program. This project also has a large impact on math and&lt;br/&gt;science education in Wyoming, as some of the speakers and&lt;br/&gt;participants are guest lecturers at the local workshop "Thinking&lt;br/&gt;and Doing Math and Science with Engineering," a program that&lt;br/&gt;presents Wyoming K-12 math and science teachers with feasible&lt;br/&gt;ways to make mathematics and science more pertinent and exciting&lt;br/&gt;to their students.</AbstractNarration>
