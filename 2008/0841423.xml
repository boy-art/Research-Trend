    <AbstractNarration>Computer science is rapidly becoming crucial to most disciplines that emphasize science, technology and mathematics, but this fact has not been communicated clearly to the public, including the next generation of scientists, engineers and innovators. In particular, students and teachers in primary and secondary schools are largely unaware of the ubiquity of computing and the revolution that it has had on different areas of science. This has led to a current shortage of computer professionals as well as science and engineering students who understand the need to apply computing to their fields of study.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal incorporates computing into existing high school and middle school courses (such as biology, physics, civics), in-school technical electives, summer programs, and research projects for high school students. Fellows will work in close collaboration with public school teachers and local school districts to develop standard-based curriculum appropriate for each individual school. This proposal is unique in that it will not introduce any new courses or programs, nor will it focus on existing computer science courses/programs. Instead, it will bring new content to established audiences.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will enhance the communication and teaching skills of the fellows and change the school culture for computing education. It will also change the university culture for graduate education by emphasizing the ability to explicate and motivate the work of the Fellows. Lastly, it is expected this program will lead to improved communication of computing applications to the public and an eventual increase in the number of computer professionals.</AbstractNarration>
