    <AbstractNarration>A Randomized Study of the Impact of STEM Mentors with Disabilities on High School Students with Disabilities is an investigation of the impact of mentoring by adults with disabilities on youth with disabilities in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first aim of the Project is to conduct an exploratory randomized clinical trial investigating the extent to which systematic interaction with STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) mentors with disabilities promotes the STEM-related career planning knowledge, self-efficacy, engagement and performance of high school students with disabilities. The proposed study will build upon an established conceptual framework explaining the role of mentors in facilitating students' self-efficacy and achievement, and previous research documenting the benefits of mentoring and, most specifically the benefits of mentoring of youth with disabilities by successful adults with disabilities (e.g., Burgstahler &amp; Cronheim, 2001; Cory &amp; Burgstahler, 2007;Hibbard, Cantor, Charatz, Rosenthal, Ashman, Gundersen, Ireland-Knight, Gordon, Avner, &amp; Gartner, 2002; Powers, Sowers, &amp; Stevens, 1995). The study will feature a three-independent group, randomized block, repeated measures design utilizing multiple-agents, multiple methods, and established protocols and measurement methods. The study includes a three-group comparison: 1) high school students with disabilities exposed to STEM mentors with disabilities; 2) high school students with disabilities exposed to STEM mentors without disabilities; and 3) and high school students with disabilities who are not exposed to mentors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second aim of the Project is to specify efficacious STEM mentor program methods and evaluation strategies, based on the study's summative and formative findings, which will be used to advance adoption of efficacious STEM mentoring approaches through a larger replication study of strategic impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An independent evaluation of the project will be conducted by Kasey McKraken from David Heil and Associates, an organization specializing in the design of science-based education programs, products, and services including project evaluation design and implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following dissemination strategies will be utilized:&lt;br/&gt;1. In line with the second aim of the project, a replication manual detailing STEM mentor program methods and evaluation approaches, based on the summative and formative findings, will be prepared and comprehensively disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;2. At least 2 manuscripts will be published in professional journals in STEM education, such as Journal of Research in Science Teaching and Journal of Research on Technology in Education, and Science and Technology Policy.&lt;br/&gt;3. The methodology and findings will be presented at a minimum of 4 regional and national conferences, such as the National Science Foundation Annual PI Meeting, American Educational Research Association (AERA) and American Academy for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).&lt;br/&gt;4. Findings will be posted on the Internet through Portland State University?s-Regional Research Institute's web site (http://pdx.edu/rri)</AbstractNarration>
