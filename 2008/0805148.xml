    <AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to develop methods to control electron/energy transfer processes at interfaces involving chemically synthesized nanoscale inorganic materials. This control will be achieved through the solution-based assembly of multiple inorganic components (metallic, semiconducting, and/or insulating) with, in some cases, functional organic molecules. For initial study, three systems of fundamental scientific and commercial importance are targeted: (1) ionic surface coatings for controlling doping and interfacial electric fields in nanoparticle assemblies; (2) organic-functionalized semiconducting nanoparticles to drive spatially controlled photochemical polymerizations; and (3) nanoparticles with multicomponent nanoscale inorganic coatings for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. These research efforts will be student-driven, with continued focus on scientific career training for female and minority students, and will take place in the scientifically rich, cutting-edge, multi-disciplinary environment at UC Santa Barbara. The graduate students working on the project will serve as mentors to undergraduate students, high school teachers, and high school students through NSF- and DoD-funded outreach programs and informal collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscale materials with useful electronic and light-absorbing properties, made using inexpensive and scalable chemical methods, could positively impact important industries ranging from energy conversion, electronics, and catalysis to use in chemical sensing, biotechnology and health care. In order to achieve the societal benefits associated with such a transformation, we are working to synthetically control, using molecules and inorganic coatings, the way in which electrons move and interact in this emerging class of materials. These research efforts will be student-driven, with continued focus on scientific career training for female and minority students, and will take place in the scientifically rich, cutting-edge, multi-disciplinary environment at UC Santa Barbara. The graduate students working on the project will serve as mentors to undergraduate students, high school teachers, and high school students through NSF- and DoD-funded outreach programs and informal collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
