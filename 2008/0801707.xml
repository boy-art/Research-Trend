    <AbstractNarration>Demand for fuel is increasing, while petroleum production levels are near their peak and there is a growing awareness of the problem of greenhouse gas generation. Alternative, renewable, and sustainable energy sources will be needed to meet future energy demands. Biofuels, produced from plant-based materials, are an attractive option. However, the biofuels industry must be developed in an integrated manner so that the goals of economic, environmental, and sociological sustainability are achieved. This will require a new generation of scientists and engineers who understand the entire spectrum of biorefining technology and also appreciate the ecological, economic, and social impacts of their technological decisions. Similarly, economists with exposure to the technological aspects of the biorefining industry will be better poised to develop accurate policies. Such interdisciplinary training does not currently exist. This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the development of the Integrated Graduate Education in Biorefining and Biofuels program, which will prepare PhD graduates to have a comprehensive perspective on the biofuels industry. Four focus areas define this integrated and comprehensive training: crop sciences and plant biotechnology; biomass conversions; product engineering; and economic and environmental assessment. This program incorporates cross-disciplinary teamwork, coursework in multiple disciplines, and research projects that span focus areas. The program will work to increase the numbers underrepresented students receiving doctoral degrees in science, technology, and engineering, and will include a collaboration with Colorado State-Pueblo. Graduates of this IGERT program will be uniquely prepared to have high-impact careers and to contribute to the biofuels industry. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
