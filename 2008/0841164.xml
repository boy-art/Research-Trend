    <AbstractNarration>The Creating Momentum through Communicating Mathematics GK-12 project will enrich the mathematical experiences of graduate student Fellows from San Francisco State University, as well as teachers and students from four San Francisco public schools. A key goal is to strengthen Fellows' communication, teaching, outreach, and teamwork skills by immersing them in mathematics classrooms and the San Francisco Math Circle (an after-school program). A second key goal is to make mathematics, especially algebra, and its career connections more relevant and explicit for 6-12 grade teachers and students. The project will enhance the preparation of Fellows for Ph.D. programs, particularly among underrepresented minorities. The project contributes to meeting societal demand for mathematicians who can explain their work and its significance, not only to each other, but to the general public. By developing mathematics seminars focused on communicating research, the model provides innovative strategies for invigorating mathematics education in graduate school. Moreover, it serves middle and high schools needs for making algebra more accessible and relevant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our project will integrate graduate research with math teaching at middle and high schools. It will strengthen the recruitment of underrepresented minorities into our M.A. program, as well as their preparation for and entry into Ph.D. programs. Our project will result in institutionalization of two new courses. By working with the California State Universities and with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, broad dissemination of the project's partnership model involving graduate students, teachers, mathematicians, and 6-12 grade students will be ensured.</AbstractNarration>
