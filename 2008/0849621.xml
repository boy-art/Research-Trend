    <AbstractNarration>This 3 year REU site program entitled Bioengineering at Saint Louis University (BE@SLU) will engage undergraduate students in research experiences in the field of bioengineering. Faculty from the Departments of Biomedical Engineering, Pharmacological and Physiological Sciences, Orthopedic Surgery, and Psychology will collaborate in this program. During the first week of the program students will receive training in bioengineering research, including discussions about how to do research, journal club-like activities, research group discussions, equipment training and safety training. In addition to the research experience, students will participate in tours of local bioengineering facilities, discussion of engineering career options, and a research training component. This research training will include both how to read and how to write a scientific paper, how to stay current with research topics in the literature, and how to set goals for their research project. At the end of the program, the students will present their project results at the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) and/or the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) annual conferences, in peer-reviewed publications, and online through the BE@SLU website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to expose early career students to options in bioengineering research and industry, who might not otherwise have the opportunity so early in their career. Recruitment efforts will be targeted to local high school seniors, who will be entering college, students at schools with limited research programs, and at community colleges. This project will evaluate whether the exposure of these early career students to bioengineering research and industrial career options will impact their future career choices, including choosing a major and post-university career options.</AbstractNarration>
