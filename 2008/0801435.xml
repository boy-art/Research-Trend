    <AbstractNarration>Remote detection using microcantilever based sensor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a highly sensitive and reliable sensor module for detection of analytes in harsh environments in air and liquid media. The approach uses a resonant microcantilever sensor with integrated deflection transducer. The cantilever will operate in a vacuum enclosure interacting electrostatically with external functionalization layers that adsorb analyte molecules in air or liquid media and result in a change in surface potential. This approach has the potential for wide ranging applications in defense and homeland security, industrial process monitoring, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed structure utilizes a non-contact detection method allowing the functionalization layer to be separated from the resonant microcantilever, which can be enclosed in vacuum leading to a dramatic increase in its sensitivity and reliability. A GaN microcantilever integrated with an AlGaN/GaN piezoresistive deflection transducer results in a highly sensitive sensor suitable for operation in harsh environments. The usage of AlGaN/GaN epitaxial layers grown on Si wafer leads to possibility of integrating the resonant sensor, transducer, and signal transmitter on a chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational and outreach activities of the project include development of a graduate course on microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors, involvement of undergraduate and high school students in research activities, minority recruitment, and development of a highly informative website on MEMS based sensing. The research activities will also involve industrial collaborations that can open up exciting new applications of III-V Nitrides leading to significant economic impacts.</AbstractNarration>
