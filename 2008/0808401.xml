    <AbstractNarration>Why do species differ? Scientists have long hypothesized that ecological pressures drive species to play different roles through the action of natural selection. This study seeks to test the role of ecology in driving a group of lizards to adopt an astonishing array of lifestyles and body forms. With a combination of genetic, statistical, and field techniques, the investigators will calculate the rate of evolution in lizards that evolved with high versus low levels of ecological opportunity. If lizards with more ecological opportunity evolved faster, we may conclude that ecological conditions regulate diversification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anolis lizards are a model system for the evolution of diversification, but this study is the first of its kind. The investigators will employ novel and more powerful statistical techniques to detect differences in the rate of evolution. Also, data from this study (representing over 350 species) will placed into public repositories so that others may use them to further explore evolutionary patterns. The lizard genus Anolis has been featured widely in textbooks and public media to educate about evolution, and the findings of this study will improve public understanding of evolutionary concepts. In addition, undergraduates will participate in the research project.</AbstractNarration>
