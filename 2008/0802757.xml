    <AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support Dr. Michael Glascock and his colleagues will continue the operation of the Archaeometry Laboratory at the University of Missouri Research Reactor Center (MURR). The MURR Archaeometry Laboratory is one of the most comprehensive US-based laboratories dedicated to chemical characterization studies of archaeological materials. The MURR laboratory is widely recognized around the world for its leading role in chemical characterization and interpretation of archaeometric data. The analytical techniques available at MURR include neutron activation analysis (NAA), inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) of solutions using high resolution and quadrupole instruments, laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS), and conventional- and portable-XRF. These multi-elemental techniques permit the quantification of major, minor and trace elements simultaneously and with a high degree of accuracy and precision in a wide range of archaeological materials. The MURR laboratory also plays an important role in training students in the analytical techniques for application to specific archaeological questions. Frequently, archaeology students are invited to spend time on site visiting the Missouri laboratory where they are taught a variety of methods for interpreting archaeological data and have direct access to the large compositional databases containing more than 90,000 previous analyses of pottery, obsidian, basalt, and chert by INAA, ICP-MS, and XRF. Online access to these databases is continuing to be developed and improved for integration with databases from other laboratories. MURR laboratory staff and students are also involved in efforts to rescue of compositional databases from laboratories no longer in operation. In addition to continued support of student and senior archaeology research projects, Dr. Glascock will also work toward the development of calibration standards and analytical procedures that facilitate the integration of data from multiple analytical techniques (e.g., INAA, ICP-MS, XRF). These efforts will benefit both new and mature analytical programs involved in archaeometric compositional analysis research. Dr. Glascock and his colleagues also will continue to oversee the development and application of LA-ICP-MS to archaeological materials and will facilitate the development of portable-XRF for archaeometric research. The broader impacts of this grant are that elemental data generated in collaboration with colleagues and students will be used to address important topics related to human and social dynamics of prehistoric peoples and societies, such as, mobility patterns and migrations of people, cultural responses to conflict and stress, community social organization, the development of craft production and specialization, and the creation and maintenance of social boundaries and identity. Compositional data will also be used improve our understanding concerning changes in ancient technology and provide insight into prehistoric diet and nutrition.</AbstractNarration>
