    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Andrey Vilesov of the University of Southern California, together with his graduate student researchers, will study the aggregation of atomic and molecular species in ultracold, superfluid helium droplets. Species to be studied include metal atoms, methane, water, ammonia, hydrogen chloride and parahydrogen clusters, among others. Cluster sizes span the range from a few atoms/molecules to tens of millions of solute species. The goal of these studies is to investigate how molecules interact with each other and with this rather unusual solvent over a wide range of size. The experiments will be carried out in the gas phase with mass spectrometric and laser spectroscopic methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate aim of research like this is to learn about new ways in which matter can interact in a highly unusual environment. The large clusters to be studied in this work are intermediate between molecular and bulk (mesoscale) and are predicted to have unusual properties. The very large helium droplets that Vilesov proposes studying may be useful vehicles for making interesting kinds of new materials. Students working with Prof. Vilesov will receive excellent training in a number of areas of high-technology -- including lasers, vacuum science and electronics. Prof. Vilesov has a strong history of international collaboration, and this will likely continue with this work.</AbstractNarration>
