    <AbstractNarration>The Education Development Center is carrying out a research and development project related to a set of professional development materials previously developed with support from the National Science Foundation. The materials, Math for All (MFA), are for the professional development of teachers who teach elementary school students with disabilities. The current project has three distinct components. 1) Conduct a qualitative study on the way the facilitators use the professional development materials. 2) Based on that study develop resources for teacher leaders and other facilitators of professional development. These resources include a Facilitator Case Book, a model for facilitator institutes, and a model for continued on-line support for facilitators. 3) Conduct an experimental study, using a randomized controlled trial model, to determine the effectiveness of these resources.</AbstractNarration>
