    <AbstractNarration>Howard University is requesting CREST resources for proposed CREST Phase 2, operation as the CREST Nanoscale Analytical Sciences Research and Education Center. In Phase 2 the CREST Center focuses on four basic Subproject areas including: (1) the characterization and measurement of the molecular composition and structural factors dictating the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials, (2) surface enhanced separation, identification and metrology of nanomolecular species in complex systems, (3) the fabrication and characterization of nanostructured materials and films for nanoscale separation, high resolution microscopy and infrared detection, and (4) development and transfer of education technology utilizing nanomaterials and nanodevice technology as tools. This research has the intellectual merit of providing the basic knowledge for elucidating chemistry at the nanoscale, and creates the analytical chemistry knowledge-base underpinning advances in nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;The rationale for the above focus of activities is that for the foreseeable future, nanoscience and engineering will continue to create frontiers for interdisciplinary research in nanomaterials, bionanotechnology, environmental science, and nanoelectronics. Executing leading-edge research in these areas will require analytical chemistry research as a pivotal discipline for advancement. Research outputs will be integrated with education to develop a modernized nanoscale analytical sciences doctoral program to provide the broader impact of educating future generations of minority characterization scientists for careers in the US nanotechnology enterprise. The CREST Center?s strategic plan for sustainment beyond Phase 2 is the continued validation of its pivotal role in the accomplishment of Howard University?s major education and research goals. This achievement is providing momentum for underpinning the launching of a Howard University NanoTechnology Initiative, which targets the provision of funding beyond NSF Phase 2. The strategy also includes expanding multi-year research funded partnerships with corporations; obtaining intellectual property in subproject areas; and initiating CREST faculty participation in SBIR programs.</AbstractNarration>
