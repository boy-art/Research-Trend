    <AbstractNarration>This award is to provide support for student participation at the 9th International Conference on Carbonaceous Particles in the Atmosphere (ICCPA), to be held on August 12-14, 2008 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA. ICCPA is dedicated to studying carbonaceous aerosols and provides the forum to highlight new results and insights into the role that carbonaceous aerosols play on climate as well as health. The 9th ICCPA is being held on the 30th anniversary of the first conference that was held in 1978 in Berkeley. The award is primarily to provide for travel assistance for students, and in special circumstances, young scientists with relevant presentations, who cannot otherwise attend the conference.</AbstractNarration>
