    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EPS-0814361&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Plan ?Building Oklahoma?s Leadership Role in Cellulosic Bioenergy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Oklahoma State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals: With this Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) grant, Oklahoma EPSCoR will develop a research program on cellulosic biofuels and will bring it to a nationally competitive level. The science theme is a multi-institutional program that adds value to the Oklahoma Bioenergy Center (OBC), a $40 million program to pursue the application of biofuels R&amp;D in cellulosic ethanol production. The RII will also support a robust education outreach program to nurture Oklahoma?s human resource infrastructure. The scientific, diversity, communications and human resource outreach activities proposed here, along with a cyberinfrastructure plan, are closely aligned with Oklahoma?s Strategic Plan for Science and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The science theme consists of three objectives addressing critical issues in developing the cellulosic bioenergy industry. One objective concentrates on establishing a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of biomass development to improve yield potential while enhancing the tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. The other two objectives are focused on the molecular mechanisms for efficient microbial conversion and new catalytic/thermochemical processes for converting cellulosic biomass to liquid fuels. Proposed RII funding will provide the support to build a critical mass of scientists enabling Oklahoma to compete for large-scale NSF funding in programs of sustainable energy and biotechnology. Through NSF and state support, and the investments in new faculty and staff by the research institutions, Oklahoma plans to reach national prominence in the research area of cellulosic biofuels. This will facilitate efforts to develop major research centers and enhance private sector R&amp;D in the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The PIs propose comprehensive educational and outreach programs, links to economic development, and to initiatives designed to enhance public awareness of the importance of science. K-12 students and teachers will be exposed to cutting-edge science and cyberinfrastructure related to the bioenergy theme through summer technology academies, mobile science vehicles, and teacher training workshops. Undergraduate student research experiences in industry and academia will be supported and talented students will be recruited into biofuels/bioenergy based graduate programs. A state-wide cyberinfrastructure consortium will also be established. The education outreach initiatives embrace the inclusion of women and underrepresented groups and strengthen competitiveness and diversity through collaboration with Oklahoma?s HBCU and tribal college, by facilitating the transition from high school to college, providing culture-attuned counseling support, and promoting enhancement programs to retain students pursuing STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
