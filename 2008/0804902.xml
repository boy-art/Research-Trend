    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex electron systems with unusual properties, such as magnetism and superconductivity or large resistivity in a magnetic field, promise revolutionary technological applications. A unifying characteristic of these systems is the capability of exhibiting spectacular and unexpected phenomena arising from the interplay and competition of several intrinsic properties such as charge, crystal structure and magnetism. Unraveling the details of this interplay will help us understand the physics behind the functionality of complex materials. This project pursues the objectives of growing novel oxide materials and studying them in-situ with optical and x-ray techniques. Studies of previously characterized systems will also be made for comparison. The different tasks and project activities are designed with the goals to reach out to undergraduate and high school students, contribute to science infrastructure and integrate science and education. Educational/research programs will be available to allow the participation of students ranging from high school to graduate level. Intellectual infrastructure of this project is expected to aid in the development of new magnetic and superconducting devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transition metal oxides such as cuprate high temperature superconductors and colossal magnetoresistive manganites are prototypical complex electron systems with unusual properties promising revolutionary technological applications. A unifying characteristic of these systems is the capability of exhibiting spectacular and unexpected phenomena arising from the interplay and competition of several intrinsic properties such as charge, lattice and spin. Unraveling the details of this interplay will consolidate our understanding of the physics at play behind the functionality of complex materials. This project pursues two main objectives, namely the carrying out of 1) the growth with Molecular Beam Epitaxy and in-situ Angle Resolved Photoemission studies of binary oxides, Fe3O4, VOx, EuO and V2O3, which will function as models systems for studying the many-body physics at play in more complex materials, and 2) time-resolved photoemission experiments on well-characterized systems, either with ultrafast optical techniques and/or x-rays, or whose nature of the interactions has already been extensively investigated with static measurements. The accomplishment of these goals on well-characterized systems will form a solid body of experience for extending the project to more complex materials. The different tasks and project activities are designed with the goals to reach out to undergraduate and high school students, contribute to science infrastructure and integrate science and education. Educational/research programs will be available to allow the participation of students ranging from high school to graduate level. Intellectual infrastructure of this project is expected to aid in the development of new magnetic and superconducting devices.</AbstractNarration>
