    <AbstractNarration>Kinderlehrer&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0806703&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Mesoscale phenomena in physical and biological systems&lt;br/&gt;assume prominence when an intermediate length or time scale is&lt;br/&gt;required to assess gross system behavior or when the finer active&lt;br/&gt;scales cannot be directly interrogated. These systems are&lt;br/&gt;frequently metastable. Two broad areas for investigation have&lt;br/&gt;been identified directly from potential application: texture&lt;br/&gt;development dependent on interfacial properties of polycrystals&lt;br/&gt;and diffusion mediated transport with application to ensembles of&lt;br/&gt;molecular motors. A central materials science problem is to&lt;br/&gt;engineer a microstructure to attain a desired set of&lt;br/&gt;characteristics. The group of the investigator has discovered a&lt;br/&gt;new characterization of material texture, the description of a&lt;br/&gt;polycrystal in terms of its geometry and crystallography, called&lt;br/&gt;the grain boundary character distribution, which is found to be&lt;br/&gt;correlated to interfacial energy. A main objective of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to explain this characterization employing large scale&lt;br/&gt;simulation and analysis and stochastic analysis. Geometric&lt;br/&gt;coarsening is also studied. The goal of the second part of the&lt;br/&gt;project is to develop appropriate modeling and analytical methods&lt;br/&gt;to understand how molecular motors function in various&lt;br/&gt;circumstances, and in particular, to examine various&lt;br/&gt;transformation pathways and transduction scenarios. This&lt;br/&gt;involves mass transport theory among other new directions in&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear analysis. Understanding the predictive character of&lt;br/&gt;large scale simulations of metastable systems used to interrogate&lt;br/&gt;and model physical and biological systems is an emerging&lt;br/&gt;fundamental challenge for mathematical/computational science. It&lt;br/&gt;is a coarse graining or upscaling question at the informational&lt;br/&gt;level. The goal of this project is to address this challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project has two related parts. Most engineered&lt;br/&gt;materials arise as polycrystalline microstructures, composed of a&lt;br/&gt;myriad of small crystallites, called grains, separated by&lt;br/&gt;interfaces, called grain boundaries. The energetics and&lt;br/&gt;connectivity of this network of boundaries are implicated in many&lt;br/&gt;properties across all scales of use, from nanoscale medicine and&lt;br/&gt;electronics to aircraft structures. A new characterization of&lt;br/&gt;material texture is now available, the grain boundary character&lt;br/&gt;distribution, discovered very recently in the group of the&lt;br/&gt;investigator. It is as if each material leaves a unique&lt;br/&gt;footprint in the microscope. A project objective is to explain&lt;br/&gt;this distribution by simulation and innovative mathematical&lt;br/&gt;analysis in order to provide materials engineers with a&lt;br/&gt;predictive tool. Eukaryotic intracellular traffic owes to a&lt;br/&gt;network of molecular motors moving on cytoskeletal or actin&lt;br/&gt;filaments. This is the second part. The ability to successfully&lt;br/&gt;transduce chemical energy to motion owes to functional elements&lt;br/&gt;and relations in the system. These are modeled and analyzed. &lt;br/&gt;The opportunity to discover the interplay between chemistry and&lt;br/&gt;mechanics and to elaborate the implications of metastability&lt;br/&gt;could not offer a more exciting venue.</AbstractNarration>
