    <AbstractNarration>The PI has developed two prototype magnetic levitation systems with novel designs, which provide unprecedented extended motion ranges in addition to the many advantages of magnetic levitation for 6 degree-of-freedom haptic human-machine interaction (such as mechanical simplicity, absence of friction and backlash, and high impedance range and control bandwidths). The first device uses a novel coil and magnet configuration to approximately double the translation and triple the rotation range of previous Lorentz force levitation devices in all directions (increasing the motion volume 8 times and reachable orientations 27 times). The second device is a modular system to levitate a platform of one or more magnets above a planar array of 5 or more cylindrical coils, which provides a planar motion range extendable to any area (by increasing the size of the coil array) and a potentially unlimited rotation range (the current prototype uses 10 coils to levitate one magnet with a motion range of 60x80 mm in the horizontal plane, 30 mm vertical, and 30 degrees of roll and pitch rotation). .In this project the PI will extend the performance capabilities of two magnetic levitation systems in terms of their motion and impedance ranges, control bandwidths, and accuracy, through new modeling, control, and computation methods. He will formulate and implement novel haptic simulation methods to benefit from the unique capabilities of the new devices for task-specific simulated environments including surgical simulation and other haptic skill tasks. And he will evaluate the resulting haptic interaction systems in terms of the realism of the haptic perception by users and system effectiveness for haptic training and task performance. The PI's overall objective in this work is to bring to bear topics in electromagnetic analysis, multivariable nonlinear dynamic control, computational methods, haptic modeling and real-time physical simulation methods, and human haptic perception and task performance, in order to improve the fidelity and effectiveness of human-machine haptic interaction using magnetic levitation devices. The PI's hypothesis is that application of the proposed methods will lead to significant measurable improvements in haptic perception, interaction, and task performance, both for general human-machine interaction and in specific applications such as training of haptic medical skills and upper-limb rehabilitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The realization of magnetic levitation systems with extended translation and rotation ranges in all directions (Lorentz device) and/or easily extensible translation in horizontal directions and unlimited rotation (planar device), will provide dramatic benefits in a wide range of domains including robotic manipulation, fine positioning and orientation, automation, materials handling and processing, force and vibration control, and camera and antenna pointing not to mention entertainment. High-fidelity haptic interaction will also have application to the study of psychophysical human haptic perception, and to the display of complex multidimensional abstract data. The new technologies will provide exciting opportunities to teach physics and engineering concepts at any level in a memorable, intuitive way; to this end, the PI will develop educational materials with haptic magnetic levitation demonstrations and simulations, which will be made available to complement materials already in development in robotics areas for university classes and secondary schools.</AbstractNarration>
