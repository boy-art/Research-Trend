    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop methods for vibration analysis and control of complex built-up frame structures. There has been an increasing interest in active vibration control due to the increasing demands for mechanical structures to be lighter and faster - lighter and faster structures are more prone to vibrations. The conventional modal vibration approach is greatly challenged when solving complex practical vibration problems due to the increased model uncertainty caused by the increased complexity of structures and the unavoidable spillover problems caused by modal truncation. In this study, a wave centered view of structures is proposed for vibration analysis and control of complex practical built-up structures. This research consists of theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and experimental verification. Deliverables include exact closed form solutions to vibration problems in planar and three-dimensional frame structures; ?active support? and ?active joint? design strategies for absorbing incoming vibration waves or shunting unwanted vibrations to less important structural members; and guidelines for designing complex periodical frame structures from vibration attenuation viewpoint. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide practical solutions to vibrations in built-up frame structures and bridge a gap between academic research and real solutions to real world problems. The related experience will be brought back to the classroom for teaching and training the next generation of civil and mechanical engineers. A course on ?Wave Approach in Vibration Analysis and Control? will also be developed to reach engineers from local industry. Furthermore, this research allows the direct participation of undergraduate and graduate students. Hence, this research not only develops a cost-effective, convenient, and practical approach in vibration analysis and control of complex built-up structures, but also provides a vehicle for educating a broad spectrum of students and engineers, in the difficulties associated with suppressing vibrations in complex practical structures.</AbstractNarration>
