    <AbstractNarration>The comprehensive chemistry of precipitation, stream and lake water within the Hubbard Brook Valley of the White Mountains of New Hampshire is the longest continuous record (45 years) of this type in the world. The proposed research would extend this unique record to 50 years and beyond. The main objective of this research is to apply these long-term data to important questions related to biogeochemical change in northern hardwood forest and associated aquatic ecosystems. For example, these long-term data will be used to quantify and evaluate the response to and recovery from disturbance such as acid rain, forest harvesting, ice or wind-storm damage, salinization of surface waters from road deicers, and experimental watershed-ecosystem manipulations. Acid rain was discovered in North America at Hubbard Brook and is a serious, ongoing environmental problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such carefully documented, high-quality long-term data are crucial to decision-makers searching for solutions to major and persistent environmental problems. It is known from these long-term studies that legacies of disturbance, such as from forest cutting, last longer than 40 years. A larger goal of this long-term research is to help transform the way people view and value the importance of watersheds and the quality of surface waters and air passing over these watersheds in their daily lives. Researchers will share the long-term data from this project with the public, educators and policy makers and assist with their interpretation and evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
