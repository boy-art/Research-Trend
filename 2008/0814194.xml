    <AbstractNarration>The Kentucky (KY) EPSCoR RII-7 proposal unites eight institutions, University of Kentucky, Berea College, Centre College of Kentucky, Kentucky State University, Morehead State University, Northern Kentucky University, University of Louisville, and Eastern Kentucky University, to continue the strategy of investing in infrastructure to develop Kentucky?s ?New Economy? by supporting research in Innovative Materials and Devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue two major research initiatives. Initiative in Innovative Materials and Devices is focused on studies of bulk single-crystal transition metal oxides and epitaxial thin films with complementary functionalities, and applications of multilayered thin films for molecular electrodes as well as for single-molecule magnets. The other part of the project will focus on engineering new platforms to enhance our understanding of a single cell or multiple cell types, interactions between individual cells and cell types, and sensing at the molecular, intracellular and intercellular levels. A statewide Micro/Nano Network will advance micro/nanotechnology and the many fields that utilize this technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kentucky EPSCoR has developed a comprehensive plan for increasing diversity and evaluating progress in that area. Programs such as seed-funding that supports research at regional institutions and a program to involve diverse populations of Kentucky students in research will be supported through EPSCoR. A special program for computer science graduate students at Kentucky State University will be introduced. Kentucky EPSCoR also proposes the cyberinfrastructure plans for the state, and augments them with support for increasing the expertise and developing new sources of talent. The project is consistent with the state?s science and technology plan, and the associated higher education plan. The project will develop new facilities and establish new faculty and staff positions in the bio-, nano-, &amp; cyber-technology areas. Kentucky EPSCoR has developed a review process intended to identify infrastructure that should support the most promising research. A system of evaluation metrics has been developed to determine whether a strategy is working, and if it is improving Kentucky?s competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>
