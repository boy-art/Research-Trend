    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase II research is focused on methods to utilize blood precursor cells derived from human embryonic stem (HES) cells. The project uses a new defined differentiation system which allows automation and scale-up production of this important cells. There is a significant demand for these cells from research and drug discovery. Increased availability and batch-to-batch reproducibility of HES cell-derived blood cells, resulting from the defined genetic background of the starting material and this standardized, automated culture system, make this technology invaluable model systems for basic research and drug development. Based on the automated pilot system for handling and scale-up production of HES cells developed in phase I of this SBIR project we will transfer our current culturing protocols into robust automated production procedures to provide a reproducible quality of CD34 positive cells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research will be improving the process of drug discovery and development and in the long term by providing revolutionary new applications for medical treatment to improve public health. Nearly 98% of a multi-million dollar stem cell market is currently consumed by blood and immune system treatments. We anticipate that the proposed research will lead to the faster integration of HES cell biology into biomedical research. It will help to provide a variety of other blood cell types in quantities required for basic research, drug development, high throughput screening, biochemical characterization and potential medical treatment of blood related disease.</AbstractNarration>
