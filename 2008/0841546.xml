    <AbstractNarration>The proposed work seeks to improve the currently incomplete understanding of factors that determine, and may limit, plants' maximal rates of photosynthesis and productivity. By combining physiological and anatomical assessments, it will be tested whether there is a fundamental relationship between the maximum rate of plant photosynthesis and specific anatomical features that may be determinants of the capacity of leaves' sugar-exporting (phloem) vessels. Sugar export may sometimes present a bottleneck to carbon distribution throughout the plant and thus to plant productivity. In particular, leaf loading vein density and the ratio of loading cells per exporting phloem vessel will be assessed in species with different mechanisms of phloem loading. If a relationship between photosynthetic capacity and phloem features can be established, these features will be available to: (i) identify plant species and varieties with superior photosynthetic performance and productivity; (ii) inform future engineering efforts directed at manipulating these anatomical features to enhance plant productivity. It will furthermore be established whether features such as high loading vein density are associated with enhanced productivity under dry conditions and/or cool temperatures. If such an advantage can be established, this will aid in the selection of plants with superior productivity in warm/arid regions that are expanding under global climate change and at higher latitudes and altitudes into which crop cultivation is expanding under the present global warming trend and where plants will experience seasonal exposure to colder than usual temperatures. The knowledge gained from this work will aid in the effort to maintain, and improve, crop productivity as well as carbon sequestration, which are urgent goals given the burgeoning human population as well as the current and projected impact of climate change. Furthermore, the PIs will utilize their existing connections to recruit students from diverse backgrounds into the proposed research and resulting publication/dissemination efforts as well as for outreach efforts. Lastly, the PIs are planning to continue their publication activity in venues reaching a broad audience including non-specialists.</AbstractNarration>
