    <AbstractNarration>Emerging computing technologies have made it possible to manufacture&lt;br/&gt;large-scale embedded multi-agent systems, from vast sensor networks to&lt;br/&gt;modular robots and smart materials. A key challenge is understanding&lt;br/&gt;how to program such systems at the individual agent level in order to&lt;br/&gt;achieve system-level behavior that is complex, fault-tolerant, and&lt;br/&gt;adapts to the environment. One source of inspiration is multicellular&lt;br/&gt;biological systems (tissues, organs, and simple organisms) that&lt;br/&gt;achieve complex self-adaptation in changing environments through the&lt;br/&gt;distributed cooperation and sensing of vast numbers of cells. Such&lt;br/&gt;systems can provide novel bio-inspired principles for the design and&lt;br/&gt;programming of multi-agent systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates new computational paradigms for programming&lt;br/&gt;multi-agent robotic systems to achieve complex self-adaptation in&lt;br/&gt;response to the environment. The two main thrusts are: (a) the&lt;br/&gt;development of a global-to-local programming methodology for&lt;br/&gt;describing complex global adaptation goals and automatically deriving&lt;br/&gt;provably robust multi-agent control (b) the development of a&lt;br/&gt;tissue-inspired modular robotic system that can demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;self-adaptive structures. A key source of inspiration is the&lt;br/&gt;decentralized control strategies that cells use to achieve&lt;br/&gt;environment-responsive structures and functions, e.g. shape adaptation&lt;br/&gt;in plants and vascular networks, and locomotion in simple animals. The&lt;br/&gt;aim is to harness these bio-inspired principles to create multi-agent&lt;br/&gt;robotic systems that replicate the adaptability and responsiveness of&lt;br/&gt;living systems. This work has broad application, from robust control&lt;br/&gt;in distributed sensor-actuator networks to the development of&lt;br/&gt;self-adapting architectural structures and prosthetics. This research&lt;br/&gt;significantly advances our understanding of how to design autonomous&lt;br/&gt;multi-agent computing systems that can self-organize, self-repair, and&lt;br/&gt;respond to the environment.</AbstractNarration>
