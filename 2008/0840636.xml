    <AbstractNarration>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the world?s energy frontier accelerator and together with the associated largest detectors ever constructed, will allow for the probing of the seminal questions in high energy physics. This proposal will provide a unique opportunity for early career graduate students involved in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC to be involved at CERN for the start of data taking. About ten high qualified students per year (a new set of approximately ten for each of three years) will be selected to receive travel awards affording them the opportunity to be present at CERN during the early running of the LHC, which is expected to start operations in the Fall of 2008. It is necessary for a complete education for graduate students that they be able to have hands-on experience in the operation of the experiment, and these prestigious travel awards will assure that the very best students from NSF core program funded institutions are able to have this once in a lifetime experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regard to broader impact, the recipients of these awards will also further the goals of recognizing and attracting underrepresented groups to the sciences, fostering international exchange, and bringing the excitement of cutting edge scientific research to a younger generation as they bring back their experiences to their campuses, interact with undergraduates in REU programs and with high school students and teachers in QuarkNet and other programs.</AbstractNarration>
