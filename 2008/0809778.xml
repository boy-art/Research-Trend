    <AbstractNarration>The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the research of Geoffrey W. Coates of Cornell University on the synthesis of new polymers with reduced environmental impact via 1) the development of new procedures that reduce energy consumption, the use of non-renewable resources (fossil fuels), or the generation of chemical waste and 2) the synthesis of polymers that are easily recycled and/or biodegraded. The new biodegradable polymers (polyesters, polycarbonates, polyethers, and polyolefins) are synthesized using a wide range of catalysts (zinc, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, etc.). Characterizational studies enable the researchers to understand the structural and kinetic aspects associated with the catalysts and the polymerization process. Professor Coates has been actively involved in introducing polymer chemistry to large organic chemistry courses. He and his group conduct demonstrations for K-12 students and teachers at the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR) and at the annual Expand Your Horizons Program for 7th-9th grade girls. The Coates' group also works closely with a small company to commercialize some of their biodegradable materials. News pieces on his synthesis of plastics from CO2 and orange oil have appeared on CNN, ABC, and the BBC, as well as in the New York Times and Esquire Magazine.</AbstractNarration>
