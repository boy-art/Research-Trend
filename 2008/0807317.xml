    <AbstractNarration>Olver&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807317&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The aim of this project is to further develop and extend the&lt;br/&gt;range of applications of the investigator's equivariant method of&lt;br/&gt;moving frames, for both finite-dimensional and&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional group actions. The specific areas of&lt;br/&gt;research in the proposal are as follows: Development of&lt;br/&gt;computational algorithms for differential invariant algebras,&lt;br/&gt;with particular emphasis on methods for determining minimal&lt;br/&gt;generating sets; exploitation of the invariant variational&lt;br/&gt;calculus based on moving frames to analyze minimizers of&lt;br/&gt;invariant variational problems and the behavior of invariant&lt;br/&gt;submanifold flows, focusing on the evolution of differential&lt;br/&gt;invariants and their signatures; algorithms for analyzing the&lt;br/&gt;structure of symmetry pseudo-groups, their use in classifying and&lt;br/&gt;finding explicit solutions to nonlinear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, with applications in fluid mechanics, gauge theories,&lt;br/&gt;integrable systems, and meteorological models; further&lt;br/&gt;development of practical tools for object recognition and&lt;br/&gt;symmetry detection in digital images based on differential&lt;br/&gt;invariant and joint invariant signature methods; and exploration&lt;br/&gt;and application of new invariant numerical algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;integrating nonlinear differential equations and approximating&lt;br/&gt;differential invariants such as curvatures, torsion, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Exploitation of symmetry, equivalence and invariance&lt;br/&gt;properties remains one of the most important mathematical methods&lt;br/&gt;for tackling the complex nonlinear systems that arise in a wide&lt;br/&gt;variety of applications. The investigator's reformulation of the&lt;br/&gt;geometrically-based method of moving frames has led to a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of new and, as yet, underexploited computational tools, as&lt;br/&gt;well as new and unexpected areas of application, including&lt;br/&gt;computer vision, recognition and surveillance, materials science&lt;br/&gt;and physical gauge theories, fluid mechanics, interface flows,&lt;br/&gt;DNA mechanics, relativity, and elsewhere. The project continues&lt;br/&gt;to develop this powerful new approach to analyzing very general&lt;br/&gt;group actions and their invariants, directly driven by current&lt;br/&gt;needs in these areas of application.</AbstractNarration>
