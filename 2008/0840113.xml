    <AbstractNarration>The American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) is organizing the first Pan American Congress on Plants and BioEnergy to be held June 22 -25, 2008 in Merida, Mexico. This ASPB satellite meeting will be held jointly with the Plant Biochemistry Section of the Biochemical Society of Mexico (SMB/BBMP). The goal of this meeting is to bring together governmental policy makers and science administrators along with plant biologists, agronomists, microbiologists, economists and ecologists to discuss issues related to bioenergy security including sustainability, environment and economy. This congress is designed to initiate Pan-American collaborations and to learn first hand from those who have already made great progress towards energy independence. The Congress on Plants and Bioernergy provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate students and young investigators to meet and interact with experts representing the different domains of bioenergy, from biological research to policy and economics. The funding provided by NSF helps defray the costs of participation of students and young investigators from the U.S. scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
