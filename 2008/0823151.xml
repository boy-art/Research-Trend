    <AbstractNarration>Matthew J. Wawersik&lt;br/&gt;IOS-0823151&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of Drosophila germ cell sex determination and male germline stem cell niche development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Germ cells are the only cells that produce the sperm and eggs required for sexual reproduction. Proper germline development is, therefore, critical for survival of the next generation. Two important steps in this process are the decision made by germ cells to develop as male or female so they produce either sperm or eggs, and the ability of these cells to develop into functional germline stem cells required for continuous gamete production. However, relatively little is know about the cellular and molecular mechanism regulating these processes. Through genetic and molecular analyses in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, the Wawersik lab is working to define these mechanisms. As the basic process of germ cell development is remarkably similar in flies, mice and even humans, they expect that better understanding of these mechanisms will help determine how defects in germ cell development can cause infertility and germ cell tumors. Thus, work by the Wawersik lab has important implications for patients suffering from cancer and infertility. Furthermore, since this work is being performed by a research team at a primarily undergraduate institution, these studies provide an exciting and highly relevant backdrop to teach fundamental aspects of genetics, as well as cellular, molecular and developmental biology to the next generation of American scientists.</AbstractNarration>
