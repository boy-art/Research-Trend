    <AbstractNarration>Improved meteorological simulations for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) will be developed for further analysis of data from the 2006 MILAGRO (Megacity Initiative: Local Global and Research Observations) field campaign. The objective is to better understand meteorology and air pollution in the MCMA and regional effects of the MCMA plume. Satellite remote sensing data will be used to evaluate and improve numerical weather simulations, with a focus on urban impacts on local meteorology such as the urban heat island and urban-induced circulations. Data assimilation techniques will be used to improve the simulations and to better quantify uncertainties. Forward and backward trajectories based on the meteorological analyses will be used to evaluate mixing processes in the Mexico City basin and the impact of different source regions on air quality. Data on gas and aerosol phase concentrations will be combined with trajectory simulations to further identify possible source regions and to evaluate the strength of impacts from known sources, including industrial, volcanic, and biological. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will assist in the development of science-based environmental policies for Mexico City as well as provide insights into other urban areas worldwide. Visualization tools will be used to demonstrate air quality issues and to increase stakeholder participation through workshops and outreach activities with both government agencies and local academic and research institutions. The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students as well as research and mentoring opportunities for a graduate student and a post-doctoral researcher who will be involved in the analysis and modeling.</AbstractNarration>
