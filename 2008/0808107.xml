    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at North Carolina State University entitled, "PREPARES: Partnering Researchers and Educators to create Problem-based curricula that Adapt Research in Engineering for Students," under the direction of Drs. Ruben Carbonell and Valerie Brown-Schild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kenan Fellows Program for Curriculum and Leadership Development (KFP), will partner with North Carolina's New Schools Project (NCNSP) and HBCU Elizabeth City State University to expand the current, successful RET funded model to four of North Carolina's most economically disadvantaged school districts. Each summer for two consecutive years, four pairs of teachers (Fellows) paired with faculty mentors, from four of 10 high-need "STEM High Schools" being redesigned by NCNSP will particpate in a seven-week summer institute. The summer program will include participation in a research project, professional development and curriculum/instructional program design. The collaboration will continue during the academic year through the development and piloting of materials and participation in KFP activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During year three of the program the Fellows and Mentors will provide professional development to at least 40 additional STEM teachers from the NSNSP STEM High Schools, distribute high quality instructional materials that translate engineering research into high school curricula, and further extend project benefits through their exemplary leadership and mentorship. This project will impact a total of 64 STEM high school teachers.</AbstractNarration>
