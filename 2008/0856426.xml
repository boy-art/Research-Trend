    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to investigate the concept of new characteristic length scale by establishing its existence, its dependence on processing conditions, and its effects on surface morphologies. Crystalline nanorods are on the order of 100 nm in diameter, and many surface features have similar dimension. It is interesting to note that the origin of this dimension remains unknown while nanorods fabrication has become a routine practice. This project focuses on the very origin of this dimension. The hypothesis is that this dimension is characteristic of surface atomic islands that are bounded by multiple layers. Aiming to confirm this hypothesis, the proposed research uses density-functional-theory based ab initio calculations, classical molecular mechanics simulations, and lattice kinetic Monte Carlo simulations; and takes simple metals Cu and Au as the prototype materials. If successful, the established concept of new characteristic length scale on surfaces will represent a new addition to surface science. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to the benefit to scientific communities, the success of this award will also provide a new means of controlling surface roughness, or surface morphology in general. For example, understanding the complete set of surface characteristic length scales will enable science-based design of reading head of hard disk drives, that of crystalline nanorods, and that of catalysts for sustainable energy applications. The award will also provide an opportunity for the education of undergraduate and graduate students, including an underrepresented minority graduate student in this case.</AbstractNarration>
