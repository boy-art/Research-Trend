    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0828728&lt;br/&gt;Ma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among available therapeutic methods in cancer treatment, magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia emerges as a highly promising approach due to its simple implementation, low cost, and few complications. In this process, magnetic particles delivered to tissue or blood vessels induce heating when exposed to alternating magnetic fields. This localized heat generation leads to thermal damage to the tumor. The employment of nano-sized particles enables adequate amount of heat to be generated within tumor tissue without necessitating heat penetration through the skin surface, thus eliminating the consequent side effects of excessive collateral thermal damage. Although the versatility of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia in treating deep-seated/irregular shaped tumors is unsurpassed by traditional non-invasive heating approaches, this method is severely limited by the lack of controlling the temperature elevations during the process. The non-homogeneous temperature distribution and inadequate temperature elevation in tumor tissue may lead to inadequacy in killing tumor cells and/or damage to healthy tissue. Multiple-site injection of nanoparticles has great potential for achieving a desired temperature elevation throughout the entire tumor region, but requires optimized injection strategy including injection sites, injection amount, and injection rate. Therefore, in the proposed study an in vivo experimental study of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia on tumors implanted on mice and a multi-scale computational study of nanoparticle transport in biological tissue will be performed with the aims of advancing understanding of nanofluid transport in tumor and quantifying the heating patterns induced by these nanoparticles under various therapeutic conditions. The ultimate outcome of this project is the development of a global methodology for designing individualized treatment protocol for irregular shaped tumors. Intellectual Merit: The findings of this study will (1) significantly advance understanding of nanoparticle transport in tissue and magnetic nanoparticle-induced heating pattern in hyperthermia treatment of cancer; (2) provide a platform on which the effect of particle properties, tissue microstructures, and injection strategy on the migration of particles and heating patterns in tumors can be tested; (3) establish a database describing the dependence of thermally affected region on injection parameters; and (4) develop of an optimized treatment strategy using multi-site injection. The capability of quantifying the induced heating pattern by nanoparticles in tumors is an important advance that moves the treatment planning from an almost empirical trial-and-error approach to a science-based engineering methodology. Broader Impact: The proposed study will be integrated into our seminar series and curricula for disseminating bio-nanotechnology as well as educating and training students in an interdisciplinary setting. Both PIs have established track records of commitment for promoting underrepresented minority students in STEM fields. The funding will provide our students from diverse backgrounds with ample research opportunities to engage in experiential training. Transformative essence: This study will lead to a global methodology for designing an optimized, patient-specific treatment protocol for magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia with maximum treatment outcomes in clinical applications. The success of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia will offer cancer patients a low cost treatment method that has high tumor cell-killing potential and minimal complications. In addition, the study of nanoparticle migration in tissue will benefit the study of nanotoxicology and site-specific drug delivery using nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt; This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes (TTP) Program, the Biomedical Engineering (BME) Program, and the Fluid Dynamics (FD) Program, all of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division within the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).</AbstractNarration>
