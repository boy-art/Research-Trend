    <AbstractNarration>CBET- 0829132&lt;br/&gt;Ferguson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal objectives of this proposal are to identify and characterize microbes in activated sludge that are capable of biodegrading emerging trace-contaminants (ETCs) at low concentrations, and develop a bioaugmentation process for existing wastewater treatment systems to remove ETCs from wastewater. In the last decades many ecological concerns have arisen related to ETC in aquatic environments. As a primary environmental source, ETC removal is one of the main challenges currently facing wastewater treatment facilities. Many studies examining the fate of ETCs in treatment processes suggest that biologic degradation contributes to transformations of ETCs. While the existence of microbes that can grow heterotrophically on ETCs has thus been confirmed, their ability to grow and contribute to ETCs degradation at the extreme low-concentrations has not been fully explored. In this proposed study, advanced analytical chemistry, microbiology and molecular biology methods will be combined to study the heterotrophic degradation of ETCs in wastewater treatment. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop a bioaugmentation approach for existing biologic treatment processes that will enhance ETC removal by addressing the following hypotheses: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Microbes presented in activated sludge are capable of degrading ETCs at low concentrations. &lt;br/&gt;2. Metabolic degradative activity is expressed at environmental concentrations of ETCs. &lt;br/&gt;3. Heterotrophic degradation contributes to observed losses in WTF of ETCs. &lt;br/&gt;4. The ability of microbes that degrade trace-level compounds to also grow using other organics will allow bioaugmentation engineering based on growth with less hazardous compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is potentially transformative in that a method of bioaugmentation for specific ETCs degradation will be developed to investigate and design processes for biomass addition to achieve targeted effluent limitations, as they are promulgated. Direct educational benefits include the training of graduate students, and participation of undergraduate researchers. Increased participation by underrepresented groups will be realized through established program through continued partnership with the University of Washington, College of Engineering Office of Diversity.</AbstractNarration>
