    <AbstractNarration>Nearly hundred years after the debut of Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravitational waves are viewed as one of the most intriguing but still elusive astrophysical phenomena. They are expected to be emitted by extreme astrophysical sources such as merging black hole binary systems, spinning neutron stars, gamma-ray bursts or supernovae. Certain aspects of these astrophysical phenomena are detectable in other forms such as gamma-rays, making our scientific endeavor even more promising. However, in order to decipher the detailed inner workings and understand the complete astrophysical process involved in these cataclysmic comic events, their observation through gravitational waves is essential. This award will support active engagement in the quest for the first detection of gravitational waves coincident with gamma-ray burst and neutrino events. The data collected by the global network of gravitational wave detectors, including the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), will also allow the advance of fundamental science prior to regular detections of cosmic events through gravitational waves by setting astrophysically interesting upper limits to the gravitational waves produced. To increase the repertoire of promising progenitor candidates, the PI and his students will also investigate data analysis techniques related to gravitational waves emitted by eccentric encounters of black hole binary systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will allow the PI to develop an innovative course at Columbia University specifically designed to enhance the critical foundations of students in experimental science. The curriculum is inspired by gravitational wave research and emphasizes real life experience for students in the laboratory. The course will focus on ingenuity and mission critical skills of experimental research; it will closely integrate lectures, experimentation, teamwork, proposal/planning/publication and other related practical skills. Students of all ages (from high school to graduate school) will be offered a diverse educational experience in the forefront of experimental research.</AbstractNarration>
