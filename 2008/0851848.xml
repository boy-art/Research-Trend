    <AbstractNarration>Software safety is critical to many projects conducted&lt;br/&gt;by both private industry and the government. After the&lt;br/&gt;Challenger accident, NASA adopted a safety policy based&lt;br/&gt;on a National Research Council report that requires every&lt;br/&gt;project to take an organized and systematic approach to&lt;br/&gt;identify safety hazards or unsafe situations and practices,&lt;br/&gt;and to follow appropriate steps to assure adequate safety.&lt;br/&gt;At the REU site to be established undergraduates participate&lt;br/&gt;in research on verification and validation for software&lt;br/&gt;safety: from, initially, a series of training seminars on&lt;br/&gt;the necessary background knowledge, to becoming involved&lt;br/&gt;in one of several specially designed research topics&lt;br/&gt;according to their interests. Topics include safety analysis,&lt;br/&gt;model construction and simulation, validation test generation&lt;br/&gt;and execution, etc. Interaction between the students and&lt;br/&gt;faculty mentors is emphasized. Follow-ups are also conducted&lt;br/&gt;with the students after the summer program to prepare their&lt;br/&gt;results for presentation at conferences and publication in&lt;br/&gt;journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research subject is software safety with a focus on the&lt;br/&gt;analysis and integration of failure conditions with functional&lt;br/&gt;specifications, the use of assertions in formal specifications,&lt;br/&gt;and validation not only for testing software under normal&lt;br/&gt;conditions but also for showing that unsafe states cannot be&lt;br/&gt;generated by the software as the result of single or multiple&lt;br/&gt;erroneous inputs. This project allows students from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups or universities with limited research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to experience cutting-edge research in software&lt;br/&gt;engineering and to gain proficiency in a broadly applicable&lt;br/&gt;skill set, including critical thinking, research methods,&lt;br/&gt;problem solving, and oral and written communication -- all of&lt;br/&gt;which are very important for success in graduate programs and&lt;br/&gt;careers in science and technology research.</AbstractNarration>
