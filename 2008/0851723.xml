    <AbstractNarration>The University of Michigan REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Ten students will be selected each year to participate in a ten-week interdisciplinary research program focused on the structure and function of proteins. Student participants will be engaged in an intensive hands-on experimental training and independent investigation in the areas of biochemistry, biophysics, cheminformatics, computational chemistry, enzymology, marine biology, molecular biology and plant biology. In addition to research, students will participate in a series of weekly enrichment seminars focusing on scientific communication, graduate school admissions and scientific career options. Opportunities for integration into the university research community will be provided through periodic social activities and field trips with REU faculty mentors, graduate students, and undergraduate students from other university summer research programs. It is hoped that the overall REU experience will promote student persistence in the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) at the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels. Students will be recruited from across the nation while maintaining a special interest in providing research opportunities to women, underrepresented minorities, and students from institutions with limited resources for research. Rising sophomores, juniors or seniors majoring in biochemistry, biology, biophysics, chemistry, computer science, engineering (chemical/biomedical), mathematics or a related discipline will be eligible for participation in the program. All participants will receive on-campus housing, meal and travel allowances, and a stipend.
