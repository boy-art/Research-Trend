    <AbstractNarration>This renewal award to University of Nevada Reno by the Solid State Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research will focus on studying the self-organization of ionic aromatic compounds into the chromonic liquid-crystalline phase and fabricating multi-functional anisotropic (direction-dependent) materials. This interest is motivated by the increasing demand of multi-functional materials with complex collections of properties for high technology applications. This research will provide a better understanding of the structure-property relationships in liquid-crystalline and crystal phases which is crucial for the rational design of compounds with desired properties, the molecular level control of materials properties, the generation of new functional materials, and the development of applications. The success of this research will broadly impact the society because of the increasing demand for anisotropic materials, long-wavelength and Near Infrared dyes, and optical materials in general. Furthermore, the integrated teaching and research program will provide important education and training to undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies are expected to be scientifically interesting and technologically important by providing better understanding of the structural parameters that dictate chromonic properties. These studies are expected to provide scientific guidance for future design of the molecular components needed to construct the next generation of multi-functional materials for sensing and display applications. With respect to teaching, training, education and outreach activities, the project integrates traditional organic synthesis with modern materials research, and will offer a broad foundation of training for students involved in the research project.</AbstractNarration>
