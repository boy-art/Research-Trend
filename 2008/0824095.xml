    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to exploit the geospatial resources available in cyberspace for the study of radio propagation in urban and mountain areas. The approach is interdisciplinary and includes research in the area of 3D reconstruction of buildings using 2D and projected images and examination of the effect of terrain and building materials on radio propagation coverage. It will result in the development of ray tracing models suitable for modeling complex building structures such as metal-framed structures and complex walls. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits: This research is interdisciplinary involving areas of geospatial resources, computational intelligence, electromagnetic wave propagation, and wireless communications systems. The integrated research will lead to the development of potentially transformative propagation modeling algorithms and tools to provide computationally efficient and more accurate capabilities for radio propagation prediction and characterization for advanced wireless communications technology including cognitive radio systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This research addresses the need for accurate, fast, worldwide radio frequency signal coverage prediction for advanced wireless communications. The project will also impact society through several educational and outreach activities that are closely integrated with the research, including the development of a new graduate course and involvement of undergraduate students in the research. In particular, the propagation modeling activities will be integrated with the State of Hawaii Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program (ACT 111) to involve high and middle school teachers and students and stimulate interest in STEM courses.</AbstractNarration>
