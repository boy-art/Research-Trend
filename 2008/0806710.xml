    <AbstractNarration>The Engage, Connect, and Deliver STEM Scholars is awarding scholarships for financially needy students who demonstrate academic promise and are enrolled in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) field of study. The framework for the project is linked to the strategic plan of the college. Four partners from industry and state government are supporting the project by providing internships and cooperative education experience. The goals of the project are to: &lt;br/&gt;(a) Increase the number of students enrolling in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;(b) Increase educational opportunities for underrepresented students. &lt;br/&gt;(c) Utilize articulation relationships to promote seamless transfer for STEM students. &lt;br/&gt;(d) Strengthen internal collaboration within the college to support successful implementation of the project. &lt;br/&gt;(e) Enhance relationships with employers from STEM-related industries in order to increase the number of employees who are educated and skilled in "technical areas of national need"; specifically within the following majors: Mathematics and Computer Technologies, Science and Engineering, Industrial Technology, Energy Technology, and Agriculture Technology and Natural Resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project advances knowledge and understanding through student learning in the STEM disciplines. Experience from a prior NSF CSEMS benefits the project. Enabling students to successfully participate in their education through a framework of comprehensive enrollment, teaching, learning, and support structures, the project promotes retention, builds a community of scholars, and assists students with workforce entry. Benchmark objectives for project outcomes include an increase in the five-year average rate of retention through individualized student action plans, a first semester seminar, and other student-focused strategies. The project is creating an active learning community of STEM students who persist in completing their education goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The intended impact of the project is to increase educational opportunities for students in STEM disciplines and begin to address the shortfall of workers critically needed in technical areas of national importance. The in-state demand from employers is significant due to the expanding economy leading STEM-related industries to hire graduates at placement rates approaching 100%. In addition, the project is broadening its impact by reaching minority students through a multicultural recruitment and retention plan.</AbstractNarration>
