    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for Dr. Matthew Johnson, Assistant Professor, Department of Wildlife, and Dr. Michael Mesler, Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, to provide research experiences for 5 U.S. undergraduate students per year for 3 years to study the interaction of tropical forests and agricultural habitats in Jamaica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on training students in applied ecological research, investigating how birds and bees provide pest control and pollination services to coffee farms adjacent to forested nature reserves, through a year-long classroom and international field-based learning experience. Students will take a fall class on ecology, research methods and Jamaican culture prior to their 5-week winter research experience in Jamaica. This will be followed by additional class work which includes substantial mentoring in data analysis and writing. Furthermore, students will have the opportunity to present their research at conferences, workshops and through publications. The PI's have included a strong collaboration with Dr. Dwight Robinson of the University of the West Indies, that will involve partnerships between faculty and students, as well as use of lab space, equipment, and assistance in communication with local farmers and Jamaican agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will help advance our understanding of the interaction of tropical forest ecology with agriculture while helping to develop new scientists competent in collaborative international research.</AbstractNarration>
