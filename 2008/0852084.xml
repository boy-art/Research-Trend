    <AbstractNarration>The Academy for the Environment REU program will link nationally recruited undergraduates with accomplished academic scientists to further our scientific understanding of our bioregion. These research teams will work in Eastern Sierra Region of Nevada, specifically within the Lake Tahoe-Truckee River-Pyramid Lake watershed. The proposed REU site will encompass a wide range of biological and natural resource science research. Topics range from studies on fire effects on watershed restoration to the anthropogenic influences on water quality along the shorezone at Lake Tahoe. Participants will be exposed to diverse scientific inquiries and technologies to gain insight into the manner in which science informs land use policy and conservation initiatives. The overarching goal of this program is to explore the interdisciplinary intersections of the various subfields in the sciences that are required for adaptively managing watersheds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The unifying approach of the program centers upon the necessary union of the biological sciences and natural resource management policy. The research projects are situated within a biologically diverse watershed, a unique ecological system that provides varied and compelling research opportunities in mountain, desert, and riparian biotic communities. More broadly, the program will expose students to integrated research questions that connect these ecosystems to larger questions of water usage and conservation in the west. The exploration of these inquiries will entail utilizing state-of-the-art technologies, while also allowing each student to explore in depth a particular aspect of a given study. Nationally recruited students will consider how these technologies influence knowledge production as they refine their scope of research. An important emphasis of this program will be team building and positive work environments and the role of students in these processes. As a result, the impact of the REU program will expand a student's understanding of, and participation in, effective research programs while producing research that has the potential to contribute significantly to a particular field. The desired outcome of our collaborative research will bridge students, faculty, and natural resource managers in a collective effort towards enhancing our scientific understanding of regional conservation issues in an applied context.</AbstractNarration>
