    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for NSF Proposal 0830381&lt;br/&gt;Project Title: Perturbation Codes: A New Class of Linear&lt;br/&gt;Convolutional Codes&lt;br/&gt;Linear convolutional codes are widespread in data communication systems and data&lt;br/&gt;storage systems. Each such code processes data at a ¯xed rate and with a ¯xed delay, so that&lt;br/&gt;the fraction of errors (called average distortion) in the reconstructed data will be acceptably&lt;br/&gt;small. The primary problem of linear convolutional code design is to ¯nd an optimal code,&lt;br/&gt;which is a code yielding the minimum average distortion among codes in a ¯nite set of feasible&lt;br/&gt;codes. In most cases, with past techniques, this problem could only be solved approximately,&lt;br/&gt;yielding an almost optimal code (a code with near minimum average distortion), the set of&lt;br/&gt;feasible codes being too large for the average distortion of codes to be examined individually.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we investigate a new technique, called perturbation theory, which reduces the&lt;br/&gt;set of feasible codes to a much smaller set of codes called perturbation codes. In many cases,&lt;br/&gt;an optimal code will be one of the perturbation codes, and it can be found in a reasonable&lt;br/&gt;amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;Each linear convolutional code in the set of feasible codes is described via a parity check&lt;br/&gt;matrix over the binary ¯eld, consisting of a ¯xed number of rows and columns. A perturba-&lt;br/&gt;tion class of codes consists of codes whose parity check matrices can be arranged so that a&lt;br/&gt;certain number of rows at the top remain ¯xed. Any code will lie in more than one pertur-&lt;br/&gt;bation class of codes, depending upon which rows of the parity check matrix are held ¯xed.&lt;br/&gt;Under certain conditions, there will be a natural group acting on the parity check matrices&lt;br/&gt;of a perturbation class of codes. Using the group structure, a subset of each perturbation&lt;br/&gt;class of codes is selected. A code will be declared to be a perturbation code if it is among the&lt;br/&gt;selected codes in a certain number of perturbation classes containing the code. There is °ex-&lt;br/&gt;ibility in the de¯nition of perturbation code. In this project, we investigate how to properly&lt;br/&gt;delineate the perturbation code concept so that an optimal code can be found from among&lt;br/&gt;a small set of perturbation codes, for source and channel models of su±cient symmetry.</AbstractNarration>
