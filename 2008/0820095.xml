    <AbstractNarration>The FASEB Summer Research Conference on "Trace Element Metabolism: From Model Organisms to Humans" will be held at Snowmass, Colorado June 15-20, 2008. Trace elements are essential nutrients and, as such, are of vital importance in medicine, agriculture and the inter-relationship between agriculture and human health. This conference will focus on topics covering the most exciting and important breakthroughs in understanding both basic and applied aspects of trace element metabolism. In this meeting, the focus will be on the trace elements iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se) and boron (B), as they constitute a group of trace elements that serve critical roles in biology. As is evidenced by the dramatic increase in the number of newly discovered biological processes in which trace elements play pivotal roles as catalysts, sensors, regulatory molecules and structural co-factors, this field of investigation is expanding at an extremely rapid pace. The specific objectives are to (1) organize and support a meeting on the latest scientific advances in the research area of trace element metabolism (2) promote interactions between scientists and trainees to share new discoveries in the field of trace element metabolism as it relates to normal growth, development and nutrition and to enhance training and new collaborations that will move the field forward and (3) to directly involve newly independent scientists and trainees including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, women, minorities and the disabled in the conference. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the conference include providing access to cutting edge science via oral and poster presentations, to allow opportunities for interactions between trainees and established investigators and to encourage and support long-term and significant advances in this important area of research.</AbstractNarration>
