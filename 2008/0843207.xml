    <AbstractNarration>Louise A. Rollins-Smith&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # IOS- 0843207&lt;br/&gt;Immune Responses in Amphibians against a Skin Fungus Linked to Global Amphibian Declines&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amphibians (frogs, toads, and salamanders) are an essential part of many aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They consume algae and plants as tadpoles, consume many insects as adults, and become food for other animals such as birds and mammals. Currently, amphibians are declining around the world due to a new skin fungus. This project will investigate the immune responses of amphibians against this skin fungus using state-of-the art molecular and cellular assays. Whether amphibians can develop antibody responses or other immune cell-mediated responses will be determined. The project will evaluate immune responses in species that have high and low resistance to the fungus. Efforts will be made to develop an immunization protocol (vaccination strategy) to protect endangered amphibians in captivity. It is expected that amphibians can be induced to develop an immune response that may protect them from natural infection in the wild. This may allow for the reintroduction of endangered species that are currently held in captivity in zoos and aquariums. The project will provide training for students at the undergraduate and graduate school levels. It has the potential to expand our understanding of amphibian immunity in general. The overall project will enhance ongoing partnerships with an international group of scientists addressing the problem of global amphibian declines and support amphibian conservation efforts.</AbstractNarration>
