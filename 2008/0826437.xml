    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to understand matrix confinement effects in thermosetting composite and nanocomposite materials, and in particular, to evaluate the importance of intrinsic size effects, surface effects, and residual stress effects. The scientific approach involves using a novel model for thermosetting composites and nanocomposites ? cure and constraint of the thermosetting resins in nanopores. Cure in nanopores is the inverse problem of thermosets cured in the presence of nanoparticles and nanotubes; however, the nanoconfined system is a simpler model because issues of agglomeration and dispersion of nanoparticles are not relevant and because a broader range of surface interactions can be realized. Experiments and complementary molecular modeling will focus on isolating intrinsic size effects, surface effects, and residual stress effects by changing monomer structure, resin/nanopore surface interactions, nanopore size, and the coefficient of thermal expansion of the confining nanoporous matrix. Deliverables will include the development and dissemination of new scientific knowledge, training of graduate engineering students, and development of a week-long module on composites for junior high school girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will facilitate design and optimization of nanocomposite and composite systems by providing a better understanding of confinement effects on matrix properties. Example applications include composites and nanocomposites used in aerospace and nanoelectronics. The results of the research will be disseminated by presentations at national and regional forums and by publication in both conference proceedings and archival journals. The graduate engineering students involved in the research will receive training in all scientific aspects of the project, as well as professional development training. A week-long module on composites for the junior high school girls interested in science and engineering will also be developed.</AbstractNarration>
