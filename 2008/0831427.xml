    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0831427&lt;br/&gt;PI: Paul Barford&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Wisconsin - Madison&lt;br/&gt;Title: CT-M: Meta-Environments for Experiments on Diverse Topics in Network&lt;br/&gt;Security&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;In order to address the continued escalation in the diversity, sophistication and quantity of&lt;br/&gt;malicious activity in the Internet, new methods for systematic testing and evaluation of&lt;br/&gt;next generation security systems and techniques are required. The objective of this&lt;br/&gt;research is to investigate and develop meta-environments for Emulab-based testbeds. A&lt;br/&gt;meta-environment is a set of testbed configurations, tools and processes developed for a&lt;br/&gt;specific security domain that enables experiments to be conducted in a simplified,&lt;br/&gt;realistic and consistent fashion. The first component of this research program is focused&lt;br/&gt;on investigating tools such as traffic generators that can be used across all metaenvironments.&lt;br/&gt;Next, five specific meta-environments will be investigated and developed&lt;br/&gt;for the following areas: 1) network intrusion detection, 2) firewalls, 3) honeynets, 4)&lt;br/&gt;denial of service defense, and 5) security perimeter design. Finally, mechanisms for&lt;br/&gt;federation between the Wisconsin Advanced Internet Lab, DETER and other Emulabbased&lt;br/&gt;testbeds that will enable large-scale experiments and transparent access to&lt;br/&gt;resources will be investigated. The broader impacts of this project are that it will&lt;br/&gt;simplify and accelerate the use of testbeds for security research, and enable consistent&lt;br/&gt;comparisons between new security systems and tools. The expected results of this work&lt;br/&gt;include tools, configurations, and documentation for the five meta-environments and&lt;br/&gt;testbed federation capability. The project also includes education and outreach activities&lt;br/&gt;that will develop network security lab exercise materials. These web-based materials will&lt;br/&gt;be openly available to the community, and will emphasize a hands-on approach intended&lt;br/&gt;to provide students with practical, relevant experiences.</AbstractNarration>
