    <AbstractNarration>Goals: This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) award seeks to build upon prior RII-supported efforts to expand the core facilities of the University?s Center of Excellence in Marine and Environmental Studies. At this center, scientists investigate the connections between ocean and coastal waters; the biological and geophysical linkages of the land-sea interface; and their potential impact on coral reef ecosystems. Specifically, this project will investigate the factors that enhance or reduce coral reefs? tolerance to environmental stress to better understand ecological resilience. The people of the Virgin Islands rely heavily on Caribbean coastal resources for subsistence, and are alarmed by findings that indicate that nearly 70% of the coral reefs are threatened by costal development, pollution, sedimentation, and over-fishing. Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification and ineffective management add further threats to Caribbean coral reefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Major Foci: Because of the US Virgin Islands? reliance on the surrounding coastal waters and coral reef ecosystems for tourism (economic engine), transportation, food and recreation, the research focus is Biocomplexity in Caribbean Coral Reefs. Three research projects have been developed into the Integrated Caribbean Coastal Ecosystem Research Plan: 1) Evolutionary and Ecological Patterns and Processes team will investigate the numerous processes that threaten coral reef ecosystems; 2) Ocean and Coastal Processes team will provide the physical foundation for interpreting biological processes based upon field data and ocean modeling; and 3) Environmental Analysis and Management team will address the gap between physical and human interactions in coastal ecosystems and the underlying importance of socio-economics on successful natural resource management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate factors that enhance or reduce a coral reef?s tolerance to environmental stress and the coral reef?s resistance to transitions to alternate ecological states. Anticipated project outcomes include a better understanding of how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The research outcomes will inform decision-makers on natural resource management and spatial planning and will enhance human and ocean health. There is an urgent need for this information given the trends on coral reef mortality in the region and the potential negative impact to the region?s economy. Research results may be applicable to regions outside the Caribbean.</AbstractNarration>
