    <AbstractNarration>Many bacteria possess the extraordinary ability to invade, replicate, and persist within host cells. However, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating these processes has remained elusive. The long-term objective of this research is to illuminate the way in which the intracellular bacterial pathogen Brucella melitensis interacts with host cells. The specific research objectives of this effort are to define the molecular mechanisms by which inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (Ire1), an important regulator of the cell's response to stress, supports B. melitensis movement and replication in host cells. In addition, this research will examine whether additional candidate genes participate in this process. Taken together, this research will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which intracellular bacterial pathogens invade, replicate, and persist in the host, and thereby, have a broad scientific impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important educational objectives will be pursued in parallel with these research aims. These objectives include expanding graduate student recruiting activities at Hispanic Serving Institutions in the Texas Rio Grande Valley and U.S.-Mexico border regions. This enhanced recruiting effort will help attract students from diverse backgrounds into life science and agriculture graduate programs at Texas A&amp;M University. In addition, this research will provide research opportunities for highly motivated undergraduates. The Rio Grande Valley and U.S.-Mexico border regions experience the highest incidences of human brucellosis (the disease caused by Brucella infection) in the nation. Therefore, the commitment to train students from these regions will create unique opportunities for integrating the specific research activities in elucidating Brucella pathogenesis with the concerns of affected communities.</AbstractNarration>
