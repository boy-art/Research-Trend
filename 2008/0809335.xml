    <AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor Pingyun Feng at the University of California at Riverside to develop solid-state materials based on chalcogenide tetrahedral clusters and various functional organic species. The proposed research seeks to explore structural and functional diversity of organic molecules to control the crystallization process and structures of chalcogenide clusters and frameworks and to modify and enhance optical and electrooptical properties of resulting chalcogenide clusters and composite materials (integrating both clusters and functional organic components). Three unique types of composite materials will be targeted in which chalcogenide clusters are integrated (1) with optically active metal-complex or organic dye molecules into the dye-sensitized system, (2) with organic electron acceptors into the charge-transfer system or stable radicals, and (3) with ligands with extended systems into covalently organized multi-dimensional systems. With new composite materials developed, this project will investigate their electronic, optical, and photoelectrochemical properties for potential use in applications such as solar energy conversion into fuels or electricity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New materials developed in this project could lead to new applications in solar energy conversion, chemical sensors, and biosensors. UC Riverside has a high African-American and Hispanic enrollment and strongly encourages undergraduate research. The proposed work will provide training for students in synthesis, structural characterization, and property measurements and prepare them for careers in science.</AbstractNarration>
