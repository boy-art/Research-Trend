    <AbstractNarration>Arizona State University is exploring the role of visual representations in student learning in undergraduate geology courses. This study investigates how students interact with, and learn from, three different types of representations: textbook figures, 3D virtual environments, and annotated sketches of geologic systems. The first part of the research involves how students interact with figures in introductory geology textbooks, focusing on how the interaction varies for different types of figures, for the degree of integration of figures and text, and for differences in the background and abilities of the student. A second component investigates student interactions with 2D and 3D virtual environments, such as static portrayals of 3D terrains on maps, various types of interactive animations, and immersive 3D environments, such as the GeoWall. A third component explores the role of annotated sketches (concept sketches) in geoscience learning and teaching, especially the use of sketches as a conceptual bridge between the other two types of visual representations and a deeper understanding of geoscience concepts and processes. The results from this research is expected to help instructors examine the role of visual representations in geoscience learning and develop strategies for more effective geoscience teaching. The project team is developing exemplary curricular materials that explicitly help students and instructors implement these strategies.</AbstractNarration>
