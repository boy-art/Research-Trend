    <AbstractNarration>Astrophysical plasmas are rarely observed to be static. Instead they&lt;br/&gt;vary strongly in both time and space, a phenomena known as turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;Such plasmas are also typically endowed with magnetic fields, just&lt;br/&gt;like the Earth and the Sun. An understanding of turbulence in&lt;br/&gt;magnetized plasmas (known as MHD turbulence) is thus required to&lt;br/&gt;understand a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, from the solar&lt;br/&gt;wind in our solar system (and how the solar wind impacts Earth) to&lt;br/&gt;rotating disks of gas falling into black holes (which produce some of&lt;br/&gt;the brightest sources of light in the Universe). Our proposed&lt;br/&gt;research is aimed at understanding the behavior of MHD turbulence on&lt;br/&gt;small scales where the energy is converted into heat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to carry out large-scale numerical calculations of the&lt;br/&gt;properties of MHD turbulence on small scales. These calculations will&lt;br/&gt;predict observable properties of the turbulence that can be directly&lt;br/&gt;compared to measurements in the solar wind, and ultimately to&lt;br/&gt;measurements in the laboratory on Earth. The same calculations will&lt;br/&gt;predict how plasmas are heated when the energy contained in the&lt;br/&gt;turbulence is dissipated -- one of the major unsolved problems in our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of turbulence. These results will be compared to&lt;br/&gt;measurements in the solar wind; they will also be used to predict the&lt;br/&gt;light we see from plasma falling into black holes -- our primary&lt;br/&gt;observational window onto black holes in nature. More broadly, the&lt;br/&gt;calculations proposed here will advance the state-of-the-art in&lt;br/&gt;numerical modeling of turbulence in magnetized plasmas and will have&lt;br/&gt;implications for a wide variety of laboratory, space, and&lt;br/&gt;astrophysical plasmas.</AbstractNarration>
