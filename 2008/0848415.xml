    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research program of Professor S. Alex Kandel in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame under a project titled, "Gas-Surface Chemistry of Self-Assembled Monolayers." Professor Kandel and his students are investigating how the exact arrangement of atoms and molecules that make up a surface influence the rate and type of chemical reactions that occur when the surface is exposed to reactive gases. The Kandel research group uses scanning tunneling microscopy to develop atomic-scale movies that map out the location and behavior of individual molecules during the course of a chemical reaction. They specifically investigate the reactions of thin organic films with hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine atoms. The study could lead to development of new materials with improved stability in reactive chemical environments such as flames, plasmas, and the upper atmosphere. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in the central discipline of physical chemistry and in the interdisciplinary fields of surface science and nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
