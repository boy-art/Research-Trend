    <AbstractNarration>The experiments for this project will employ solid-state magnetic resonance methods to investigate peptide-lipid interactions. In particular, the investigators seek to understand the molecular mechanisms by which designed, anchored, membrane-spanning peptides interact with lipids and adjust their tilt or geometry in response to changes in the lipid environment. Of specific importance will be attempts to resolve recent apparent discrepancies or controversies that have arisen between the experimental results from magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the theoretical predictions from molecular dynamics simulations concerning the behavior of peptides that span lipid bilayer membranes. The experimental methods will address these timely issues by using two independent and inherently different approaches, namely methods based upon the deuterium (2H) quadrupole interaction and the nitrogen/hydrogen (15N/1H) dipole interactions. The expected results will enhance the collective understanding of protein/lipid interactions and the function of membrane proteins at the molecular level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will augment a particular University of Arkansas initiative aimed toward developing a new paradigm for undergraduate science education. This HHMI funded "Studio Approach to Science Education" has been designed for innovative recruiting of new creative minds to lifelong careers dedicated to scientific discovery, while at the same time broadening the base for participation of non-traditional individuals and underrepresented groups in science. Efforts here will broaden the team research concept by including NSF-supported students working alongside and in conjunction with ongoing studio research team members. The impact of extending the novel studio/team experience will benefit society by helping to build the future scientific work force.</AbstractNarration>
