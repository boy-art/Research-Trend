    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit. This project aims to understand the molecular machinery that controls endosomal-mediated degradation of plasma membrane proteins in plants as well as the cellular and developmental processes that depend on endosomal trafficking pathways. Endosomal compartments play a fundamental role in the sorting, recycling, and turnover of membrane proteins, the down-regulation of receptors, and the trafficking of proteins to vacuoles and lysosomes in all eukaryotic cells. This project focuses on two important plant endosomal proteins, SKD1 and CHMP1, which work in coordination with other endosomal protein complexes to regulate sorting of membrane proteins for degradation. Endosomal trafficking plays a role in various aspects of the plant life, such as development, cell type specification, cell wall remodeling, gravitropic response, signal transduction, and hormone transport. The research proposed here will provide valuable information in this plant cell biology area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The project will have important impacts on education and outreach. The Principal Investigator is currently teaching undergraduate courses at the University of Wisconsin. An additional part of the plan is to recruit one or more graduate students, in addition one already in the laboratory, to work on the central topic of this research proposal. Due consideration will be given to recruitment of individuals from under-represented groups. The development of new imaging techniques will also be important for the educational plan, since the PI is committed to develop workshops on cell biology and cell imaging for undergraduate and graduate students across campus as part of the educational activities of the new Imaging Center in the Department of Botany-University of Wisconsin. The Center was initially supported by NSF funds.</AbstractNarration>
