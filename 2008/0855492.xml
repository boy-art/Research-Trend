    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of The Eighth International Congress on Thermal Stresses (TS2009) hosted by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are to provide a forum, stimulate a scholarly dialogue, and facilitate the cross-fertilization of ideas among engineers, technologists and scientists in academia, industry and laboratories whose common interests lie in thermal stresses and related topics. All areas of Thermal Stress Sciences related to basic research and industrial applications will be represented. Keynote lectures will be delivered at the congress by prominent researchers from all over the world and topical Symposia will be organized to honor distinguished scientists. The support of the National Science Foundation will facilitate the organization of the TS2009 Congress, will provide travel funds to scientists, fellowships to talented students, and will contribute to the overall success of this planned event. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Congress encompasses topics that are not covered by other national and international conferences. The discussion of the mainstream topics as well as of the emerging areas is likely to bring about a substantial contribution in many areas of modern technology, including, primarily, the aeronautical/ aerospace, materials, nuclear, automotive, civil and mechanical engineering areas.&lt;br/&gt;The Congress will not only have significant value for engineering design and applications, but it will also enhance education. This event will involve a number of students and support their participation. In soliciting students to participate, women and underrepresented minorities will be strongly encouraged. The TS2009 proceedings will be the primary vehicle for dissemination of latest findings and discoveries in the thermal stresses arena.</AbstractNarration>
