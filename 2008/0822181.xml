    <AbstractNarration>This proposal focuses on teaching and learning concerning an important issue: global warming and climate change. The project seeks to develop a model of how middle school students learn about these complex issues, and a model of ?teaching learning of student learning.? The project has four facets: (a) Collection of baseline data on student understanding of global warming and related concepts in Grades 7 and 8; use of this data to construct an initial model of student learning and an initial model of teacher understanding of student learning. (b) Collection of data on classroom instruction and assessment of student learning relative to collaborative action research plans. Emphasis will be placed on what and how the science teachers are learning with regard to establishing coherence among the topics that ground student understanding of global warming. Formative assessment by both internal and external evaluators twice during each instructional cycle will be used to inform the subsequent data collection process. (c) Analysis of student and teacher data collected during the school year during Years 1-4 and development of a model of student learning will be conducted. Analysis of collaborative action research projects and development of the goals for the subsequent cycles will also be conducted at this time. (d) Explore resources, particularly the ones developed by NSF-funded curriculum projects to support and enhance teacher knowledge and classroom instruction will be conducted.</AbstractNarration>
