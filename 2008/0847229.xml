    <AbstractNarration>This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports fundamental studies by Professor David McMillin at Purdue University on the development of new reporter probes that contain a transition metal ion and emit light after electronic excitation. The investigations involve different metal ions, including copper, ruthenium, and platinum, each of which is incorporated into a specifically designed coordination sphere. The focus is mainly on systems that offer open coordination sites where interactions occur in the excited state and provide coupling to the local environment. The systematic approach provides for the development of new, sterically accommodating systems with programmable binding properties. From the educational perspective, the Chemistry Department at Purdue University and the McMillin group have a strong track record of training students from underrepresented groups. In terms of chemistry, the new luminophores that result are applicable to many areas including supramolecular chemistry, molecular sensing, and molecular devices that utilize solar energy.</AbstractNarration>
