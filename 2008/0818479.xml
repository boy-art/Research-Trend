    <AbstractNarration>In plants, both water and pathogens move through the same transport tissue (xylem) that consists of hollow, pipe-like cells (conduits). Because water flow along this complex network of conduits occurs under tension, bubbles can be produced that eliminate water transport. The xylem conduits are of fixed length and are to some extent interconnected, but the extent of the interconnectedness has not been evaluated. The fixed length and interconnections may be important for limiting bubble expansion or pathogen transport. The investigators will use High Resolution Computed Tomography (a kind of CAT scan) to reveal the three dimensional structure and connections of the xylem conduits, and from these data resolve how the network design may facilitate water transport and limit pathogen movement. The investigators will use grapevine (Vitis species) and the xylem-limited bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa as a model system to examine the influence of xylem structure on the ability of pathogens and embolisms to move through the network. Reconstructions of the vessel network will be used to mathematically model the 3D arrangement of the hydraulic network and its transport properties. Graphical user interfaces will greatly simplify both the analysis of imaging data and the use of network simulation software. The user interface will be web-based to make it readily accessible to students, teachers, or plant scientists anywhere in the world for use in developing their own three-dimensional xylem structural models, or analyzing characteristics of xylem networks particular to their interests. Model predictions of system hydraulics and pathogen movement will be compared with experimental data on grapevines. The results will significantly enhance our understanding of how system level properties of the xylem network influence plant water use in the face of biotic and abiotic stresses, and may reveal novel design features related to disease resistance. The project brings together a novel combination of physics and plant biology to apply the advanced technology of CAT scans, used for example to evaluate blood flow in brains, to the perplexing problems of drought and disease effects on plant and crop growth. This approach may be transformational in producing detailed three-dimensional pictures that have been increasingly exploited in medicine but not in plant biology, and in training scientists in the application of CAT scan technology to plants.</AbstractNarration>
