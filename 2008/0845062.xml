    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The responses of a cell to its environment result largely from the movement of signals from receptor proteins on the outer cell surface to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Strict regulation of this signal transduction is crucial for cell survival, differentiation, growth and other activities. However, many aspects of how the cell maintains control of signaling pathways remain unclear. The objective of this project is to reveal new details about the molecular mechanisms that regulate signaling. Specifically, we will examine signaling mechanisms of the erbB protein family to 1) characterize receptor dynamics and their influence on protein interactions; 2) determine the order and rate of protein recruitment to signaling complexes; and 3) measure the conformational changes that induce erbB activation. Comparisons between normal and mutant erbB receptors that exhibit altered signaling will provide further insight into regulation mechanisms. New imaging techniques and analyses will be developed for the study of dynamic protein events at the molecular level on living cells. This research will result in quantification of protein dynamics at the single molecule level, revealing information that cannot be elucidated by traditional biochemical techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This multi-disciplinary project will train students in research at the interface of biological and physical sciences. Graduate and undergraduate students will be introduced to exciting new research in cell biology and fluorescence microscopy through development of a cross-campus light microscopy course. Working with the Explora Science Center and Children's Museum of Albuquerque, artistically and scientifically compelling videos and presentations based on live cell imaging will be developed. Explora's visitors include &gt; 60% minority students of all ages, allowing us to reach an underrepresented group in science and providing an ideal forum to introduce the world of cell biology to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being co-funded by the Cellular Biosystems Cluster and Physics of Living Systems Program.</AbstractNarration>
