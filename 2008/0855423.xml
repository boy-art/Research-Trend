    <AbstractNarration>The Compact Object Binaries and Gravitational Radiation project focuses on computational modeling of astrophysical phenomena that enter the LIGO sensitivity band, thus exploiting the predictive power of numerical relativity. The effort capitalizes on both the latest advances of LIGO and its partners in gathering data and operating at design sensitivity and on the recent revolution in numerical relativity that has made binary black hole simulations possible. The project consists of the following areas: (i) Enhancement of computational infrastructure to improve performance and accuracy of black hole collision simulations and their associated gravitational waves, (ii) binary black hole simulations with unequal mass and spinning black holes in support of LIGO observational efforts, and (iii) black hole and neutron star simulations to model central engines for short gamma-ray bursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project transforms the focus of the numerical relativity at Georgia Tech from development to applications, with the aim of producing results that capture broad interest and involving scientific computing that pushes the frontiers of high performing computing. Specifically, the project further enhances the computational infrastructure and enables the development of flexible and reusable community tools essential to collaborative effort in support of the detection and interpretation of gravitational wave observations.Â  In addition, the project provides valuable sources of ideas and materials for interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in gravitational wave physics.</AbstractNarration>
