    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on hardware features &lt;br/&gt;to improve the security of software systems.&lt;br/&gt;By refining the coarse-grained protections available in&lt;br/&gt;today's architectures, the project will aim to protect&lt;br/&gt;the integrity of individual software objects or components.&lt;br/&gt;The hardware mechanisms force tight controls on &lt;br/&gt;the execution of software components, which&lt;br/&gt;programmers can define to be as large as entire&lt;br/&gt;applications or as small as individual objects. &lt;br/&gt;The goal is to rapidly detect and also recover from attacks that&lt;br/&gt;improperly access memory or take over the CPU.&lt;br/&gt;The approach also includes hardware-supervised&lt;br/&gt;recovery, to enable systems to return to normal &lt;br/&gt;operation after an attack and to protect the recovery &lt;br/&gt;process itself from attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits of this project include the ability to &lt;br/&gt;thwart a large class of attacks and the potential of&lt;br/&gt;developing more robust software systems in the future.&lt;br/&gt;Recovery, which has received somewhat less attention than&lt;br/&gt;attack prevention or detection, is especially important for &lt;br/&gt;embedded systems that do not have the luxury of intervention &lt;br/&gt;by human operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be used to train graduate students and to &lt;br/&gt;feed material into graduate courses taught at the three &lt;br/&gt;participating universities. Modules will also be developed for &lt;br/&gt;use in K-12 education with the aim of drawing students into &lt;br/&gt;considering careers in computer science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
