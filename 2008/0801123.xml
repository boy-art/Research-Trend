    <AbstractNarration>The investigator will work on two projects connected with number&lt;br/&gt;theory and arithmetic geometry. The first project is to study&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of Hilbert's Tenth Problem. The problem in its&lt;br/&gt;original form asked for an algorithm to decide whether an arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;multivariable polynomial equation with integer coefficients has an&lt;br/&gt;integer solution. In 1970 Matiyasevich proved that no such algorithm&lt;br/&gt;exists, i.e. Hilbert's Tenth Problem is undecidable. This motivated&lt;br/&gt;studying analogues of this problem by considering equations and&lt;br/&gt;solutions in other commutative rings. The biggest open problem in the&lt;br/&gt;area is Hilbert's Tenth Problem over the rational numbers. The PI has&lt;br/&gt;proved the undecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for various&lt;br/&gt;function fields. These generalizations have used tools from&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic geometry, such as the study of rational points on elliptic&lt;br/&gt;curves. One research goal is to extend these results and prove&lt;br/&gt;undecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for the function fields for which&lt;br/&gt;the problem is still unresolved. The biggest open problems are&lt;br/&gt;function fields of one variable over an algebraically closed field.&lt;br/&gt;Another goal is to explore Hilbert's Tenth Problem for various&lt;br/&gt;subrings of number fields. The second project is to study several&lt;br/&gt;problems that deal with computational aspects of curves and their&lt;br/&gt;Jacobians. Elliptic curves and, more generally, Jacobians of curves&lt;br/&gt;of small genus have many applications to cryptography, and the second&lt;br/&gt;project focuses on these applications. One goal of the second project&lt;br/&gt;is to explore curves of small genus and work on constructing curves&lt;br/&gt;that are suitable for cryptographic purposes. The PI will also work on&lt;br/&gt;applications of pairings to cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both projects involve studying the solutions to multivariable&lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations. Looking for solutions to such equations over the&lt;br/&gt;integers or rational numbers has a long history that goes back to&lt;br/&gt;ancient Greece. For the first project the investigator will study the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental question of whether it is possible to find a procedure&lt;br/&gt;that determines whether an arbitrary multivariable polynomial equation&lt;br/&gt;has a solution in a given number system. The second project focuses&lt;br/&gt;on computational aspects of certain special classes of equations that&lt;br/&gt;have applications to cryptography. For these applications one usually&lt;br/&gt;looks for solutions to these equations over finite fields.</AbstractNarration>
