    <AbstractNarration>Lead contamination of the urban environment is not a new phenomenon. A great deal of research has focused on the health effects of lead-based paint. Less attention, however, has been given to the potential problem of contaminated soils. Ecologists can help understand this problem by using the tools of landscape ecology to predict where and how much lead remains in urban residential soil. This research will address whether certain features found in the urban environment (trees, lawns, buildings, and roads) can be used to predict lead concentrations in soil. Using a method that allows for rapid assessment of lead concentrations in soil, this research will use information gathered from urban residential yards to generate a model that will predict the spatial distribution of lead. This research will contribute to the growing field of urban ecology by advancing our knowledge of how patchiness across properties and neighborhoods affects the distribution of a critical pollutant in urban systems. In addition, this research will test the suitability of land cover as a predictive ecological variable. &lt;br/&gt; Communicating results of this research through various non-profit organizations will benefit city residents through an improved understanding of the distribution of an important environmental contaminant. Although the model created by this research will rely heavily on data collected from Baltimore, Maryland, this research will contribute to the understanding of soil lead contamination in other urban areas. The public health community can use information generated by this model to streamline current lead remediation efforts.</AbstractNarration>
