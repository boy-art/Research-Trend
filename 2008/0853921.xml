    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0853921&lt;br/&gt;Romanowski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasmon resonance, an optical phenomenon associated with metal nanoparticles, is being investigated for biomedical imaging and intervention at the cellular level. However, the size requirements for complete elimination of currently available nanoparticles from the body may limit their clinical utility. In response to this challenge we recently reported preparation and testing of a new composite material, biodegradable plasmon resonant nanoshells. This fundamentally new class of materials maintains optical tunability characteristic of solid metallic shells, yet upon degradation yields individual clusters of diameter compatible with the requirements of renal clearance. Biodegradable metallic nanoshells may enable clinical translation of many research-stage technologies, including imaging and therapeutic applications of gold nanoparticles studied by these investigators earlier. The main goal of this research plan is to evaluate applications of degradable gold nanoshells in medical diagnostics and therapy. Photothermal conversion, content release as well as molecular targeting of degradable nanoshells will be studied. Specificity of delivering agents to cell types of interest will be determined. The subcellular fate of the released contents will be detailed to evaluate mechanisms to enhance delivery to cells, and the ability of the delivered agent (siRNA) to effect cell function will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An integral part of this research project is to provide research and educational opportunities to students with interest in engineering materials on the nanometer scale for applications in human health. In addition to a graduate student support, this research plan will create educational opportunities within two programs active at the University of Arizona, Undergraduate Biology Research Program and a summer research program for underrepresented high school students with interest and abilities in science. This experience will subsequently help these investigators enhance educational curriculum in areas of photonics, molecular biology and material science, or more broadly, nanomedicine.</AbstractNarration>
