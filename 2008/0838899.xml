    <AbstractNarration>A computer program is written in a high-level *programming* *language*,&lt;br/&gt;but to be run, it must be translated into a *machine* *language*.&lt;br/&gt;A translator is difficult and expensive to build, and using today's&lt;br/&gt;techniques, each programming language needs its own translator. For&lt;br/&gt;example, it is nearly impossible to use the same translator for both Java&lt;br/&gt;and C++. The project is developing techniques by which a ``back end,''&lt;br/&gt;which understands machine language, can serve many different ``front&lt;br/&gt;ends,'' each of which understands a different programming language.&lt;br/&gt;Combining such front and back ends can produce a translator much more&lt;br/&gt;cheaply than is possible at present. The major new idea is to use&lt;br/&gt;*three* interfaces. The C-- language is an interface that enables&lt;br/&gt;the front end to tell the back end what a program should do. The C--&lt;br/&gt;run-time interface reveals decisions made by the back end so that the&lt;br/&gt;front end can support such services as garbage collection and threads.&lt;br/&gt;The Cobalt language is an interface that enables the front end to tell the&lt;br/&gt;back end what special translation techniques are needed for efficiency in&lt;br/&gt;a particular language. These interfaces are supported by new, automatic&lt;br/&gt;techniques for eliminating potential errors in translation.</AbstractNarration>
