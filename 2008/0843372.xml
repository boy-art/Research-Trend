    <AbstractNarration>The parasitic plant dodder has a remarkable ability to communicate with its host plants. During parasitism it develops a structure called a haustorium, which penetrates the host, establishes vascular connections, and serves as a conduit for obtaining water and nutrients from the host. This is all the more striking because recent research has demonstrated the movement of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from the host into dodder. The project will investigate mRNA trafficking in the host-dodder system, focusing on tomato and Arabidopsis as model host species. New mobile mRNAs will be identified by sequencing mRNAs from dodder and host tissues adjacent to the haustorium, and these mRNAs will be characterized with respect to their cellular localization and fate using fluorescent tags and probes. These experiments will provide insight into how mobile mRNA movement is regulated and whether cross-species movement of mRNAs function to convey information from one plant to another. Because mobile mRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of plant growth and development, this project will contribute to the fundamental knowledge needed to improve plant productivity. The project will foster student training at several levels, including graduate, undergraduate, and high school. For the latter, a high school teacher will collaborate on the project to develop an aspect of the research that can be used for student project. These students will gain a valuable perspective on research by participating in an open-ended project, one whose outcome is not known and that holds potential for making a genuine contribution to the larger project.</AbstractNarration>
