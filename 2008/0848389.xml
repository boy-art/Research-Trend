    <AbstractNarration>This work pursues the development of a new algorithmic framework which&lt;br/&gt;allows for the first time efficient computation of higher-order&lt;br/&gt;interactions in biomolecules. Algorithms are created to demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;two important applications on much larger scales than were previously&lt;br/&gt;tractable, each representing a new door to a larger class of further&lt;br/&gt;possibilities: Axilrod-Teller (3-body) simulation, and Hartree-Fock&lt;br/&gt;(4-index) quantum-level simulation. The multidisciplinary project&lt;br/&gt;brings together experts in computer science, protein folding, and&lt;br/&gt;quantum chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomolecular simulations usually break down complex chemical systems&lt;br/&gt;into a balls-and-springs mechanical model augmented by torsional&lt;br/&gt;terms, pair-wise point-charge electrostatic terms, and simple&lt;br/&gt;pair-wise dispersion (van der Waals) interactions. However such models&lt;br/&gt;often fail to capture important, complex non-additive interactions&lt;br/&gt;found in real systems. Though the criticality of multi-body&lt;br/&gt;potentials for more accurate and realistic molecular modeling has been&lt;br/&gt;argued by various authors, their evaluation in systems beyond tiny&lt;br/&gt;sizes has not been previously possible due to the unavailability of an&lt;br/&gt;efficient way to realize the computation, which is cubic or higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work augments a framework for computational problems called&lt;br/&gt;Generalized N-Body Problems, which contains any such higher-order&lt;br/&gt;physical potential. The framework was originally developed to&lt;br/&gt;accelerate common bottleneck statistical computations based on&lt;br/&gt;distances, utilizing multiple kd-trees and other space-partitioning&lt;br/&gt;data structures to bring down computation times both asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;and practically by multiple orders of magnitude. This work extends&lt;br/&gt;the framework with higher-order hierarchical series approximation&lt;br/&gt;techniques, demonstrating how to do a fast multipole-type method for&lt;br/&gt;higher-order interactions for the first time, effectively creating a&lt;br/&gt;Generalized Fast Multipole Method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms are validated in biochemical systems chosen to clearly&lt;br/&gt;illustrate many-body interactions: hydrogen bonds and three-body&lt;br/&gt;dispersion interactions. Parameters for potential functions are&lt;br/&gt;obtained using customized machine learning methods on dual data sets&lt;br/&gt;generated by the co-PI's labs: high-quality quantum mechanical&lt;br/&gt;benchmark data and experimental protein structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to demonstrate working many-body codes able to explore the&lt;br/&gt;effect of modeling higher-order interactions on a larger scale and&lt;br/&gt;more systematically than ever attempted previously. The intellectual&lt;br/&gt;merit of the work is the elucidation of the first multi-tree multipole&lt;br/&gt;method capable of accurately and scalably performing these fundamental&lt;br/&gt;types of higher-order physics computations. The potential broader&lt;br/&gt;impact is the ability to perform more accurate next-generation&lt;br/&gt;molecular modeling, with implications for fundamental biology and drug&lt;br/&gt;design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page at &lt;br/&gt;http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~agray/gfmm.html</AbstractNarration>
