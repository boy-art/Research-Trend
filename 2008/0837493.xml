    <AbstractNarration>The Rochester Institute of Technology proposes to increase the participation of students with visual impairments in computing by providing better preparation and support for them, as well as increased professional development opportunities for their teachers. There are four objectives: (1) increase the number of students with visually impairments who enter computing programs at the post-secondary level, (2) increase instructional opportunities for students are visually impaired in grades seven through twelve, (3) increase the preparation of computing teachers at the secondary level, and (4) provide ongoing support for computing educators and students while the students are in secondary school or making the transition to post-secondary education. Summer workshops and year-round follow-up activities will be developed to provide middle and high school-aged students with the opportunity to explore computing in a multi-modal, hands-on environment with their parents. An annual workshop will be held to train special education and computing educators from secondary schools. The Project ACE website will be expanded to include a multimedia career zone to learn about being a student and practitioner pursuing computing. In addition, a 2-day conference for industry, STEM professionals who are visually impaired, students and their families will be held in collaboration with the National Federation of the Blind to explore the issues, opportunities and successes regarding participation in computing by the visually impaired community.</AbstractNarration>
