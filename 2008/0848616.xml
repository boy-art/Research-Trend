    <AbstractNarration>Novel catalytic methods for synthesizing the 8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane nucleus are to be developed in this project, with two fundamentally distinct strategies under investigation. In the first of these, a transannular cascade reaction involving an oxa-Michael/aldol/oxa-Michael mechanism will be developed. In the second project area, a metal-catalyzed [2+2+2] tricycloisomerization reaction will be investigated for generating the 8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane moiety. Two alternative tactics for implementing each of these fundamentally distinctive strategies will be examined. Specifically, inter- and intramolecular nucleophilic addition by oxygen to initiate the Michael/aldol/Michael cascade will be studied in the first case. In the [2+2+2] cycloisomerization segment of the project, two catalysts [Rh(I)-Sn(II) and CpRu+] will be evaluated for reactivity and mechanistic profiles. A positive consequence of the bridged polycycle-generating cascade reactions to be developed will be short and versatile synthetic routes to the biologically interesting steroidal alkaloid cortistatin A. Beyond this, broad adaptability of these methods is anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Steven D. Burke of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Professor Burke's research efforts revolve around the development of methods and strategies for the synthesis of biologically active substances. Successful development of the methodology proposed will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.</AbstractNarration>
