    <AbstractNarration>This project will address the development of catalysts for the stereoselective formation of C-C bonds using nitroalkanes. The ease of deprotonation adjacent to nitroalkanes along with their facile conversion to other functionality such as amines and ketones makes them attractive targets for reaction control. Organocatalysts have been developed that achieve asymmetric conjugate addition of nitroalkanes with a variety of substrates, presumably through non-covalent stabilization of the anionic intermediates. Catalyst design continues through investigation of additional scaffolds that are complementary to nitroalkane structure as well as expanding the scope of applicable nitroalkanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Linton of the Department of Chemistry at Bowdoin College. Professor Linton's research efforts revolve around the development of molecular catalysts that control the reactions of nitroalkanes. Since stereoselective syntheses are required for numerous pharmaceutical and biological substrates, these catalysts have broad applicability to a wide variety of relevant target molecules. Additionally this approach uses environmentally friendly organocatalysts that can perform these reactions with minimal use of reagents and minimal production of waste.</AbstractNarration>
