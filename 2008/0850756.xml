    <AbstractNarration>This chemistry REU program at Syracuse University (SU) will include at least 15 students per year in 2009-2011, with 10 funded by NSF and 5 or more funded by SU or SU-associated NSF or NY State grants including LSAMP, AGEP, McNair, or CSTEP. The entire Department of Chemistry faculty will participate as mentors in this ten-week summer program, which is designed to maximize laboratory time while providing valuable scientific and social experiences outside the laboratory. Students will participate in weekly luncheon meetings, in which they will first hear faculty presentations and later present their own research; an interactive ethics seminar; a chemistry careers workshop; and hands-on workshops in both computational chemistry and glassblowing. In addition to their oral presentations, students will also present posters at a campus-wide poster session and contribute articles to a CD compilation. The additional inclusion of 11-12 Austrian undergraduate students (supported by the Technical University of Graz in an iREU exchange program) will provide significant international exposure to all participants, and the participation of high school teachers (supported by SU) will also bring important new perspectives to the program, from which all participants will benefit. With support from LSAMP, AGEP, McNair, and CSTEP programs at SU, minority students will be well represented in the program.</AbstractNarration>
