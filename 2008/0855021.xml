    <AbstractNarration>Among of the most exciting events of recent years has been the mounting evidence that the very early universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion known as primordial inflation. During primordial inflation there is a vast enhancement of quantum effects, which are ordinarily very small. These quantum effects can become so strong that conventional techniques for computing them break down. The main goal of this project is to develop new techniques for reliably computing these quantum effects, so that people can know precisely what they are. Another goal is to search for observable consequences of these enhanced quantum effects that may be masquerading as modifications of the gravitational force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such a study is interesting because many aspects of the current universe can only be understood, without using quantum effects, by supposing that cosmological evolution is driven by enormous quantities (about 96% of the total) of exotic mass and energy that has not been detected in Earth-bound laboratories. It is possible that some of the inexplicable features of cosmology are the result of quantum effects that became strong during primordial inflation. The broader impacts of this project lie in the promotion of teaching, training and learning.</AbstractNarration>
