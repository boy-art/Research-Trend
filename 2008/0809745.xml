    <AbstractNarration>In this research supported by the Analytical and Surface Science Chemistry Program, magnetic effects on electron transfer processes are investigated and modeled. Electron transfer processes and magnetic fields are ubiquitous and coupled through the electron spin, but the role of magnetic fields in electron transfer is poorly understood. From our prior work, magnetic modification of electrodes substantially enhances currents for academically interesting redox probes and for technologically important power sources including fuel cells and batteries. In this project, models for magnetically enhanced reaction kinetics will be developed by imposing magnetic field and spin terms on extant models of electron transfer. The models will be tested against existing data and data newly collected in light of the modeling results. The models will advance theoretical and experimental science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some broader impacts of facilitating electron transfer rates by magnetic modification are apparent from our prior work: fuel cells with higher power density and carbon monoxide tolerance, platinum catalysts tolerant to carbon monoxide, and alkaline batteries with higher accessible energy density that are also made rechargeable. All are potentially transformative technologies. Appreciation of why magnetic fields facilitate these processes will advance the understanding of electron transfer reactions as well as lead to markedly more efficient development of other technologies. The project is highly multidisciplinary and integrates distinct fields of chemistry, a research matrix that leads to better trained students.</AbstractNarration>
