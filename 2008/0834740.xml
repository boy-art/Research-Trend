    <AbstractNarration>Over 6.4 million automotive accidents occur in the US annually. Odds of someone being in an accident this year are 1 chance in 16. Any information that warns of problems along the road(s) ahead can therefore potentially save lives and reduce the frequency and/or intensity of accidents. The vehicle of tomorrow is the programmable-networked vehicle. In our view, the networked vehicle of the future is one of the most complex Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) with active trajectory control, active navigation and on-line maintenance. V2V wireless networks are a special class of networked-CPS where the maximum relative speeds are in excess of 80m/s, the node density can span over 9,000 vehicles/mi^2 and, most importantly, the dynamics of the vehicle, the environment, driver reaction and interaction with other vehicles need to be considered in every communication and control decision. To meet these timeliness and coordinated communication requirements, we are developing a new set of networking capabilities that can lay the foundation for dynamic vehicular networks designed to make driving safer, more efficient and more enjoyable. This project is aimed at the design, analysis, implementation and evaluation of vehicular networks that will enable a wide range of applications including V2V and V2I communication for: (a) Bounded-latency broadcast protocols for active networked safety alerts (b) Protocols and algorithms for Real-Time collision avoidance (c) Native protocols for secure V2V and V2I communication. Real-time research in V2V networks will be the first step toward developing a Spatio-Temporal Real-Time theory and network protocols with wide-area time synchronization.</AbstractNarration>
