    <AbstractNarration>This effort brings together an international team of glass scientists, and optical design and laser physicists to investigate advanced glasses for novel optical fiber applications. This network of scientists examines the intrinsic limits of next generation glasses for use in traditional and novel fiber geometries, models and experimentally verifies the impact of such compositional modification on the glass? hot-forming response during fiberization and extrusion, and assesses the post-fabricated material stability and optical performance of the resulting fibers. Chalcogenide and tellurite-based glasses form the primary focus of the effort, exploiting the novel aspects of the glasses visco-, thermal and optical properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team addresses materials science questions which extend current capabilities in the design, processing and manufacture of advanced glasses into glass fibers. University researchers benefit from the support of key industrial partners who recognize the critical need for such advances. There is an overall benefit to the international community in bringing diverse skill sets together through global training experiences for faculty and students across a team of eight scientific groups from four countries (Australia, France, Italy and the US). Through this partnership, the US team coordinates education and research experiences for team members via summer research experiences, faculty and staff exchanges, as well as opportunities for student participants to complete dual PhD degrees.</AbstractNarration>
