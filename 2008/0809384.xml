    <AbstractNarration>The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program and the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program support the work of Professor Jeffery I. Zink of the University of California-Los Angeles to examine the excited electronic states and reactivities of metal-containing molecules. His research program has four complementary objectives: 1) to spectroscopically characterize the excited electronic states of metal-containing compounds, 2) to understand the effects of potential surface coupling on electronic and resonance Raman spectra, 3) to study large-amplitude molecular motions, and 4) to explore spectra, photochemistry and photodeposition from volatile molecules in the gas phase. These studies may contribute to the development of photoactivated molecular machines and nanovalves that can trap useful molecules such as drugs and release them on demand. The research group recruits undergraduate students from UCLA's Student Research Participation Program and the Center for Academic Excellence (CARE) Program. The CARE Program focuses on the retention students from educationally or socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. These students as well as other graduate, undergraduate and high schools student and teachers also participate in the California NanoSystems Institute to introduce students to various aspects of science and technology in the core curriculum set by the state of California. Professor Zink also promotes communication with the public as he regularly participates in the American Chemical Society's Speaker Tour, giving public lectures on Excited State Distortions.</AbstractNarration>
