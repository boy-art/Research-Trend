    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Division of Materials Research to Cornell University is to develop a coherent structural and electronic understanding of hidden patterns and symmetries of intermetallic compounds through synthesis, structure determination, property measurement, and theory. The main focus will be on complex noble and near noble metal structures. Through this work a new understanding and relationship among the Samson compounds, the Vernier structures and quasicrystalline phases will be developed and could unify these seemly unrelated areas. This project could expand how solid-state chemists, condensed matter physicists, and materials scientists will consider using X-ray diffraction and band theory. In addition, these proposed studies may provide important insights into the structure and electronic characteristics of quasicrystals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project could provide unique opportunities to the students participating in this program in experimental and theoretical approaches of materials science. The outreach activities could have tremendous impact on the society with books and TV series about sciences and chemistry in particular. The "fourth dimension" is an important and useful concept that could be introduced to general public in an understandable and meaningful way.</AbstractNarration>
