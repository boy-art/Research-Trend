    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology is well known as an important part of the economy, both present and future, but most people do not realize that for ages mankind has made materials with certain desirable properties by controlling the nanostructure of the material. In this sense nanotechnology has been around for a few millennia. What has changed dramatically in the last few decades is our ability to characterize what we make, which has greatly improved our synthesis techniques. Microscopy has been an important component of this recent revolution in nanocharacterization. This project is based on the simple idea of rastering a nano-sized sensor over the sample to measure different properties, such as magnetism and superconductivity. The research team working on this involves young men and women, many of Hispanic background, from the High School to the Ph.D. level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This project emphasizes the development of novel scanning probe techniques that operate at low temperatures, with the goal of studying new materials. Recent examples include the study of colossal magnetoresistive materials, manganites in particular, by tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and contact atomic force microscopy. Another example is the study of multiferroic materials with Kelvin force microscopy and MFM. The most recent technique is based on a microscopic Hall sensor, which has been used to study a dilute magnetic semiconductor (Ga0.94Mn0.06As). These techniques will provide a better understanding at the nanoscale of the electronic, magnetic, and transport properties of new materials.</AbstractNarration>
