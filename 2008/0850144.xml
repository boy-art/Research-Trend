    <AbstractNarration>The objective of "Cardinal Science Scholars: Enhancing Student Opportunities and Retention in Biochemistry, Chemistry, and Physics" is to provide a significant scholarship and exceptional academic and co-curricular experiences to at least 30 students who are planning on majoring in chemistry, biochemistry, or physics. Faculty in these disciplines together with the Office of Admissions are recruiting academically talented students with financial need from Ohio schools that have a high percentage of minorities, women, and/or an emphasis on STEM education. Once on campus, the Cardinal Science Scholars are forming an active learning community through activities including a weeklong summer immersion experience, a year-long seminar program focusing on career options, programs at the Center for Career Planning, residence in a living/learning house, and mentoring triads consisting of a mentor/scholar, upper level student, and alumnae. The merit of this project lies in the unique programming to increase career preparation for and retention of the scholars, as well as the mentoring triads. The broader impact includes not only providing scholarships to select students, but also building a more supportive community for all students within these departments. Additionally, recruiting efforts at the high schools are encouraging all students to pursue STEM fields, regardless of which college or university they will be attending.</AbstractNarration>
