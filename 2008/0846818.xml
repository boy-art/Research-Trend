    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of this research is to lay a solid foundation for the development and application of a new generation of two-photon pumped lasers based on engineered semiconductor nanostructures, whereby the strong electronic and/or optical confinements in nanocrystal quantum dots, nano-rods, wires, and disks will impact the nonlinear coherent upconversion process for greatly enhanced lasing performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The research project is targeted at developing a new generation of two-photon pumped laser devices based on semiconductor nanostructures, whereby the strong electronic and/or optical confinements in nanocrystal quantum dots, nano-rods/wires, and nanodisks will impact the nonlinear coherent upconversion process for greatly enhanced lasing performance. Particular efforts will be made to (1) understand the mechanism of two-photon absorption-induced stimulated emission in nanoscale semiconductor materials, (2) study the two-photon lasing dynamics (gain, mode, spectral and spatial distribution, threshold behavior, upconversion efficiency, etc) and their relation to the structural parameters of nanoscale semiconductor dots/rods/wires/disks, (3) enhance the upconversion efficiency and optimize the lasing performance by tailoring the multiple variables used in nanostructure design and processing, and (4) identify the key applications of nanostructured two-photon lasers in biomolecular detection, optofluidic lasing, and optical storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Successful implementation of the proposed study will bring fundamental changes to the design and operation of two-photon pumped lasers and expand their applications in wavelength upconversion, on-chip UV lasers, bio/medical sensing and diagnostics, and optical storage. The study will also build on a foundation of nonlinear optical processes and stimulated emission in low-dimension semiconductors. The proposed work will provide focused research and learning experience to undergraduate and graduate students by involvement in experimental laboratory work, and help them to bridge the fundamental nanoscience with the real-world applications of nanotechnology. In addition, The PI will work with the Penn State's Center for Nanotechnology Education and Utilization and contribute to the state-wide education and workforce development program on nanotechnology in Pennsylvania.</AbstractNarration>
