    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to conduct an in-depth research on a series of fundamental, open, but very important issues leading to the development of a unified theory consisting of revolutionary methods on the general relational data community discovery and learning. The specific approaches include novel methods on statistical machine learning and data mining with unified views to link to the existing literature in the areas of machine learning and data mining. The intellectual merit includes the development of comprehensive understanding of the general unsupervised relational data clustering and learning as well as the expected breakthrough in the community discovery and learning methodologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include promoting the timely and effective knowledge dissemination on relational data mining and statistical machine learning, including project?s web site (http://www.fortune.binghamton.edu/nsf-iis-0812114.htm), as well as the technology development and transfer in a wide range of applications. Educational and outreach activities include providing educational and research experience for the university students. In addition, activities emphasize advancing and enhancing the high school education and syllabi in sciences and developing an integrated model for high schools' research and services for the local community and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
