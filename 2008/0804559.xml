    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Electrons are characterized by their spin as well as charge properties. An electron can generate and interact with a magnetic field through its spin. By taking advantage of spin properties of electrons, one can develop quantum computers that can solve certain problems much faster than any of current classical computers. This individual investigator project studies how electron spins interact with the surrounding nuclear spins in a semiconductor. Experimental studies will be based on the use of laser pulses with durations of order picoseconds. Since interactions between electron and nuclear spins can prevent the proper function of electron spins in a quantum computer, a primary objective of this project is to decouple or isolate electron spins from the surrounding nuclear spins with the use of ultrafast laser pulses. Research conducted in this program will provide excellent training for graduate and undergraduate students in semiconductor physics, nanotechnology, and information science and technology, preparing them for careers in academe, industry, or government. The project receives support from the Divisions of Materials Research and Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator project seeks to advance our ability to control fundamental decoherence processes of electron spins in semiconductors. The project will study optical spin echoes and coherent nonlinear optical processes of localized electrons and two-dimensional electron gas in semiconductors. Donor bound electrons in high purity n-type GaAs and electron gas in modulation doped CdTe quantum wells will be used as model systems of localized electrons and two-dimensional electron gas, respectively. Spin decoherence arising from the coupling of an electron spin to the surrounding nuclear spin bath will be investigated with optical spin echoes and with a particular emphasis on the understanding of non-Markovian spin decoherence processes. Restoration of spin coherence lost due to the coupling to the nuclear spin bath will be explored with dynamical decoupling techniques. The issue of how many-body Coulomb interactions fundamentally modify coherent optical processes in a two-dimensional electron gas will be addressed with both two-pulse and three-pulse differential absorption techniques. Research conducted in this program provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in semiconductor physics, nanotechnology, and quantum information. The project receives support from the Divisions of Materials Research and Physics.</AbstractNarration>
