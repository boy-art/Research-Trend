    <AbstractNarration>0809520&lt;br/&gt;Kotek&lt;br/&gt;This project supports collaborative research by Dr. Richard Kotek, College of Textiles, North Carolina State University, Raleigh and Dr. Samiha Mahmoud, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt. They plan a study on ?Production of New Biocidal Textiles Using Advanced Nano and Melt Spinning Techniques? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Merit: Biocidal textiles are becoming more important due to the appearance of fatal diseases in the world. Production and functionalization of these textiles which are produced from non-woven or woven synthetic fibers &amp; their blends are done with the aim to be introduced to the textile industry. Melt spinning process of synthetic fibers in presence of biocidal nano-particles (inorganic or organic compounds or ploy active monomers) is used to create biocidal fibers containing quaternary ammonium salts sites or others. Biocidal textiles of antimicrobial &amp; insecticidal activities will be produced from polypropylene, polyamide &amp; polyester on a pilot scale &amp; then transferred to the industry. The effectiveness of antimicrobial finish and its durability to repeated washing or dry cleaning is to be tested. Improvement properties of synthetic fabrics to thermal treatment, moisture regain and dyeing will be evaluated. Production cost and end-uses of the fibers specified. The antimicrobial and insecticidal activities of these fibers will be effected and compared to the blanks. The work should result in the development of new potential means of incorporating nanoparticles of different physical/chemical characteristics into textile materials using the nano and melt spinning technology. The collaboration is expected to be successful, given the expertise and past and current research activities of both laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: New nano biocidal-based textile materials will be produced and this could lead to possible development of patented technologies that will be available to the Egyptian laboratory. In turn this will provide Egypt with the opportunity to establish a new industry related to biocidal textile materials production. The project will enhance collaboration and capabilities in the research areas, and may also create patented materials. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
