    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alice 3 is is a new version of the Alice programming environment that blends the highly successful Alice 3D animation environment with the capability of going "under the hood" of Alice by allowing students to program directly in Java using a text-based integrated development environment. Alice 3 will take advantage of the interest and motivation students find in video games and animated films while allowing teachers to cover all the skills and concepts mandated by computing curriculum standards. This project is delivering a workshop for college teachers in computer science who teach the first rigorous course in computing (CS1). Workshop participants are being introduced to Alice 3 and are being given the opportunity to test the software, to report bugs, and ultimately to contribute to the production of a stable version of Alice 3.</AbstractNarration>
