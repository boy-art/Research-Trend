    <AbstractNarration>Ancient ice is melting as a result of climate change in high latitude regions. The life cycles and cultural use of poorly-known features of perennial ice, called "ice patches," are the focus of this research. Rare and well preserved organic artifacts, including clothing, baskets, and tools are melting from ice patches around the world. Radiocarbon dating demonstrates that these features have existed for thousands of years, providing a unique opportunity to investigate their role in high latitude human adaptations. Four locales identified by preliminary research in Alaska's Wrangell St. Elias National Park and Preserve (WRST) are the focus of this program. Using cultural ecological and geoarcheological approaches the research documents and interprets the role of ice patches in early high latitude human adaptations, 2) interprets their role in high latitude cultural development, 3) defines ice patch composition, character, and projected longevity, and 4) develops methods to identify fossil ice patches so that they can be recognized after the ice has melted. This project also contributes baseline data important to understanding the prehistory and paleoecology of a poorly known region, expands the discipline of geoarcheology, and provides insights into the concept that polar environments are "barometers" of climate, environmental, and cultural change. It enhances education by exciting the public, educators, and resource managers about climate change and the need to locate, collect and preserve rare organic remains melting from ancient ice before they are lost forever. The program also provides opportunities for Native Americans to participate in, and contribute to, science. Artifacts from this project will support a regional museum/cultural center providing cultural and educational opportunities to local residents and tourists.</AbstractNarration>
