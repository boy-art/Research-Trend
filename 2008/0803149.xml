    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project addresses current carrying capability in high-temperature superconductor (HTS) films. The focus of the project is on novel experimental approaches, such as incorporation of porosity by nanoscale strain effects, and physical properties of HTS films. Three topics will be investigated: 1) physics of critical current density in single HTS nanobridges and networks of HTS nanobridges fabricated using e-beam lithography. The HTS materials include YBCO), Tl-based (Tl-HTS) and Hg-based (Hg-HTS) superconductors; 2) porous YBCO films via a process that combines vicinal growth and nanoparticle insertion. The mechanism of pore initiation and pore evolution will be studied to increase basic understanding and for its use toward achieving control of pore morphology, density, and interface features. Electric transport properties will be assessed to understand and utilize correlation between microstructure and transport properties in formulating schemes for HTS devices with high current carrying capability approaching theoretical limits. 3) focus will be on the microscopic growth mechanism of linear defects, specifically nanotube pores through micrometer thickness of YBCO films. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of electronic materials science with high technological relevance. Research and educational activities will be integrated by involvement of undergraduates in the research program, and incorporating new research results into the classroom, striving for forefront education to the next generation in nanoscience, material science, and physics.</AbstractNarration>
