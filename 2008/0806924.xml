    <AbstractNarration>Nanomagnets have a wide range of potential applications, including next generation high-density magnetic data storage, spintronic devices, and magnetic biosensing. Essential for all applications is an understanding of the underlying material properties and the capability to design and optimize these properties for the purpose at hand. In this collaborative effort between UC Santa Cruz and the Magnetic Nanostructures group of Manfred Albrecht (Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany), patterned nanomagnetic materials are fabricated and characterized to obtain a complete understanding of the material properties of curved metallic multilayer nanomagnets (?nanocaps?) for use in high-speed, high density magnetic data storage. Different metallic multilayer compositions are investigated and compared to more conventional flat nanomagnets. A complete picture of the dynamic properties of the magnetic nanocaps is obtained using time-resolved magneto-optical studies of single, isolated magnets and nanomagnets within an array. This comprehensive comparison results in a quantitative understanding of the influence of the magnetic environment on the dynamics of a single nanomagnet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact of this research results from the straightforward application of the results of this project to other growing areas of nanomagnetic research such as magnetic memory, spintronics, or biosensors. In addition, joint educational activities between the participating groups take full advantage of the international nature of the collaboration. These include mutual, extended visits of students at different levels to the partner laboratory to gain experience in the complementary expertise of their colleagues. This experience improves the students? understanding of different cultures, research environments, and languages, and gives them a competitive edge in this highly international field.</AbstractNarration>
