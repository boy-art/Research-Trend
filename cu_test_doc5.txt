In engineering design a popular representation taught in mechanical design curricula is "functional modeling" Function has been defined as what a device or system is intended to do or the intentional transformation from inputs to outputs The function is not what the product is (form) how the product does what it does (behavior) or why the product exists (purpose) However it does relate to all of these and thus allows engineers to transition between the problem space and the solution space Many design tools have been developed based on functional modeling but are not yet ubiquitously found throughout industry Rather than suggesting new function vocabularies tools or methods this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project seeks to understand how engineers think about function by studying their behaviors in creating models To do this the modeling behaviors of design engineers will be recorded and models of cognition will be used to explain these behaviors With this understanding new computational design tools can be developed in the future In addition engineering design education can be enhanced by providing students with better strategies for creating the function modelsIt is important to understand how engineers think reason and operate on function modeling elements and how these models bridge problem definition and solution exploration Through experimental protocol studies the specific modeling patterns (forward chaining backward chaining nucleation) and pause patterns (pause before or after elemental instantiation) will be analyzed The modeling patterns will provide evidence of goal-oriented thinking (backward chaining) or causal reasoning (forward chaining) The pause patterns and frequencies will be used to understand relative importance of function (action of transformation) and flow (things being transformed) Two basic research questions will be explored: Are there modeling behavior patterns to function modeling that are invariant of chosen representation And can these modeling behavior patterns be used to understand predict and explain cognitive models of design activities

Many nation states restrict citizen access to information over the Internet by analyzing Internet users' traffic and then blocking traffic deemed controversial or antithetical to the views of the nation state This project explores an alternative end-to-end network architecture that removes the vulnerability of citizens to traffic analysis The researchers propose alternative Internet architecture and protocol designs assesses the impact of such designs on Internet stakeholders and provide assessment methods for correctness performance and scalability of the alternative design The project broadly impacts multiple domains and research communities from the network security and anti-censorship communities to those who design and run the Internet Assuring that individuals around the world can easily access information over the Internet is one of the core driving principles behind this projectTraffic analysis uses packet meta-data and side-channels to infer information about communication sessions encrypted or not running over a network Proxy services make traffic analysis difficult by inserting intermediate nodes between packet source and destination but their success is limited They can be detected and blocked The core concept binds communications sessions to dynamic short-lived and seemingly random Internet Protocol (IP) addresses This fundamentally impacts multiple aspects of the Internet: the domain name system (DNS) IP addressing/routing and packet forwarding This EAGER project will explore the solution space (scope capabilities impact) identify strategies for realization and develop a prototype to assess key properties of the approach The project's intellectual merit includes host and network methods based on ephemeral pseudo-random IP addresses IPv6 addressing and inter-domain routing and SDX architecture/functions

The functioning of interdependent critical infrastructures such as water electricity gas transportation and telecommunications is highly reliant on sensors data networks and control services that are enabled by computer hardware and software systems which in turn cannot function without electric power and sufficient cooling capacity The interdependency and interconnected nature of these cyber-physical systems has increased the possibility that a minor disturbance in one infrastructure can cascade into a regional outage across several infrastructure systems The human response to such outages both on the supply and demand sides is crucial and mainly influenced by the perception of emerging risk and the ability to take rational decisions This project is developing a framework for modeling collaborative adaptive capabilities that are driven by human cognitive abilities and preferences in order to minimize the risk of cascading failures across infrastructure systems The cyber-physical-psychological interplay investigated in this project will have widespread benefits to infrastructure managers emergency response teams and policy makers enabling them to more effectively deal with emerging crises This project also offers inter-disciplinary research opportunities for undergraduates and underrepresented students in addition to graduate student mentoringThe research objective is to advance real-time predictive capabilities of cascading failures across interdependent critical infrastructures by aligning the simulation model architecture with human adaptive preferences to enable rational decision making in the face of emerging unprecedented risks Three interconnected tasks will be undertaken to achieve this objective:  the cognitive abilities and adaptation preferences of infrastructure control room operators (and organizations they represent) will be modeled using cognitive task analysis techniques;  an integrated real-time simulation model for electricity-gas-water networks will be developed through time-synchronization of individual dynamic simulation models using a system-in-the-loop framework; and (3) the capabilities of computational intelligence techniques such as cellular computational networks in predicting near-future system states will be evaluated Particular attention will be paid to the ability of infrastructure operators to visualize an emerging threat through the developed model architecture and embedding their adaptive preferences in the predictive modeling framework to rationalize response decision making This project will advance understanding of both spatial and temporal extents of cascading failures through continuous learning of the simulation model using real-time monitoring data from SCADA systems With advancements on several fronts the research outcomes will contribute to realizing autonomous adaptive control of critical interdependent infrastructures

The advancement of science requires the development of new mathematical methods that can rapidly and reliably solve large-scale scientific computing problems Any modern scientific computing tool and supercomputer must have the ability to effectively (and one hopes optimally) manipulate both the data and parallel computational processes to manage: (a) the load-balancing in parallel computation; (b) data migration between components in a supercomputer; (c) performance optimization; (d) task scheduling; and (e) storage/memory reduction and data compression These and many other problems (such as electronic chip design and community detection in social networks) can be tackled using a family of mathematical optimization problems called partitioning that are formulated on mathematical models called hypergraphs However partitioning of hypergraphs is extremely hard in theory and practice To tackle it this research project will develop and investigate efficient and effective methods that are inspired by multigrid which is one of the most successful classes of numerical methods for solving large-scale scientific computing problems The technical goal of this project is to carry out computational and theoretical investigations in algebraic and nonlinear multigrid methods for hypergraph partitioning motivated by various problems in the areas of computational mathematics and scientific computing These investigations aim to provide breakthroughs in practical computational capabilities modeling matrix-matrix (vector) multiplication matrix partitioning and general load-balancing for scientific computing applications The results of the project will also deepen understanding of theory of multigrid methods applied to computational discrete optimization In recent decades multigrid-inspired methods for graphs (also known as multilevel) led to important breakthroughs in a variety of computational problems However in contrast to the multigrid-inspired methods for graph cut-based problems (such as graph partitioning and linear arrangement) multigrid-inspired methods for hypergraphs are relatively unexplored This project aims to develop theory related to multigrid-inspired methods for discrete optimization problems on graphs and hypergraphs of great practical importance in computational mathematics

This award supports fundamental research into the interactions of a fish-like body with a surrounding fluid and the ways in which motion of the body can transfer energy and momentum for propulsion and maneuverability The research builds upon recent results that show how the complex dynamics of certain types of fish-like bodies can be captured in the form of a relatively tractable nonholonomic constraint that is an algebraic relationship between the velocities of different parts of the system This project will generalize and extend the consequences of this result and clarify the variables that govern this class of fluid-structure interaction Robotic platforms will be built to experimentally validate the theoretical insights The ability to precisely maneuver small aquatic robots has many important applications including the inspection of underwater structures environmental monitoring and underwater exploration The results of this project will lead to improved design of aquatic robots with different shapes sizes and propulsion mechanisms The natural appeal of fish-like robots will be leveraged to recruit members of underrepresented groups into engineering to develop attractive independent research projects for undergraduate students and to demonstrate and motivate key aspects of fluid mechanics in undergraduate courses The project provides a rich multidisciplinary research education and training environment demonstrating synergy between subjects including fluid mechanics nonlinear dynamics geometric mechanics and control theory which are rarely connected at the undergraduate levelThe motion of a fish-like body in water is governed by the changes in its shape the creation of vorticity and the interaction of the body with such vorticity The creation of vorticity imposes a nonholonomic constraint on the motion of the body The primary aim of the research supported by this award is to create a mathematical framework that can illuminate the interplay of abstract shape variables and nonholonomic constraints on the motion of a body in water Shape variables will take form of internal masses and rotors The constraints in the form of vorticity creation will be modeled using discrete vortex approximations Such models with the novel interpretation of vortex shedding as a nonholonomic constraint are well suited to understand and emulate the efficiency and maneuverability of fish to investigate gaits and to design control algorithms for an aquatic robot Aquatic robots propelled and maneuvered entirely via internal rotors or moving masses will be designed and provide a platform to validate the theoretical results

The significance of the project is that it will enhance the logical reasoning ability of students and thus improve the quality of the software they develop after graduation To make this possible the project will employ an integrated system of engaging interactive reasoning guides to help overcome individual and collective learning obstacles These guides will facilitate incremental learning for students and incremental adoption for educators The automation inherent in the guides will make them an ideal vehicle for impacting learning in personalized and online settings and for reaching a diverse audienceThe project goals include enabling students to reason correctly about code compositions on all valid inputs pinpointing fine-grain learning obstacles using a logical reasoning approach aided by an automated verification engine and tailoring the tutoring necessary to help students overcome those obstacles The scope includes common code idioms from the introductory programming repertoire and more advanced component-based software engineering concepts such as contracts The underlying verification engine makes it possible for the interactive guides to offer a class of learner activities and directed logical feedback not possible with standard IDEs (Interactive Development Environments) such as Eclipse Research and evaluation will focus on how well the guides engage students and how learning is improved

This research will investigate how salamanders respond to climate change by acclimating to new environments The capacity to adjust physiological traits may be especially important for amphibians because they are one of the most threatened groups of animals on the planet Amphibians use both terrestrial and aquatic environments and thus are particularly sensitive to environmental degradation due to climate change Unfortunately despite increased interest in response to climate change we know very little about how salamander populations will fare under changing conditions The goal of this project is to identify genes that may contribute to a salamander's ability to accommodate environmental change This study will help determine if salamander populations can evolve an increased capacity to deal with variable environments The study will also provide underrepresented college students the opportunity to develop independent inquiry-based projects in amphibian biology In response to climate change organisms must adapt acclimate migrate or potentially face extinction Adaptation is a heritable evolutionary change of a population over generations Acclimation is change that happens within the lifetime of an individual animal If individuals vary in their capacity to acclimate increased acclimation ability might itself evolve due to natural selection creating an adaptation of acclimation The study will determine the capacity of individual Southern grey-cheeked salamander (Plethodon metcalfi) to adjust rates of water loss in response to temperature and humidity Using a time-course experimental design the study will identify differences in gene expression between individuals that acclimate and individuals that do not acclimate and identify the genes that the salamanders use to reduce rates of water loss as temperature changes Upon identifying these genes the study will link the activity of those genes to specific physiological responses that alter water loss The result will be an increased understanding of the genetic basis of acclimation and adaptation to environmental cues

With the help of Online Social Networks (OSNs) people share personal and public information and make social connections with friends coworkers colleagues family and even with strangers As a result OSNs store a huge amount of sensitive information about users and their interactions To protect such information privacy control has been treated as a central feature of OSNs Although OSNs currently provide some privacy control mechanisms allowing users to regulate access to information they share users unfortunately have no control over data others share For instance if a user posts a comment in a friend's space s/he cannot specify which users can view the comment Similarly when a user uploads a photo and tags friends who appear in the photo the tagged friends cannot restrict who can see this photo Since multiple associated users may have different privacy concerns over the shared data privacy conflicts occur and the lack of collaborative privacy control increases the potential risk of leaking sensitive information by friends to the public To address such a critical issue it is essential to accommodate diverse privacy control requirements coming from multiple associated users for collaboratively managing the shared data in OSNs The new techniques developed in this project will substantially enhance the state-of-the-art in privacy-aware data sharing in OSNs and will have implications for the design of future collaborative sharing systems in OSNs Moreover since privacy practices in many other collaborative environments such as electronic health records and financial data sharing also require multiple users to co-manage the privacy of information the fundamental results generated by this project could be expanded to those collaborative environments beyond social networks The goal of this project is to seek an effective and flexible mechanism to enable privacy-aware collaborative data sharing in OSNs To this end the researchers will first analyze data sharing associated with multiple users in OSNs and articulate several typical scenarios of privacy conflicts to understand the risks posed by those conflicts To mitigate risks caused by privacy conflicts the researchers will investigate a collaborative data sharing mechanism to support the specification and enforcement of multiple privacy concerns In addition a systematic conflict detection and resolution mechanism will be created and evaluated with respect to its ability to cope with privacy conflicts occurring in collaborative management of data sharing in OSNs The conflict resolution in the project attempts to balance the need for privacy protection and users' desire for information sharing by quantitative analysis of privacy risk and sharing loss Another compelling feature of the proposed approach is the support of both theoretical and empirical analyses on privacy control in OSNs The researchers will analyze the strategic behaviors of rational users using a game-theoretic model where each player aims at accommodating her/his privacy concerns as much as possible by adjusting her/his privacy setting in collaborative data sharing in OSNs Furthermore the researchers will carry out empirical analysis for practical user behaviors and contrast it with the theoretical analysis in collaborative data sharing articulating the gap between the theoretic model and real user behaviors More details about this project including experimental data and curricular materials can be found on the project website (wwwcsclemsonedu/~hongxih/projects/gpc)

1531041 (Klotz) This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Environmental Sustainability program in the CBET Division in the ENG Directorate the Decision Risk and Management Sciences program in the SES Division of the SBE Directorate and the Office of Integrative Activities The project will extend - to upstream multi-stakeholder decision making for sustainability - the study of interventions designed to alleviate decision biases such as framing effects and social norms This topic will be studied in the context of defaults or starting points in development decisions for physical infrastructure which has long term impacts on various sustainability concerns Such decisions in infrastructure as in other domains are guided by decision aids including rating systems that do not take full advantage of advances in behavioral sciences in part because this is an area where interdisciplinary exchange of methods problems and solutions has been rare Through a collaboration that was established by the NSF RCN SUSSTAIN this project will examine whether and how default options presented to infrastructure designers can help them overcome barriers to the selection of more sustainable options Intentionally designed defaults will be studied in Envision a leading rating system for sustainable infrastructure The research plan follows an iterative process that begins with experimental work to test a series of default interventions with students and professionals using replicas of actual infrastructure development decisions Experiments will test the extent to which behavioral science theories translate to upstream multi-stakeholder decisions in particular whether choice defaults influence such decisions and through which of three channels: the cognitive energy required to make a decision; perceptions that the default is the recommended or social norm option; and by framing the outcome as a loss or gain Experiments will also explore whether disclosing interventions diminishes their effect Semi-structured interviews with decision makers will complement the experiments to explore the relative influence of the choice defaults compared to technical and economic considerations and compared to stakeholders' differing goals importance weightings and tradeoff values This project is set up to yield educational case studies to infuse research insights into engineering and behavioral science curricula

This project will investigate the use of virtual reality technologies to create virtual field experiences for use in introductory geosciences classes Although field experiences are an important aspect of geoscience education there are few opportunities to provide physical world experiences to many undergraduate students due to access logistical and financial constraints Thus geoscience instructors must develop novel teaching and learning opportunities that closely approximate the information elements and environment students would find on a physical in-person field study The types of virtual experiences developed through this project while different from their physical corollaries will give learners the chance to engage with learning content and activities through multi-modal interactions in the virtual environment The use of virtualization tools will create opportunities that give geoscience educators access to interactive contextualized teaching materials and learners access to a space for exploration and discovery The development of virtual reality field experiences will also create a pathway for a diverse audience of students to encounter the earth sciences particularly those from underrepresented groups resource-limited institutions and majors traditionally not directly involved in the earth sciences Enhancing access to educational opportunities for these groups will aid in developing the engaged diverse and earth-science literate population that is needed to address societal needs in a complex and changing worldThe project will develop a virtual reality field-trip of the Grand Canyon that will be accessible to a wide audience in diverse educational settings Through the experience students will develop core geoscience concepts as they find and evaluate evidence that will help them piece together the geologic history of the region In the virtual experience students will apply their knowledge of rock and mineral properties build their understanding of spatial and temporal relationships between Earth processes learn how these relationships are recorded in the rock and ultimately synthesize their observations into a coherent geologic story that they will encapsulate in lay terms as a virtual brochure for the Canyon The project will also develop a virtual reality toolbox for earth science educators that will facilitate the future development of additional virtual field activities The project will utilize new innovations in the field of virtual reality eg Oculus Rift technology to provide geoscience educators the means to give every student a first-person virtual field experience The virtual field experiences will be designed to emphasize key aspects of geoscience learning (ie temporal thinking spatial thinking earth systems and field learning) and integrate the 'Big Ideas' in geoscience proposed by the Earth Science Literacy Initiative The specific learning activities that will be developed in the project are strongly grounded in the existing geoscience education STEM education and game-based learning literature and will utilize built-in learning analytics for improved assessment of student learning By addressing both the affective and cognitive routes to learning this approach holds promise to increase student engagement and concept retention in the classroom

The research focuses on the Monin-Obukhov similarity hypothesis which is the theoretical foundation for understanding the surface layer of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) The hypothesis has been used successfully to scale many statistics (eg those containing the vertical velocity) in the surface layer However it fails to scale some other important statistics such as the horizontal velocity variances and the large-scale horizontal velocity spectra in the convective surface layerThe research will provide a more universal scaling framework for the influence of shear and buoyancy on the surface layer turbulence termed multi-point Monin-Obukhov similarity (MMO) In the research the PI will systematically investigate MMO through its spectral predictions and the spectral dynamics in the surface layer Systematical tests of the predicted large-scale velocity and temperature spectra using high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) fields will be conducted The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr Martin Otte at Computer Science Corporation (CSC) a research firm contracting with the Environmental Protection AgencyIntellectual Merit:The research addresses the critical issue of Monin-Obukhov similarity of the atmospheric surface layer It is expected to further validate MMO through its prediction of the turbulence spectra and cospectra; it will provide an important understanding of the physical basis for MMO Due to the central role of the Monin-Obukhov similarity in our understanding of the surface layer dynamics the research on MMO will provide a new framework for analyzing and understanding the surface layer turbulence and will have a strong impact on the understanding and modeling of the ABL in generalBroader Impacts:The research has broader impacts in several areas It will provide education and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students Improved understanding of the surface layer turbulence and the ABL in general will be of importance to developing predictive models for atmospheric dispersion and diffusion weather forecasting atmospheric chemistry wind energy and land-atmosphere exchange The modeling approach will also be important for modeling boundary layers with a strong pressure gradient (eg curved boundary layers) in the atmosphere and in engineering flows Advances in these areas will benefit the environment and society

This workshop proposal focuses on developing a national agenda for research in broadening participation in engineering by those who self-identify as persons with disabilities veterans low income/first generation or members of the LGBTQ community The effort to increase the numbers of students who study computer science and engineering is a national imperative Furthermore there is a need to ensure this workforce is representative of the nation's populations as a diverse workforce will spark greater innovation and creativity through the incorporation of multiple perspectives and experiences in the creation of technology Efforts to create a more diverse workforce have often focused on interventions to recruit and retain under-represented populations As a result progress has not occurred at a substantial rate as these efforts tend to be localized and not easily scaled What is needed is greater research in understanding the various factors that impede and influence the full participation of these underserved groupsThe project will convene a workshop of thought leaders including scholars practitioners policy makers and others from a broad spectrum of social science disciplines Brought together from across the nation the participants will seek to develop an understanding of how best to increase research capacity to better understand why these groups are so underrepresented in the computer science and engineering workforce Participants will identify existing research and new research possibilities regarding computing and engineering participation by persons from the specified under-served groups The goal is to help define the national agenda for areas of research in the field of broadening participation for these targeted populations in the engineering and computer science workforce

Adolescents have fully embraced social networks for socializing and communicating However cyberbullying has become widely recognized as a serious social problem especially for adolescents using social networks Also cyberbullying techniques change rapidly Perpetrators can use the camera-capacity of their mobile devices to bully others through making and distributing harmful pictures or videos of their victims via mobile social networks While the social and psychological aspects of cyberbullying have been the subject of intense study little research has been dedicated to tracing cyberbullying attacks accurately and automatically using computing technologies Indeed the development of automatic cyberbullying detection techniques is still in the nascent stages All state-of-the-art studies in automatic cyberbullying detection have mainly focused on the content of the text written by the perpetrators of cyberbullying (aka textual cyberbullying) while largely overlooking the misuse of visual media in cyberbullying This research reveals that there are great challenges that must urgently be resolved to ensure the most robust defense against visual cyberbullying attacksThis project is designing and developing a systematic solution for automatic detection of and intervention in visual cyberbullying attacks in emerging mobile social networks The researchers are identifying new person and situational factors associated with visual cyberbullying and designing a cross-feature classifier for automatic visual cyberbullying detection The project is also building an adaptive cyberbullying intervention system to continuously monitor situation changes in cyberbullying and provide specific response strategies for each associated participant The proposed methods can be potentially adopted and implemented in popular mobile social network platforms to prevent visual cyberbullying The system designed by this project could be used to curb the rising trend in instances of cyberbullying among young people and reducing the myriad harmful effects that follow from it In addition since many other common cyber threats targeting adolescents must also deal with visual media now the fundamental results generated by this project could be expanded to cope with those threats beyond cyberbullying
