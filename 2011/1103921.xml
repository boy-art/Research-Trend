    <AbstractNarration>The TIME Center has been instrumental in ensuring that Maryland's secondary and post-secondary programs keep pace with the rapid transformation of manufacturing from a mass-production, product-based industry to a customized production, knowledge-based, demand-driven industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TIME Center's goals and objectives are focused on educating manufacturing and engineering technicians (MET) to meet regional workforce demands and enhancing the advanced technical skills sets of new and incumbent technicians. Regional MET careers are evolving to demand broader and deeper skills and more integration of emerging and converging technologies. The goals, objectives and activities extend the work the Center has begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1: Developing and enhancing secondary/post-secondary manufacturing and engineering technology (MET) curricula in demand-driven program areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2: Providing professional development opportunities for secondary and post-secondary MET faculty that enhance their technical knowledge, improve their pedagogical skills and broaden their awareness of MET &amp; STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 3: Collaborating with partners and key stakeholder groups to increase the visibility and improve the image of manufacturing and engineering technology as viable career options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 4: Implementing innovative approaches to improve and enhance MET learning, providing broader access to MET learning opportunities and better integrating partner college efforts with economic development needs in their regions.</AbstractNarration>
