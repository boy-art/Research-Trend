    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is providing engineering undergraduate students the opportunity to engage in research in engineering education. Olin College is committed to understanding and improving undergraduate engineering education, and many of the faculty have active research programs in this area. Ten undergraduate students and two high school teachers each summer are working closely with Olin faculty on a wide range of research projects. For example, some teams are researching how engineering content is taught in colleges and universities, which is resulting in new educational materials and practices. Others are focusing on how to better develop professional and interpersonal skills, such as communication and teamwork, that complement technical engineering training. Still others are examining how being in an engineering program affects students' self-confidence, identity, and interest in engineering careers. The outcomes of the research are improving the recruitment, retention, and preparation of engineering students. The REU students are learning about educational research through their participation, which is also increasing their likelihood of continuing in engineering. All program participants, including teachers and professors, are reflecting on their own experiences in engineering and are becoming stronger advocates for improving engineering education at their institutions.</AbstractNarration>
