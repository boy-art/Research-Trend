    <AbstractNarration>Throughout their history, both humans and nonhuman animals experienced dark nights. This started to change ~120 years ago with the development of electrical lighting which illuminates our nights and most recently has led to urban and suburban light pollution. Normal physiology and behavior display a circadian organization that depends on clear light and dark signals, but the presence of light at night potentially disrupts temporal organization. Because of the convenience of electric lights, little thought has been given to their biological effects. This project will examine the effects of dim light at night on immune function in hamsters. By using established physiological, molecular, and genetic tests of immune function, the effects of night-time light on the immune system will be established. The project will train high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees of both sexes from diverse cultural and historically-underrepresented backgrounds during the conduct of this project. All experimental results will be made easily accessible to the general public through publications, websites, popular press, and presentations at professional societies, community forums, colleges, and universities. An interactive website where scientists and lay people can upload light-at-night illumination levels to get a finer-grain appreciation of light pollution than typically provided by satellite maps will be established and maintained. The results will provide insight into how vertebrates may respond to global change in the near future, how emergent diseases may arise as immune regulation changes, as well as provide unique insights as to how environmental control mechanisms evolved and how they are potentially disrupted by unintended light pollution.</AbstractNarration>
