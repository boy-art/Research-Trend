    <AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Douglas of the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities for studies toward the activation and functionalization of carbon sigma bonds adjacent to carbonyls. First, new methods involving the metal-promoted activation of these bonds in ketones, esters, and aldehydes will be developed. A major focus will be on the insertion of unsaturated groups into the activated bonds. Second, mechanistic work will be undertaken to develop a deeper understanding of the new reactivity develop. Cross-over and kinetic isotope effect experiments will teach us how the reactions proceed and give insight in to the development of improved catalyst systems and asymmetric processes. Finally the methods developed under this award will be applied to a diverse set of synthesis challenges. Applications will range from the synthesis of commodity chemical feedstocks like methyl ethyl ketone to the synthesis of complex natural products like dragmacidin E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Douglas will also initiate two educational projects that interweave research and teaching. The first project involves discovery-based learning in the large chemistry classroom. A hybrid, guided-inquiry and traditional-lecture teaching plan for introductory organic chemistry will be piloted and tested against appropriate control groups. The second program is an outreach program involving a local recording-arts high school that serves at-risk children from predominantly underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
