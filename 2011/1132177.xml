    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial funding to support workshops on Multiscale Modeling for Multifunctional Analysis and Design (MMMAD) and Challenges in Computational Multiscale Materials Modeling (CCMMM) to be held in Arlington, Virginia. These workshops are part of a series of three interdisciplinary workshops that will focus on experimental and computational methods in multiscale analysis and design. The workshops will be held from 2 thru 5 May 2011 and are entitled:&lt;br/&gt;(i) Experimental Multiscale Methods (EMM), &lt;br/&gt;(ii) Multiscale Modeling for Multifunctional Analysis and Design (MMMAD), and&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Challenges in Computational Multiscale Materials Modeling (CCMMM). &lt;br/&gt;The workshop series will be sponsored by multiple government agencies, viz. ARO, AFOSR and NSF. The EMM workshop will focus on measurement of deformation and experimental methods across scales. It will also address validation of multiscale models by means of multiscale experiments. The MMMAD workshop will discuss specific challenges pertaining to the development of robust multiscale computational analysis-design platforms for multifunctional materials and structures. The CCMMM workshop will address critical issues that confront the computational multiscale materials modeling research discipline for comprehensive analysis of complex material structure interactions at a broad range of length and time scales. The workshops will address critical challenges and needs in establishing robust spatio-temporal multiscale modeling of material systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential of the multiscale modeling paradigm is unfathomable at the current stages, given the tremendous growth in various aspects of this discipline. The theme is consistent with current trends in Integrated Computational Materials Science and Engineering (ICMSE) and Simulation based Engineering &amp; Sciences (SBES) to guide the design of novel systems that meet specifications of performance and reliability. The proposed workshop series will bring together researchers from academia, industry and national laboratories to identify major challenges and research objectives for developing robust multiscale modeling and design platforms. A comprehensive report will result from this workshop which will be an important roadmap for future strategic developments in this field.</AbstractNarration>
