    <AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to observe, document and analyze the current surge of Bering Glacier and derive parameters that capture deformation characteristics during surge stages and provide information that may facilitate mechanical modeling of fast glacier movement. Observations will include aerial GPS, video and photographic data, fixed laser profilometry and time-sequenced satellite imagery. Analysis of the surge propagation will employ an automated spatial-statistical/connectionist approach developed by the PI, this allows derivation of deformation characteristics, as evident in surge crevasse structures from imagery, and linkage of them to ice dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glacier surges can have an immediate and detrimental impact on ecosystems situated in their path. Few such surges have been carefully observed and described making it difficult to understand what characteristics of surging glaciers can be expected as typical and what range of variability is realistic to anticipate. This makes long-range management planning and risk assessment for such systems difficult. The proposed research will contribute to the resolution of this issue.</AbstractNarration>
