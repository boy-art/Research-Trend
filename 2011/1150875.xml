    <AbstractNarration>With this CAREER award, the Chemistry Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Uttam K. Tambar of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Professor Tambar will develop novel molecular reorganization processes, wherein a simple starting material selectively rearranges into a more complex and more valuable product. Molecular rearrangements have pervaded organic chemistry for decades. In fact, some of the most fundamental principles of chemical reactivity were elucidated in the context of molecular rearrangements. Professor Tambar is interested in studying areas of molecular reorganization that are underdeveloped. His group will develop selective rearrangements that will facilitate the synthesis of complex molecules, including polycyclic natural products. In the process of developing these new transformations, Professor Tambar's group will focus on elucidating new concepts in chemical reactivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Tambar will also initiate new educational activities that will integrate his research goals with his commitment to educate the broader community of chemistry's role in improving our quality of life. These initiatives include introducing elementary school students to chemical synthesis, improving Chemical Safety Training for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists at his university, and organizing Science Caf√©s for the general public of Dallas-Fort Worth area.</AbstractNarration>
