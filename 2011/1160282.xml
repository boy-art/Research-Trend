    <AbstractNarration>The grant will support student travel to the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI'12) and a pre-conference workshop on discussing collaboration in research and education between US and Chinese researchers, titled Trends in Concurrency (TiC'12). The main conference, PLDI, is being held in Beijing, China. PLDI is a top conference in the field of programming language and compiler technology. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.</AbstractNarration>
