    <AbstractNarration>Development of innovative thinking skill among engineering undergraduates is of critical importance in designing new products/systems and creating new services, and thus is vital to the national economy. This project examines whether effective use of instructional technology, specifically slate-enabled technology, has an impact on the innovative thinking skills of engineering undergraduates enrolled in large lecture classes, and develops and implements a pedagogical model based on the findings. The methodology used is a quasi-experimental mixed method approach utilizing a control and treatment group. Data are being collected through surveys (i.e., quantitative assessment) and interviews, focus groups, and direct observation (i.e., qualitative assessment). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project advances understanding of how students learn to be innovative through determination of measurable and identifiable learning outcomes. In addition, information about how best to teach innovative thinking skills among undergraduates in an active and engaging educational environment using slate-enabled instructional technology provides a useful educational model. The model considers faculty motivation for employing active and engaging learning strategies that utilize slate-enabled instructional technology in developing innovative thinking, the infrastructure (e.g., wireless capabilities, student requirements, technology support) that is necessary to facilitate such a model, and how to assess the extent to which the employment of the model has been effective. The project has the potential to produce information that will lead to transformative change in undergraduate STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
