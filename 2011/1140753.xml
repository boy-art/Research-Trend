    <AbstractNarration>Rowan University is developing, evaluating, disseminating and supporting the broad adoption of a project-based curriculum to help all computer science undergraduate students understand and apply classic algorithm design techniques for solving intractable problems. This novel, award winning curriculum is a sequence of laboratory projects comprising increasingly sophisticated solvers for a single intractable problem. To facilitate broad adoption, this award funds the development of three sets of projects based on intractable problems from different domains: Satisfiability, Traveling Salesperson and Sequence Alignment. This project makes a significant contribution to computer science education by establishing the effectiveness of project-based learning in the study of algorithm design techniques for intractable problems. The project has the potential for national adoption, for a direct impact on computer science educational practices, and for advancing knowledge in the discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To encourage adoption, an extensive faculty guide is being developed and disseminated. The project funds the attendance of potential adopters at a training workshop as well as the development of an online community of adopters. Adopters will have the opportunity to publish and present an experience paper at a national conference.</AbstractNarration>
