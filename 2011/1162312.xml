    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the research is to demonstrate direct growth of 2D carbon (graphene) sheets on insulator via an innovative chemical process, laying the foundation for integrated, scalable carbon-based manufacturing. Aiming at removing the known barriers to preparing "integratable" carbon nanostructures, the research is composed of the following parts: (i) developing a chemical growth process for controlled assembly of single-layer graphene on an insulating substrate and discovering key mechanisms and pathways towards an integrated manufacturing process, and (ii) demonstrating two representative circuit elements on the carbon platform, graphene transistors and graphene nanowire interconnects, and correlating critical electrical performance and reliability metrics to material configurations, extrinsic effects (e.g., material imperfections), and nanofabrication processes. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate a seamlessly integrated material-processing platform with compatibility with the existing semiconductor integrated chip manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research would overcome several major difficulties in the implementation of "integratable carbon-based manufacturing", challenging the present-day dominance of silicon electronics. The research could be potentially important in closing the big gap between science-driven research on 2D nanomaterials and commercial development in the microelectronics industry. In a broader view, the proposed integrated processing strategy could be extended to a broad family of emerging 2D/3D nanostructures. The integrated material platform has major potential impacts in a wide variety of arenas, including computing, broad-band/low-noise RF communication, high-speed interconnects, photovoltaics, distributed sensing networks, and heterogeneous integration of multifunctions via innovative engineering design. The research opens unique opportunities for students to acquire interdisciplinary research experience in material sciences and engineering, physics, devices, nanofabrication, and wafer-fab processing.</AbstractNarration>
