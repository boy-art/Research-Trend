    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to create the first set of quantum interference based slow and stopped light photonic devices. Quantum interference creates some of the strongest light-matter interactions ever observed, including electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), slow light, and stopped light. A large number of possible applications exist, including optical data processing, enhanced sensing, (quantum) optical memories, and quantum information processing. However, to date there is no viable platform that combines large quantum interference effects with photonic device integration.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to explore the use of a recently developed self-contained atomic spectroscopy platform for creating a new class of photonic devices based on quantum interference. To this end, a second generation hollow-core waveguide spectroscopy chip for high temperature and high optical density operation will be developed and used to demonstrate stopped light on a chip. A set of novel, canonical photonic devices for chip-scale sensing and optical signal processing based on quantum interference, slow and stopped light will be demonstrated. This new class of devices will have transformative impact on the use of non-solid (atomic) media for photonics.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work are to unite several fields, including microfabrication, integrated optics, atomic spectroscopy, and device physics. This collaborative project will provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to acquire a unique, multidisciplinary skill set. The program is complemented by a number of outreach efforts to recruit undergraduate students from underrepresented groups through established and successful programs at UCSC and BYU, respectively.</AbstractNarration>
