    <AbstractNarration>Recent studies suggest that an internal biological clock (circadian clock) modulates several aspects of learning and memory including acquisition, retention, and recall such that the ability to form and/or recall new memories may be quite different at one time of day than another. Neither the mechanisms by which the circadian system regulates these processes nor the extent and functional importance of their circadian regulation are well understood. The goal of this project is to evaluate the role of the circadian clock in regulating the formation and recall of associative memories, comparing memories formed by classical (Pavlovian) conditioning with those formed by operant (instrumental) conditioning. Preliminary studies indicate there are major differences in the role of the clock in regulating memory formation and recall for the two types of conditioning, and the project will address both functional significance and mechanism underlying these differences. The results of the experiments will provide new insight into our understanding of how animals learn and of processes that regulate the ability to learn. The project will also provide exceptional opportunities for research training of graduate and undergraduate students, and for engaging high school students and the general public in the research enterprise though several outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>
