    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant will implement a rigorous experimental methodology to examine the impact of team activities on the self-efficacy of women engineering students. The research project engages complementary expertise in engineering and psychology, and builds on existing networks and resources at the PIs institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises from the increasing importance of teams in engineering courses and curricula. Since recent research demonstrates the impact of self-efficacy on how well students learn, this work can broadly inform efforts to produce a better trained engineering workforce. A vigorous plan to disseminate the results of this research is proposed. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
