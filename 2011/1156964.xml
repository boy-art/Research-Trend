    <AbstractNarration>This award to the Bucknell University "Summer Research Program in Physics and Astronomy" will give 8 undergraduate students per summer the opportunity to collaborate with a member of the Bucknell faculty for 10 weeks on his or her research. Projects to be offered cover a broad range of topics, including experimental atomic and molecular physics, theoretical statistical mechanics, quantum information theory, theoretical quantum optics, computer simulation, experimental nonlinear dynamics, astronomy, and geophysics. This immersion in a research environment is intended to complement traditional classroom experiences of the students. Participation will help students make career choices, and will provide specific preparation for those that continue on to graduate studies in physics. Students will be recruited from around the country. All of the students will live together on the Bucknell campus, conduct most of their research in on-campus facilities, and participate in weekly departmental seminars and colloquia. Students will have the opportunity to present their work in regional and national conferences. Finally, it is anticipated that much of the work of the participants will be published in peer reviewed journals and these papers will include students as co-authors. This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
