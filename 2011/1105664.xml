    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the project is to increase the US participation in the Workshop on Geometric Group Theory held at the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research, with a particular emphasis on graduate students, junior researchers and minorities underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. The workshop will focus on the interactions between geometric group theory and non-commutative geometry, in particular, on approximation properties including amenability, the Haagerup property, property A (exactness of groups), their connections to ordinary group cohomology and bounded cohomology and applications to the Baum-Connes and Novikov conjectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop, to be held in Bristol, UK, will serve as an excellent international platform for exchanging ideas. It will feature open problem sessions, ``ask the expert" question-and-answer sessions aimed at junior researchers and will provide a perfect opportunity for young mathematicians to establish connections and new collaborations which will benefit them in the future. Europe and the United States have leading researchers working in geometric and analytic group theory and there is an ongoing need for sharing knowledge in this active area of mathematical research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Analysis Program.</AbstractNarration>
