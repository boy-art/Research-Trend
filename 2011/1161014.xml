    <AbstractNarration>IIP 1161022 &lt;br/&gt;University of Florida &lt;br/&gt;George &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP - 1161014 &lt;br/&gt;The George Washington University &lt;br/&gt;El-Ghazawi &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests a five year renewal (phase II) of NSF funding for the University of Florida (UF) and the University of George Washington (GWU) sites for the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHREC is currently comprised of the University of Florida (UF) as the lead institution, the George Washington University, Brigham Young University (BYU), and Virginia Tech as research partners. These institutions were brought together to establish the CHREC I/UCRC to investigate, develop, and evaluate new concepts, methods, infrastructure, and tools in reconfigurable high-performance computing (HPC) and high-performance embedded computing (HPEC), from building-block devices to hardware and software infrastructure to applications and tools, and advance these technologies through research and education for the benefit of Center members, students, and the discipline at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHREC is ideally situated to explore key research challenges of specific interest and paramount importance to its membership. The proposed university sites possess the expertise, experience, base of high-quality students, cutting-edge facilities, and administrative commitment to support this endeavor, as well as a strong record of success. Areas of research thrust for the next phase of CHREC include: design automation and programming methods; algorithms and applications; device and core building blocks; and systems and services. CHREC will continue and expand its role as the first university/industry research center in this fast-growing and increasingly important field of computer engineering. Research results will lead to new concepts, technologies, insights, and tools in reconfigurable computing for HPC and HPEC, experience rapid technology transfer via the I/UCRC structure, and thereby enrich and expand the nation's lead in these vital industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHREC will continue to have a direct impact upon the success of this field as a whole by helping support a national R&amp;D plan and serving as a catalyst that brings leading organizations together to define common goals, methods, and standards. The PIs will continue to integrate the research results into the university educational process with expanded programs at multiple levels in engineering, and state-of-the-art facilities will be leveraged. Activities will be structured to attract a diverse set of students and faculty, including underrepresented students via several minority recruitment programs. Broad dissemination of results will occur through scholarly journal and conference publications, the center web site, and press releases.</AbstractNarration>
