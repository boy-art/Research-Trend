    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Dikarev of the Department of Chemistry at University at Albany will broadly explore heterometallic alpha-diketonates as single-source precursors for the synthesis of mixed-metal materials. Specific combinations of heavy metals (Ba, Sn, Pb, Bi, RE) with 3d transition metals (Ti/Ni) that result in materials with valuable multiferroic properties will be targeted. This work will focus on volatile single-source precursors that can be used in MOCVD preparation of thin films, deposition on solid support, growth of single crystals, and formation of nanoparticles. It will be demonstrated that heterometallic diketonates are universal precursors that can be explored for the preparation of a wide array of multiferroic materials: oxides, oxyfluorides, fluorides, and silicates. The broader impacts involve an enhancement of the educational and research experiences of graduate and undergraduate students and participation in university wide and community initiatives, such as continuing development of forensic chemistry program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will lead to more efficient preparation of new class of multifunctional materials called multiferroics. Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on other areas of materials chemistry in which the synthesis of mixed-metal compounds is needed, such as high-temperature superconductors, rechargeable battery electrodes, and chemical sensors. In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to graduate, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
