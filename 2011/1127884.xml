    <AbstractNarration>Scientists across the globe are investigating the effects of toxic exposure on human cells. This study poses the following research questions: How do scientists define and measure environmental exposure? How do scientists designate, test and collect evidence for laying claims about the effects of environmental toxins on bodies and biologies? At exactly what point do scientists feel they can identify when and how 'external' chemicals and 'internal' biologies affect each other? How are scientists both confronted with and using environmental degradation as the means through which to advance cutting-edge basic laboratory research in an internationalized research climate? The researcher proposes to conduct 18 months of fieldwork in order to investigate the social dimensions of research scientists' methods, practices, research questions, and concerns. Fieldwork will be conducted in laboratories, department and university meetings, and research publication and presentation preparation meetings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have broad impact by illuminating how scientists define and study environmental exposures. It contributes to science and technology studies, anthropology of science, and environmental science. By studying the way cells interact with environment toxins, primarily chemical pesticides, these scientists attempt to bring evidence to bare on many countries' toughest social dilemma - how to improve citizens' quality of life without quickly destroying the quality of the environment.</AbstractNarration>
