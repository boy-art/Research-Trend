    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to define and understand the concept of critical thinking in engineering, determine differences in how engineering students and engineering faculty view and instantiate critical thinking, and differentiate engineering's definition from those of other disciplines. This work explores and will clarify foundational definitions within engineering education that are common across many degree programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project, if successful, will be to help faculty and curriculum designers in supporting the development of critical thinking in engineering degree programs. Additionally the research technique that will be used may help engineering educators understand how different groups define and enact critical thinking. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting existing fields. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
