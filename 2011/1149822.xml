    <AbstractNarration>The timing of flowering is especially important in plant development because it directly impacts reproductive success. For example, flowering at the wrong time could mean that important pollinators are not present or that fragile embryos will be subjected to freezing temperatures. Thus, plants have complex and highly specific mechanisms to harmonize flowering with the natural ecosystems in which they evolved. Understanding flowering time has further important implications in agricultural settings, as flowering time can have profound effects on the overall production of commercially valuable vegetative organs, fruits, and seeds. To properly time flowering, many plants have an internal clock that monitors day length (photoperiod) and seasonally activates genes that drive the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth. In particular, activation of the floral integrator gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is an essential early step in the photoperiod-regulated transition to flowering. This project uses a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to specifically investigate how regulatory proteins called NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) mechanistically control FT expression to initiate flowering. In addition to potentially impacting agricultural production and our collective understanding of natural ecosystems, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students in both the research and classroom laboratories. Elements of the research aims will be incorporated into an upper division Plant Physiology course. Additionally, molecular plant biology forums will be initiated as part of an effort to improve collaborative interactions among Oklahoma researchers. All discoveries and resources developed from this funding will be made freely publicly available through a combination of peer-reviewed publications, distribution to public stock centers/data repositories, and direct distribution of materials.</AbstractNarration>
