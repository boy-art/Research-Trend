    <AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will enhance the Nation's knowledge of the impact of providing relevant STEM instruction, on recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. For those students entering the workforce directly from the college, it is important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navajo Technical University will develop a two-year engineering technology degree to complement their four-year engineering and digital manufacturing programs. The two-year degree will create a milestone that will encourage students to start a STEM degree while opening a pathway to a bachelor's degree. The project will increase faculty skills in relevant technologies and create a model for incorporating advanced manufacturing technology in engineering education, particularly at tribal colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>
