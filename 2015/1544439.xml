    <AbstractNarration>Glenn McClure, a composer and professor of music, will create an orchestral and choral musical composition by translating subsonic frequency data, obtained by the researcher Dr. Peter Bromirski studying the shifting Ross Ice Shelf, into musical frequencies within the range of human hearing. McClure will also record audible ambient sounds that will enhance his composition as well as take video and still images for projection during live performances of his finished piece. The goal is to deliver an artistic experience of the scientific concepts the music is based on and convey an emotional experience of the effects of changing conditions of the Ross Ice Shelf. In addition to his composition, McClure will create an instructional module with the goal of empowering middle-school students with the ability to create their own musical works from scientific data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project holds relevance for the general public and the educational community as a new motivational instructional tool for science, in general, and Antarctica, specifically. The deliverables will include sheet music, rehearsal recordings, videos to accompany live performances, composer's notes and links to Antarctic resources for extended study. The educational products will include the arts integrated instructional module, an online community of practice, other online resources, and a platform to celebrate exemplary student work. McClure has identified multiple potential dissemination channels for live performances of his compositions in addition to YouTube videos and other outreach opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
