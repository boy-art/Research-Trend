    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This REU Site will introduce students and teachers to research in biomaterials research. The development of personalized health and assistive care technologies relies on understanding the interplay of materials and biology. Students will work on projects in bio-inspired engineering, wound healing and tissue engineering, medical diagnostic and drug delivery technologies, and soft robotics and prosthetic devices. The BRIDGE Program at Harvard has a strong emphasis on gateway students, especially those students with little or no previous research experience. Student recruitment focuses on students from underrepresented groups, students at non-research intensive institutions, and non-traditional students who have re-entered college, in particular veterans of the armed forces. Students and teachers who are deaf/hard of hearing will also be recruited. Therefore, research projects are designed to be relevant and accessible for military veterans and students with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This REU Site, Biomaterials Research Initiative Dedicated to Gateway Experiences, focuses on the interplay of materials science and bioengineering via 3 themes: (1) Understanding and exploiting bio-inspired nano- and microscale structures; (2) Tunable materials and devices for diagnostics, tissue engineering and drug delivery; and (3) Materials and strategies for soft and adaptive robotics. The research activities include studies that combine experiment with theory and/or simulation in the study and design of interfaces between cells and surfaces; tunable structures, gels and networks; drug delivery systems; tissue culture scaffolds; and multi-functional biomaterials such as photonic and electronic biomaterials. Importantly, the topics are chosen to appeal to a wide population of students who are at early stages of their academic development, and who have limited awareness of career paths. Research projects are also designed to be relevant and accessible for military veterans and students with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
