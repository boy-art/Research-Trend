    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), entitled, "Bioengineering and Biomanufacturing", will engage a diverse cohort of students in research projects with an intellectual focus on engineering biological systems and biomanufacturing. A combination of computational and experimental research will be conducted on projects related to biomedical, chemical or biological engineering. The development of engineered biological systems for medical, biotechnological or chemical applications remains an important research challenge for a broad range of applications. The proposed REU site will focus on both the research and development that goes into developing new bio-based technologies and their manufacture. The proposed integrated training experience will guide undergraduate students, recruited from underrepresented groups from non-research-intensive schools, through a research project; while also helping them understand how they could pursue an engineering career. Cohort building and inter-cohort interactions between REU students and graduate/high-school students will be integrated into the program for community building and to provide students with opportunities for mentoring and to serve as mentors to future engineers and scientists. The programs' research results will be disseminated broadly by the PIs, participating faculty, and students via scientific publications, conference presentations, and internet-accessble materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each undergraduate student will conduct research over a ten week summer experience on a project that is designed for his/her abilities, under the mentorship of both a faculty member and graduate student. The twenty participating REU faculty have highly active, externally funded research programs and include undergraduates in their research teams and as co-authors on publications. Weekly workshops that address communication, ethics, mentoring, and the nature of research will help the students gain professional skills and personal confidence that are critical for their success.</AbstractNarration>
