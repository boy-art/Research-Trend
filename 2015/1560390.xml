    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites Program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor Randolph S. Duran recruits cohorts of students, primarily selected from the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) in STEM Program, which has sites nationwide. The students who become members of this International Research Experiences for Undergraduates (iREU) Site conduct summer research in France and Belgium. The goal is to provide deep scientific and cultural immersion learning experiences during which participants obtain publication-quality results. Strong translational infrastructure, such as innovation campuses at each location, gives participants exposure to how research discoveries can lead to start-up companies in this international setting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This iREU Site focuses on the chemical aspects of sophisticated nanoscience and biotechnology, giving students an early experience at bridging the gap between basic research and emerging applications. The unique and close interactions among university research, high technology companies, and national laboratories provide students the opportunities to experience a network of research not typically available to students at their home institutions. The facilities, from high-tech scale-up to international user facilities, are also different from many research universities in the United States. Students with previous experience and a strong desire to continue in STEM areas are recruited, with emphasis on NSF-LSAMP Programs nationwide. The international collaborators show institution commitment by developing a way to credit iREU students with the equivalent of European Master's degrees, based on performance. Outstanding facilities and research support at the proposed locations ensure sufficient resources for participants.</AbstractNarration>
