    <AbstractNarration>1545637&lt;br/&gt;Trail&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant supports a laboratory technician over a two year period. The technician will be responsible for daily operations of an extant laser ablation microprobe equipped inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS), testing and developing glass and mineral standards for geochemistry research, and assisting external users with the operation of piston cylinders used to synthesize phases in the experimental petrology lab at the University of Rochester. This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of training the next generation scientific workforce in modern experimental and materials analysis techniques which this new position will foster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technician will directly support PI, student and regional collaborator research in experimental petrology and geochemistry including studies of Earth?s earliest evidence of crustal differentiation based on chemical analysis of ancient zircons, fundamental studies of isotope fractionation between mineral phases in experimental run products in support of environmental proxy development, studies of trace element distributions and valence state determinations in accessory phases from ash deposits to assess the redox state of the parent magmas, and trace element investigations in support of studies in tectonics, metamorphic petrology and as indicators of artifact provenance for studies in archeology, to name a few.</AbstractNarration>
