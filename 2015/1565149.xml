    <AbstractNarration>The STEM-Pros project at Upper Iowa University (UIU) will increase recruitment, retention, and degree completion while preparing STEM professionals for the 21st century workplace. STEM-Pros scholars will develop their full potential as STEM professionals by establishing self-identity and acquiring the skills to define and solve complex problems. With faculty guidance, academic supports, co-curricular experiences, and innovative family programming, students will more fully engage in their chosen fields and thus persist in overcoming challenges. STEM-Pros will focus on four majors (environmental science, forensic science, computing sciences/information technology, and mathematics), and will provide support for 14 students over five years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impacts of family-oriented programming on retention, academic achievement, and STEM career trajectories of 14 STEM-Pros scholars will be assessed using a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental study, conducted with an external evaluator. The evaluation will utilize a nonequivalent comparison group with dependent pretest and posttest samples. To reduce selection differences, the treatment group (students that receive family-oriented programming) will be matched with a comparison group (students in the same program and department, but that do not receive family-oriented programming) on characteristics associated with outcomes including gender, GPA, and other factors. Qualitative and quantitative instruments will be used in interviews and online questionnaires of individuals including: (1) two STEM-Pros cohorts and their matched comparison cohorts; (2) local STEM industry partners; (3) family orientation participants and facilitators; and (4) management team.</AbstractNarration>
