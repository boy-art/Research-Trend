    <AbstractNarration>This REU site will engage students in research related to water resource management issues in the Yucat치n Peninsula in Mexico. Science and engineering undergraduate students will work with faculty mentors from Northern Illinois University, Northeastern Illinois University, and the Yucat치n Center of Scientific Research on projects related to groundwater recharge, groundwater contamination and public health, and groundwater geophysics. The goals of this REU site include: develop scientific skills in the field and laboratory, install in students a global perspective of water resource issues, develop communication skills in the participants, and develop appreciation for international scientific collaborations. The student projects will be interconnected to better understand the water issues in Yucat치n within a cultural and historical context. Because the research project is in Mexico and encompasses a cultural aspect, it is expected that students interested in the region will be attracted to apply. In addition to carrying out research, the participants will produce materials for online platforms to share information with the public, make presentations in Mexico to local officials about the research findings, and publish the results in open access journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During an eight-week period, the program will provide a high quality research environment and mentoring to a diverse group of 8 undergraduate students that may not otherwise have the opportunity to be engaged in scientific activities in an international context. The summer experience will consist of: (1) two weeks at Northern Illinois University where participants will define the research they will pursue in the field, participate in ethics training, discuss the relationship between culture and water issues in Yucat치n, receive safety and travel information, and virtually meet the team members from Mexico; (2) the next four weeks will be spent in Mexico sampling and collecting field data; the participants will stay in local neighborhoods, away from the tourist areas to gain more in-depth appreciation for the culture. During this period, participants will be working side by side with Mexican scientists and students; and (3) the last two weeks participants will return to Northern Illinois University to continue with data analyses and synthesis.</AbstractNarration>
