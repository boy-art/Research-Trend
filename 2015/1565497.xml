    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A program of the National Science Foundation, Professor Oliver Monti of the University of Arizona is studying organic molecules on metal surfaces, with a specific focus on how the structure of the molecules and the metal influences the rate at which electrons can be transferred from the metal surface to the molecule (and vice versa).  Professor Monti's research group uses several experimental techniques in this investigation, including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which can image individual atoms and molecules, and photoelectron spectroscopy, which uses intense laser light to eject electrons from the sample, and reveals how strongly electrons are bound to either the molecule or the surface.   This electrons transfer from metal surface to molecule must be carefully controlled for improved catalysis, new sensor technologies and novel approaches to energy conversion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a systematic and fundamental understanding of the interplay of electronic structure, self-assembly and carrier dynamics at organic semiconductor / metal interfaces. Professor Monti combines atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy with momentum- and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of interfaces with systematically varied molecular and surface electronic structure to enable predictive tailoring of charge flow across interfaces. Charge-transfer across interfaces constitutes a central process in heterogeneous catalysis, electrochemistry and novel organic electronic technologies. Beyond training the next generation of scientists in Chemistry, Professor Monti and his students are developing and disseminating a database of organic semiconductors which links key molecular properties to device performance. This database is also used in active engagement classroom activities at The University of Arizona to develop the concept of structure-property relationships within the General Chemistry curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
