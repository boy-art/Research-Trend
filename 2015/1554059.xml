    <AbstractNarration>The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) will collaborate with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) on a two-year study and implementation project designed to increase the involvement of primary and secondary school teachers in policy leadership. Teachers who are previous recipients of Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST) will be recruited for this project. PAEMST is a White House program established by statute in 1983 to honor superior teaching and accomplishment at the K-12 level. It is administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF) on behalf of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paramount goal of this NSTA project will be establishment of a nationwide corps of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teacher ambassadors who will speak for and about the critical importance of STEM education for our Nation's workforce development, economic growth and wealth creation for all segments of society. Teacher ambassadors will work with local and state business leaders, civic organizations, school districts and other like-minded community members to bridge the gap between policymakers and educators. Teachers will have more in-depth look at how decision makers make policy, and how as STEM ambassadors they share information with others on the importance of STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSTA project will begin in the first year with a select pilot group of ten previous PAEMST recipients (five science and five math teachers) based on applications from PAEMST winners in the 50 states and four U.S. jurisdictions. Applications will be screened by a selection committee identified by NSTA and NCTM. They will receive intensive training in communications, media, and policy and will establish leadership connections in their home states' science or math teacher association chapters. Beginning with year two of the project (and for all succeeding years) ten additional teachers will be added to this emerging national corps. Teacher ambassadors will represent the broad demographic in American teaching (gender, culture, socio-economic status; and urban, suburban, and rural location). Teacher ambassadors will receive ongoing training and connections to important resources from both NSTA and NCTM.</AbstractNarration>
