    <AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge on the material properties of sandwich beam parts created by selective laser melting using titanium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navajo Technical University (NTU) will examine data from two different designs and their meanings and lay the groundwork for comparing other sandwich beam designs, thereby leading to designs for optimum strength-to-weight ratio. The research will explore two constructs, stretch-dominated (truss-type lattice cells) and bend-dominated (dodecahedron-type lattice cells) beam structures, using simple supported bending experiments. The research will explore creating and simulating 3D computer models of the test specimens using off-the-shelf analysis software. NTU will collaborate with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), which will include but not be limited to guiding appropriate structure designs for testing and testing process data collection. Another aspect of testing will use a high-speed camera system to gain full view analysis of the forces, force vectors and in-process white light scanning.The project also uses cutting edge techniques that capture real-time force data to plot accordingly, which will provide a more expansive interpretation of test data. Comparing test specimens created on two different machines with dissimilar surface finishes may demonstrate an impact on the test specimens' ability to resist bending forces.</AbstractNarration>
