    <AbstractNarration>The Siple Transmitter Experiment, operated in Antarctica from 1973 to 1988 under sponsorship from the National Science Foundation, provided scientific researchers with a heretofore unmatched opportunity to perform controlled experiments to study nonlinear wave-particle interactions. Very low frequency waves radiated by the transmitter at the Antarctic Siple Station propagated into the Earth?s magnetosphere where they interacted with the energetic electrons in the Radiation Belts. This interaction modified the waves, amplifying them and generating new rising and falling frequency components. The modified waves were observed with radio receivers on the ground at the Northern Hemisphere conjugate points of the same geomagnetic field line. These "triggered" waves bear similarities to naturally occurring "chorus" type waves that are a major driver of space weather processes. The data were recorded and later digitized under the Air Force Research Laboratory data-preservation award. Analyzing this legacy dataset with modern techniques and comparing observations to the latest numerical models will help resolve outstanding issues in space weather research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whistler-mode waves are the electromagnetic waves with frequency of about 100 Hz-30 kHz, observed in Earth?s magnetosphere, and they are one of the major factors significantly affecting the energetic electrons population in the Earth's Radiation Belts. Despite many decades of active research, important questions on the whistler waves interaction with energetic electrons in the Radiation Belts still remain unanswered, which does not allow us to predict reliably the intensity of energetic electron fluxes in the Radiation Belts. These fluxes of energetic particles may significantly affect spacecraft in the geostationary and low orbits, astronauts in the space station, as well space-based scientific, military, and communication satellites. This project will study previously accumulated collection of data from the Siple Transmitter Experiment. Statistical analysis of these data in combination with numerical simulations will be used to characterize the dynamics of nonlinear interactions of whistler waves with energetic particles, focusing on the wave growth and generation of newly triggered emissions. This data analysis will guide advanced numerical simulations of the wave-particle interactions in order to understand fundamental physical processes involved, such as generation of naturally occurring plasma waves called "chorus" and "hiss" and also electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. This research project will enhance infrastructure for research and education through a strong collaboration between two academic institutions and contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
