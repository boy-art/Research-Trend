    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Drexel University engages undergraduate students in research focused around the critical and timely engineering challenges on topics related to energy and the environment utilizing the principles of experiential learning. With concerted recruitment of underrepresented minorities, women, and those who do not have access to advanced research facilities at their own educational institutions, this REU Site promises to open new career paths to some of the best and brightest students in the nation who might otherwise miss out on these opportunities. The REU Site addresses two critical needs faced by the nation: 1) effectively developing human resources in science and engineering, and 2) addressing the scientific challenges on energy and the environment directly benefiting the ability to create a better, more sustainable future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in energy and environment related research during a 9-week summer program. The REU will encourage undergraduate students to explore research careers, develop graduate student educational and mentoring expertise, create collaborations on many levels, and inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. The three main objectives of the Site are: 1) Provide experiential learning research opportunities to students and their faculty advisors from institutions that do not typically offer research experiences to undergraduate students, with a particular emphasis on underrepresented minority groups; 2) Encourage participants to explore and pursue graduate education and research careers in cutting edge science and engineering fields; 3) Demonstrate to participants the benefits of experiential learning through synergy of hands-on research projects, active discussion and feedback, reflection of pursuits, and awareness of how their effort fits into the broader scientific and engineering challenges associated with energy and the environment. In addition to active energy and environment research projects all within the A.J. Drexel Institute of Energy and the Environment mentored by faculty from the College of Engineering, students will participate in research seminars, ethics training, writing and communications training, field trips to world class research facilities, educational outreach, and career development activities.</AbstractNarration>
