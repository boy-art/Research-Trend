    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The overall objective of this REU site project is to provide undergraduate students with hands-on research opportunities to explore the scientific frontiers of bioplastics and biocomposites within the context of the industrially relevant research environment provided by the Center of Bioplastic and Biocomposites (CB2). The project aims to attract and retain students in STEM careers and to inspire national students to pursue graduate work with a focus on sustainable technologies and materials. This 9.5 week summer project provides a unique research experience and prepares undergraduate students for the scientific and technical challenges faced in the nascent field of bioplastics and biocomposites. Participants will gain a greater understanding of and appreciation for the importance of sustainable technologies and materials in meeting national renewable goals and the rewarding research career opportunities available. The program builds on existing relationships with industry already engaged in the Center of Bioplastic and Biocomposites both at Iowa State University and Washington State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The NSF I/UCR Center of Bioplastic and Biocomposites (CB2) was established in order to (1) to improve the basic understanding of the synthesis, processing, properties, and compounding of bioplastic and biocomposite materials; (2) to develop reliable material characteristics data for industrial partners; and (3) to support large-scale implementation of renewable materials. The overall goal of the center is to provide the scientific basis for a successful transition from petrochemical raw materials to domestic sources for polymers, in particular renewable and biodegradable plant-based oils, carbohydrates, and proteins. This crucial transition will reduce the environmental impact of plastic production, manufacturing, and disposal and create new businesses and markets within the US. This fast growing industry depends on a well-prepared workforce that is familiar with research and development of plant-based materials and cutting edge manufacturing technologies tailored to these materials. Students participating in the REU focused on Sustainable Technologies and Materials will learn: (1) how to conduct research as part of a collaborative research team; (2) how to present and publish their findings; (3) the role of ethics in research; (4) the scientific and technical challenges in the area of sustainable materials and technologies; and (5) that research offers rewarding career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acknowledgement: This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
