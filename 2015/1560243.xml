    <AbstractNarration>This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. The University of Florida will host a new REU site that will train students on research in Intelligent Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction. By becoming deeply involved in research projects and participating as members of cutting-edge research labs, students will: 1) develop research skills through authentic research experiences and targeted training; 2) strengthen preparation for completing the baccalaureate degree in computer science or a related discipline; 3) increase preparation for applying to and entering doctoral programs; and 4) create and disseminate novel innovations through collaborative research and publications with graduate student and faculty mentors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a growing field that is concerned with how to design and create computational artifacts that serve the needs of their users. Multimodal HCI involves enabling users to interact through multiple modalities, such as speech, gesture, and touch, modalities that tremendously increase the contexts and users that our software systems can serve. This REU site focuses on intelligent multimodal HCI, which brings together the power of adapting to individual users with the flexibility of multimodal interfaces. This project, which targets students who are historically underrepresented in computing, will help build a generation of computer science students whose research and development work directly benefits many facets of society.</AbstractNarration>
