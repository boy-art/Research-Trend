    <AbstractNarration>The GEM Consortium has a rich-history in broadening participation among underrepresented graduate students in engineering and other STEM fields. Annually, it offers an abundance of opportunities, where underrepresented graduate students are able to supplement their formal graduate education with meaningful professional development and formal and informal mentorship from engineering and other STEM faculty. This workshop/travel grant proposal focuses on providing underrepresented graduate students with special professional development opportunities at the 40th GEM Conference &amp; Gala. Through these professional development opportunities, underrepresented graduate students will be provided mentorship and other meaningful learning experiences to help them gain greater understanding and preparation for the professoriate in engineering and other STEM fields. Progress in diversifying the ranks of the faculty has been slow in engineering and many other STEM fields. The effort to increase the representation of African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans in engineering and other STEM fields is a priority of NSF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a workshop format, this project aims to advance underrepresented graduate students' research knowledge and skills, while exposing them to strong mentorship and support systems in engineering and other STEM fields. The broader significance and importance of this project is its focus on positively influencing the STEM faculty pipeline by equipping underrepresented graduate students with knowledge, skills, and support to successfully pursue careers at the faculty ranks. This project is closely aligned with NSF's strategic goals and priorities to increase the participation of underrepresented groups at all levels of the STEM educational pipeline.</AbstractNarration>
