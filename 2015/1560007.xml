    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program hosted by the NanoScience Technology Center (NSTC) at the University of Central Florida (UCF), entitled, "Engineering and Nanoscience of Materials and Device Applications in Biotechnology and Medicine", will engage a diverse cohort of students, recruited from underrepresented groups, in the development of materials and technologies for application in biotechnology and medicine. The students will gain hands-on research training in topics such as adoptive cancer immunotherapy and targeted nanoparticle cancer therapy, engineering of MEMS devices and body-on-a-chip systems for proteomics research, develop nanofibers for tissue engineering, engineer smart wound healing patches, and nanomanufacturing of tunable plasmonic sensors. The REU site will foster intercollegial relationships between faculty and students with an opportunity to investigate new teaching and training paradigms. The program further strengthens bridges to community colleges in Central Florida and minority institutions with limited research capabilities by promoting the benefits of undergraduate research. This REU experience will inspire students to pursue careers that produce high quality researchers and personnel, which will help address the growing need for trained professionals capable of developing and deploying biotechnology and the next generation of medicine in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each undergraduate student will conduct research over a ten week summer experience with a multidisciplinary team of faculty and students. The program will also include: (1) Introductory Course in Engineering, Nanoscience and Technology; (2) Mentor and student professional development, including leadership and diversity; (3) Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC), scientific writing development for REU students; (4) Seminars, workshops, group projects to foster interdisciplinary research and learning; (5) Monitoring, evaluation, and tracking of the students' progress via weekly discussion groups; and (6) Preparation of students to pursue careers in STEM and medical areas.</AbstractNarration>
