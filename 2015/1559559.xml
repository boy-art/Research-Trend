    <AbstractNarration>CAMPARE (California-Arizona Minority Partnership for Astronomy Research and Education) is a program established to advance undergraduate astronomy research and education among groups that are traditionally underrepresented in astronomy. It has been supported by the Partnerships in Astronomy and Astrophysics Research and Education (PAARE) program. This renewal proposal includes plans to expand CAMPARE and to integrate it with the Cal-Bridge program, which helps undergraduate students from California State University campuses make the transition to one of the University of California graduate programs. In addition to recruiting and placement of underrepresented minorities, they provide mentoring, professional development, and administrative services to assist and track students making their way through these programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program does this by actively recruiting undergraduates from among the California State University campuses, promoting their participation in astronomical research at University of California campuses and at Research Experiences for Undergraduates programs across the country. The proposal team has established close connections with many minority-serving, primarily undergraduate institutions located in a region of explosive growth in Hispanic population, and with twelve research institutions that have strong track records of involving undergraduates in research. The goal is to increase the numbers of students from underrepresented minorities that enter and complete PhD programs in astronomy and related fields.</AbstractNarration>
