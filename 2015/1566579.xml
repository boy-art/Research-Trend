    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on developing a novel design platform to improve failure-resilience in complex cyberphysical systems (CPSs) by exploiting the synergy between the design and operation of the physical systems. Resilience defines the ability of an engineered system to sense and withstand adverse events, and to recover from the effects of the adverse events. The design platform provides new methods and tools needed to leverage cyber-enabled failure prognostics and prognostics-informed failure recovery for making CPSs resilient with reduced levels of redundancy. This project will develop the methods and tools, and demonstrate proof-of-concept of the design platform using wind turbine gearbox as a CPS application. The success of this research will produce major advancements in extending life and durability of CPSs, and will potentially lead to the development of CPSs that are more reliable and cost-effective than existing systems. The design platform will also enhance the understanding and design of resilient cyber-physical infrastructure systems that provide essential goods and services despite adverse events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, failure prognostics of a physical system has been exploited only in the operation stage and in isolation with the early design of the system, which may be attributed to the lack of cognizance of strategic interactions between the design and operation of the system. The design platform developed in this project will bridge the gap between early-stage design and post-design prognostics by facilitating a synergistic integration of simulation-based design and sensor-based prognostics. The research project will provide rich research and educational experiences for graduate students in the fields of engineering design, embedded monitoring systems and prognostics and health management, as well as offer unique education and outreach programs for undergraduate and high school students in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
