    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to challenge the conventional abstract model of a high-speed network link as a single, logical point of attachment. Instead, the proposed approach exposes the inherent parallelism that exists within the end host, network links, and the network fabric as a whole, to applications and the network control plane. The result is a network fabric consisting of a number of distinct physical networks that coexist within a single physical topology. By decoupling the channels making up network links, the project radically redesigns the network fabric to address today's requirements and challenges. A key hypothesis of this work is that composing multiple, potentially heterogeneous networks provides for greater scaling, performance, service quality, and manageability than maintaining the legacy fat-pipe link abstraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will impact the broader community in four ways: (1) by addressing the societal need of large-scale networking infrastructure to support next-generation clusters and data centers, by (2) engaging with industry to help inform the design and construction of new devices, by (3) interacting with other scientific communities through interdisciplinary research, and by (4) engaging with graduate and undergraduate students to translate the resulting research into structured courses and hands-on learning experiences for traditionally under-represented&lt;br/&gt;student groups.</AbstractNarration>
