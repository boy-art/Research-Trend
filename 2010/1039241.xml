    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The Eighteenth Microbial Genomics Conference will be held September 12-16, 2010, at the UCLA Conference Center at Lake Arrowhead, California. The meeting is aimed at fostering interactions among scientists from multiple disciplines who are studying various aspects of microbial biology enabled by the wealth of genomic information and bioinformatics technologies developed during recent years. This conference will include active genome researchers, such as sequencing experts and informatics specialists working in database design, sequence analysis, or simulation; geneticists developing new methods to take advantage of genomic information, e.g. for functional analysis; and cell biologists and biochemists who have specialized in basic science areas now ripe for genomics such as metabolism, chromosome structure, or gene regulation. One focus of this conference will be on microbial communities and biodiversity, including the human microbiome (the collection of microorganisms in the human body). Another focus will be on finding new methods of annotation, as the conference includes a workshop on genome annotation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This meeting has become established as a major annual microbial genomics conference during the last eighteen years. It continues to offer a major opportunity for young investigators and students to attend, present their research as posters or talks, and discuss recent findings with leading researchers in the field. This exchange of ideas is critically important to network- and career-building.</AbstractNarration>
