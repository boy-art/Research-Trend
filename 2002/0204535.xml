    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204535&lt;br/&gt;Shuguang Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study several issues in Topology and Geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The central theme is that of real structures which can be defined&lt;br/&gt;on symplectic and contact manifolds. With the presence of such&lt;br/&gt;structures, the proposal aims to introduce new versions of Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory, Seiberg-Witten-Floer theory, and to apply the resulting&lt;br/&gt;invariants to String Theory as well as Real Algebraic Geometry.&lt;br/&gt;Another aspect of the project will study related analytical problems&lt;br/&gt;on manifolds that possess open conical singularities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real Algebraic Geometry concerns the real solutions of real polynomials&lt;br/&gt;which arise naturally in many real-life applications. Despite the&lt;br/&gt;fact that this is one of oldest Mathematical branches, we have so far&lt;br/&gt;made very little progress in understanding it. Our project will attempt&lt;br/&gt;to fill the gap partially by using new machinery following from the&lt;br/&gt;pioneer work of Donaldson, Floer, Taubes etc. It was Einstein's dream&lt;br/&gt;to unify all four fundamental forces in the nature. Through Quantum&lt;br/&gt;Mechanics, it is possible to unify the strong force, the weak force and&lt;br/&gt;the electro-magnetic force. However the unification with the fourth&lt;br/&gt;force, the gravity, has eluded some of the greatest thinkers of our time.&lt;br/&gt;Nowadays it is commonly believed that String Theory offers the best hope&lt;br/&gt;to achieve this last unification. Complex manifolds with real structure&lt;br/&gt;are called orientifolds in String Theory. These are popular but&lt;br/&gt;still poorly-understood objects for Physicists. A purpose in the project&lt;br/&gt;is to lay down a rigorous mathematical foundation for Gromov-Witten</AbstractNarration>
