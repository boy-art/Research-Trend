    <AbstractNarration>0224869 &lt;br/&gt;Ratchford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will support the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in a partnership with three scientific organizations in Latin America to showcase the achievements of distinguished U.S. women scientists to wide audiences in Latin America. Organized by Marina Ratchford of the AAAS Department of International Programs, the initiative seeks to increase both the visibility of U.S. women scientists' careers, and the participation of women in the scientific enterprise in Latin America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AAAS will organize three panels, each composed of three U.S. women scientists interested in sharing their experiences with Latin American colleagues. Panelists will be selected, not only on their outstanding scientific careers, but also on how their experiences furnish compelling strategies to overcome the challenges of pursuing scientific careers. It is expected that the selected panelists will serve as role models for women in the U.S. and Latin America. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selected panelists will develop lectures and visual materials to be presented at the Annual Meetings of the Brazilian Society for the Progress of Science (SBPC); Costa Rica's National Council for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICIT); and the Panamanian Association for the Advancement of Science (APANAC). These venues will gather a diversity of participants that include scientists, educators, students, policymakers and journalists. AAAS will work with host associations to arrange additional activities to take place around the Annual Meeting lectures, including visits to local universities, schools, museums, and research institutes. Lecturers will provide a report about their interaction with Latin American colleagues, including suggestions to increase the participation of women in science and international cooperation among women scientists.</AbstractNarration>
