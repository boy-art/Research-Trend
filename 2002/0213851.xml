    <AbstractNarration>Frogs and salamanders are key contributors to many ecosystem functions. It is a concern, therefore, that amphibian species are declining worldwide, some to extinction. Among the suspected causes of amphibian declines is the emergence of infectious diseases. The proposed research will answer a series of questions designed to test how extinction, disease, and environmental change are linked. Do novel, highly virulent pathogens increase the chance of extinction? Does the health of the host change the risk of infection? Are there environmental conditions that increase the likelihood animals become ill? Why do emerging diseases drive some populations or species to extinction but not others? An international team of molecular biologists, immunologists, pathologists, population ecologists, and epidemiologists will use experiments and observations in the field and laboratory to answer these and related questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of species on Earth is diminishing, and these losses affect the capacity of ecosystems to deliver the goods and services required to sustain life. Infectious diseases are likely responsible for species losses in some ecosystems, but relatively little is known about how pathogens increase the risk of extinction. From time to time the decline of a key species, for example the American eagle, signals a degrading environment that also threatens many other organisms. It is important to understand how infectious diseases and amphibian declines are linked if we are to ensure a high quality environment for our generation and those that follow.</AbstractNarration>
