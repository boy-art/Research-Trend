    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit. Numbers of nonindigenous species--species introduced from elsewhere - are&lt;br/&gt;increasing rapidly worldwide. They are a major cause of biodiversity loss and environmental&lt;br/&gt;change, and are estimated to cost the US $137 billion/yr. The 2001 National Invasive Species&lt;br/&gt;Management Plan (www.invasivespecies.gov) highlighted the urgent need for more rigorous and&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive risk analysis frameworks for nonindigenous species so that prevention and&lt;br/&gt;control strategies can be targeted appropriately. The central public policy consideration is how&lt;br/&gt;much of society's resources should be expended in response to nonindigenous species, and how,&lt;br/&gt;for example, should it be allocated between prevention and control? These considerations,&lt;br/&gt;though, include a nexus of interacting ecological and economic factors that require&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary effort. Species invasions are caused by economic activities, and in turn affect&lt;br/&gt;economic activities. This ecological and economic linkage and feedback means that the&lt;br/&gt;assessment of risk interacts with the management of risk, which contradicts the common notion&lt;br/&gt;that risk assessment and risk management are independent. Social welfare and risk assessment&lt;br/&gt;are both determined jointly by ecological and economic processes.&lt;br/&gt;In response to the need for interdisciplinary risk analysis, this project brings together&lt;br/&gt;experts from invasion biology, mathematical modeling, and economics. The main goal is to&lt;br/&gt;develop and apply a bio-economic modeling framework for nonindigenous species that&lt;br/&gt;integrates risk assessment and risk management, includes uncertainty distributions, and&lt;br/&gt;optimizes prevention and control strategies in a landscape context. The overall bio-economic&lt;br/&gt;model uses Stochastic Dynamic Programming, which allows the investigators to incorporate&lt;br/&gt;ecological-economic feedbacks in such a way to optimize combinations of prevention and&lt;br/&gt;control strategies to maximize social welfare. This framework will be extended to the landscape&lt;br/&gt;scale with Neural Network models.&lt;br/&gt;The applications will focus on freshwater nonindigenous species in the Great Lakes&lt;br/&gt;region. A preliminary application to zebra mussels suggested, for example, that society should&lt;br/&gt;be spending about $240,000/yr to keep zebra mussels from invading each lake with a power&lt;br/&gt;plant (to prevent fouling of pipes). This is in sharp contrast to the $825,000 that the Fish &amp;&lt;br/&gt;Wildlife Service spent in FY2001 for prevention and control efforts for all aquatic nuisance&lt;br/&gt;species for all lakes. Our analyses will be directly relevant to policymakers and natural resource&lt;br/&gt;managers.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The investigators will partner with the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago to&lt;br/&gt;educate schoolchildren and the public about the general problem of nonindigenous species, about&lt;br/&gt;what individuals can do to reduce the problem, and about the role that science plays in public&lt;br/&gt;policy decisions. By partnering with an educational software firm, they will convert research&lt;br/&gt;models into user-friendly formats for use by schoolchildren, the public, policymakers, resource&lt;br/&gt;managers, and stakeholders. In partnership with the Great Lakes Commission, research methods,&lt;br/&gt;results, and user-friendly products will be disseminated in workshops to policymakers, managers,&lt;br/&gt;and stakeholders. Finally, they will develop international collaborations and a reciprocal&lt;br/&gt;exchange of information and techniques with top researchers in Australia, where NIS research is&lt;br/&gt;advanced relative to North America.</AbstractNarration>
