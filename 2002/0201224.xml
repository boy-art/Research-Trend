    <AbstractNarration>Heat straightening has been used to repair damaged steel structures for many&lt;br/&gt;years. However, until recently practitioners use of the method was based on&lt;br/&gt;experience gained through trial and error. Recent research had provided and&lt;br/&gt;engineering basis for the method and established procedures for its use.&lt;br/&gt;The engineering and construction community has been hesitant to utilize heat&lt;br/&gt;straightening for several reasons including: past misuse of the process&lt;br/&gt;which has produced fractures during repair; concerns about the effect of&lt;br/&gt;heat straightening on material properties, especially ductility; and a&lt;br/&gt;general lack of understanding of the method. Its current application is&lt;br/&gt;primarily in repair of damaged bridge girders with limited application for&lt;br/&gt;other types of construction. Even though a scientific basis now exists for&lt;br/&gt;the method, there is a major gap in available data that has limited the&lt;br/&gt;application of heat straightening. There have been no significant&lt;br/&gt;investigations into the fracture sensitivity of heat straightened members.&lt;br/&gt;Without this knowledge, a performance based design approach cannot be used&lt;br/&gt;for designing heat-straightening repairs. The purpose of this proposal is&lt;br/&gt;to describe a research plan that will quantify the process and define the&lt;br/&gt;limiting parameters for a successful repair.</AbstractNarration>
