    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0203486&lt;br/&gt;Patrick Gilmer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates applications of integrality results for&lt;br/&gt;morphisms under Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) for&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional topology. Strong Shift Equivalence (SSE) is an&lt;br/&gt;equivalence relation which arose in symbolic dynamics. Gilmer is&lt;br/&gt;investigating a connection between TQFT and SSE which he has recently&lt;br/&gt;discovered. Using a TQFT one defines various SSE class invariants of&lt;br/&gt;knots and other spaces which are equipped with an infinite cyclic cover.&lt;br/&gt;This can now be derived as a consequence of a SSE class invariant.&lt;br/&gt;Gilmer is attempting to use TQFT to find obstructions to classical knots&lt;br/&gt;being slice knots. In general, Gilmer is using TQFT as a tool in&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional topology. In joint work with Stepan Orevkov, Gilmer is&lt;br/&gt;calculating further signatures and nullities of certain links which he&lt;br/&gt;associated to collections of curves in the real projective plane. In&lt;br/&gt;previous work, Gilmer found restrictions on these invariants if the&lt;br/&gt;collection of curves is isotopic to a real algebraic curve of given&lt;br/&gt;degree. These calculations may lead to new general restrictions on the&lt;br/&gt;topology of real algebraic curves. Gilmer is also exploring relations&lt;br/&gt;between real algebraic curves and shadow descriptions of links, in the&lt;br/&gt;sense of Turaev.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the study of intrinsic shape. It is sometimes called "rubber&lt;br/&gt;sheet geometry" because the objects under investigation can be twisted and&lt;br/&gt;stretched (but not torn) without losing their identity. It is a subject&lt;br/&gt;which impinges on many areas of mathematics and science. Topological&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Field Theory is one of the most current and exciting areas of&lt;br/&gt;topology with intimate connections to high energy physics as well as other&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics, for instance number theory and symbolic dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems. Gilmer is applying this subject to answer questions about knots,&lt;br/&gt;links and 3-dimensional manifolds. A 3-dimensional manifold is a&lt;br/&gt;topological object which looks locally like the familiar space we live in.&lt;br/&gt;One may also consider manifolds of other dimensions. It is ironic that&lt;br/&gt;manifolds of dimension three and four are least well understood. One would&lt;br/&gt;guess that our intuition should be strongest in these dimensions. A knot&lt;br/&gt;is a closed loop in a 3-manifold. A link is a collection of closed loops&lt;br/&gt;in a 3-manifold. In 1900, Hilbert gave a famous list of problems for&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians to study. His sixteenth problem concerns the topology of&lt;br/&gt;real algebraic curves in the real projective plane, It is still unsolved&lt;br/&gt;but it has lead to many beautiful developments and partial solutions.&lt;br/&gt;Hilbert asked how the components (called ovals) of the set of zeros of a&lt;br/&gt;nonsingular real homogenous polynomial of given degree can be arranged in&lt;br/&gt;the plane, if the number of these ovals is maximal for the given degree.&lt;br/&gt;This project further studies certain type of links to make progress on&lt;br/&gt;Hilbert's problem and related questions.</AbstractNarration>
