    <AbstractNarration>Sea Studios Foundation is developing a five-hour television-based project that will examine "Earth System Science," which will be produced in association with the National Geographic Society (NGS). Geologists, biologists, oceanographers, climatologists, social scientists and others are joining forces to understand the planet's rapidly changing environment. The series will follow the on-going research of these scientists as they investigate the links between Earth's geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. These programs are planned as the first season of an annual series on the topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational outreach will include a hands-on traveling exhibit to be developed and tested by the Maryland Science Center; an Educator's Guide for print and electronic distribution to informal science centers and community organizations; a "resource toolkit" to augment the Educator's Guide and an Internet site hosted by NGS that provides links to existing and new environmental resources. The series content also will be integrated into several NGS venues including: National Geographic Today, the daily news program on the National Geographic Channel; National Geographic Magazine, which will create a "global report card" as an annual feature; and National Geographic for Kids magazine, which is distributed to children in grades three through six. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project advisory board includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Richard Barber, Professor of Biological Oceanography, Duke University&lt;br/&gt;Robert Costanza, Professor of Zoology, University of Maryland&lt;br/&gt;Gretchen Daily, Interdisciplinary Research Scientist, Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;Robert Dunbar, Specialist in Global Environmental Change, Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;Habiba Gitay, Senior Lecturer, National Centre for Development Studies, Asia Pacific School of Economics and Management, Canberra, Australia&lt;br/&gt;Michael Glantz, Senior Scientist, the Environmental and Societal Impacts Group, National Center for Atmospheric Research&lt;br/&gt;John Katzenberger, Executive Director of Aspen Global change Institute&lt;br/&gt;Jane Lubchenco, Professor of Marine Biology, Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;J.
