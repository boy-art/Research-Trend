    <AbstractNarration>In work with G. Pareschi, Popa has introduced a notion of Mukai regularity&lt;br/&gt; for coherent sheaves on abelian varieties, defined using the Fourier-Mukai&lt;br/&gt; transform, and developed its theory. Popa and Pareschi are now interested&lt;br/&gt; in using the concept of Mukai regularity in the study of irregular&lt;br/&gt; varieties, especially to give effective results on adjoint linear series and&lt;br/&gt; pluiricanonical maps. Also, Popa and Pareschi intend to use invariants&lt;br/&gt; arising naturally from this theory in order to differentiate between&lt;br/&gt; Jacobians and other abelian varieties, and thus approach the Schottky&lt;br/&gt; problem in a new way. Using some of their results that carry through in the&lt;br/&gt; more general context of an arbitrary Fourier transform, Popa and Pareschi&lt;br/&gt; intend to obtain constraints on the existence of equivalences of derived&lt;br/&gt; categories, which is a main concern in this line of approach to mirror&lt;br/&gt; symmetry. In other work, Popa has established effective results for linear&lt;br/&gt; series on moduli spaces of vector bundles on curves. Popa is interested in&lt;br/&gt; approaching the Strange Duality by refining his methods based on the&lt;br/&gt; Fourier-Mukai transform of Verlinde bundles on Jacobians and combining it&lt;br/&gt; with representation theory techniques. Popa also intends to approach some&lt;br/&gt; optimal conjectures on effective base point freeness on these moduli spaces&lt;br/&gt; for general curves, using degeneration to stable curves. In work with G.&lt;br/&gt; Farkas, Popa has obtained Brill-Noether type non-existence results for rank&lt;br/&gt; 2 vector bundles on general curves, via generalized limit linear series and&lt;br/&gt; stability of pairs on reducible curves. Popa and Farkas intend to further&lt;br/&gt; refine these techniques in order to prove a conjecture of&lt;br/&gt; Bertram-Feinberger-Mukai on Brill-Noether theory for rank 2 vector bundles&lt;br/&gt; with canonical determinant, and to find non-existence results in higher&lt;br/&gt; ranks. This will allow them to define new divisors in moduli spaces of&lt;br/&gt; stable curves for appropriate genera. The ultimate goal of this project is&lt;br/&gt; to compute the class of these divisors and determine whether they provide&lt;br/&gt; counterexamples to the Harris-Morrison Slope Conjecture as expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Algebraic curves and abelian varieties are ubiquitous objects in&lt;br/&gt; mathematics. Apart from their realizations in algebraic geometry, they&lt;br/&gt; appear in complex analysis (as Riemann surfaces or complex tori) or algebra&lt;br/&gt; (as field extensions or group schemes), and play a fundamental role in&lt;br/&gt; recent progress in mathematical physics. One of the most important problems&lt;br/&gt; in algebraic geometry is to classify algebraic varieties. For&lt;br/&gt; one-dimensional varieties (that is, for algebraic curves) this problem is&lt;br/&gt; approached by understanding the geometry of a space M(g) parametrizing all&lt;br/&gt; curves of given genus. In the case of abelian varieties, one way to approach&lt;br/&gt; this is to understand the totality of a specific kind of algebraic objects&lt;br/&gt; (called coherent sheaves) which can be associated to them. The investigator&lt;br/&gt; is pursuing these directions in research related to this proposal.</AbstractNarration>
