    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0203936&lt;br/&gt;Charles W. Rezk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to apply homotopy theoretic &lt;br/&gt;methods to algebraic problems. There are two threads of &lt;br/&gt;ideas involved here. One is the description of homotopy &lt;br/&gt;theory as a kind of topologically enriched category theory, &lt;br/&gt;as has been developed by Dwyer-Kan and many others. Another &lt;br/&gt;thread is in the theory of commutative ring spectra (a homotopy theoretic generalization of commutative ring theory), and&lt;br/&gt;in particular the development of a topological version of &lt;br/&gt;the algebraic de Rham complex of a ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory is a branch of topology; it arose as the &lt;br/&gt;study of certain invariant properties of spaces, namely those &lt;br/&gt;left unchanged by continuous deformations. It is a surprising &lt;br/&gt;fact that there are deep analogies between the methods of the &lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory of spaces (which would seem to be geometric and topological) and those of several branches of algebra (such as homological algebra, sheaf theory, and category theory). For &lt;br/&gt;example, there is a close analogy between the way we can &lt;br/&gt;describe an algebraic object (such as a group or ring) by&lt;br/&gt;giving generators and the relations between them, and the &lt;br/&gt;way we can describe a topological space by giving polyhedra &lt;br/&gt;and the way they are attached together to give the space. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop certain homotopy &lt;br/&gt;theoretic methods in the context of ring theory and of &lt;br/&gt;category theory, and to allow them to be applied to&lt;br/&gt;traditional algebraic problems.</AbstractNarration>
