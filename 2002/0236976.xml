    <AbstractNarration>The Vermont EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Award will enhance the research infrastructure in environmental science/engineering and materials science. With the goal of developing an Environmental Water Center, the university plans to build capacity through faculty lines in geochemistry and aquatic biology, along with additional physical and human resources to enhance established strengths. Incorporation of earth systems and landscape ecological data into the Vermont Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data base will provide a valuable tool for the environmental science community across the state. In the materials area, the University of Vermont proposes to build on recent investments in polymeric and nanoscale materials with two related positions in chemistry and mechanical engineering and outreach to polymer processing and fabrication companies in the state. The goal is to develop a competitive materials science research center. Each focus area, environmental science/engineering and materials science, will include support of early career faculty, post-doctoral associates, and graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vermont EPSCoR award includes an outreach program involving high school students and teachers, diverse student populations, baccalaureate institutions, the private sector, and public policy. One aspect of the program supports high school teacher and student teams working with faculty members at the University of Vermont or at one of Vermont's baccalaureate institutions. An additional outreach program is designed to increase the diversity of the undergraduate student population in Vermont by building on an ongoing partnership with a Bronx high school. The rural poor of Vermont will be eligible for summer job internships and math/science institutes. Faculty and students at Vermont's baccalaureate institutions will be able to compete for equipment grants and small college development grant; a small business innovation research (SBIR) phase (0) program will provide seed grants. Finally, Vermont EPSCoR will partner with the Vermont Technology Council to help locate in-state resource persons for policy makers seeking scientific expertise.</AbstractNarration>
