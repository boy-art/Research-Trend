    <AbstractNarration>National reports over the last decade have focused on the need for change in the way mathematics is taught at the elementary and secondary levels. The GeoSet project supports the full development and dissemination of the curriculum and pedagogy for a discovery-based course in geometry for prospective elementary teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometry is an ideal course in which to model discovery-learning and the use of technology for pre-service teachers. This project draws on the experiences gained from a well-established course in geometry for elementary teachers and an experienced team of project directors at Oklahoma State University. Project materials support a cognitive level and require a substantially higher level of participation than is normally the case for the course audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide range of curricular and pedagogical activities is supported by the prototype workbook-style text currently being used. The intellectual merit is realized through the development of materials that include: group activities, extensive writing, math-literature connections, projects, construction with manipulatives, and mathematical proofs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact of "GeoSet" is realized through the development, testing, and revision of innovative materials that targets pre-service elementary teachers. In addition, these materials support innovative professional development activities both as a basis of discovery-style pedagogy and as a foundation to promote ongoing professional growth as teachers through a lesson study model.</AbstractNarration>
