    <AbstractNarration>The Glenn H. Brown Prizes were established in 1986 to advance and diffuse knowledge of liquid crystal states of matter by encouraging effective written and oral presentations of doctoral research results. At the International Liquid Crystal Conference to be held June 30-July 5, 2002 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the International Liquid Crystal Society will award prizes for outstanding thesis completed between January 2000 and December 2001. Tesis on theoretical, experimental and/or applied work on thermotropic, polymeric and/or lyotropic liquid crystal systems will be considered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The liquid crystal community continues to have direct impact on education and the development of new materials for technological advances of high significance to society. The latter include the development of novel electro optic devices of high commercial interest. Since these technical areas are of very high priority to industry, students educated and trained in these multidisciplinary areas involving liquid crystal science and engineering compete very well in the job market and go on to contribute in many significant ways to the global economy.</AbstractNarration>
