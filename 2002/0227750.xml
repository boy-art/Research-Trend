    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Steven G. Greenbaum has mentored minority students in physics for more than twenty years. His academic advisorship and mentoring role has supported the graduation of Afro-American physicists from MIT and from other prestigious schools. Also noteworthy is the outcome of his students professionally. His evidence of commitment is embedded in the achievement of his students. The emotional support and encouragement for minority students to study science has been meritorious; the work with minorities in science is, in general, remarkable and likely to be continued.</AbstractNarration>
