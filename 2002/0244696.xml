    <AbstractNarration>Professor Georges Guiochon of the University of Tennessee is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to work on the fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics of chemical separations and preparative chromatography. Several separation systems are to be studied, including monolithic columns. The experimental investigations include pressure dependence of insulin separations and the isotherm behaviors of chiral separations. Central to this work is the prediction and optimization of individual band profiles of multicomponent mixtures including protein variants, through calculations involving physical models. The work here proposes to invoke established parameter estimation methods and determination by experiment and extend them to situations where the response is nonlinear, for example, under slow mass transfer conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work represents the application of mathematics to understand chromatography. Separations science is economically important. If theory can assist in optimizing parameters to achieve better separations, time and cost are saved as well as potentially reducing harmful solvent use. The area is a good training ground for students in that they are exposed to elements of chemistry, chemical engineering, mathematics and biochemistry.</AbstractNarration>
