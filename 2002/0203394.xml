    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0203394&lt;br/&gt;Ying-Qing Wu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI of this proposal intends to study the topology of 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds via Dehn surgery, essential surfaces and essential&lt;br/&gt;laminations. It is a common method to use 2-dimensional surfaces as a&lt;br/&gt;tool in studying 3-manifolds. The most useful surfaces in studying&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds are essential surface, essential laminations, and Heegaard&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. The purpose of this project is to study the properties of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds using these surfaces and Dehn surgery. There have been&lt;br/&gt;great progress in this area in the last few years, for example we now&lt;br/&gt;know that an essential surface will remain essential after most Dehn&lt;br/&gt;surgeries, and the exact upper bounds on distances between all ten&lt;br/&gt;pairs of nonsimple surgery types have been determined. However there&lt;br/&gt;are still some very important problems remaining to be solved in this&lt;br/&gt;area. An objective of this project is to determine how many surgeries&lt;br/&gt;are ``exceptional'' in certain sense, for example, how many will&lt;br/&gt;produce so called Seifert manifolds, and how many will kill an&lt;br/&gt;essential surface. The PI will also study the problem of how an&lt;br/&gt;immersed surface intersects a Heegaard surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds are objects that are locally like ordinary 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces, but whose global structure may be quite complicated. Such&lt;br/&gt;objects appear naturally from different areas of mathematics as well&lt;br/&gt;as physics and other sciences. The ultimate goal in the study of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifold topology is to have a thorough understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;structure of 3-manifolds. This has not been achieved yet, but there&lt;br/&gt;has been a great progress towards the proof of a conjectural picture&lt;br/&gt;described by Thurston more than 20 years ago. The PI proposes to&lt;br/&gt;continue studying 3-manifolds via Dehn surgery, which is a method of&lt;br/&gt;constructing new 3-dimensional spaces from an existing 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;space, by removing a neighborhood of a circle and then gluing back in&lt;br/&gt;a different way. The achievement of this project will be an important&lt;br/&gt;step towards the goal of having a clear understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;topological and geometric structures of 3-manifolds.</AbstractNarration>
