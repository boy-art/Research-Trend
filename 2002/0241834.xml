    <AbstractNarration>P.I. Ward&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 0241834&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to develop a profiling instrument for the study of air-sea gas exchange. The Air-Sea Interaction Profiler (ASIP) will be equipped with sensors to measure temperature, conductivity, turbulent velocity, oxygen, and the abundance of biological species. Measurements will be confined to the upper 10 m of the ocean, with a focus on surface layers. ASIP will be completely self-contained and will be capable of making upwardly-rising, autonomous profiles during deployment. The objectives of this work focus on the close interplay between physical, chemical and biological processes at the ocean surface. This instrument will significantly enhance the scientific understanding of air-sea gas exchange, which has far-reaching societal ramifications due to factors such as the buildup of greenhouse gases and their affect on future climate. If successful, the data collected using this instrument will help elucidate the role of the ocean in absorbing CO2. Accurate knowledge of gas exchange is also important for monitoring ecosystems such as those in coastal regions, rivers, lakes and estuaries, as these data are required for determining ecosystem parameters such as net ecosystem production and gross primary production.</AbstractNarration>
