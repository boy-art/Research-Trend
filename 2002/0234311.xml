    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0234311&lt;br/&gt;Peter Ozsvath&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal deals invariants for three- and four-dimensional manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;specifically those which the proposer constructed in collaboration Zoltan&lt;br/&gt;Szabo. These invariants appear to be closely related to gauge-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;(Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten) invariants, except that they have the&lt;br/&gt;advantage of being more combinatorial in nature than their gauge-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;predecessors, and hence easier to calculate. To illustrate their strength,&lt;br/&gt;one can reprove some results in four-dimensional differential topology&lt;br/&gt;which were obtained previously using gauge theory. These invariants also&lt;br/&gt;have new topological applications which go beyond gauge theory. For&lt;br/&gt;instance, they can be used to give new restrictions on knots whose&lt;br/&gt;surgeries give lens spaces. The author hopes to further extend this&lt;br/&gt;theory, to see what further insight they may give to topology in&lt;br/&gt;dimensions three and four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal deals with studying the intrinsic structure of three- and&lt;br/&gt;four-dimensional spaces. The study of four-dimensional spaces was&lt;br/&gt;revolutionized by Simon Donaldson in the early 80's by his introduction of&lt;br/&gt;"gauge-theoretic techniques". These techniques associate to a space the&lt;br/&gt;space of solutions of certain partial differential equations (which come&lt;br/&gt;from mathematical physics). Course properties of these solution spaces are&lt;br/&gt;then used to give insight into the finer structure of the underlying&lt;br/&gt;spaces on which the equations are defined. The proposal deals with efforts &lt;br/&gt;at circumventing these (often difficult to identify) auxiliary spaces of &lt;br/&gt;solutions, to give more directly combinatorial approaches to understanding &lt;br/&gt;the way three- and four-dimensional spaces fit together.</AbstractNarration>
