    <AbstractNarration>In the summers of 2003, 2004 and 2005, the University of Tennessee Mathematics Department will sponsor a "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" program. Each summer, ten undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;will spend 8 weeks in this program, working on research projects with faculty members. Our approach is based on "one student with one advisor." Two of the students will work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for their projects. There will be two short courses and a faculty seminar for the students, in addition to the research projects. The students will give practice talks and as a finale, talks at the end of the program on their projects. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
