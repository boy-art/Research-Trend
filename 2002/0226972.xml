    <AbstractNarration>This Math and Science Partnership includes San Francisco State University, the Berkeley Unified School District, the Jefferson Elementary School District, and the South San Francisco Unified School District. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partnership is focusing on improving student performance in algebra by uniting three distinct groups of educators: middle and high school algebra teachers (grades 8-10), undergraduate mathematics majors with interests in secondary education, and graduate mathematics students who teach remedial college algebra. The cohort is working together to ensure the successful learning of algebra for students, particularly underrepresented students, at the high school and undergraduate level. Improved student achievement results from the collaboration and its emphasis on improving the effectiveness of teachers. A key component of the project is professional development based on the Japanese lesson study model that engages teams of teachers and graduate students in professional discussions centered on classroom lessons. Benchmarks include increased percentages of students enrolling in and passing both high school and college algebra courses. Undergraduate mathematics majors, by assisting in the secondary schools, receive the classroom experience needed to encourage them to become teachers while improving their teaching capabilities.</AbstractNarration>
