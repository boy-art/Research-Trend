    <AbstractNarration>0245216 Brezonik The CLEANER Workshop 2 will build on the results of CLEANER Workshop1. In that workshop, it was explicitly recommended to convene another workshop devoted to Environmental Field Facilities (EFFs). Thus, CLEANER Workshop 2 is in response to that recommendation. The continuing development of the CLEANER initiative leads to an effort devoted to defining the concept of (EFFs). The agenda for CLEANER Workshop 2 has been developed and will include: review the results of CLEANER Workshop 1 "Large Scale Environmental Challenges: CLEANER as the Engineering Approach"; Status/Experience for CLEANER; Defining an EFF(with breakout sessions); Modeling; Environmental Cyberinfrastructure; Sensor Needs, Development, and Networking: Initial Insights, and the Path Forward. This workshop is an important next step in securing a cross-discipline view of the evolution of CLEANER.&lt;br/&gt;This Workshop will be held at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, on October 20-22, 2002. The workshop will be attended by approximately 50 scientists and engineers from the academic, consultant and governmental communities. A report summarizing the results of the workshop will be prepared by the steering committee and submitted to the Environmental Engineering Program Director by December, 2002.</AbstractNarration>
