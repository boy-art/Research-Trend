    <AbstractNarration>The main objects of investigation of this project are weak Hopf algebras&lt;br/&gt;(also called quantum groupoids in literature). These are group-like &lt;br/&gt;objects that generalize both Hopf algebras and usual groupoids and that &lt;br/&gt;appear naturally in the theory of semisimple tensor rigid (fusion) categories, &lt;br/&gt;conformal field theory, symmetries of algebra extensions, and the quantum &lt;br/&gt;dynamical Yang-Baxter equation. The investigator develops the general &lt;br/&gt;theory of weak Hopf algebras and their representations and applies it to &lt;br/&gt;the study and classification of fusion categories (every such a category is&lt;br/&gt;equaivalent to the representation category of a semisimple weak Hopf algebra).&lt;br/&gt;One goal is to extend the results known for the representation categories of&lt;br/&gt;ordinary semisimple Hopf algebras, such as e.g., Larson-Radford theorems, &lt;br/&gt;Stefan's finiteness result (Ocneanu's rigidity), and Class Equation to general&lt;br/&gt;semisimple tensor categories. Another goal is to use weak Hopf algebra&lt;br/&gt;techniques to reveal the structure of modular categories which are important&lt;br/&gt;because of their applications to physics and geometry. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;also studies weak Hopf algebras arising from dynamical twists (these twists &lt;br/&gt;give rise to solutions of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation of Felder). &lt;br/&gt;The goal here is to get a conceptual explanation of new intriguing phenomena &lt;br/&gt;related to dynamical twists, such as, e.g., non-minimizable dynamical twists &lt;br/&gt;in group algebras and self-duality of dynamical quantum groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the investigator studies problems of the theory of quantum groups. &lt;br/&gt;The origins of this theory which was created in 1980s are the classical theory of&lt;br/&gt;groups and quantum physics. The theory of groups is the classical mathematical&lt;br/&gt;subject that describes in mathematical terms the phenomenon of symmetry&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., groups describe the symmetry of molecular structure). Groups are fundamental&lt;br/&gt;objects as they provide a universal language used in all areas of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;The quantum theory reveals the laws of physics that determine the behavior &lt;br/&gt;of very small particles and interactions between them. This theory led to many&lt;br/&gt;technological advances of the 20th century such as, e.g., development of the&lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics. In order to give an adequate mathematical description of &lt;br/&gt;the structure of quantum physical systems the theory of classical groups &lt;br/&gt;is not sufficient, this is why the new theory of quantum groups was invented. &lt;br/&gt;Among these new objects the notions of weak Hopf algebras and quantum &lt;br/&gt;groupoids are of special interest, as they have recently seen many applications &lt;br/&gt;on both sides of the mathematics-physics divide. The present proposal is devoted &lt;br/&gt;to the study and classification of weak Hopf algebras and exploring their applications &lt;br/&gt;to various areas of mathematics and physics.</AbstractNarration>
