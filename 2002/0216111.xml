    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports acquisition of a desk top x-ray diffractometer that will be used in materials science and solid-state chemistry research at Jackson State University, an undergraduate, teaching-oriented university. This diffractometer does not require water cooling and is sufficiently simple that undergraduate students can use it after a short training period. The diffractometer will be used in teaching laboratories as well as in research. The research is varied. One example is exploring new forms of silicon, including amorphous silicon that contains on the order of 40% molecular hydrogen. New open framework structures such as silicon-germanium and tin clathrates will also be characterized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This equipment will see shared use with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Auburn University. It should enhance the on-going collaborations between the three universities. The equipment will also be used as a demonstration tool for high school students in collaboration with a program called "Alabama Science in Motion" and will be employed in the continuing education Masters Program for local high school teachers.</AbstractNarration>
