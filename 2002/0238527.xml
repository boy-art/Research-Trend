    <AbstractNarration>This career grant project offers a novel research approach to attempt to reduce our uncertainty of climate system sensitivity to greenhouse warming by quantifying cloud radiative feedbacks in the historical data record. The study focuses on the three clouds types believed to have the greatest radiative impact on the climate system: Oceanic subtropical low-level; oceanic summertime storm-track; and tropical deep convection. The data set to be utilized as a basis for the research is the cloud catalogue created by Warren and Hahn (1999) which offers a record beginning in 1952, pre-dating the satellite record by three decades. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activity is expected to enhance scientific understanding of cloud feedback mechanisms and climate sensitivity, contributing towards improvements in understanding and modeling global warming associated with climate change. The results of this project will be communicated to the general population via public lectures and education of K-12 students and their teachers.</AbstractNarration>
