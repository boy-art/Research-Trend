    <AbstractNarration>This project is designed to encourage low-income, academically talented students to&lt;br/&gt;major in computer science and mathematics and to assist them in being successful in the&lt;br/&gt;completion of their academic program. Through innovative community building&lt;br/&gt;activities, the scholarship program is having a significant impact on the entire cohort of&lt;br/&gt;students enrolled in Computer Science and Mathematics programs at NJCU. This cohort of &lt;br/&gt;students are predominately female and disadvantaged minorities. New Jersey City &lt;br/&gt;University is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and a Minority Institution, &lt;br/&gt;with a Hispanic enrollment of 30% and a total minority enrollment of 62%. The Program &lt;br/&gt;consists of four components: (1)recruitment of talented, low-income students into &lt;br/&gt;Computer Science, Pre-Engineering and Mathematics majors; (2) targeted academic &lt;br/&gt;support initiatives, in addition to existing student support services; (3) structured &lt;br/&gt;scholarship community activities; and, (4) internships and cooperative education work &lt;br/&gt;experiences. The overall goals of the Project are the increase in enrollment, retention and &lt;br/&gt;graduation rates of high-ability, low-income students in Computer Science, &lt;br/&gt;Pre-Engineering and Mathematics baccalaureate degree programs. These goals and &lt;br/&gt;objectives are being accomplished through existing programs, services and resources, &lt;br/&gt;as well as through the addition of new academic support initiatives, and scholarship &lt;br/&gt;community activities. This initiative represents a congruence between NJCU's mission &lt;br/&gt;and the goals and purposes of the National Science Foundation's Computer Science, &lt;br/&gt;Engineering and Mathematics Scholarship Program. The Project enables the creation &lt;br/&gt;of a sustainable system for academics, student services and career planning supports &lt;br/&gt;for our diverse student population, thereby increasing the technological capacity of our &lt;br/&gt;nation's youth, and strengtheing and diversifying of our nation's workforce.</AbstractNarration>
