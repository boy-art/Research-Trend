    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0204326.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M. Gross plans to study the geometry of mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. This will be done from the perspective of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow&lt;br/&gt;conjecture and algebro-geometric analogues of this conjecture currently&lt;br/&gt;being developed by M. Gross and B. Siebert. These ideas will be pursued&lt;br/&gt;with a goal of finding a general mirror symmetry construction, associating&lt;br/&gt;to any polarized maximally unipotent degeneration of Calabi-Yau manifolds a mirror family&lt;br/&gt;of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds. Implications of these ideas to understanding&lt;br/&gt;the behaviour of Ricci-flat metrics near maximally unipotent degenerations&lt;br/&gt;and the counting of rational curves using the notion of log Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants will also be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed by M. Gross lies at the intersection of string theory&lt;br/&gt;and geometry. String theory replaces the traditional notion of &lt;br/&gt;the point particle with a small loop of string, moving through space-time.&lt;br/&gt;To make string theory compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must&lt;br/&gt;be ten-dimensional. Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one expects &lt;br/&gt;six of these dimensions to be a very small `curled up' geometric object. &lt;br/&gt;These geometric objects are called Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the early&lt;br/&gt;1990s, string theorists proposed a remarkable association between&lt;br/&gt;completely different Calabi-Yau manifolds: certain calculations extremely&lt;br/&gt;difficult to perform on one Calabi-Yau manifold could be completed&lt;br/&gt;by performing completely different, and much easier, calculations on&lt;br/&gt;a different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as mirror symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;Since this time, many geometers have been trying to understand &lt;br/&gt;the mathematics behind this miraculous observation. The work of M. Gross&lt;br/&gt;hopes to give mathematical insight and explanation for the phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;of mirror symmetry.</AbstractNarration>
