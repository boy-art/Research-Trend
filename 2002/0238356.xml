    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to advance the understanding of multicomponent diffusion in multiphase alloys through development of phenomenological expressions, analytical methods and experimental techniques. The goal is to study multicomponent systems of current interest, namely Ni-Pt-Al and Fe-Ni-Al for high temperature coatings and structural applications. Based on innovative transformation of phenomenological expressions, accurate and efficient analytical methods to determine multicomponent diffusion coefficient will be developed. Evolution of diffusion structures involving stability of interphase boundaries and multiphase-layer formation will be examined and analyzed quantitatively by obtaining accurate experimental data using advanced characterization techniques. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be educated about diffusion in multicomponent-multiphase alloys through an integration of fundamental laboratory research and course revision with "hands-on" laboratories. These research and educational activities are designed to harvest materials scientists and engineers with exceptional knowledge and competence in diffusion in solids, while advancing the science of diffusion in multicomponent-multiphase alloys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequentially designed laboratory modules will be implemented for a course entitled "Diffusion in Solids." The project aims to disseminate the basic understanding of diffusion and its importance in materials science for public at large, particularly for K-12 teachers and students as well as blind and visually impaired children, with assistance from the Orlando Science Center (OSC) and the Center for Independence Technology and Education (CITE). Undergraduate and graduate students involved in laboratory research will actively participate in these rewarding activities, and have a chance to mentor and interact with K-12 students including those handicapped.</AbstractNarration>
