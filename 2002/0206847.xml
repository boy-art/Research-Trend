    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0206847.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract of the Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is centered around the study of the Ricci flow on complete,&lt;br/&gt;non-compact Kaehler manifolds of nonnegative holomorphic bisectional&lt;br/&gt;curvature. The main goal is to seek a complete understanding of singular&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the maximal solutions to the Kaehler-Ricci flow with&lt;br/&gt;nonnegative curvature, in particular the geometry, such as the rates of &lt;br/&gt;curvature decay and volume growth of geodesic balls, of complete Kaehler-Ricci solitons,&lt;br/&gt;which turn out to be the models for Type II singularities and can be considered as a&lt;br/&gt;natural extension of Calabi-Yau metrics on non-compact complex&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. Progress on the project will lead to new understanding of geometry, analysis, &lt;br/&gt;and complex structure and could have important application to solving a&lt;br/&gt;well-known conjecture in complex geometry. The research will be based&lt;br/&gt;on the effort of extending the dimension reduction method of Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;for the Ricci flow in the Riemannian case to the Kaehler case where one&lt;br/&gt;has weaker curvature assumption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project deals with singular behavior of the Kaehler-Ricci&lt;br/&gt;flow, or Parabolic-Einstein equations, and studies uniformization type&lt;br/&gt;problems for complete Kaehler manifolds. The Kaehler-Ricci flow is an&lt;br/&gt;important type of geometric evolution equations, which have profound&lt;br/&gt;importance and applications in science and geometry. Some of the examples include &lt;br/&gt;the motion of a surface by its mean curvature, the flow of gas in a porous mechanism,&lt;br/&gt;the motion of a liquid crystal, the diffusion of oil in shale, the&lt;br/&gt;reproduction of sparse species, and image sharpening. The knowledge&lt;br/&gt;gained in this project would not only have significant implications to&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of complex geometry which in turn could be very useful&lt;br/&gt;to the study of mathematical physics, but also may lead to new&lt;br/&gt;understanding of singularity formations in other geometric evolutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------</AbstractNarration>
