    <AbstractNarration>0243425 Helmuth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Western Transportation Institute at Montana State University for research opportunities for undergraduate students in rural transportation research. Eight undergraduate students will be selected each summer to participate in a ten-week residential program. Students will present their research results at the end of the program at an in-house symposium and will produce a written report on their results. This summer REU program will provide students from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to engage in current research topics relevant to improving rural transportation. The program aims to increase students' awareness of the breadth of rural transportation issues and promote fundamental scientific understanding of the importance of innovative transportation research. The program is designed to improve students' research, collaborative, and professional skills in order to address the nation's need for innovative researchers and professionals capable of developing creative long-term solutions to complex rural transportation issues. This REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.</AbstractNarration>
