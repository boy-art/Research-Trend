    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the problem of generating intelligent behavior in complex settings. The need for generating such behavior is evidenced in many areas, including game playing, business operations, and military engagements. The objective of the research is to identify suitable means for a self-adaptive system to explore alternative possible allocations of resources and to learn how to respond to stimuli with only minimal human intervention. The research will focus on the combination of evolutionary computation and neural networks, and, in particular, will include object networks that examine subsections of a scene and are combined to render a decision regarding the appropriate course of action. The anticipated results include the identification of appropriate methods for evolving these complex object neural networks, as well as the suitability of the results for direct application in commercial markets, particularly in the area of software entertainment&lt;br/&gt; The possible commercial applications include strategic assessment of dynamic combat environments, optimization of business operations in supply-chain management and logistics, and the development of intelligent opponents in video games. Natural Selection, Inc plans to focus on video game products as the most direct method for bringing the research to a commercial application with significant impact.</AbstractNarration>
