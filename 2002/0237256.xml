    <AbstractNarration>This project targets high energy, short lived, reactive molecules for study. The molecules of interest are generated by photolysis of synthetic precursors and the stable products of their chemical reactions are identified. Through UV-visible and infrared spectroscopic studies at time scales ranging from nanosecond to picosecond, complemented by Density Functional Theory calculations, four main objectives will be targeted. The rates with which photochemically generated reactive intermediates lose heat to solvent will be measured, and possible rearrangements to more stable isomers as they cool will be explored. New reactive intermediates will be probed by nanosecond time resolved flash photolysis of precursors at 77K. Specific solvation of carbenes in coordinating solvents will be examined. Carbenoids and nitrenoids derived from the reactions of carbenes and nitrenes with salts will be characterized by both time resolved spectroscopy and by chemical reactivity studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the research of Professor Matthew S. Platz of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University. Professor Platz creates and studies interesting highly reactive and short-lived molecules. Although such molecules are of basic scientific interest, they have much practical value in making larger molecules. They are also used by biochemists to attach small probe molecules to larger ones such as proteins, by materials scientists and in industry as photoresists and in lithography. Students working on this project will be educated to become problem solvers who will eventually apply their skills to solving problems in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and in academe.</AbstractNarration>
