    <AbstractNarration>CCR-0210176&lt;br/&gt;Crommie, Michael&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and &lt;br/&gt;Engineering initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT. The main objective of this project is to develop and characterize mechanical devices at the nanoscale. This will be performed through the creation of new, synthetic molecular machines purposefully designed in a molecule-by-molecule fashion. In order to achieve this goal an interdisciplinary team of researchers has been gathered that will engage in the following &lt;br/&gt;activities:&lt;br/&gt;1) chemically synthesize new molecules having tailored properties to be used as nano-machine components, 2) adhere newly synthesized molecules to prepared surfaces and demonstrate mechanical functionality, 3) combine photolithographic MEMS technology with carbon growth techniques to create electro-mechanically actuated molecular motors from carbon nanotubes. Two new categories of functional molecular assemblies are expected to result from this research. The first involves chemically engineered molecules designed with specific mechanical functions in mind. This research thrust will be supported by a strong chemical synthesis effort aimed at the development of new classes of molecules able to undergo conformational changes when triggered by an outside stimulus. The second category involves the engineering of multi-wall carbon nanotubes to form the basis of a new mechano-molecular technology. This effort is expected to culminate in the demonstration of the first functional nanotube motor.</AbstractNarration>
