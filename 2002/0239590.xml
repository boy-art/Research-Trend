    <AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: AST-0239590&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Wichita State University&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ferguson, Jason&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jason Ferguson of Wichita State University (WSU) will pursue calculations of the opacity of cold dust grains. Dust is evident in the interstellar medium, circumstellar dust shells around dying stars, and in disks around newly forming planets. Dust has a vital role in the formation of stars and planets. Dust reddens and dims the light from distant galaxies. Astronomers modeling these diverse conditions need accurate dust physics including the interaction of dust with light: opacity. Opacities are essential for the computation of the passage of radiation through matter. Astronomers modeling such diverse processes as star and planet formation, accretion disk physics, and stellar evolution need opacity tables that contain data over a wide range of temperature, density, and chemical composition. Dr. Ferguson will develop methods to improve the computation of these opacities and the physics involved. He will also integrate his research into upper division level astronomy courses, allowing students to participate directly in the modeling of astrophysical phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to his research, Dr. Ferguson will implement inquiry based learning in the undergraduate astronomy curriculum at WSU with assistance from the Curriculum &amp; Instruction (C&amp;I) Department in the College of Education. He will also work with the C&amp;I department to design and implement a new physical science course for non-science educators. The course activities will also be offered as workshops to in-service teachers during the summer.</AbstractNarration>
