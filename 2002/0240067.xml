    <AbstractNarration>In this project, various radio resource allocation problems that arise in multi-hop wireless communication networks are proposed, where the main focus is on broadband wireless infrastructure networks. The aim is to help facilitate the realization of such networks by developing system level approaches to reducing cost and maximizing performance. The resource allocation problems considered include transmission scheduling, routing, power control, and topology configuration, including node placement, and node density planning. In this project, rigorous mathematical analysis techniques will be developed that have not previously been applied to the design of wireless infrastructure networks. These techniques will be combined with practical engineering approaches to yield novel network architectures and improved insight into the design space for multi-hop wireless networks. The results of the project could help to enable low cost, ubiquitous wireless networks that support very high data rates. Development of resource allocation technology underlying broadband wireless infrastructure networks, as presented here, may enable other related applications, including high bandwidth sensor networks and ad-hoc networks. For example, cost effective high bandwidth wireless infrastructure network technology may lead to "grass root" development of highly robust communications infrastructures whose control and ownership is distributed among end-users. The improvement of the efficiency of wireless information transport may enable large-scale video surveillance networks.</AbstractNarration>
