    <AbstractNarration>The Workshop on Early Child and Brain Development will be held in Bucharest, Romania June&lt;br/&gt;12-15, 2002. The primary objective of the workshop is to open a dialogue between Romanian&lt;br/&gt;researchers, academics and practitioners and their American counterparts. The state of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge in Romania on early child development and brain development has suffered as a&lt;br/&gt;result of long communist rule, and has advanced slowly in the decade since the fall of Nicolae&lt;br/&gt;Ceausescu. As such, the workshop will also provide an introduction to the Romanian participants&lt;br/&gt;to state-of-the-art knowledge in early child development and early brain development. The&lt;br/&gt;Romanians and Americans participating in the workshop will be able to work together to&lt;br/&gt;determine the specific information and resource needs of the various fields represented by&lt;br/&gt;Romanian workshop participants. Finally, the workshop will enable the American participants to&lt;br/&gt;make connections with possible collaborators and/or likely recipients for future&lt;br/&gt;academic/research support.</AbstractNarration>
