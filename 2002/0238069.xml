    <AbstractNarration>The work will provide an integrated electronic infrastructure that will act as a catalyst for the transmission of information across many boundaries. Collaborating partners in this CAREER effort include universities within the US, in Japan and in Africa. The program seeks to develop a real-time data collection, integration and management system to monitor free-ranging chimpanzees for conservation purposes. Novel non-invasive techniques will be developed to obtain the physiological status of the chimpanzees. Data will be captured by mobile handheld modules on PDAs in standardized formats. The software is linked to a global positioning system. Modules in the field in Tanzania will be downloaded, stored, and served from a database in Virginia. The server will be web-enabled, to both disseminate information and be the basis of an education program, which involves students across many levels.</AbstractNarration>
