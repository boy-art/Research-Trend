    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Modeling the genetics of species using biological informatics: interactions of gene flow, selection, and dispersal." This simulation model uses parameters compiled from biological databases to evaluate the role of gene flow, selection coefficients and dispersal on the rate of allelic spread across subdivided populations. The research provides information on how species may remain cohesive at only a handful of major loci while simultaneously diverging at many minor loci, and has implications for explaining the relationship between macro- and microevolution.</AbstractNarration>
