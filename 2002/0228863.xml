    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) for a long-standing program of travel assistance to qualified and active oceanographic researchers from developing countries and nations with economies in transition. SCOR travel grants are awarded to enable such individuals to attend international meetings relevant to their scientific interests and to those of SCOR and the Division of Ocean Sciences of NSF. This ongoing project has become the cornerstone of SCOR's efforts to provide assistance to marine scientists in the third world and, more recently in Russia and Eastern Europe. All recipients of funds are informed that this assistance is made possible through a grant to SCOR from the US National Science Foundation. Project objectives include: broading the participation of scientists from developing countries, eastern Europe, and Russia in international marine science events; encouraging contacts between scientists from the United States and other developed countries with their colleagues in developing countries, and to facilitate the transfer of knowledge in all disciplines of oceanography; making available specialized regional knowledge and expertise at meetings where this is needed, for example, in the planning of regional components of large-scale experiments; and providing opportunities for involvement of developing country scientists in international collaborative programs.</AbstractNarration>
