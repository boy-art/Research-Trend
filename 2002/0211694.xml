    <AbstractNarration>This dissertation investigates how gender-based asylum policies have developed and been administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). In 1995 the INS created a category of gender-specific types of persecution. Examples of gender-based persecution are rape, sexual abuse, genital mutilation, forced marriage, forced sterilization, and domestic violence. The United States is one of only three nations to implement a 1991 United Nations call to recognize gender-based persecution. The history and administration of this policy will be investigated by interviews with INS officials, administrative hearing officers, immigration attorneys, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), human rights activists, and asylum seekers. Observation of hearings and NGO meetings will also provide information on how the policy is being implemented. In addition, archival materials such as INS and UN documents, attorney case files, and NGO reports will provide background information on the history of the policy and its administration.</AbstractNarration>
