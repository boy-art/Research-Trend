    <AbstractNarration>This project will build a QoIA-aware attack resistant database&lt;br/&gt;system framework, call Linba. The trustworthiness of a computing&lt;br/&gt;system in delivering valid services in face of attacks has&lt;br/&gt;become a more critical concern than ever as people are experiencing&lt;br/&gt;increased cyber security threats. A Quality of Information&lt;br/&gt;Assurance (QoIA) service is a service associated with a specific level&lt;br/&gt;of trustworthiness. From the viewpoint of end users, the goal of trusted&lt;br/&gt;computing is to enable people to get the QoIA services that they&lt;br/&gt;have subscribed for even in face of attacks. However, (most) existing&lt;br/&gt;trusted systems cannot deliver QoIA services since they have very limited&lt;br/&gt;ability in providing (sustained) quantitative trustworthiness guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to build a new trusted computing&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure that is able to continue delivering QoIA services&lt;br/&gt;in face of attacks and cost constraints. Based on a novel formal&lt;br/&gt;(service) trustworthiness model, Linba&lt;br/&gt;delivers multilevel, differential, quantitative QoIA services&lt;br/&gt;through near optimal neuro-fuzzy composite QoIA adaptations where&lt;br/&gt;Linba intelligently adapts itself to environment changes and&lt;br/&gt;QoIA-cost tradeoffs are done in an optimized way. Successful&lt;br/&gt;development of Linba will arm existing trusted database systems&lt;br/&gt;with the ability to deliver QoIA services (in a cost-effective&lt;br/&gt;way) and provide very valuable hints on developing a variety of other&lt;br/&gt;types of trusted computing systems that can deliver QoIA services.&lt;br/&gt;The cost-effectiveness of Linba will be evaluated through&lt;br/&gt;simulation or prototyping.</AbstractNarration>
