    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program will support faculty in the Applied Physics and Applied Mechanics groups at Harvard University with the acquisition of a thin film deposition system with in-situ stress monitor. The system will be used for the growth of metal films that range in thickness from tens of nanometers to several micrometers, for a comprehensive study of thin film mechanical properties. The main focus of this study is the deformation behavior of elemental metal and alloy films. Basic deformation mechanisms and interactions with microstructural features such as grain size, grain orientation, grain boundaries, interfaces, surfaces, and dislocation substructure will be explored. Alloy films will be used to investigate precipitation hardening and the shape memory effect in thin films. The deposition system will also support research on self-organized nanostructure evolution and amorphous metallic films. Students at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels will use the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the IMR Program will support faculty in the Applied Physics and Applied Mechanics groups in the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University with the acquisition of a thin film deposition system with in-situ stress monitor. The system will be used in graduate research projects on thin film mechanics, self-organized nanostructure evolution, and amorphous metallic films. In addition to the graduate research program, a special program will be set up to involve undergraduate students in original thin films research in the framework of an independent research course offered by the Division. The deposition system will also significantly advance undergraduate education through the development of special laboratory sessions for an Introductory Materials Science course. These sessions will serve as a first introduction to thin film technology, but are also intended to foster interest in advanced Materials Engineering studies.</AbstractNarration>
