    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative effort is developing activities that integrate knowledge building and formative assessment in the evaluation of learning at the introductory physics level. Included in this effort is the development of research-based formative assessment tools. These tools involve active engagement methods with appropriate feedback in the form of test kits of activities that are common in the practice of science and engineering. Such activities have been found to be the most effective intervention to help students achieve desired learning outcomes. Each kit includes six different types of activities, along with templates and rubrics that instructors can use for evaluation, and that students can use for self and small-group assessment of their own work. The scoring rubrics assess students' development of science and engineering abilities, and allow instructors to evaluate outcomes, improve the quality of feedback (the most important part of formative assessment), and establish the validity of the activities--do they assess the desired skills. The components of the kits are being developed and tested in large-enrollment introductory physics courses in two universities (one large research and one medium comprehensive university) with 1600 students each year, in a high school physics course (100 students/year), and in methods courses for pre-service teachers (15 teachers/year). Dissemination of the kits occurs via the web and by a publisher (hard copy and a CD), peer-reviewed papers, workshops and talks at national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
