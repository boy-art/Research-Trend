    <AbstractNarration>The University of the Virgin Islands seeks NSF support to undertake a series of planning activities designed to identify and address the competitive research and education challenges facing the Virgin Islands. The principal outcome of this effort will be development of a 10-year plan for strengthening the Territory's Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) research and education enterprise. Specific activities will assess existing STEM research resources and strengths; identify potential institutional and territorial barriers to development of competitive research; develop a priority list of research areas and disciplines for development tied to UVI's strategic mission and the Territory's development needs; and determine the human, financial and technological resources required to succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the only institution of higher education in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the University of the Virgin Islands fulfills a variety of community needs - from community college to workforce training to liberal arts education to research university. The strengthening of the research enterprise is clearly associated with enhancing the Territory's ability to meet its workforce training needs and take advantage of new opportunities for technology-based diversification of the Virgin Islands' economy. The University will build and expand on a number of existing collaborations with institutions and private sector organizations within and outside of the Virgin Islands. Furthermore, plans for establishment of a research and technology park will be developed to maximize these collaborations and to grow and sustain the science, engineering and technology enterprise in the Virgin Islands.</AbstractNarration>
