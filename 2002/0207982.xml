    <AbstractNarration>0207982&lt;br/&gt;Hamburger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EarthScope is a major earth science research initiative that will integrate scientific information derived from seismology (US Array), geodesy (Plate boundary Observatory), subsurface sampling and measurement (SAFOD), remote sensing (InSAR), and complementary geology and geophysics to understand continental scale plate deformation and evolution. Funding for the EarthScope initiative is currently being discussed in Congress as part of NSF's FY 2003 budget. The Division of Earth Sciences has made FY 2002 funds available for projects that qualify as pre-EarthScope activity, i.e. activities that will facilitate or enable the construction, fabrication, installation or operation of EarthScope once it is funded under the MREFC (Major Research Equipment Facilities and Construction) account. Such activities include meetings and workshops, prototype development, site selection or characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds to support a focused workshop on active magmatic systems. The workshop will provide a forum for interdisciplinary discussion of magmatic systems and will result in a detailed, integrated deployment and operations plan for the magmatic systems component of EarthScope. Participants will be invited from a variety of disciplines related to geological, geophysical, and geochemical study of active magmatic systems. The meeting will be conducted in a setting of one of western North America's active volcanic systems (e.g. Cascades, Long Valley, Alaska), and will include a full-day field trip on active volcanic processes.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
