    <AbstractNarration>This award will fund an NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conference entitled ``The Web of Modularity''&lt;br/&gt;to be held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the summer of 2003. The conference lecturer will be Professor Ken Ono of the University of Wisconsin at Madison; Professor Ono will give &lt;br/&gt;ten lectures centered around the diverse roles which the theory of modular forms plays in various areas of mathematics related to Number Theory. The conference will focus on a wide array of problems which can be addressed through the use of modular forms. These include, among others, problems from representation theory, partition theory, arithmetic geometry, the theory of L-functions, hypergeometric series, and combinatorics. Although these comprise a very broad array of topics in active areas of mathematical research, they share the feature that they can be understood using a unified set of techniques from the theory of modular forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the conference are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) To present an organized and motivated description of the important and diverse role which modular forms play in Number Theory and other areas of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) To provide young mathematicians and newcomers to the field (particularly graduate students and post-docs)with an accessible account of important techniques, theorems, and open problems at the forefront of this area of research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) To provide established researchers an opportunity to share their expertise and to interact with each other and with junior mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) To strengthen regional ties among researchers working in areas connected to the themes of the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) To plan a scientific program which will lead to a published monograph of lasting importance to the wider mathematical community.</AbstractNarration>
