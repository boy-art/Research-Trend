    <AbstractNarration>Two forces have exacerbated problems associated with packet processing. First, demands for higher bandwidth and line rates challenge our abilities to perform real-time packet processing. Second, more complex functional requirements and services are being defined that significantly increase packet computational demand. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In response, modern routers are being equipped with Network Processors (NPs) that include both general-purpose multiprocessing and special hardware capabilities. NPs push the envelope of our design capabilities. This research aims at quantifying NP design and at developing a performance driven methodology that is cognizant of both physical constraints (e.g., area, power) and the computational requirements of packet applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal architectural approaches (parallelism, pipelining, instruction specialization) are investigated and design procedures for exploiting these architectural paradigms are developed. The NP architecture models along with associated benchmarking lead to a coherent NP design methodology and extend our understanding of real-time computer design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research directly benefits the rapidly expanding area of NP and router design, and network performance. The techniques utilized are those of classical computer architecture, including the formalization of the design constraints, development of design models, and the use of benchmarks for quantitative model parameterization.</AbstractNarration>
