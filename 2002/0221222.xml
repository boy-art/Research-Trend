    <AbstractNarration>0221222&lt;br/&gt;Inman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan America Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) award, jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE), is being organized by Dr. Daniel Inman of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in collaboration with Dr. Vincent Lopes of the Universidade Estadual Paulista. The proposed activity will take place in Florianopolis and Santa Catarina, Brazil in November 2003, and will bring together well-qualified researchers in diverse disciplines related to damage prognosis. The main objective is to involve forty to fifty postdoctoral, advanced graduate students, senior scientists and engineers in a two-week intensive course that highlights interdisciplinary efforts in fields related to damage prognosis. The key unifying theme of the proposed course is to tie in three areas: 1) hardware to implement prognosis; 2) damage mechanics to model and understand the physical principles of prognosis; and 3) algorithms to make appropriate predictions, to form a Prognostic System and understand the nature of the interface between the three areas.</AbstractNarration>
