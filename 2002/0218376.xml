    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0218376&lt;br/&gt;Thomas LaBean&lt;br/&gt;Duke University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel DNA Nanostructures for Targeted Molecular Scale too Micron Scale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main thrust of this project is to develop fabrication techniques which bridge the gap between two size scales: (i) the micron scale, where conventional lithographic methods provide efficient top-down object construction, and (ii) the molecular scale, where viable bottom-up techniques for object assembly are beginning to emerge. The key problem addressed is how molecular scale structures can be selectively attached and interconnected with micron scale structures such that the molecular scale structures are functional. Bridging this gap is particularly important for advancing molecular-electronics into practical applications and for continuing the miniaturization trend of micro-electronics. This project approaches the scale gap challenge by the use of novel DNA nanostructures that have a scale between the two and can be made to selectively assemble with either. These structures present unique opportunities: (i) they provide for selective attachments via DNA annealing, (ii) they have length scales and flexibility permitting attachment to micron scale structures (iii) they can be metallized to provide conductive interconnects, (iv) potentially they can be used to orient other nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes. The major research steps to be taken include: (1) development of a diverse family of DNA nanostructures, (2) further characterization of existing DNA nanostructures, (3) further development of metallization techniques for these DNA nanostructures, (4) attachment experiments to various materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project impacts important educational objectives by providing training opportunities for science students at several educational levels. Funds are included for a high school student from the SEED project for under-represented minority students, as well as for a graduate student and half the salary of a post-doctoral fellow. Training of students at graduate and undergraduate levels is helping to create future scientists with strong interests in nanotechnology, DNA engineering, and related fields critical to continued growth in electronics and computer sciences.</AbstractNarration>
