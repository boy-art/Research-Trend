    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0203924&lt;br/&gt;Choset, Howard&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: CISE Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Topologically Inspired Multi-Agent Robotic Systems with Coverage Tasks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will contribute to the development of the underlying science in using topological information encoded in a free space to spatially allocate members of a multi-agent team to achieve a particular task. Converge path planning (a new motion planning approach that determines a path ensuring a robot's end effector will pass over all points in a target region) will be used as the focusing task for multi-robot team allocation theory development and experimental verification. The postdoctoral associate and the principal investigator will consider how to decrease the time of operation (i.e., work in parallel) and create qualitative synergies among robots working together in a team. The expected outcome is a new geometric result based on Kalman filtering theory, which will support planning optimal motions for agents engaged in mutual positioning. The associate will also participate in educational activities, specifically including robotic LEGO modules for undergraduate and middle school education.</AbstractNarration>
