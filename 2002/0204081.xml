    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0204081 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Kuperbeg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted on continuous dynamical systems on&lt;br/&gt;manifolds of dimension three and higher, with emphasis on &lt;br/&gt;compact invariant subsets on which the flow is minimal. &lt;br/&gt;Continuing the work related to the real analytic solution to &lt;br/&gt;the Seifert conjecture on aperiodic flows acting on the &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional sphere, the PI plans to classify the minimal &lt;br/&gt;sets in such flows with respect to their homological and shape &lt;br/&gt;theory properties. Minimal sets shape-equivalent (in the sense&lt;br/&gt;of Borsuk) to a polyhedron often appear in flows as&lt;br/&gt;attractors, and are of special interest. Minimal sets of &lt;br/&gt;non-polyhedral shape are usually approximated by circular &lt;br/&gt;orbits or by other movable sets with the so called UV-property.&lt;br/&gt;They have very complicated dynamics around them, which can be &lt;br/&gt;investigated through the structure of the family of the &lt;br/&gt;approximating invariant sets. Circular orbits are extremely&lt;br/&gt;important in celestial mechanics as they appear as paths of &lt;br/&gt;movement. Smaller particles, dust, can align along a braided &lt;br/&gt;orbit, and in the continuous case, in a mathematical model, &lt;br/&gt;this "orbit" could be an invariant set, aperiodic but &lt;br/&gt;"circle-like", or "graph-like" such as the &lt;br/&gt;well-known Denjoy continua. A volume-preserving dynamical system, &lt;br/&gt;associated with incompressible fluids, imposes restrictions on &lt;br/&gt;the flow outside the special invariant collection and is an &lt;br/&gt;important area of study as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of dynamical systems was developed in an effort to&lt;br/&gt;provide a mathematically rigorous description of real physical &lt;br/&gt;phenomena. It is therefore closely connected to many domains &lt;br/&gt;of science: mechanics, various areas of physics, biology, and &lt;br/&gt;economics. Dynamical systems connect several branches of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics such as analysis, topology, geometry, algebra, &lt;br/&gt;and combinatorics.</AbstractNarration>
