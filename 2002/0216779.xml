    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the acquisition of a field emission gun for a scanning Auger Microscope at PA St U University Park. Scanning Auger Microscope is an important tool for the study of surfaces, interfaces and thin films. The purchase of an electron gun will allow this technique to be performed in existing equipment at Penn State. Materials researchers will use scanning Auger microscopy to address important questions in the development of &lt;br/&gt;both conventional and nanoscale semiconductor devices, superconductors, and carbon nanostructures. Users in the Center for Innovative Sintered Products, Center for Thin Film Devices, and National Nanofabrication Users Network at Penn State will also &lt;br/&gt;benefit from availability of the technique. The equipment will be integrated into an existing undergraduate laboratory course in materials science and engineering, and a new one credit graduate course will be offered to teach students about the principles and operation of the scanning Auger microscope. Both graduate and undergraduate students will use the equipment for research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the acquisition of a field emission gun for a scanning Auger Microscope at PA St U University Park.
