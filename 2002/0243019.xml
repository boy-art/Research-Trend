    <AbstractNarration>Paul Devlin of Oklahoma State University is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the properties of icy nanoparticles and their interactions with strong adsorbates at the molecular level. The research focuses on two topics: (1) solvation in two dimensions: spectroscopic studies of acid adsorbates on surfaces of hydrogen-bonded nanoparticles, and (2) electrical properties of ice particles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and computer simulation methods will guide the effort to understand the comparative nature of water ice and methanol particle surfaces, and their respective interactions with strong hydrogen-bonding adsorbates at temperatures less than 140 K. Adsorbates capable of cleaving normal hydrogen bonds, such as the acids HCl, HBr, HI, HF, and nitric acid, will be given a special emphasis. Methanol particles will enable studies complementary to those for water ice, and are expected to lead to new insights into both systems. Studies into electrical properties of ice nanoparticles aim to advance molecular level understanding of issues including surface and interior mobility of ionic and orientational defects. Collaborations will continue with theorist Victoria Buch of Hebrew University, and others. The outcomes of this research are expected to impact related problems in atmospheric, planetary, and biochemical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice plays an important role in a variety of natural phenomena, including precipitation, electrical storms, atmospheric chemistry, and space science. This research is expected to lead to increased understanding of the structure of ice surfaces and the mechanisms by which molecules adsorb strongly and weakly onto ice nanocrystals. Results will be pertinent to scientific areas of current interest, including hydrogen bonding in biochemical systems, proton transfer and transport in the atmosphere, and properties of charged icy particles in the atmosphere. In addition, this research is expected to improve the understanding of diurnal variations in the atmospheres of the icy moons of Jupiter, chemistry of the icy mantels of interstellar dust particles, and clathrate hydrates important in fuel science.</AbstractNarration>
