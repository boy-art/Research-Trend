    <AbstractNarration>Li&lt;br/&gt;0211614&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this project is to develop mathematical theory&lt;br/&gt;regarding biodiversity in the context of resource competition.&lt;br/&gt;Recent numerical work suggests that competition for multiple&lt;br/&gt;resources can generate periodic oscillations or even chaotic&lt;br/&gt;oscillations, and a large number of species can coexist on very&lt;br/&gt;few limiting resources. However, both mathematicians and&lt;br/&gt;ecologists still lack analytic understanding of mechanisms that&lt;br/&gt;generate diversity in ecological communities. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies several resource competition models, including standard&lt;br/&gt;competition models with multiple resources and competition models&lt;br/&gt;within food webs; he gives rigorous analysis for the models and&lt;br/&gt;provides insight into diversity of competing species. Theory of&lt;br/&gt;differential equations and theory of dynamical systems are used&lt;br/&gt;to determine the long-term behavior of solutions of the models in&lt;br/&gt;the form of attracting steady states, limiting cycles or strange&lt;br/&gt;attractors. Important issues are what causes competing species to&lt;br/&gt;coexist, and locating parameter ranges in which coexistence&lt;br/&gt;occurs.&lt;br/&gt; The question of the maintenance of species diversity in&lt;br/&gt;natural systems has intrigued mathematicians and ecologists for a&lt;br/&gt;very long time. This work provides a general understanding of&lt;br/&gt;factors affecting abundance and biodiversity. The results have&lt;br/&gt;important implications for determining the patterns of species&lt;br/&gt;composition in aquatic and terrestrial systems, and for managing&lt;br/&gt;natural resources such as forests and lakes.</AbstractNarration>
