    <AbstractNarration>It proposes to convene at Atmospheric CO 2 Inversion Intercomparison Workshop at the Colorado State University campus in Fort Collins, Colorado in February 2002. This workshop will focus upon issues central to the IGBP Task force on Global Analysis, Interpretation and Modelling (GAIM) with strong links to the Carbon Joint Project (CJP). The workshop will build on the results of a previous TransCom workshop held in Melbourne, Australia in March 2001. Proposed project seeks to bring the research community together for the purpose of finalizing current activities through the analysis and synthesis of several ongoing activities: 1) Analysis of seasonal, stationary and time-dependent inversions in an attempt to identify a central, control TM version of each; 2. Data sensitivity tests (testing inverse results against various spatial and GCM sub-sampling schemes); 3. Optimization of sampling networks, both selectively and with a genetic algorithm; 4 Comparison of the seasonality, the phase and amplitude of the rectifier effects with data; 5. Collaboration with other groups (SCRIPPS/SIO) on an Atmospheric Potential Oxygen (APO) experiment; and 6) Development of collaboration with the Biosphere-Atmosphere Stable Isotope (BASIN) community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop will include 20 participants representing inverse modeling groups that are currently contributing to TransCom analyses and syntheses.</AbstractNarration>
