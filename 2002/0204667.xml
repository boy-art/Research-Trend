    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0204667.&lt;br/&gt;PI: Zhiqin Lu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; On the Geometry of Kaehler-Einstein Manifold&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the proposer is going to understand&lt;br/&gt;Kaehler-Einstein metrics, especially Calabi-Yau manifolds&lt;br/&gt;using the theory of moduli spaces, through three different&lt;br/&gt;ways. The first way is to study the potential function of&lt;br/&gt;the Bergman metric of a polarized compact Kaehler&lt;br/&gt;manifold. For the application in the Kaehler-Einstein&lt;br/&gt;geometry, one needs to estimate the potential function from&lt;br/&gt;below for a family of manifolds. The problem is related to&lt;br/&gt;the stability of manifolds in the sense of Geometric&lt;br/&gt;Invariant Theory. The second way is to study the relation&lt;br/&gt;between the K stability and the Mumford stability. Such a&lt;br/&gt;relation, if exists, would give one new insights of the&lt;br/&gt;relations between the Kaehler-Einstein geometry and the&lt;br/&gt;stability of manifolds. The third way is the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;moduli space of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds. A Kaehler&lt;br/&gt;metric on the moduli space has been defined and was found&lt;br/&gt;that the Ricci curvature of such a metric is negative away&lt;br/&gt;from zero by the proposer. In order to introduce geometric&lt;br/&gt;analysis to the place, one needs to prove a version of the&lt;br/&gt;maximal principle on the moduli space, even if the moduli&lt;br/&gt;space, in general, is not smooth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Einstein's general theory of relativity is a theory that&lt;br/&gt;interprets the concept of gravity into the geometric&lt;br/&gt;property of the space. Recent development of in physics&lt;br/&gt;shows that the universe may be of dimension ten, with three&lt;br/&gt;dimension in space and one dimension in time plus a tiny&lt;br/&gt;six dimensional space called Calabi-Yau threefold. One of&lt;br/&gt;the main mathematical tool to study the geometry of the&lt;br/&gt;space is differential geometry. Since the discovery of the&lt;br/&gt;general relativity, differential geometry becomes crucial to&lt;br/&gt;both mathematicians and physicists. The project is one of&lt;br/&gt;the main field in differential geometry. It will help a lot&lt;br/&gt;in understanding one of the basic force of the universe: the&lt;br/&gt;gravity and ultimately understanding the space we are living&lt;br/&gt;with. It is difficult to believe that without an extensive&lt;br/&gt;study of fundamental sciences such as general relativity,&lt;br/&gt;modern technology like the use of atomic energy can come&lt;br/&gt;true. By the same reason, today's fundamental study will not&lt;br/&gt;only enlarge our knowledge but eventually benefit people's&lt;br/&gt;life as well.</AbstractNarration>
