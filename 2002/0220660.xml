    <AbstractNarration>This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students enrolled in Computer Science, Computer Support Specialist, Engineering, Engineering Technology and Mathematics. The program uses existing facilities at BSC to recruit high school students and provide them with a host of academic support and faculty and peer mentoring to succeed in their education. Efforts are also focused on recruiting women and minority students in the program. The participating students can earn additional college credits through internships and cooperative education experience. The students in the program also have the opportunity to do research by participating in internships with industrial and government partners. This experience provides an opportunity for them to apply their knowledge gained in classes to finding solutions to real world problems. Job placement assistance is provided to participants who graduate from the program and desire employment in their fields.</AbstractNarration>
