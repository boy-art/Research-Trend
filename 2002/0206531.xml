    <AbstractNarration>A key goal of ecology is to understand how ecosystems process materials and energy.&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, we focus on the energetic importance of terrestrially-derived dissolved&lt;br/&gt;organic matter (DOM) for lake ecosystems. Using laboratory-based studies, we will&lt;br/&gt;assess how terrestrial DOM quantity and quality influence the production and growth&lt;br/&gt;efficiency of pelagic bacteria. These two processes ultimately dictate how much&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial DOM enters lake food webs. We will then incorporate the laboratory data into&lt;br/&gt;a simulation model that will predict conditions under which terrestrial DOM is likely to&lt;br/&gt;be energetically important for higher trophic levels. We are particularly interested in&lt;br/&gt;using the model to assess terrestrial carbon flow in lakes with contrasting food webs and&lt;br/&gt;trophic states. Finally, we will test model predictions by examining the stable isotopic&lt;br/&gt;signatures (delta 13 C) in zooplankton from a wide array of New England lakes. Results from&lt;br/&gt;this study will clarify the energetic importance of spatially linked ecosystems and&lt;br/&gt;broaden our understanding of how allochthonous inputs influence food web dynamics. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, our studies will aid in decision-making regarding land use activities that modify&lt;br/&gt;carbon export to lakes such as agriculture, shoreline development, forestry, and wetland&lt;br/&gt;delineation.</AbstractNarration>
