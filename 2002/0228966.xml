    <AbstractNarration>0228966&lt;br/&gt;Niebur&lt;br/&gt;This symposium is designed to explore the function of biological tissues as modulators of mechanical stimuli applied to cells and as transducers of mechanical forces. A wide variety of lectures will be presented, ranging from tissue formation and remodeling, to methodologies for probing the mechanical properties of tissues and cells. Speakers with expertise in a wide range of biological systems will develop a broad understanding of mechanobiological processes. By promoting discussion and presenting current research, the proceedings will advance our current understanding of mechanobiology and foster new research by exposing gaps in current knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will bring together acknowledged experts in the field of tissue mechanics to provide training, insight, and advice to those interested in becoming involved in this field of research. It will also provide a forum for discussion and debate of the current state of knowledge of mechanics and mechanobiology for different tissues. Tutorial lectures on bone, cardiovascular, and cartilage remodeling will provide attendees with a view of the current state of the art in each of these fields, and emphasize important areas of future research. The meeting is to promote interaction between engineers, physicists, mathematicians, biologists, and chemists with interests in biomechanics and mechanobiology. Also, it provides a forum for junior faculty and graduate students to interact with a wide range of experts in the field of tissue mechanics and mechanobiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proceedings of the conference will be compiled and disseminated to all participants, and will be made available electronically over the world-wide-web.</AbstractNarration>
