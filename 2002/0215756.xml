    <AbstractNarration>Recent studies on the autoignition behavior of fuel-rich methane/air mixtures at elevated pressures suggests that mixtures at equivalence ratios of around 4 can be made to react rapidly for pressures above 8 atmospheres, and thus it may be possible to stabilize the process in a modified burner configuration for continuous production of product gases. Current mechanisms for fuel-rich methane combustion--those used to model 'cool-flame' behavior of methane--predict that the product gases resulting from such combustion will have hydrogen yields that exceed current combustion approaches and hydrogen:water ratios of 3 or better. In this work, a high-pressure reactor for combustion of methane/air mixtures at equivalence ratios of approximately 4 is designed and constructed. The reactor is designed to facilitate stabilization of these flows, which are characterized by long induction times and low heat release. In addition, the reactor has complete optical access, enabling detailed temperature and species concentration measurements in a flow that is optimized for comparison with the predictions of a kinetic model. Using this reactor, an extensive characterization of the combustion of very rich methane/air mixtures at elevated pressures is conducted. Temperature and formaldehyde spatial profiles, induction times, and detailed product yields are measured as a functions of process parameters, and the propensity for soot formation is examined. Using these data, current kinetic models are evaluated and analyzed under these conditions. This study is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of elevated pressure, air-based combustion techniques for hydrogen synthesis from natural gas, as well as to develop the tools for computational process analysis and optimization, while simultaneously generating an extensive and detailed dataset on the unique &lt;br/&gt;combustion behavior of this important mixture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economical conversion of natural gas to hydrogen fuel is critical to realization of large-scale use of hydrogen as a fuel for transportation and for industry. In addition, widespread use of fuel cells likewise requires an inexpensive source for hydrogen. Most current hydrogen synthesis schemes, for example steam methane reforming and catalytic partial oxidation, remain too costly, in part due to high costs associated with the catalysts that are inherent in these processes. Combustion technologies offer the promise of inexpensive hydrogen production through non-catalytic partial oxidation of natural gas to carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syngas). Such technologies can generate power and hydrogen simultaneously and can be designed to involve simple reactor facilities that require smaller capital costs. At least two such combustion processes are currently used by industry. Significant cost reduction in combustion process for hydrogen synthesis can be obtained if 1) the hydrogen:water ratio in the product gases (currently ~1 to 2) can be significantly improved, and 2) the required oxidizer is air rather than oxygen.</AbstractNarration>
