    <AbstractNarration>Project Number 0243227 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rowan University&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Chen&lt;br/&gt;Title: Adaptation of Concept Inventories for Rapid Feedback and Peer-Assisted Learning in Core Engineering Courses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our study is being conducted under the Adaptation track of the Assessment of Student Achievement in Undergraduate Education Program. The goal of our project has been to adapt the Concept Inventory for frequent classroom use, and to implement it in a system to provide rapid feedback to students of their understanding of key concepts during classroom lectures. This rapid feedback system acts as the focal point and catalyst to encourage students, working in pairs, to assist each other in correcting misconceptions or deepening each other's understanding of the topic at hand. Furthermore, the system allows the professor to assess the students' level of comprehension (or misconception) in a just-in-time fashion, and thus guides his or her pacing and coverage of the material. The system and methodology has been implemented in at least three core-engineering courses at two institutions.</AbstractNarration>
