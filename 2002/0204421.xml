    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT: DMS 0204421.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project we will continue to study the deformed equivariant Dirac&lt;br/&gt;operators on open manifolds. We will use the nice spectral properties of these&lt;br/&gt;operators to construct new invariants of manifolds. In particular, we introduce&lt;br/&gt;the regularized cohomology of equivariant holomorphic vector bundles over open&lt;br/&gt;Kaehler manifolds. One of the goals of the project is to extend the vanishing&lt;br/&gt;theorems and the semi-continuity theorem to non-compact setting. The&lt;br/&gt;applications will include the non-compact versions of Witten's holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;Morse inequalities and of the formula for the cohomology of the Mumford&lt;br/&gt;quotient, as well as new proofs of these results in the compact case. We also&lt;br/&gt;introduce an analogue of the Quillen metric on the determinant of the&lt;br/&gt;regularized cohomology and are planning to study this metric. This will shed a&lt;br/&gt;new light on the properties of the Quillen metric on compact manifolds. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, in a joint project with A. Abanov we suggest a mathematically&lt;br/&gt;rigorous description of the non-linear sigma-model describing the&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity. Jointly with P.-E. Paradan we a planning to use the deformed&lt;br/&gt;Dirac operator in the study of discrete series representations of Lie groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elliptic operators on compact manifolds have very nice properties. In this&lt;br/&gt;project we introduce a class of operators on non-compact manifolds with similar&lt;br/&gt;properties. The study of these operators not only leads to a generalization of&lt;br/&gt;many theorems from compact manifolds to non-compact ones, but also provides new&lt;br/&gt;results and methods in the theory of compact manifolds. The applications of&lt;br/&gt;these results and methods range from the mathematical theory of&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity to representation theory and complex geometry.</AbstractNarration>
