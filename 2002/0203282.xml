    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0203282&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dennis Stanton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several topics in q-analysis will be studied. A family&lt;br/&gt;of generalizations of the Gaussian integral is&lt;br/&gt;considered which has several q's. These integrals are&lt;br/&gt;closely related to the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, and&lt;br/&gt;new results are found which are motivated by the integrals.&lt;br/&gt;An investigation of the root system version of the integrals&lt;br/&gt;will be undertaken. Some new classical q-orthogonal&lt;br/&gt;polynomials, q-Taylor series and combinatorial enumeration&lt;br/&gt;problems will also be considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the simplest types of functions is a polynomial.&lt;br/&gt;More complicated functions such as sine, cosine,&lt;br/&gt;or exponentials can be approximated accurately using polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;The general theorem in calculus which allows such results is&lt;br/&gt;called Taylor's theorem, and it is used in applications&lt;br/&gt;throughout science. One of the objects of study in this proposal&lt;br/&gt;is a generalized approximation result, a q-Taylor theorem.&lt;br/&gt;It can be applied to functions currently under study in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and statistical physics. Several related integrals,&lt;br/&gt;derivatives, and polynomials are also studied.</AbstractNarration>
