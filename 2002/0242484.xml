    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this research involves the development of new chiral catalysts. Neutral and charged bi-,tri-, and tetra-dentate ligands will be used in conjunction with cationic copper (2+), tin (2+), aluminum (3+) and scandium (3+) metals in the generation of new families of chiral Lewis acids. Reactions under consideration will include enantioselective carbonyl addition processes, particularly aldol and vinylogous aldol reaction variants, cycloaddition, and conjugate- and hetero-conjugate addition processes. Catalysts will be developed that will implement both the enolization process and will moderate the subsequent electrophile-enolate bond construction with absolute stereochemical control. Catalyst structure will be examined using X-ray crystallography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. David A. Evans of the Department of Chemistry at the Harvard University. Professor Evans will focus his work on using a combination of fundamental concepts in inorganic coordination chemistry with mechanistic principles in organic chemistry for the design of chiral metal-based complexes that function as catalysts for important families of carbon-carbon bond forming processes. The project provides an excellent venue for the training of graduate students and the results of the research will have significant impact in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.</AbstractNarration>
