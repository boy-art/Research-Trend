    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0245406&lt;br/&gt;Yang, Tonghai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Arithmetic Cycles, Eisenstein Series, &lt;br/&gt; Automorphic L-Functions, and Complex Multiplication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the connections between generating functions&lt;br/&gt;for height pairings of arithmetic cycles on certain Shimura&lt;br/&gt;varieties, on the one hand, and second terms in the Laurent&lt;br/&gt;expansions of elliptic modular and Siegel modular Eisenstein&lt;br/&gt;series at certain critical points, on the other. The generating&lt;br/&gt;functions can be viewed as arithmetic analogues of theta functions&lt;br/&gt;and can be use to define arithmetic analogues of the classical&lt;br/&gt;theta correspondence, now taking certain types of modular forms to&lt;br/&gt;elements of arithmetic Chow groups. One application is to prove a&lt;br/&gt;version of the celebrated Gross-Zagier formula without base change&lt;br/&gt;the L-function. It is also hoped that one may&lt;br/&gt;ultimately obtain information about higher dimensional analogues&lt;br/&gt;of the Gross-Zagier formula and the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer&lt;br/&gt;conjecture. Another part of the project is to use arithmetic of&lt;br/&gt;genus two curves to study cryptography, which has very practical&lt;br/&gt;application in electronic communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the later part of the 20th century significant advances were made &lt;br/&gt;in developing a `number theoretic' geometry, in which an additional &lt;br/&gt;dimension is added to carry information involving the interaction &lt;br/&gt;between the geometry and prime numbers. To a point on such a &lt;br/&gt;space, one can attach a number call its height, which is a measure &lt;br/&gt;of its `arithmetic complexity'. More generally, heights can be defined &lt;br/&gt;for higher dimensional objects, curves on surfaces, for example. The &lt;br/&gt;present project studies combinatorial relations among such heights, &lt;br/&gt;which reflect hidden structure carried by the spaces of `number&lt;br/&gt;theoretic' geometry. One of the most important part in electronic&lt;br/&gt;communication such as credit card processing is security, which is&lt;br/&gt;done by means of cryptography. Since late 80's, it is found that&lt;br/&gt;number theory can be applied to obtain highly secure cryptographic&lt;br/&gt;system.</AbstractNarration>
