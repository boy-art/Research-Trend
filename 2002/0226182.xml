    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conferences, initiated in the late 1920's by Dr. Neil E. Gordon, promote discussions and the free exchange of ideas at the research frontiers of the biological, chemical and physical sciences. Scientists with common professional interests come together for a full week of intense discussion and examination of the most advanced aspects of their field. These Conferences, which are usually held in small isolated New England towns away from other distractions, are attended by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior investigators and senior scientists, and provide a valuable means of disseminating information and ideas. This award represents full or partial support of thirteen conferences in the biological sciences, being held in the summer of 2002 through the spring of 2003.</AbstractNarration>
