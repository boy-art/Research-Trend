    <AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships for academically talented and financially needy students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in math, computer science or information systems. The project focuses on recruitment of eligible students and builds upon the university's strong academic programs, assists the math/computer science department in meeting their goal of increasing majors in the department. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These scholarships enable the scholars to afford a high-quality private education, complete their degree, and attain a job with a high technology company or be accepted into graduate school. Current effective programs, such as faculty academic advising and peer tutoring, are maintained and expanded to ensure that the institution's strong graduation and placement rates are maintained for the scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student recruitment is conducted via a number of avenues, including the college's Outstanding and Distinguished Scholar Days, Science visit day, the college's admissions office, contacts with regional high school teachers, and utilizing the college's established Upward Bound and Educational Talent Search programs. The scholar's applications are reviewed by a team comprised of the PI and representatives from the offices of admissions, registrar, and student financial planning. The CSEMS faculty works with the university's Department of Career Services to seek out internship opportunities for the scholars as well as interviews for job placement.</AbstractNarration>
