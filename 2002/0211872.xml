    <AbstractNarration>The relationship between eukaryotic viruses and their hosts are characteristic of most&lt;br/&gt;host-pathogen relationships that have co-evolved. The outcomes of virus-host interactions are genetically pre-determined. To produce disease, viruses must enter the host, multiply locally in host tissues, spread from the site of entry, and overcome or evade host immune responses. Plants have evolved various anti-viral defense strategies to clear viral infection. On the other hand, viruses have evolved counter-defense strategies. Therefore, it is important to understand molecular mechanisms of how viruses evade the host's antiviral defenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Tobacco Rattle Virus-based virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) system will be used to identify suppressors of viral resistance and susceptibility factors. In addition, a functional proteomics approach will be used to study virus-host interactions. The knowledge gained from these studies will help to combat infectious plant diseases. Protection of crops from disease can significantly improve agricultural production. Application of a plant's own defense mechanism can lead to more effective protection against plant pathogens. Control of pathogen-induced diseases using cellular genes that function in the disease resistance signaling pathway may provide tremendous agricultural benefits and serve the environment by offering an alternative to pesticide use to prevent disease. Tools and information developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community. These resources will assist in the efforts to improve economically important plants like tomato, potato and pepper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available now: pTRV1, pTRV2, pTRV2-GATEWAY, pTRV-NbPDS, pTRV-tomPDS &lt;br/&gt;VIGS system.
