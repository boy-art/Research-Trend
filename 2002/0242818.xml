    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Zwier will conduct experimental research on the conformational preferences and isomerization dynamics of flexible biomolecules (dipeptide, tripeptide, triamide, and depsipeptide) cooled in a gas phase supersonic expansion. These molecules are sufficiently large to have significant conformational complexity to bridge the gap between small molecules and the complexity of large ones such as proteins. An ultraviolet chromophore will be incorporated in the molecules, thereby enabling sensitive detection via laser induced fluorescence or resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy. The dynamics of conformational isomerization will be studied with IR-UV hole filling spectroscopy and IR-induced population transfer spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work will be applicable to problem of protein folding and may provide information about the laser control of molecular shape, with possible applications to a variety of areas including information storage. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this research. They will thereby acquire valuable experience in preparation for advanced studies or for entry into the scientific/technological workforce.</AbstractNarration>
