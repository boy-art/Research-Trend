    <AbstractNarration>Electrical generation system operators are essential to the reliable and safe distribution of electric power. Recent federal regulations, certification requirements, and projected need for a trained workforce have created an urgent need for this program. Bismarck State College (BSC), expanding upon existing energy programs and distance education expertise, joins industry and technology partners, in the development and delivery of an anytime, anywhere accredited Associate Degree in Electrical Transmission Systems Technology. This project encompasses several national funding priorities including: response to a national workforce education need; collaboration and effectiveness of multiple partners; balance between cost efficiencies and flexibility; development of high quality, interactive courses, and; accountability of student learning and program success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An industry advisory committee works with the project team to develop curriculum for a competency-based program with measurable performance outcomes. This team is designing and developing 18 technical courses for flexible, online delivery to a targeted workforce audience in a 7-state region that is challenged by time and place constraints. Through internal and external assessment, BSC continually evaluates this model in terms of student learning, retention, performance, success and overall program effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major outcomes and innovations of this project are:&lt;br/&gt;1) To design a comprehensive, accredited associate degree program for electrical transmission system operators.&lt;br/&gt;2) To demonstrate and record the outcomes of leveraging partnership resources.&lt;br/&gt;3) To deliver the system operator program to a targeted region and workforce audience.&lt;br/&gt;4) To demonstrate student success in an interactive learning environment, that ensures program effectiveness through continuous modification and improvement.&lt;br/&gt;5) To disseminate student learning and program results, and market for distribution in other locales.</AbstractNarration>
