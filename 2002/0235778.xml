    <AbstractNarration>The Role of Ornamentation Versus Genetic&lt;br/&gt;Compatibility in Passerine Bird Mate Choice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Dr. Geoffrey E. Hill and Dr. Herman Mays&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do female animals choose mates? It has long been known that female animals the use expression of ornamental traits, such as bright coloration, as the basis for choosing mates. Indeed there is growing evidence that such ornamental traits evolved as indicators of mate quality. A new theory in behavioral biology suggests that animals may also choose mates based on genetic compatibility. Recent studies indicate that genetic diversity is linked to important aspects of individual fitness, such as the ability to fight disease. There may, therefore, be an advantage for females to choose males within a population whose genetic makeup is most dissimilar to hers, thereby producing offspring that are genetically diverse and healthy. Whether females use the expression of ornamental traits, genetic complimentarity, or both in their choice of mates is the focus of this study of Eastern Bluebirds, a species with bright blue plumage coloration that is used by females in mate choice. New genetic techniques will be used to determine the genetic compatibility of pairs of bluebirds. The health of offspring from pairs that are more or less similar in genetic makeup will then be measured. Mate choice experiments will also be conducted in which females are allowed to choose between potential mates who are either genetically similar or brightly colored. Throughout this project high school, undergrad, and grad students will be involved in research.</AbstractNarration>
