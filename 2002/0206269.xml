    <AbstractNarration>AST-0206269&lt;br/&gt;Showman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations from the Pioneer, Voyager, and Galileo spacecraft as well as ground-based&lt;br/&gt;measurements beginning in the 1800's indicate that the four giant planets in our solar&lt;br/&gt;system, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, have strong east-west jets in their&lt;br/&gt;atmospheres. The jets take different forms on each planet; Jupiter and Saturn have about&lt;br/&gt;twenty jets each (ten eastward and ten westward), whereas Uranus and Neptune have only&lt;br/&gt;about three jets each. The jets are correlated with spatial variations in the temperature&lt;br/&gt;and cloud abundance, suggesting that the full problem is a coupled one involving all the&lt;br/&gt;dynamical variables. The question of what causes these jets is one of the most important&lt;br/&gt;unsolved problems in planetary atmospheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Adam Showman of the University of Arizona will investigate the dynamics and formation processes of the giant-planet jets using a fully nonlinear numerical model of atmospheric motion. Two distinct, yet related, numerical investigations will be conducted. Both are aimed at&lt;br/&gt;elucidating the role of small-scale convection in pumping the jets. The first problem&lt;br/&gt;uses a realistic parameterization of the convection and will focus predominantly on&lt;br/&gt;elucidating the dynamics near the cloud level. The second problem adopts a simpler&lt;br/&gt;representation of the convective forcing and investigates whether extremely deep jets can&lt;br/&gt;be driven from the upper regions where the moist convection is expected to occur. These&lt;br/&gt;studies are the first fully-nonlinear numerical simulations of Jupiter's cloud layer that&lt;br/&gt;address the problem of Jovian jet formation using a model with many vertical grid points.&lt;br/&gt;As a result, they will be groundbreaking in their ability to address the vertical&lt;br/&gt;structure that results from plausible jet-formation processes. The research will use&lt;br/&gt;established numerical codes that Dr. Showman is experienced in using.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
