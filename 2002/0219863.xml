    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates two problems associated with the monitoring of human activities: The first problem is tracking of articulated motion as a whole without identifying individual limb motion. The goal is to address certain shortcomings in previous solutions to this problem, the main shortcoming being their over-constrained nature. The proposed solution, which is presented as a real-time human tracking&lt;br/&gt;system, will be capable of working under many difficult circumstances. The second problem is recognition of&lt;br/&gt;articulated motion. The goal here is to show that the recovery of three-dimensional properties of the object or even two-dimensional tracking of the object parts are not necessary steps that must precede action recognition. The proposed approach uses motion features only. Unlike other similar approaches, the motion&lt;br/&gt;features will be used in such a way to represent complex and long actions as well as to distinguish different actions with many similarities. Each action is represented as a manifold in the lower dimension space and matching is done by comparing these manifolds. As part of a homeland security scenario, its is planned to use these methods to monitor outdoor human activities based on the ability to recognize, for example, that a human runs in the opposite direction that a crowd moves.</AbstractNarration>
