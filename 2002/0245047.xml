    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0245047&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Yoav Rieck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the center of the proposed conference will be a series of lecture&lt;br/&gt;by Professor Andrew Casson of Yale University. These lecture will&lt;br/&gt;focus on two of the most important open questions in the fields of&lt;br/&gt;topology and group theory. The first question, the Poincare&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture, was posed by Henri Poincare almost 100 years ago. It is&lt;br/&gt;concerned with the basic structure of very simple 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces; while the Andrews-Curtis Conjecture is about algebraic&lt;br/&gt;structures, and is very relevant to the Poincare Conjecture. In&lt;br/&gt;addition to a survey of existing approaches, partial results and open&lt;br/&gt;questions related to these conjectures, these talks will attempt to&lt;br/&gt;describe some intriguing similarities and differences between the two&lt;br/&gt;conjectures. In addition, 10 leading experts from around the world&lt;br/&gt;will deliver talks about their own work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will be the 28th annual Arkansas Spring Lecture&lt;br/&gt;Series. The format of the lecture series is 5 one hour talks by a&lt;br/&gt;world leading mathematician, accompanied by about 10 lectures of&lt;br/&gt;invited experts, and several shorter talks by a variety of people,&lt;br/&gt;including graduate students. This structure is valuable, particularly&lt;br/&gt;for younger researchers, that get an excellent learning opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;This year's Lecture Series is about 3-dimensional topology. The&lt;br/&gt;importance of low dimensional topology has been growing in recent&lt;br/&gt;tears, with numerous applications starting at robotics and control,&lt;br/&gt;and ending with theoretical physics and cosmology. For example, one&lt;br/&gt;intriguing question is what the shape of the Universe is. The&lt;br/&gt;spherical shape of the earth was discovered two millennia ago, and yet&lt;br/&gt;we have no clue as to the shape of the Universe. The work of&lt;br/&gt;Professor Casson as well as other leading mathematician, may help&lt;br/&gt;answer this question by leading astronomers is the right direction,&lt;br/&gt;and helping design the right experiments to answer these questions.&lt;br/&gt;Jeff Weeks, a McArthur Fellow, will discuss such experiments in a&lt;br/&gt;lecture open to the public and using a language accessible to all.&lt;br/&gt;This will give the public an opportunity to understand the work of&lt;br/&gt;world leading mathematicians. Jeff Weeks talk should have great&lt;br/&gt;educational value in motivating younger students to enjoy basic&lt;br/&gt;research.</AbstractNarration>
