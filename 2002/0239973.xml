    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0239973&lt;br/&gt;A. Chatterjee, SUNY College Environmental &amp; Science Forestry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to enhance understanding of the conditions under which physically connected networks are formed in multicomponent mixtures of non-spherical molecules. Nanocomposite systems in which a thermoplastic matrix is reinforced by the addition of rigid rod-like or plate-like filler nanoparticles will be the primary focus of this investigation. The dependence of the percolation threshold upon the stiffness and effective diameters of the matrix polymer, and upon the nature of matrix-filler interaction, will be studied using methods of integral equation theory which have proved successful in previous work involving polymer solutions and blends. This investigation will lead to a more fundamental understanding of the factors which promote network formation at low filler volume fractions, a desirable objective for the rational design of lightweight, high-strength, composite materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being co-funded by the divisions of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry (TCC) and Chemical and Transport Systems (CTS).</AbstractNarration>
