    <AbstractNarration>The introduction of exotic pathogens and pests to forest ecosystems represents a&lt;br/&gt;powerful agent of ecological change that may selectively remove dominant tree species and&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously stimulate widespread human disturbance in the form of pre-emptive and salvage&lt;br/&gt;logging. Due to the increasing global movement of organisms and materials, the selective&lt;br/&gt;decline and elimination of tree species is an increasingly important ecosystem disturbance that&lt;br/&gt;warrants intensive study at stand to regional scales.&lt;br/&gt;The recent unimpeded infestation of the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) across the&lt;br/&gt;northeastern U.S. provides an unusual opportunity and critical imperative to examine the&lt;br/&gt;ecological consequences of the removal of a keystone tree species, eastern hemlock, on forest&lt;br/&gt;composition, structure, and function. HWA is generating widespread mortality and initiating&lt;br/&gt;intensive logging of hemlock from North Carolina to Massachusetts and threatens to produce a&lt;br/&gt;range-wide decline or elimination of this ecologically, culturally, and economically important&lt;br/&gt;species. Specifically, mortality of hemlock stands with sparse understories may lead to&lt;br/&gt;a lengthy period of forest ecosystem reorganization resulting in new, distinct forest types and&lt;br/&gt;major changes in ecosystem function including disruption of decomposition, nitrogen cycling and&lt;br/&gt;nitrate leaching.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts from this study include: 1) incorporation of new ecological findings into&lt;br/&gt;scientific publications, presentations, and public outreach; 2) informing the public and land&lt;br/&gt;managers by distributing findings to the HWA working group and other web-based products; 3)&lt;br/&gt;integration of data into existing collaborative efforts with regional experts and professionals; and&lt;br/&gt;4) strong educational training in research design, field techniques, and data and laboratory&lt;br/&gt;analyses for students in the graduate and Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU)&lt;br/&gt;programs at the Harvard Forest.</AbstractNarration>
