    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is aimed at producing novel images of a scene from arbitrary new &lt;br/&gt;viewpoints using a sparse set of compressed panoramic snapshots or sample &lt;br/&gt;images of the scene. The samples are taken from a relatively small number of &lt;br/&gt;strategically placed cameras. A major application and evaluation testbed of &lt;br/&gt;the proposed work is to enable walkthroughs of a 3D scene by generating the &lt;br/&gt;images of the scene along a trajectory dynamically chosen by a remote user. &lt;br/&gt;The focus of the proposed work is on the acquisition of panoramic stereo &lt;br/&gt;images which serve as scene samples, and their interpolation (or &lt;br/&gt;extrapolation) for producing a new stereo pair of images of the scene from an &lt;br/&gt;arbitrary new viewpoint. The user follows a dynamically chosen arbitrary &lt;br/&gt;trajectory and wishes to continuously teleview the scene from along the &lt;br/&gt;trajectory points. It is assumed that relative locations of the objects in the &lt;br/&gt;scene for which walkthroughs are to be generated are known; the object &lt;br/&gt;locations are sparse; and that the strategic placement of the cameras does not &lt;br/&gt;change significantly to warrant camera replacement. Development and &lt;br/&gt;implementation of a stereo panoramic camera is proposed. Limited work is &lt;br/&gt;proposed on joint image compression. The topology of the camera network also &lt;br/&gt;allows the determination of which cameras are to be used to generate the &lt;br/&gt;walkthrough image at any given point along the user drawn trajectory. &lt;br/&gt;Applications of the proposed work include video surveillance, virtual museums &lt;br/&gt;and video conferencing.</AbstractNarration>
