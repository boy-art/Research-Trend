    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0203735.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed lies at the interface of dynamical systems and differential &lt;br/&gt;geometry. Its principal goal is the investigation of the dynamical and geometric &lt;br/&gt;structures of "higher rank" systems. Such systems naturally appear both in dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems and geometry. In particular, the principal investigator will study &lt;br/&gt;rigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian and semisimple Lie groups &lt;br/&gt;and their lattices with the ultimate goal of classifying such systems under &lt;br/&gt;suitable geometric or dynamical hypotheses. In particular, he will study higher&lt;br/&gt;rank hyperbolic abelian actions, and actions by semisimple groups and their &lt;br/&gt;lattices preserving affine and geometric structures. He will also investigate &lt;br/&gt;invariant measures of algebraic higher rank abelian actions. The investigator &lt;br/&gt;will also investigate Riemannian manifolds (especially higher rank ones)&lt;br/&gt;and their geodesic flows. Geometric, dynamical and group theoretic &lt;br/&gt;tools will be used in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively new fields that investigate &lt;br/&gt;the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in &lt;br/&gt;a fluid flow). New ideas and concepts from dynamics (e.g. chaos, fractals) have &lt;br/&gt;changed our perception of the world fundamentally. Dynamics and ergodic theory &lt;br/&gt;provide the mathematical tools and analysis for these investigations. Dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems have had a major impact on the sciences and engineering. Symbolic &lt;br/&gt;dynamics for instance has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe &lt;br/&gt;codes for computer science. Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as &lt;br/&gt;far afield as cell biology and meteorology. Geometry is one of the oldest fields &lt;br/&gt;in mathematics, and generally studies curves, surfaces and their higher &lt;br/&gt;dimensional analogues, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such &lt;br/&gt;spaces. Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now studied &lt;br/&gt;for its close ties with physics and other sciences and applied areas (computer &lt;br/&gt;vision e.g.)as well as internal aesthetic reasons. Geometry and dynamics are &lt;br/&gt;closely related as some important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and &lt;br/&gt;geometry also provides tools to study dynamical systems. One main goal of this &lt;br/&gt;project studies when two dynamical systems commute, i.e. when one system is &lt;br/&gt;unaffected by the changes brought on by the other. Important examples of such &lt;br/&gt;systems arise from geometry.</AbstractNarration>
