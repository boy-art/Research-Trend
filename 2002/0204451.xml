    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Development and testing of genetic algorithms for inferring maximum-likelihood based phylogenies from very large, heterogeneous molecular data sets." Likelihood-based phylogenetic algorithms become very computationally expensive as data sets become larger. However, genetic algorithms offer an efficient alternative to existing methods. This project uses a large molecular data set to test the efficiency and accuracy of a recently developed genetic algorithm under various models of evolution and search conditions. The data are being used to construct a phylogeny of frogs.</AbstractNarration>
