    <AbstractNarration>The existence of volumetric imagery is a natural consequence of distributed imaging and is a significant potential benefit of the sensor-network paradigm. Volumetric image data is important for many commercial, scientific, and military applications. Security-related imaging applications in both the military and commercial sectors are now receiving heightened attention, and volumetric imagery is expected to play an ever-increasing role within these important application domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with novel methods for compressing volumetric imagery. We will focus primarily on volumetric data that has been generated by range sensors (e.g., ladar) and arrays of range sensors; however, many of the approaches will be extensible to more traditional imaging sensors and sensor arrays. The goal of the proposed work will be the efficient compression of volumetric image data: an issue that is expected to be especially critical for wireless and/or mobile sensor applications, in which power constraints become severe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will assume a distributed sensing environment and will focus on balancing inter-sensor against downlink communication costs. When inter-sensor communication is not allowed each sensor must rely on its own measurements along with prior knowledge of the sensor constellation to predict which aspects of its measurements are unique and thus warrant transmission. We will pursue techniques for both prediction and compression of this unique sensor data. When limited inter-sensor communication is allowed, it is important to identify maximally informative data to exchange so as to optimize both inter-sensor and downlink efficiency.</AbstractNarration>
