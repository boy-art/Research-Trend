Bohnert (Co-Principal Investigator current)&lt;br/&gt;Robert E. Sharp (Co-Principal Investigator current)&lt;br/&gt;Gordon K. Springer (Co-Principal Investigator current)&lt;br/&gt;Daniel P. Schachtman (Co-Principal Investigator current) Georgia Davis (Co-Principal Investigator current) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The roots of plants play vital roles in water and mineral acquisition which are essential for plant growth and development. Under conditions of drought, roots can adapt to continue growth while at the same time producing and sending "early warning" signals to shoots which inhibit the plant growth above ground. A "Plant Root Genomics Consortium" has been formed and is dedicated to root genetics and physiology.&lt;br/&gt;The broad aim is to develop an understanding of the molecular mechanisms used by plant roots to acquire water and minerals from the soil, to elucidate the role roots play in adaptation to drought conditions, and to transfer this knowledge to crop improvement through biotechnology. This project focuses mechanisms of root growth maintenance and root to shoot signaling under water deficits. The research approach is interdisciplinary encompassing whole plant physiology, genetics, genomics, and proteomics.&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims are to identify the genes and biochemical networks: controlling the mechanisms of root growth and root to shoot communication under drought through four specific objectives:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Characterization of the transcript profiles in elongating and non-elongating regions of roots under water deficit in sensitive and tolerant maize lines, an abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient mutant and near-isogenic lines differing in ABA accumulation. (2) Characterization of the changes in protein profiles, especially cell wall proteins, in the different root regions to identify factors associated with root growth maintenance and tolerance to water deficit. (3) Investigation of the production and transport of root signals to provide a better understanding of root to shoot signaling under drought. (4) Development of genetic and genomic resources for further investigations of root growth and signaling in the field.&lt;br/&gt;This knowledge will lead to novel approaches for improving drought tolerance in maize through genetic and metabolic engineering of root functions. All materials will be made publicly available. A Plant Root Genomics Web site will be maintained and integrated with the maize genome database (MaizeDB) at the University of Missouri-Columbia.</AbstractNarration>
