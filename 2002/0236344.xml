    <AbstractNarration>Sulfolobus shibatae Virus (SSV) is a Crenarchaeal virus that exists in extreme thermal (greater than 80oC) and acidic (pH &lt; 3.0) environments such as the ones found in Yellowstone National Park. While SSV1 is the best characterized of any Crenarchaeal virus, the current understanding of these extremely unique viruses is very limited. Genomic sequence analysis of SSVs and most other viruses from extreme thermal environments fails to find homologues in the publicly available data bases for the vast majority of the putative open reading frames (ORFs). Thus, most of the SSV1 viral proteome, 30 of 34 ORFs, have yet to be assigned any function, and the roles that these proteins play in the viral life cycle remains a mystery. Using X-ray crystallography, this project seeks to identify structural homologues for member of the SSV1 proteome, thus providing insight into their possible function. The structural studies are being supplemented by the production of polyclonal antisera for each of these proteins, with subsequent analysis of their expression patterns and function with respect to the viral life cycle. Together, these data will begin to provide an understanding of the SSV1 life cycle at the molecular level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Viruses of extreme thermophiles can serve as model systems for understanding the biochemistry and molecular biology required for life at high temperatures, thus this research will help to open a window onto some of the most fundamental processes of the still poorly understood Crenarchaeota. The structural biology investigated in this project will be incorporated in the undergraduate educational activities. Additionally, this project will provide outstanding training opportunities to students at different levels, including summer research experience for Native American students from Montana.</AbstractNarration>
