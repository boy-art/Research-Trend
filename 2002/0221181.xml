    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-01221181&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presence of thousands of halogen and especially chlorine containing secondary metabolites in marine organisms has long been documented by marine natural products chemists. However, the presence in marine biota of many halogenated organic compounds very close in structure to specific man-made chemicals leaves their ultimate source in question. A multi-isotopic abundance measurement approach is suggested as a means of differentiating anthropogenic halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) from those arising naturally in the marine environment. This investigation seeks to measure the compound specific isotopic 14C abundance of several HOCs whose anthropogenic vs natural origin is uncertain, using the expected isotopic depletion of any fossil fuel derived carbon implied for anthropogenically sourced compounds. Further source discrimination may be afforded by consideration of the stable chlorine isotopic ratios of HOCs. Stable isotopic chlorine (d 37Cl) ratios, as yet only preliminarily studied for this purpose, may be expected to exhibit larger, or simply different, chlorine isotope effects during enzymically controlled biochlorinations compared to those observed during industrial synthesis. A dual isotope approach may be additionally useful in unraveling both the complex sources, widespread distribution and chemical transformations that these molecules may undergo in the natural environment. &lt;br/&gt;Proposed activities to be undertaken include graduate student training, employing unique analytical capabilities and infrastructure and enabling continuance of international collaborations on a problem of high scientific interest. The recalcitrance or reactivity of HOCs in the marine environment has important implications for societal concern and policy as to the environmental persistence, bioaccumulative properties and toxic effects of HOCs in the environment, in marine life, and in humans.</AbstractNarration>
