    <AbstractNarration>The Educational Broadcasting Corporation (WNET, New York) is producing 14 half-hour episodes of "Cyberchase," with accompanying outreach, to extend the new animated television series into a second season. " Cyberchase," which began airing on PBS in January, 2002, engages children ages eight to eleven years old in the fun and challenge of mathematics. Its goal is to demonstrate the usefulness of mathematics and empower children to become mathematical problem-solvers by fostering a positive attitude toward mathematics, reinforcing basic mathematics concepts, modeling reasoning skills and motivating children to approach mathematics with confidence. The funds will also support the design and implementation of an outreach program, including materials for parents; a workshop activity kit for schools, libraries and museums; and ten pilot after-school programs. Specifically, outreach components include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A web component that provides mathematical activities and content for the target audience and their parents;&lt;br/&gt;A 12-page Cyberchase Magazine (50,000 copies);&lt;br/&gt;A 20-page Teacher's Guide (15,000 copies);&lt;br/&gt;Collector Cards (50,000 sets of six cards each); and a&lt;br/&gt;Poster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peer review, extensive evaluation and a national advisory board will inform all components.</AbstractNarration>
