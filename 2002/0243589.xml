    <AbstractNarration>The University of Minnesota continues operating a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with the U. of Minnesota Materials Research Science and Engineering Center. Ten undergraduate students are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience. Emphasis is placed on recruitment from four-year colleges, tribal colleges in the upper Midwest, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions. Undergraduate students are involved in materials research projects that include microstructured polymers, crystalline organic semiconductors, and magnetic materials. In addition, REU participants attend professional development workshops, research seminars and on-campus social events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site also includes a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) component. Seven high school teachers are recruited every year for a five-week summer research experience, with an option for accompanying high school students for returning teachers.</AbstractNarration>
