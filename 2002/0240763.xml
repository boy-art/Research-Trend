    <AbstractNarration>The project will support the development and implementation of a workshop/symposium, held by the College of Engineering of Tuskegee University, in partnership with a number of engineering departments and engineering colleges, professional organizations, and individual experts. The event will facilitate the gathering of information to establish the methods used by the HBCU engineering schools to achieve success in degree production among underrepresented minorities, especially African-American students. The symposium will also address the development of a vision for strengthening HBCU engineering institutions, determining what strategies might assist the further development of students, and improving corporate partnerships, governmental service, and collaboration with majority institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By identifying successful practices and disseminating these findings by way of the proposed collaborative website and other participant-based communications through participating institutions, the PI anticipates that engineering departments/colleges will be motivated to consider ways to improve their academic programs through use of the best practices established in the symposium (and documented by participants).</AbstractNarration>
