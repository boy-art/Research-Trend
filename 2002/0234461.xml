    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded within the NSF-wide CAREER program by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Kaiser will investigate the collision-energy dependent reaction dynamics of bimolecular atom-radical reactions of ground state atomic carbon and silicon with propargyl and allyl radicals, and the radical-radical reactions propargyl-propargyl, propargyl-allyl, and allyl-allyl. The principal objective of this research is to unravel the reaction mechanisms that underlie these processes. The experiments will be performed using crossed supersonic beam technology. Both reactant beams will be prepared in well-defined quantum states before they cross with a specific collision energy under single collision conditions. The research will be conducted with a number of international collaborators spanning a variety of expertise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will actively participate in the development of a cross-disciplinary curriculum in reaction dynamics, linking his Department of Chemistry with the Department of Physics and Astronomy, the university's Institute for Astronomy and the Hawai'ian Institute of Geophysics and Planetology. Through these interactions the PI will relate chemical dynamics to astrochemistry, planetary sciences, laboratory astrophysics, astrobiology, and combustion chemistry. The PI's research project will involve the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the further scientific development of postdoctoral researchers. Undergraduate students involved in research, training and mentoring and will primarily be drawn from the underrepresented minority students at the University of Hawai'i. The PI will further engage in an outreach program to science teachers and students at local schools involving visits, presentation of popular scientific lectures, and visits by high school students and teachers to the research laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
