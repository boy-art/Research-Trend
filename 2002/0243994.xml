    <AbstractNarration>0243994 Abolmaali&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) for six students per year during eight weeks in the summer to conduct hands-on laboratory and field research in structural, geotechnical, and construction engineering. Each student will work with one of four small research teams focusing on (1) The Seismic Performance of Partially Restrained Connections, (2) Repair Performance Evaluation of Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composites, (3) Novel Measurements in a Geotechnical Engineering Laboratory, and (4) Residential Foundation Repair Methodology. The REU experience is designed such that the students experience the research process through developing improved materials and testing procedures; manufacturing and testing structural components and systems; collecting and analyzing field data; collecting and analyzing data using state-of-the-art laboratory measurement techniques; and writing and presenting papers. Each research team will include faculty members from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UTA and industry-based professional advisory members of the Construction Research Center at UTA. Both formative and summative assessment and evaluation of the REU Site will be performed. Outreach to local K-12 schools by the principal investigator to inform local students and teachers about REU Site activities, along with involvement of local K-12 math and science teachers in biweekly REU site meetings will be done to encourage students to consider enrolling in civil and environmental programs after high school and to promote professional development of K-12 math and science teachers.</AbstractNarration>
