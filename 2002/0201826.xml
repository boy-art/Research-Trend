    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0201826&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Eric Sommers [esommers@math.umass.edu]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will study several questions in representation&lt;br/&gt;theory which are related to nilpotent orbits in Lie algebras. More&lt;br/&gt;specifically, the investigator will study a new duality map that he&lt;br/&gt;defined (and that has recently been extended by Achar). He will continue&lt;br/&gt;to study the Lusztig bijection. He will try to complete the determination&lt;br/&gt;of which nilpotent orbits in the exceptional Lie algebras have normal&lt;br/&gt;closure and prove results (in all Lie algebras) about the structure of&lt;br/&gt;functions on covers of nilpotent orbits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representation theory is a branch of modern algebra that is concerned with&lt;br/&gt;understanding symmetries. A central idea is that complicated algebraic or&lt;br/&gt;geometric structures can be represented by a certain set of matrices&lt;br/&gt;(arrays of numbers), which are easier to understand than the original&lt;br/&gt;structure. For example, the symmetries of the square can be represented&lt;br/&gt;(in one possible way) by a certain set of eight two-by-two matrices. &lt;br/&gt;This view of representation theory has many applications in chemistry and&lt;br/&gt;physics. The investigator's work will contribute to understanding the&lt;br/&gt;representation theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups.</AbstractNarration>
