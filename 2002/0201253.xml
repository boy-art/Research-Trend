    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0201253&lt;br/&gt;Shang-Ching Cou&lt;br/&gt;Wichita State U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automated geometry reasoning has been a very successful area in the past twenty years. Highly&lt;br/&gt;successful methods for automated geometry theorem proving and discovering have been introduced&lt;br/&gt;since the late 70s. With these methods, one can not only prove most of the geometry theorems&lt;br/&gt;within seconds, but also discover many new theorems. One may also prove and discover theorems&lt;br/&gt;in differential geometries and mechanics. In the early 90s, methods were developed to generate&lt;br/&gt;human-readable proofs, multiple proofs, and the shortest proofs in geometry.&lt;br/&gt;Methods for automated geometry diagram generation (AGDG) have been developed recently.&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of AGDG is to draw a declaratively described diagram automatically. Compared to&lt;br/&gt;automated theorem proving, AGDG has a wider range of applications, including intelligent CAD,&lt;br/&gt;robotics, linkage design, computer vision, nanotechnology and chemical molecular modeling,&lt;br/&gt;interactive constraint-based graphic systems, numerically controlled machines, and computer aided&lt;br/&gt;instruction.</AbstractNarration>
