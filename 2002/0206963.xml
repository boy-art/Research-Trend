    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0206963&lt;br/&gt;Clarence W. Wilkerson&lt;br/&gt;James E. McClure&lt;br/&gt;Jeffrey H. Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilkerson (in joint work with W. G. Dwyer of Notre Dame) &lt;br/&gt;studies the classifying spaces of Lie groups and p-compact &lt;br/&gt;groups with the goal of finishing the classification of &lt;br/&gt;2-compact groups and their automorphisms. Wilkerson and &lt;br/&gt;Smith study actions of finite groups on arbitrary finite &lt;br/&gt;complexes. The goal is to construct a moduli space&lt;br/&gt;that classifies actions with given fixed point data.&lt;br/&gt;McClure and Smith will continue their work on chain &lt;br/&gt;operads and chain models for homotopy theories. Specifically, &lt;br/&gt;they propose to find a small chain model for the framed &lt;br/&gt;little-disks operad, to show that the category of "unstable" &lt;br/&gt;coalgebras over a certain chain operad is a model for HZ-local &lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory of spaces, to give a similar model for &lt;br/&gt;HZ-local spectra, and to create a chain model for the model &lt;br/&gt;category of K(n)-module spectra. They also propose to &lt;br/&gt;investigate the properties of a symmetric monoidal&lt;br/&gt;structure on the category of cosimplicial chain complexes.&lt;br/&gt;McClure uses the joint work with Smith to study the homotopy&lt;br/&gt;theoretic properties of the Snaith splitting. He hopes &lt;br/&gt;to find a simplified proof of the theorem of Goerss-Hopkins &lt;br/&gt;theorem which gives the spectrum E(n) a commutative &lt;br/&gt;multiplication. He also studies the rational homotopy &lt;br/&gt;theory of equivariant spectra when the group is the circle.&lt;br/&gt;Smith and Grodal are studying homotopy G-spheres. That is, &lt;br/&gt;spaces that are homotopy equivalent to a sphere and have &lt;br/&gt;an action of a finite group G. They hope to give a complete classification based on algebraic invariants of the group. &lt;br/&gt;They also study the moduli space of homotopy G-spheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory is the most fundamental of all geometries. &lt;br/&gt;It studies those geometric properties which do not change &lt;br/&gt;no matter what continuous deformations are made. The "equality"&lt;br/&gt;of donuts and coffee cups is a well known example. Yet, &lt;br/&gt;surprisingly, geometry as studied by homotopy theory has &lt;br/&gt;an intrinsic algebraic nature. The PIs study the &lt;br/&gt;geometric properties of spaces using techniques &lt;br/&gt;that come from algebra, with homotopy theory providing &lt;br/&gt;the bridge between these different areas of mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;In fact, all homotopy information of a space can be &lt;br/&gt;described using algebra. The algebra is complicated &lt;br/&gt;but homotopy theory gives a correspondence &lt;br/&gt;between geometry and algebra that has many important &lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>
