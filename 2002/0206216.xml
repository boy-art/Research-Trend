    <AbstractNarration>AST 0206216&lt;br/&gt;Kravtsov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the greatest challenges of modern astrophysics is understanding how galaxies such as our own Milky Way form within the framework of the Big Bang cosmology. The current theory of structure formation (called the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) scenario) predicts that massive galaxies were built from smaller galaxies that collided and merged, inducing bursts of star formation and resulting in the different types of galaxies observed today. This entire sequence of events is thought to be seeded by quantum fluctuations in the very early Universe and governed by mysterious "dark matter" which constitutes about 85% of all matter in the universe. While the CDM theory is successful in explaining many observations, it faces an increasing number of problems which may lead us to revise or even abandon this paradigm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the fundamental, unanswered questions is whether realistic galaxies with properties similar to those of observed galaxies can be formed in the CDM model. This project will specifically focus on stellar feedback and heavy element enrichment and their role in the evolution of galaxies. Dr. Kravtsov and his collaborators will address this question by using very high-resolution, state-of-the-art computer simulations which include all the main processes thought to be important in galaxy. In particular, the simulations will account for the release of enormous amounts of energy and heavy elements into the surrounding gas by the explosions of young, massive stars. This energy release, or "feedback", is thought to play a critical role in controlling the rate at which interstellar gas is turned into stars and in shaping the overall properties of galaxies. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
