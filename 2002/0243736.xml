    <AbstractNarration>Institution: Montana State University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EIA - 0243736&lt;br/&gt;PI: Denbigh Starkey&lt;br/&gt;Title: A Computer Science REU for Tribal College Students&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports an REU Site that provides a summer research experience for students from Montana's tribal colleges, with the intention of encouraging participants to continue their education at a university after completion of their two- or four-year current degrees. The REU program supports eight students per year; six in the summer program, and two year-round. The students work on the graphics and visualization components of a five-state precision agriculture project, interacting not only with the PI of this REU proposal (who is graphics and visualization team leader for the precision agriculture project) but also with researchers and producers associated with the project. The participants are immersed in 3D graphics and programming, usually for the first time.</AbstractNarration>
