    <AbstractNarration>Rationally connected varieties form a class of varieties that &lt;br/&gt;coincides with rational and unirational varieties for curves &lt;br/&gt;and surfaces, but represents a very different (and better &lt;br/&gt;behaved) class in higher dimensions. The investigator studies &lt;br/&gt;aspects of rational connectivity; in particular, the relation &lt;br/&gt;between rational connectivity and unirationality and the &lt;br/&gt;implications of rational connectivity for existence of points &lt;br/&gt;on varieties over non-algebraically closed fields. In relation &lt;br/&gt;to the latter, the investigator studies the geometry of &lt;br/&gt;parameter spaces for rational curves on a rationally connected &lt;br/&gt;variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of algebraic geometry is to learn more about &lt;br/&gt;the solutions of polynomial equations by studying geometric &lt;br/&gt;objects, called varieties, associated to them. For example, &lt;br/&gt;if an ellipse is given to us by a polynomial in two variables, &lt;br/&gt;we might ask how the shape of an ellipse affects the solutions &lt;br/&gt;of the polynomial. Recently, algebraic geometers have introduced &lt;br/&gt;a new property of varieties, called rational connectivity, and &lt;br/&gt;results to far indicate a strong connection between the algebra &lt;br/&gt;of a system of polynomial equations and the rational connectivity &lt;br/&gt;of the variety they define. The investigator studies this &lt;br/&gt;connection further.</AbstractNarration>
