    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0243921 Date: 1-17-2003&lt;br/&gt;Institution: State University of West Georgia PI: Ray &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Chemistry at the State University of West Georgia will be the site for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program during the summers of 2003-2005. Gigi B. Ray is the site director and Victoria Geisler is co-PI. The site will host 9 students (8 NSF supported) for ten weeks. The West Georgia REU program is designed to give two-year college students from across the Southeast a research experience. Approximately two-thirds of the participants are targeted from two-year colleges. The students will have the opportunity to participate in research in analytical, biological, computational, inorganic, and physical chemistry. Nine research projects in these areas, some involving collaborative efforts between the faculty members, are proposed for investigation. The intellectual focus will be a hands-on research experience supplemented with weekly seminars, workshops, field trips to regional research centers, and student presentations of their work.</AbstractNarration>
