    <AbstractNarration>EIA 02-42822&lt;br/&gt;Wolff, Lawrence B.&lt;br/&gt;Johns Hopkins University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE RI: A Networked Computing Environment for the Manipulation and Visualization of Geometric Data &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, enabling the RI/MII PI Workshop, strengthens the national computing infrastructure by supporting exchanges on infrastructure development needs of research. The meeting serves to judge the effectiveness of the awarded infrastructure and awarded research carried upon such infrastructure, as well as their impact on research and education. Facilitating face-to-face contacts and exchanges of ideas, the conference serves as a tool for the principal investigators to judge their own work and that of others awarded. In addition to research exchange, often the PIs gain insights as to where to recommend students to pursue graduate studies and even what universities to apply that best might service their new PhD degree, and alternately, where their research might have the most influence.</AbstractNarration>
