    <AbstractNarration>This project is a laboratory study of a diverse set of atmospheric reactions potentially important to odd hydrogen (HOx) and organic analog (ROx) cycling in the troposphere and stratosphere. Initially, laboratory experiments will involve direct detection of short-lived intermediates and weakly bound complexes by isolating and identifying spectroscopic signatures. Reaction kinetics of these various reactive intermediates will then be studied using a variety of sensitive spectroscopic techniques and reactant flow systems designed to cover broad ranges of temperature and pressure representative of the ambient atmosphere (troposphere and stratosphere). Laboratory results will be combined with theoretical calculations involving quantum mechanical and statistical-dynamical computations. The broader impacts of this work include results that will be important in gaining a better understanding of the oxidative pathways controlling the oxidizing capacity of the Earth's atmosphere, and thereby improve greatly our understanding of some important reactions driving tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry. This project will also provide laboratory research training for three graduate students and one postdoctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>
