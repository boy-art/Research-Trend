    <AbstractNarration>Through collaboration between UCSD's Jacobs School of Engineering, Mathematics Department, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and Division of Student Affairs, this institution will refine and continue its CSEMS Program in order to provide scholarships for freshmen and upper-division, low-income undergraduates majoring in computer science, engineering, or mathematics. Ten qualifying freshmen will receive $3,030 annually over four years beginning in fall, 2003 while 40 upper-division students will receive $3,030 annually for two years, 20 effective in fall, 2003 and 20 in fall, 2005. Recruiting will be initiated through personalized letters sent from PIs to students identified as potentially eligible. To encourage applications from low-income women, underrepresented students and those with disabilities, notices will be posted in specialized campus locations such as the Women's and Cross-cultural Centers. Applications will undergo review by a committee including PIs and the CSEMS Coordinator. Due to under representation of ethnic minorities, women and persons with disabilities in CSEMS fields, priority will be given to students from these groups. Alternate Scholars will be identified to insure a consistent participant level of 30.</AbstractNarration>
