    <AbstractNarration>These research projects concern the set theory of the real line,&lt;br/&gt;a part of descriptive set theory. The principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies various ideals of sets of real numbers. Cardinal&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of the continuum and the associated families of&lt;br/&gt;small sets are central to this research. Specifically, he&lt;br/&gt;focuses on problems concerning the consistency of various&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of the Borel Conjecture, a statement asserting&lt;br/&gt;that the families of sets in question consist entirely of&lt;br/&gt;countable sets. He also studies the extent of the duality&lt;br/&gt;between the two classical notions of smallness: measure zero and&lt;br/&gt;the first category. This problem concerns finding parallels&lt;br/&gt;between the measure concepts such as strong measure zero and&lt;br/&gt;universal measure zero, and their first category analogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the structure of the real numbers marks the origins&lt;br/&gt;of set theory and has been the object of systematic research&lt;br/&gt;since the beginning of the last century. Concepts of measure and&lt;br/&gt;category have been studied rigorously for about one hundred&lt;br/&gt;years, and have been successfully used in many areas of modern&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Bartoszynski pursues several problems in this area.&lt;br/&gt;These problems may yield positive answers that are theorems of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics or they may turn out to be independent from the&lt;br/&gt;standard axioms of set theory. The positive answers involve new&lt;br/&gt;results in both finite and infinite combinatorics and have&lt;br/&gt;applications reaching beyond traditional set theory to real&lt;br/&gt;analysis, measure theory, and topology. On the other hand, the&lt;br/&gt;independence results, particularly ones using forcing, have&lt;br/&gt;applications within set theory itself.</AbstractNarration>
