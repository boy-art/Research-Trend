    <AbstractNarration>Embedded systems require maximum performance from a processor within&lt;br/&gt;significant constraints in power consumption and chip cost. Using&lt;br/&gt;software pipelining, high-performance digital signal processors can&lt;br/&gt;often exploit considerable instruction-level parallelism (ILP), and&lt;br/&gt;thus significantly improve performance. However, software pipelining&lt;br/&gt;sometimes fails to utilize the processor efficiently and may hinder&lt;br/&gt;the goals of low power consumption and chip cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems with software pipelining can be ameliorated by using&lt;br/&gt;advanced compiler loop transformation techniques. However, current&lt;br/&gt;methods for applying loop transformations are lacking. Metrics for&lt;br/&gt;applying loop transformations do not model high-performance digital&lt;br/&gt;signal processing (DSP) architectures and the effects of software&lt;br/&gt;pipelining effectively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will address the above problems by developing&lt;br/&gt;and experimentally validating the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) A performance metric that accurately models software-pipelined&lt;br/&gt;loop performance on high-performance DSP architectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) A prediction of the register pressure of a software-pipelined&lt;br/&gt;loop before high-level loop transformations are applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of this research, more ILP will be exploited in DSP&lt;br/&gt;applications, resulting in an increase in performance and a savings in&lt;br/&gt;the overall energy required to execute an application. Improvements in&lt;br/&gt;performance and energy usage will allow better and more&lt;br/&gt;computationally expensive algorithms to be used in embedded systems.</AbstractNarration>
