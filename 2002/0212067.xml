    <AbstractNarration>When a body is threatened by foreign pathogens, expression of a variety of immune system genes allows cells to react to this threat and initiate an immune response. Central to inducing this immune response is the activation of the master regulator factor, the class II transactivator (CIITA). CIITA acts in the nucleus of cells to induce the expression of genes necessary for the presentation of foreign peptides on the cell surface. The CIITA protein is know to be present in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of cells, although the significance for this bimodal distribution and the factors that regulate it are unclear. It has been well established that the addition or subtraction of phosphate group moieties to a cellular protein can modify the activity and localization of that particular protein. Preliminary data indicates that CIITA is indeed subject to phosphorylation; however, the effect this phosphorylation has on regulating the function of the CIITA protein is unknown. One hypothesis is that phosphorylation of CIITA specifically present in the nucleus shuts down CIITA-regulated gene expression and subsequently induces the export of CIITA from the nucleus out to the cytoplasm. This may allow the organism to rapidly and precisely control the timing and extent of CIITA activity, and therefore mediate the magnitude of the immune response. This project will examine this hypothesis by: 1) identifying the cellular mechanisms and factors that mediate phosphorylation of CIITA; 2) determining the effect phosphorylation has on CIITA activity; and 3) identifying the protein domains that mediate the export of CIITA from the nucleus. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control CIITA activity will be crucial to devising strategies to manipulate the immune system and alter immune responses.&lt;br/&gt;This project will identify the cellular mechanisms by which the immune system is regulated and signaled to respond to the presence of foreign pathogens. Laboratory experiments will determine how the central control protein, CIITA, is structurally modified and regulated and what effect these modifications have on the function of the protein within cells. This research will provide a basis for generating therapeutic strategies to modify and enhance the therapeutic abilities of the immune system at the molecular and cellular level. Additionally, during the three-year timeframe of this project, undergraduate students will participate in the program as summer or academic year interns, establishing the foundation for further curricular development and strengthening undergraduate scientific training at Sarah Lawrence College.</AbstractNarration>
