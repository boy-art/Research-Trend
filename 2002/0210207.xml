    <AbstractNarration>This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and Engineering" (NSF 01-157). This research project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using carbon nanotubes for nanodimensional optoelectronic devices. Preliminary results have shown that optical activity in the visible spectrum is induced with additions of ruthenium to multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). This project will focus on in-situ doping MWNTs with other optically active materials, in particular rare earth elements, by introducing proper organic precursors during the chemical-vapor-deposition growth. Through this chemical vapor deposition process, rare-earth elements will be introduced into the nanotube architectures, leading to luminescent behavior in the visible spectrum. The advantage of using a nanotube host is that the luminescent particles can be confined to dimensions of a few nanometers. Since the deposition temperatures are low (~600 degrees C) it will also be possible to directly deposit the materials directly onto display glass and other device substrates. The research program will support the involvement of an undergraduate and graduate student, who will have a unique opportunity to pursue research at the cutting edge of nanoscience and nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since nanotubes can be patterned on various device substrates such as silicon and glass, revolutionary advances in nanodimensional optoelectronic devices, such as high-resolution information displays are now possible. The research program will educate both undergraduate and graduate students from the Pennsylvania State University in the emerging, interdisciplinary field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Since these areas are high priority ones in the academic, industrial, and government laboratory sectors, these students will be highly competitive in these and related job markets.</AbstractNarration>
