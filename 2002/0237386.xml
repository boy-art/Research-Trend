    <AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0237386&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ko Honda (USC)&lt;br/&gt;TItle: CONTACT SRUCTURES AND LOW-DIMENSIONAL TOPOLOGY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the topology of 3-dimensional manifolds via contact&lt;br/&gt;structures. Over the last several years, the investigator and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators (Colin, Etnyre, Giroux, Kazez, Matic) have developed a largely&lt;br/&gt;cut-and-paste theory of tight contact structures. Taking this program further,&lt;br/&gt;he plans to conclude the project on finiteness questions for tight contact&lt;br/&gt;structures (with Colin and Giroux), investigate Legendrian and transverse knots&lt;br/&gt;(with Etnyre), and explore connections with foliation/lamination theory (with&lt;br/&gt;Kazez and Matic). More fundamentally, he seeks to understand the nature of&lt;br/&gt;tightness, and relations with hyperbolic geometry and finite type invariants of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a continued study of 3-dimensional spaces. The 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces we study will locally be similar to the standard (Euclidean)&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional space. These objects may be very complicated globally, but a&lt;br/&gt;local observer cannot tell the difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether&lt;br/&gt;it is sitting on a flat plane or a very large sphere. In our work, we seek to&lt;br/&gt;better understand 3-dimensional spaces by employing a new type of probe, called&lt;br/&gt;a contact structure. Although mathematicians have been cognizant of contact&lt;br/&gt;structures for decades, a good understanding of such structures has become&lt;br/&gt;gradually possible only over the last twenty years. Contact structures are&lt;br/&gt;also intimately connected with 4-dimensional geometry (the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;space-time), quantum physics, and dynamics (such as fluid dynamics).</AbstractNarration>
