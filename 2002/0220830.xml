    <AbstractNarration>The Departments of Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics, in collaboration with the Office of Strategic Initiatives and the Center for Academic Success at Louisiana State University, is increasing the educational and career opportunities for academically talented, financially disadvantaged students to reach their fullest potential through a student/faculty partnership with a comprehensive monitoring system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to recruit financially disadvantaged students, to retain these students, and to enhance the educational experience of these students in the technology disciplines. Specific objectives are: (1) Recruit qualified students through an active K-12 educational outreach program, including math and science fairs, competitions, and in-school math and science laboratories, (2) Retain these students through the incorporation of student support and mentoring programs, (3) Enhance the educational experience of these students through workshops/seminars, industrial outreach, and community service opportunities, (4) Increase the number of undergraduates, including women and minorities in the above-mentioned disciplines, and (5) Promote intercultural participation among non-minority and minority students. In addition to the scholarships, the project consists of three activities: (1) mandatory computer and information technology training (average 2 hrs/wk), (2) mandatory academic enhancement activities (average 1 hr/wk), and (3) optional educational and industrial outreach programs (up to 3 hrs/wk). CSEMS Scholars receive additional information technology training through various workshops and training courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Office of Strategic Initiatives and the Center for Academic Success, Co-PIs, and several other faculty members provide active mentoring and academic assistance for the CSEMS Scholars to maximize their chances for academic success. The faculty mentors also assist CSEMS Scholars in pursuing their professional careers though continuing graduate studies or job placement in industries relevant to their education. There are 29 students per year majoring in computer science, engineering, or mathematics disciplines who hold scholarships. Scholarships can be renewed up to graduation. CSEMS Scholars form a community that interacts regularly with each other, with faculty, and with other students on campus.</AbstractNarration>
