    <AbstractNarration>AST-0204771&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Baron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernovae have become exceedingly interesting astrophysical objects in recent years owing to their use as cosmological probes (standard candles visible at great distances) to determine expansion of the universe and to measure the dark energy of the universe, and also due to their possible association with mysterious gamma-ray bursts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main work in this project will focus on the comparison of observed data with theoretical models in order to clarify the connection between specific classes of supernovae and stellar evolution models of the progenitor star. The principle investigator will study effects such as the metallicity dependence of the progenitor on its observed spectrum and light curve, and extend to every type of supernovae consideration of their use as distance indicators. Three central questions that are to be addressed concern the progenitor systems of each type of supernova, the consistency between stellar evolution hydrodynamical models for supernovae and observations of them, the values of the cosmological parameters when they are calculated using the detailed spectral models of the Spectral-fitting Expanding Atmosphere Method applied to high redshift Type II supernovae, and finally, the statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with these values.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
