    <AbstractNarration>AST-0201597&lt;br/&gt;Markoff, Sera&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Markoff is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at MIT's Center for Space Research. She will conduct a theoretical and observational study of astrophysical jets, twin outflows of relativistic plasma formed and expelled near the event horizons of accreting black holes. She will develop models for predicting the contribution of jets to the broadband spectra of stellar X-ray binaries and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, which are orders of magnitude apart in mass, but close in scaled power. Her participation in observational campaigns will provide data for testing these predictions and the underlying similarities between the engines that drive jets of stellar and galactic scale. Her program of research will address fundamental outstanding questions pertaining to jets, such as their formation and matter content. She will incorporate her research into a new educational unit for classrooms participating in Project Astro and for an exhibit for the Boston Museum of Science, Current Science and Technology Center. She also plans to teach associated courses at the Museum and at local teachers' professional development workshops.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
