    <AbstractNarration>Public participation in technology policy decision-making is both controversial and desirable. It is controversial because of questions about the capabilities of citizens to understand and evaluate these complex issues; it is desirable because democratic participation is a measure of civic engagement and may improve decisions and their outcomes. Identification and development of more effective modes of citizen participation will play an important part in enabling citizens to participate effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has several goals: 1) to develop improved vehicles for effective public involvement in technology policy, 2) to create basic knowledge of how citizens' trust in regulators, scientists, and corporations; self-efficacy; and learning are affected by participation in these processes, and 3) to inform development of effective internet-mediated models for national technology policy participation. The research team, composed of faculty in rhetoric of science, group decision-making, and political science, will conduct two mixed-mode and six internet-mediated consensus conferences, based on the Danish model. These conferences will involve 120 citizens; each panel of 15 citizens will be representative of the local population and will deliberate to reach consensus recommendations on a prominent technology issue. The research includes testing an innovative measure of democratic deliberation developed by one of the team. The project will also test political science theory, by investigating relationships between gender, ethnicity, lower socio-economic status and increases in efficacy and trust in regulators, as outcomes of modes of participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has national-level impact, broadens participation of underrepresented groups, and develops new participation approaches using information technology. The project will also involve undergraduates and graduate students in research; results will be distributed broadly, including publicizing the results and citizen recommendations to policy makers and the media.</AbstractNarration>
