    <AbstractNarration>9704344 Phillips The proposal was evaluated by four reviewers, resulting in ratings of Excellent (1) Very Good (2), and Good (1). Review Analysis: The outcome of the review was an overall show of support for the proposed project. The proposal, for example, was characterized by most of the reviewers as focusing on an important topic, conceptually and methodologically sound, involving quite capable investigators, and likely to lead to useful results. Even the one reviewer who was more critical noted that the project would have significant impact because of its educational component. Recommended Action: An outstanding team of researchers has been assembled to carry out this research, which would involve cross-university collaboration and provide important experience for participating students. The team includes an up-and-coming younger investigator and two senior researchers who are at the top of the field. The topic is very important, and the research would be guided by a well-conceived conceptual and methodological plan. A three-year continuing award is recommended. ***</AbstractNarration>
