    <AbstractNarration>The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology supports a broad-based interdisciplinary research program. The research is conducted in five interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). These include Microphotonic Materials and Structures (IRG 1) where new physical phenomena in materials are discovered for which relevant length scales are comparable to a photon wavelength. Such "photonic crystals" can exhibit new phenomena that can be formulated by theory and applied in novel optical devices. IRG 2 on Nanostructured Polymer Assemblies seeks to gain understanding of how polymer nanocomposites organize at the molecular level and how to enhance or control the performance of electronic, magnetic, biosensor and optical devices based on these materials. Electronic Transport in Mesoscopic Semiconductor and Magnetic Structures (IRG 3) explores charge and spin transport in solid-state electronic structures. Both chemically produced as well as lithographically defined nanostructures are investigated. IRG 4 on the Science and Engineering of Solid-State Portable Power Sources focuses on the fundamental science and engineering of materials for solid-state electro-chemical power sources. The ultimate goal of the IRG is to apply this fundamental knowledge to develop ultra-high performance batteries. Quantum Magnetism, Correlated Electrons and Superconductivity in Transition Metal Oxides (IRG 5) investigates the effects of carrier doping, temperature and magnetic fields on materials with strongly correlated electron systems. Such materials exhibit unusual electronic, magnetic and superconducting properties which are currently not understood. Future activities in this IRG are expected to be reduced. The Center has a strong education program directed toward graduate students, undergraduates, middle and high school students and K-12 teachers. Emphasis is placed on including underrepresented minorities in these programs. The education activities enjoy the broad participation of MIT students and faculty and are closely linked to complementary programs in other MIT administrative units, such as the MIT museum and MIT's Council on Primary and Secondary Education. The Center operates shared facilities and has an effective industrial outreach program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the Center currently include 35 senior investigators, 2 postdoctoral associates, 28 graduate students, 33 undergraduates, and 2 technicians and other support personnel. Professor Michael F. Rubner directs the MRSEC.</AbstractNarration>
