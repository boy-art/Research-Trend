    <AbstractNarration>In this GOALI project, Carnegie Mellon proposes to develop a web-based Background Curriculum, allowing computer-aided simulation, design, modeling and prototyping skills to be transparently overlaid onto and distributed through the traditional engineering curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal involves a partnership between Carnegie Mellon University, Parametric Technologies Corporation, Drexel University and Pine-Richland High School. An objective of this project is to grow our experience base and create a readily transferable suite of web-based course modules that others can use to teach and motivate their students. Undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon will collaborate with faculty and develop a series of modules for use in mechanical engineering undergraduate courses. Colleagues with expertise in assessment and cognitive psychology from the CMU Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence will assess the effectiveness of our efforts by using focus groups, survey instruments, and software for tracking web page use patterns. A work product of this project will be a suite of freely available web-based course materials appropriate for use as a template for integrating computer modeling and design skills into any mechanical engineering undergraduate program, and for exposing high school students to the excitement of the mechanical engineering profession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of our work product will be a critical aspect of this project. Carnegie Mellon will partner with Drexel University to integrate the web-based course modules developed at Carnegie Mellon into the Drexel curriculum. In turn, Drexel will provide assessment and feedback data for refining and improving the learning modules. High school students and the instructors in the Pine-Richland High School Engineering Systems course will use a subset of the web-based modules and computer-controlled prototyping hardware with the objective of exposing their students to the excitement, hardware, and tools of the mechanical engineering profession.</AbstractNarration>
