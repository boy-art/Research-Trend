    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204579&lt;br/&gt;Selman Akbulut&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposer plans to investigate the topology of smooth 4-manifolds by &lt;br/&gt;decomposing them into Stein pieces which are easy to understand &lt;br/&gt;(since they turn out to be Lefschetz fibrations over the 2-disk). He &lt;br/&gt;would like use the techniques of complex and symplectic manifolds to &lt;br/&gt;understand the restriction this decomposition imposes to the topology &lt;br/&gt;of the original manifold. Proposer hopes to apply these techniques to &lt;br/&gt;attack some unsolved problems of 4-dimensional topology, such as &lt;br/&gt;finding 4-dimensional fake s-cobordisms, and to the problem of &lt;br/&gt;constructing a fake S^3 x S^1. Proposer also plans to work on the &lt;br/&gt;topological problems arising from complex algebraic geometry, such as &lt;br/&gt;problems coming from the complex conjugation, branched covers and the &lt;br/&gt;curve counting problem in real algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposer plans to investigate structure of 4-dimensional manifolds by &lt;br/&gt;decomposing them into pieces that are topologically easier to &lt;br/&gt;understand (4-manifolds are spaces which locally look like &lt;br/&gt;4-dimensional Euclidean space-time we live in). These smaller pieces &lt;br/&gt;carry certain `natural complex structures' which analytical &lt;br/&gt;techniques apply. By these techniques Principal investigator hopes to &lt;br/&gt;construct certain 4-manifolds believed to exists but not yet have &lt;br/&gt;been found. One of the reasons 4-manifolds are of interest is because &lt;br/&gt;of the physicists model of the 10-dimensional universe which consists &lt;br/&gt;of a 4-dimensional space-time plus 6-dimensional complex piece.</AbstractNarration>
