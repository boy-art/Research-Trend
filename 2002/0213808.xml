    <AbstractNarration>The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Nebraska supports an interdisciplinary research program on Quantum and Spin Phenomena in Nanomagnetic Structures. The MRSEC includes faculty participants representing the departments of physics, mechanical engineering, chemistry, and the school of biological sciences The Center's research is organized into two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). IRG1, Nanomagnetism: Fundamental Interactions and Applications, is concerned with the study of exchange and magnetostatic interactions between particles or grains in nanostructures. IRG 2, Spin Polarization and Transmission at Nanocontacts and Interfaces, investigates spin polarization and transport through nanoscale magnetic contacts and at ferromagnetic/ferroelectric structures. The Center's research is aided by extensive collaborations with other universities, government and industrial laboratories that bring in over fifteen additional participants. The Center also maintains shared experimental facilities in support of its research efforts. Education outreach efforts include research experiences for teachers and for faculty-student teams from predominantly undergraduate institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the Center currently include 16 senior investigators, 2 postdoctoral associates, 14 graduate students, 10 undergraduate students, and 2 support personnel. Professor David J. Sellmyer directs the MRSEC.</AbstractNarration>
