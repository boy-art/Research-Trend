    <AbstractNarration>The performance and durability of microdevices in sliding contact is &lt;br/&gt;strongly dependent on interfacial phenomena like adhesion, friction, wear, &lt;br/&gt;and friction/vibration interaction. It is becoming increasingly recognized &lt;br/&gt;that problems of stiction, adhesion and other critical phenomena such as &lt;br/&gt;bouncing vibrations occur dynamically in the presence of time-varying loads &lt;br/&gt;and motions. As high-speed contacts operate under ever more challenging &lt;br/&gt;conditions, contact or sticking can, in principle, occur at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: In this research, a systematic approach to dynamic &lt;br/&gt;contact studies of microsystems will be performed based on system &lt;br/&gt;independent interfacial models that are coupled to the system dependent &lt;br/&gt;dynamics of the interface. A unique feature of the proposed approach is &lt;br/&gt;the direct incorporation of the intermolecular (adhesion) forces and &lt;br/&gt;kinetic friction models based on continuum mechanics into a dynamically &lt;br/&gt;moving contact interface. This will enable contact length scales from &lt;br/&gt;micrometer to millimeter range and beyond to be covered. Also, two unique &lt;br/&gt;microtribometers will be built to measure key dynamic properties of &lt;br/&gt;realistic miniature systems, and to conduct dynamic contact and friction &lt;br/&gt;experiments for model verification and for studying such phenomena in &lt;br/&gt;HDI's, and MEMS. The outcome of this research is to: (a) Develop a &lt;br/&gt;rigorous kinetic friction model for microdevices; (b) Use the model to &lt;br/&gt;predict interfacial forces, damping and kinetic friction, thus providing a &lt;br/&gt;powerful tool for controlling adhesion, friction and wear in microsystems; &lt;br/&gt;(c) Predict the motions of contacting and pseudo-contacting HDI's and MEMS &lt;br/&gt;as a function of design parameters like roughness, material properties, and &lt;br/&gt;system dynamic properties, thus avoiding large vibrations and impact forces &lt;br/&gt;and the associated catastrophic consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research plan will advance the knowledge of tribology &lt;br/&gt;and microtribolgy, while the education plan of this research will &lt;br/&gt;disseminate it outside the research group and beyond the University. The &lt;br/&gt;educational goals of increasing the awareness of micro/nanotribology and &lt;br/&gt;engineering in general, will be accomplished by: (a) establishing an &lt;br/&gt;outreach K-12 program targeting students grades 1 through 5 (cub-scouts) &lt;br/&gt;and high school students, (b) enhancing a basic tribology course using &lt;br/&gt;modern teaching techniques and also recruiting underrepresented students to &lt;br/&gt;work on projects and disseminate the information to the public, (c) &lt;br/&gt;developing a new graduate class in friction/vibration for miniature systems &lt;br/&gt;(microtribodynamics) that will include current research findings, and (d) &lt;br/&gt;actively participating in local and professional societies to promote &lt;br/&gt;engineering and tribology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed integrated research and education plan will advance further &lt;br/&gt;the development of micromachines, which has a major potential impact on &lt;br/&gt;society through transformation of a wide range of technologies, and at the &lt;br/&gt;same time increase the awareness and significance of friction and tribology</AbstractNarration>
