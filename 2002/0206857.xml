    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Zink will conduct research on the excited electronic states and reactivities of inorganic molecular precursors for photodeposition of metals and semiconductors. Absorption, emission and resonance Raman spectroscopies as well as gas phase action spectra and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization experiments will be performed on a series of metal organic molecules. The basic spectroscopic and photochemical properties of these compounds will be used to establish optimum parameters for deposition processes and formation of nano-strutures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thin film deposition and formation of nano-structures from gaseous metal organic compounds depend on the knowledge of the spectroscopic and photochemical properties of the molecules. This research is directed to bring about a better understanding of these properties in order to facilitate efficient fabrication of thin films, lithography and direct writing units, the production of three dimensional structures with potential use in making three-dimensional circuits and photonic crystals, and the production of nanoparticles in porous and templated materials. The research will be done with students who thereby will receive training in preparation for entering the scientific/technological workforce.</AbstractNarration>
