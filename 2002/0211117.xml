    <AbstractNarration>This award from the MRI program supports the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities with the acquisition of a reactive sputtering system for magnetic oxide thin film research and education. The ultra high vacuum system will incorporate d.c. and r.f. sputtering methods at high substrate temperatures, with controlled oxygen partial pressures. A novel gas injection mechanism will be employed to yield the largest possible control over the ratio of inert gas pressure to oxygen pressure, amenable to the deposition of a wide variety of epitaxial oxides. This, along with a load locked sample introduction chamber and multi-sample access will provide a highly flexible system with relatively high throughput as well as the capability to grow conventional metallic and insulating samples. The system allows growing novel magnetic oxide materials of current and future interest. Possibilities include the deposition of heterostructured samples involving combinations of non-magnetic metals, ferromagnetic metals and magnetic oxides and tunnel barriers. Thin film cobaltites, LaFeO3 exchange, and antiferromagnet/ferromagnet superlattices will be studied. In addition to the research opportunities the instrument will also support a unique educational tool for the training and education of graduate and undergraduate research students.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award from the MRI program supports the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities with the acquisition of a reactive sputtering system for magnetic oxide thin film research and education.
