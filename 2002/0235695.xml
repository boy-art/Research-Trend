    <AbstractNarration>Forest habitats are increasingly fragmented by road building. However, little is known about the effects of roads on animal populations in adjacent forests. Roads may affect populations by contributing to abiotic edge effects, by causing direct mortality, or by reducing rates of dispersal. This study will use two species of terrestrial salamander (Plethodon cinereus and P. glutinosus) to examine how fragmentation by roads can affect animal populations. Investigators will use detailed field surveys, field experiments and genetic analysis to answer the following questions: 1) How do the effects of roads on salamander densities vary among species, among sites, and among years? 2) What mechanisms are responsible for the effects of roads on salamander densities? 3) How do different types of roads affect salamander dispersal ability?, and 4) How do different types of roads affect patterns of gene flow? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has general implications for the understanding the persistence of animal populations in fragmented habitats and has specific applications to the conservation biology of amphibians. Terrestrial salamanders are an important component of temperate forest ecosystems and have been proposed as useful indicators of forest health. Although terrestrial salamanders do not appear to have declined as severely aquatic-breeding amphibians, habitat fragmentation may threaten their long-term persistence. As an RUI project, this study also provides numerous research training opportunities for undergraduate students in genetics, ecology, and conservation biology. Students will participate in all aspects of the project, from study design to data collection to presentation of results.</AbstractNarration>
