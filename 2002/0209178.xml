    <AbstractNarration>This workshop is for university faculty, department heads and deans as well as economists, nationally recognized experts from the electric power industry, and experts in adaptive systems to explore advanced research needs in the fields of Economics, Power Systems and Adaptive Systems. The workshop is intended to identify the basic theoretical problems now facing the electric, power industry in the United States and suggest research needs that can be addressed by NSF in the future. This is the second of a series of three NSF/EPRI workshops, whose ultimate goal is to promote research leading to new solutions to existing problems facing the electric power industry.</AbstractNarration>
