    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204428&lt;br/&gt;Xingru Zhang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of compact irreducible 3-manifolds splits naturally&lt;br/&gt;into cases of finite fundamental groups and infinite fundamental&lt;br/&gt;groups. In the case of infinite fundamental groups, the virtual&lt;br/&gt;Haken conjecture of Waldhausen has been serving as a guiding open&lt;br/&gt;problem, because virtual Haken 3-manifolds possess similar nice&lt;br/&gt;properties as Haken 3-manifolds, such as topological rigidity,&lt;br/&gt;residually finite fundamental groups and geometric decomposition&lt;br/&gt;in Thurston's sense. Concerning 3-manifolds with finite&lt;br/&gt;fundamental groups, the Poincare conjecture is perhaps the most &lt;br/&gt;fundamental open problem. The well known Property-P conjecture &lt;br/&gt;may be considered as a special case of the Poincare conjecture. &lt;br/&gt;Xingru Zhang proposes to continue his investigation of the virtual&lt;br/&gt;Haken conjecture and the Property-P conjecture, along with some &lt;br/&gt;closely related problems, such as embedded or immersed essential &lt;br/&gt;surfaces in 3-manifolds, various exceptional Dehn surgeries on &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic knots, and representations of 3-manifold groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three dimensional manifold topology, including the knot theory,&lt;br/&gt;has been one of the most active research areas in topology over &lt;br/&gt;the last twenty-five years. This is a rich, beautiful and &lt;br/&gt;challenging area where topology meshes up harmonically with &lt;br/&gt;algebra and geometry. For instance, if a compact 3-manifold &lt;br/&gt;without boundary admits a complete hyperbolic metric, then the &lt;br/&gt;topology, the fundamental group and the hyperbolic metric of the &lt;br/&gt;manifold mutually determine each other. In general, it is &lt;br/&gt;fundamental to know that to what extent the topology of a compact &lt;br/&gt;3-manifold is determined by the fundamental group of the manifold,&lt;br/&gt;and that whether the interior of a compact 3-manifold admits one &lt;br/&gt;of the eight standard complete metrics under the condition that &lt;br/&gt;the manifold contains no essential 2-spheres or 2-tori. In this &lt;br/&gt;proposal the PI plans to continue his investigation in this &lt;br/&gt;direction.</AbstractNarration>
