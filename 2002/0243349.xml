    <AbstractNarration>Provenance and data derivation are important to many aspects of scientific computation. In &lt;br/&gt;molecular biology, where data is repeatedly copied, corrected, and transformed as it passes &lt;br/&gt;through numerous genomic databases, understanding where data has come from and how it &lt;br/&gt;arrived in the user's database is of crucial to the trust a scientist will put in that data, yet this &lt;br/&gt;information is seldom captured properly. In astronomy, useful results may have been been &lt;br/&gt;obtained by filtering, transforming, and analyzing some base data by a complex assemblage of &lt;br/&gt;programs, yet we lack good tools for recording how these programs were connected and the &lt;br/&gt;context in which they were run. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in the new insights that it will bring to the &lt;br/&gt;important topics of data provenance and data derivation. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity relate primarily to the establishment of &lt;br/&gt;new ties between distinct disciplines that have strong interests in data derivation and provenance &lt;br/&gt;but have not, historically, talked to each other. These new ties will tend to accelerate both &lt;br/&gt;research and education in the participating disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
