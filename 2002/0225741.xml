    <AbstractNarration>The change in biology to a data driven science has meant that new educational needs have become apparent. Primary among these is the skills associated with biological informatics, skills in understanding algorithms and databases. This workshop will draw together a group of scientist with a background and experience in developing curricula in bioinformatics to identify best practices and the challenges that remain. The programs represented at the meeting cover the US and, by holding it in association with a major meeting, will help to raise awareness of the importance of education and training in biological informatics. A report of the meeting will be made available on the web.</AbstractNarration>
