    <AbstractNarration>This dissertation investigates the organizational factors that affect a union's efforts to organize nonunion workplaces. Fifteen locals will be randomly selected for study from each of the largest 20 international unions. Annual measures of resources used for organizing will be taken from financial disclosure forms unions filed with the Department of Labor. These include estimates of the total expenditures on organizing and the size of the staff devoted to organizing. These same disclosure forms also include data that will be used to measure the degree of oligarchic leadership structure that may depress organizing and rank-and-file mobilization. These include the expenditures on officer salaries, the tenure length of officers, and the extent of union investments. Other measures in the analysis include union size, the proportion of union income from member dues, and whether union officers are elected by the rank-and-file. The outcomes to be studied are the number and success of union organizing efforts between 1991 and 2001, a period of growing union organizing efforts. Event history analysis will evaluate which of the union organizational variables are associated with union organizing efforts and union success two years later.</AbstractNarration>
