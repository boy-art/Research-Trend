    <AbstractNarration>This research concerns the use of simultaneous multithreaded (SMT) processors for soft real-time applications such as multimedia applications. SMT processors have the potential to provide high throughput by running multiple threads at the same time, and soft real-time applications are an&lt;br/&gt;increasingly important workload. The use of SMT processors for real-time applications, however, has largely been unexplored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most work on SMT has been driven by the goal of increasing throughput. Real-time applications additionally require high schedulability (i.e., the ability to meet deadlines) and predictability. Further, such applications often run in energy and thermal power constrained environments. This work&lt;br/&gt;seeks to develop co-schedule selection and resource sharing algorithms (and consequent admission tests) for SMT processors that will (1) maximize instruction throughput, (2) maximize schedulability, (3)&lt;br/&gt;maximize execution time predictability, (4) minimize energy, and (5) minimize thermal power, for soft real-time applications such as multimedia applications. This is the first work that considers the issues of temporal schedulability and predictability, and integrates them with energy and thermal considerations, for real-time applications and SMT. Without this research, an increasingly important class of workloads would be unable to exploit an architectural advance that has provided large benefits in other domains.</AbstractNarration>
