    <AbstractNarration>The subject of this research proposal is the Anderson metal-insulator transport &lt;br/&gt;transition and other phenomena in disordered systems. A new approach to the Anderson &lt;br/&gt;metal-insulator transition based on transport instead of spectral properties will be &lt;br/&gt;investigated. In addition, several related topics will be investigated. Constructive &lt;br/&gt;criteria for localization in random media will be developed; an application is planned &lt;br/&gt;for the Landau Hamiltonian with a random potential. Local Poisson statistics for the &lt;br/&gt;strong insulator spectrum of Anderson-type Hamiltonians in the continuum will be &lt;br/&gt;studied. The spectrum of the Anderson model on the Bethe lattice will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;Localization at low disorder in one or two dimensions will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortysome years have passed since P. Anderson's seminal article on localization of &lt;br/&gt;electrons in random media, but our mathematical understanding of the metal-insulator &lt;br/&gt;transition is still very unsatisfactory. In three or more dimensions a transition is &lt;br/&gt;believed to occur from an insulator regime, characterized by localized states, to a &lt;br/&gt;very different metallic regime characterized by extended states. The energy at which &lt;br/&gt;this metal insulator transition occurs is called the mobility edge. The standard &lt;br/&gt;mathematical interpretation of this picture is that there should be a transition in the &lt;br/&gt;spectrum of the random SchrAdinger from pure point spectrum (localized states) to &lt;br/&gt;absolutely continuous spectrum (extended states). But up to now there are no &lt;br/&gt;mathematical results on the existence of continuous spectrum and a metal-insulator &lt;br/&gt;transition (except for the special case of the Anderson model on the Bethe lattice). A &lt;br/&gt;new approach to the Anderson metal-insulator transition is proposed based on transport &lt;br/&gt;instead of spectral properties. It is motivated by the fact that the intuitive physical &lt;br/&gt;notion of localization has a dynamical interpretation: an initially localized wave &lt;br/&gt;packet should remain localized under time evolution, and delocalization may be &lt;br/&gt;interpreted as nontrivial transport. The main goal of this proposal is to show the &lt;br/&gt;existence of such a transport transition.</AbstractNarration>
