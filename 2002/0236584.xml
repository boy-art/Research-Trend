    <AbstractNarration>Research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In previous work supported by NSF, the PI discovered a process for the rapid deposition of highly conformal coatings consisting mostly of silicon dioxide (silica). The method uses alternating layer deposition (ADL) from two different vapors supplied alternately to a surface to make a coating that is laminated on the nanometer scale. Each layer is formed with a highly precise atomic level of control over thickness, smoothness, conformality and composition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes theories that should permit him to extend the capability of this deposition method in five different ways:&lt;br/&gt;1. Lower dielectric constant. Carbon-doping of the silica films will be used to lower the dielectric constant (k). Carbon will be introduced into the coating by chemical modification of the precursors.&lt;br/&gt;2. Selective sealing of pores. By use of the catalytic character of the ALD process, the PI plans to deposit the carbon-doped low-k material to seal the pores near the surface of the ultra-low-k dielectrics, without placing any material inside interior pores. This process will prevent the electrical leakage that occurs after deposition of electrically conductive materials onto ultra-low-k dielectric materials.&lt;br/&gt;3. Selective trench filling. By another use of the catalytic character of the ALD process, the PI plans to fill the insides of narrow trenches with low-k material, while keeping adjacent flat surfaces free of any deposit.&lt;br/&gt;4. Higher growth rate. Using his theoretical mechanism for the ALD process, he plans to further increase growth rate by the synthesis and testing of a new chemical precursor.&lt;br/&gt;5. ALD of optical multiplayer filters. The ALD process has the right characteristics to make superior low-index layers for optical multi-layer filters, even on non-planar surfaces such as those found on lenses or focusing mirrors. A method is also being considered for ALD of layers of the other material needed for these filters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the five planned activities could have important impact on critical needs in the microelectronics and optical communications industries:&lt;br/&gt;1. This process would extend the unique capabilities of ALD to make highly conformal low-k insulators needed in microelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;2. Selective sealing of surface pores on ultra-low-k dielectrics is needed to provide the smooth surfaces needed for making interconnections in microeletronics.&lt;br/&gt;3. Selective trench filling would allow the filling of isolated trenches between microelectronic transistors without the use of the expensive chemical/mechanical polishing step normally needed to remove excess silica from the top surface.&lt;br/&gt;4. Achievement of still higher deposition rates will make the ALD process more cost-effective for all practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;5. Wavelength-selective filters with higher quality are needed in fields such as integrated optics and electronics, and optical communications.</AbstractNarration>
