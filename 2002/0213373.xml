    <AbstractNarration>This project involves a combined experimental and theoretical study of the effects of nonhy-drostatic stress on the kinetic processes of epitaxial crystal growth and diffusion. The impact of stress-dependent activation barrier heights for crystal growth and surface diffusion on growth morphology evolution will be studied. The effect of simple, uniform stress states on atomic dif-fusion in thin films, both parallel and perpendicular to the surface, will be measured. The theory of diffusion under nonhydrostatic stress states will be further developed. This research is ex-pected to establish methods by which the measurement of the stress-dependence of a kinetic pro-cess under a few simple, uniform stress states permits the prediction of the effect of an arbitrary, nonuniform stress state-deemed important for the design of future semiconductor devices. It also permits the determination of processes going on in the interior of solids, where they cannot be observed directly, from the results of atomistic theoretical calculations and experimental ob-servations of the response to imposed external stresses. It is anticipated that success in this en-deavor will facilitate the creation of new, interesting, and potentially useful materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues in areas of electronic materials science having strong technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education. The research program provides excel-lent opportunities for hands-on experience in the use of sophisticated scientific equipment. The resources available provide special opportunities for education and training of students involved in interdisciplinary forefront materials science research. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
