    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Recently, there has been growing interest in legume-rhizobia associations as&lt;br/&gt;model systems for studying mutualisms, but a central obstacle is that little is known about&lt;br/&gt;the genetic structure of native communities. We know that associations can be specific&lt;br/&gt;or promiscuous, but very few studies have described spatial or temporal variation in&lt;br/&gt;native rhizobia-legume communities. We intent to examine levels of spatial and&lt;br/&gt;temporal variation in communities of rhizobia and legumes in natural environments. We&lt;br/&gt;will compare associations at various geographic scales, from within nodules to between&lt;br/&gt;canyons. We will measure how associations change over time, considering variation&lt;br/&gt;between months, seasons, and years. By considering specificity of associations and the&lt;br/&gt;genetic structure of a native community, our goal is to better understand the potential for&lt;br/&gt;coevolution to shape this mutualism. The proposed work uses sequences from 1329&lt;br/&gt;strains from 15 plant species to characterize the effect of plant taxa, microhabitat&lt;br/&gt;differences, and seasonal differences on rhizobial genetic variation and specificity of&lt;br/&gt;associations. We will contribute to the understanding of this imporant mutualism by&lt;br/&gt;seeking to describe natural systems in detail, characterizing rhizobial genetic diversity,&lt;br/&gt;and measuring the extent that specialization and generalization is achieved in naturally&lt;br/&gt;evolving populations.</AbstractNarration>
