    <AbstractNarration>This project uses the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-CHEM) three-dimensional chemical-transport model to investigate processes controlling tropospheric ozone and selected related trace constituents of the troposphere, relying heavily on satellite remote-sensing, aircraft and surface station data sets to initialize, constrain and evaluate the model. The high-resolution modeling will focus specifically on process and regional studies of selected trace gases important to the global environment, placing emphasis on interannual variability and an investigation of regional sources and sinks. Work on trace carbon gases will be carried out in collaboration with Daniel Jacob (Harvard University). The Asian region and its effect on the global environment will be investigated, including the somewhat novel consideration of the influence of European and American emissions on Asian air quality. The project will provide important updated information on concentration fields globally of several important tropospheric trace constituents, important for projections of future concentrations. Results will have important policy-relevant implications within the global community of nations, especially those undergoing rapid economic development. This award will provide educational opportunities for graduate students and a post-doctoral student.</AbstractNarration>
