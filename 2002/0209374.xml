    <AbstractNarration>DMS Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Award #: 0209374&lt;br/&gt;PI: Simmons, Charlotte&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Central Oklahoma&lt;br/&gt;Program: Applied Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;Program Manager: Catherine Mavriplis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAM 2002: Conference on Applied Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAM 2002, a conference on applied mathematics, will be held on the University of Central Oklahoma campus on the weekend of October 25 - 27, 2002. The conference will focus on two related areas within applied mathematics with applications to telecommunications, and electrical and computer engineering: wavelets/signal processing and error-correcting codes. As a result, this conference will be of interest to engineers and physicists as well as to mathematicians. A major emphasis of the conference will be "coding theory": Much of signal processing is about source coding while the theory of error-correcting codes is channel coding. Wavelets are now the most applicable tool in signal processing. For instance, wavelet filters were recently adopted as the JPEG-2000 image compression standard. Wavelet packets, a mathematical shorthand for compressing and restoring virtually any image or sound, have been used by the FBI and Scotland Yard to compress their fingerprint files to a more manageable size. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAM 2002 will foster interdisciplinary communication between mathematicians, computer engineers, and signal processors; i.e., this conference will bring together theoreticians and practitioners. Moreover, the conference will provide an opportunity for students (undergraduate &amp; graduate) and faculty from the region to share their research with each other and interact with world-class experts in the areas of wavelets/signal processing and error-correcting codes. Error-correcting codes provide the means for the reliable transformation of speech, audio, images and video into digital content. Deep space communication, wireless phones, high speed data networks, the Internet, and products like compact disc players, hard drives, and high speed modems make essential use of coding and data compression to improve speed and reliability. The federal funds will be used primarily to provide travel support for students, recent doctoral recipients, junior faculty, women and other underrepresented groups in mathematics, science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date: May 14, 2002</AbstractNarration>
