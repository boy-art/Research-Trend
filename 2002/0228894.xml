    <AbstractNarration>0228894&lt;br/&gt;Elser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a U.S.-China joint workshop proposed by Dr. James Elser, Arizona State University, on ecological complexity and ecosystem services. The workshop will bring together American and Chinese researchers in biocomplexity and ecosystem services in a series of interactions designed to establish a network of international collaboration and exchange. A preliminary meeting between U.S. and Chinese organizers will be held in November, 2002, and a U.S. delegation of 12 scientists will visit China in spring, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is outstanding. The area of ecosystem services is emerging as a topic for fundamental research. The proposed collaborative activities would benefit ecological science and its contribution to the management of complex ecological/economic systems. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and NSF will jointly support the cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
