    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is the development of anionic and photochemical condensation reactions. When combined with anionic fragmentation reactions, these transformations will produce highly functionalized 5-10 membered ring systems including those present in the biologically active cembranoid natural products. The educational component of the project includes K-12 science outreach and curriculum development at the undergraduate level. At the graduate level, future educators will be introduced to ways of describing chemical research in layman's terms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Jon D. Rainier of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona. Professor Rainier will focus his research on the development of synthetic methodology applicable to the preparation of complex molecules with important biological properties. Dr. Rainier's educational activities include outreach efforts and curriculum development at the undergraduate level.</AbstractNarration>
