    <AbstractNarration>The VLSI design productivity crisis, that is, the fact that the number of&lt;br/&gt;available transistors grows much faster than the ability to design them&lt;br/&gt;meaningfully, has become the greatest threat to the growth of semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;industry. Silicon complexity, which refers to the impact of previously &lt;br/&gt;ignorable physical phenomena, is at the center of this crisis. Based on our beliefs that&lt;br/&gt;the only effective way to improve productivity is to maintain design complexity&lt;br/&gt;at a manageable level, and that formal methods are the right techniques for&lt;br/&gt;complexity control, the objective of this research is to improve design&lt;br/&gt;productivity by applying formal methods to silicon complexity problems such as&lt;br/&gt;inductive/capacitive couplings and process variabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research develops methodology, models, and algorithms to handle silicon&lt;br/&gt;complexity through the application of formal methods. By treating timing &lt;br/&gt;analysis as extracting semantics of a circuit, a timing analysis system is developed &lt;br/&gt;that handles both inductive and capacitive coupling delay variations. The system&lt;br/&gt;develops and uses a range of inductive coupling models with different accuracy&lt;br/&gt;and complexity. Based on that, timing macromodels for coupling delays are &lt;br/&gt;created for library characterization and IP specification. Clock scheduling and &lt;br/&gt;retiming algorithms are developed to separate signal switching times for coupling delay&lt;br/&gt;optimization. Signal switching time information is also explored in routing and&lt;br/&gt;placement to minimize coupling between sensitive wires. For process &lt;br/&gt;variability, statistical models are developed and combined into the timing analysis &lt;br/&gt;system to compute the statistical performance of a circuit, and stochastic &lt;br/&gt;optimization is used to optimize the statistical performance. The integrated education &lt;br/&gt;activities aim at two aspects of computer engineering education: 1) educating students in&lt;br/&gt;formal methods, especially their applications to nanometer VLSI design, thus&lt;br/&gt;bringing needed mathematical rigor into the discipline; 2) introducing students&lt;br/&gt;to silicon complexity and its impacts on VLSI design so that they are equipped&lt;br/&gt;with necessary background for modern high performance VLSI design.</AbstractNarration>
