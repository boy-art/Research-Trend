    <AbstractNarration>Inputs to the global nitrogen cycle have increased significantly due to human activities and there are many uncertainties in our knowledge of how this nitrogen enrichment will impact terrestrial biotic communities and ecosystem function. Among these is the impact that nitrogen enrichment is having on decomposer organisms and the litter decomposition process. The overall objective of this research is to examine how plant litter chemistry (lignin and nitrogen content) and external nitrogen availability interact to impact the composition and/or activity of the litter microbial community. Because nutrient cycles are being significantly altered by human activities, basic ecological research is needed to determine whether anthropogenic disturbance is impairing the ability of ecosystems to function sustainably. This research will contribute to our understanding of how decomposer microorganisms respond to nitrogen additions and to enhance our ability to predict how nitrogen enrichment impacts the litter decomposition process.</AbstractNarration>
