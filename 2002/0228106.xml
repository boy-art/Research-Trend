    <AbstractNarration>Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) is establishing a high performance network connection to support its increasingly strong research mission. Among the researchers who will use this connection are &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ralph M. Butler (Computer Science). Dr. Butler conducts research in the development of algorithms/software for parallel processing and computational biology. The high performance network connection will enhance his collaboration with colleagues at Argonne National Laboratory and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ngee-Sing Chong (Chemistry). Dr. Chong conducts research in the development of new materials for the removal of environmental pollutants. The high performance network connection will also allow him to carry out computational simulation of the transport of atmospheric pollutants using the resources available from various government agencies. Dr. Chong will also make use of remote access to instrumentation for student research projects and laboratory instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Preston J. MacDougall (Chemistry). Dr. MacDougall is the Principal Investigator for the Materials Theory and Molecular Design Project at MTSU. The most computationally intensive area of his research program is the development of molecular visualization tools, and involves collaboration with computer scientists at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. The high performance network connection at MTSU will enable Dr. MacDougall and his students to utilize the key interactive features of his visualization software remotely, and in "real time". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Zachariah Sinkala (Mathematics). Dr. Sinkala focuses on research in applied differential equations. He will use the high performance network connection to obtain rapid access to powerful computer systems capable of numerically solving systems of hundreds of simultaneous, nonlinear, partial differential equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MTSU has a network backbone using Gigabit Ethernet. The campus standard is 100 Mbps switched Ethernet to the desktop, providing a full 100 Mbps dedicated connection to the campus data network. The network includes over 7000 active ports. The high performance network connection will be achieved by purchasing a router to provide connectivity to Vanderbilt University via a full DS3. MTSU will also purchase the necessary equipment to interface the DS3 circuit with Vanderbilt's network equipment as specified by Vanderbilt's Information Technology department. MTSU traffic destined for Abilene will then combine with Vanderbilt Abilene traffic on an OC-12 connection to the Southern Crossroads (SoX) regional high-speed network.</AbstractNarration>
