    <AbstractNarration>P.I. Webster, Donald (Georgia Tech) Proposal #: 0219519&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to develop a new apparatus to simulate oceanic turbulence in the laboratory. The work proposed is a one-year effort to complete the design, construct, and validate the apparatus. The proposed equipment is superior to traditional designs, such as grid-oscillating tanks, because of greater isotropy, improved homogeneity, increased simplicity, increased controllability, increased transportability, and reduced cost. The system consists of a cubic Plexiglas box with an actuator located at each corner. Each actuator alternatively forces fluid out of and draws fluid into a small hole in the box wall. This action induces a turbulent pulsed jet originating from each corner aimed at the box center; the net result of the eight actuators is a highly isotropic and homogeneous turbulent region in the volume surrounding the box center. This system is based on a previous apparatus constructed for use with gases. Once validated, the system will have broad application for research in physical and biological oceanography as well as fundamental fluid mechanics.</AbstractNarration>
