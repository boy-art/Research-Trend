    <AbstractNarration>In many imaging applications, mobile agents--such as untethered reconnaissance robots and micro air vehicles--transmit and receive bandwidth-intensive image data over wireless networks. A key issue in developing small, mobile agents is minimizing their power requirements. The most significant source of power dissipation in a wireless communications system is the transmission of data over the wireless link. Compressing the data before transmission is a direct way to significantly decrease power requirements; thus, effective image compression algorithms are critical to realizing a mobile, wireless, real-time, high quality imaging system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various hardware platforms can be considered for mobile computing. Of these platforms, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are the most compelling for wireless, mobile, fast, low-power, handheld/wearable/embedded, image compression devices. FPGAs can be used as the basis for implementations that are low cost, easily updated, and significantly faster than microprocessor-based implementations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is twofold: to design new, efficient image compression algorithms and to design, build, demonstrate and evaluate FPGA implementations of state-of-the-art image compression systems. Our close-knit interdisciplinary team of image compression and hardware specialists will allow for end-to-end system performance analysis. This critical assessment is almost never performed and yet it is important to understanding the combined effects of algorithmic and implementation design choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, two or three real-world interdisciplinary projects that can be utilized in senior-level digital signal processing and digital design classes will be designed and published.</AbstractNarration>
