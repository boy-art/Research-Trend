    <AbstractNarration>This is a request for support for research on predicting spin observables in the&lt;br/&gt;photo- and electro-production of mesons. Our goal continues to be to use the&lt;br/&gt;new and precise cross-section and spin observable data, from Je.erson Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;(JLAB) and from other GeV electron beam facilities, to determine the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms of electromagnetic meson production and the associated&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of excited nucleons, and perhaps the nature of hadrons themselves.&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge of nucleon excited states and their form factors provides important&lt;br/&gt;information about the non-perturbative regime of QCD. The photo- and&lt;br/&gt;electro-production of p, ., kaon, and vector mesons are being measured with&lt;br/&gt;high precision using the impressive JLAB large angle spectrometer (CLAS) detector&lt;br/&gt;and the high resolution magnetic spectrometers in Halls A&amp; C.&lt;br/&gt;Polarized targets and beams at JLAB and at other facilities allow a variety&lt;br/&gt;of single and double spin observables to be measured. Our focus is on the&lt;br/&gt;questions: Can we develop a analysis tool that can be used to extract reliable&lt;br/&gt;isobar information from electromagnetic production experiments? What can&lt;br/&gt;one learn from such measurements? Can quark dynamics be incorporated into&lt;br/&gt;the coupled-channels approach we have developed over the last several years?&lt;br/&gt;Does evidence exist for the excitation of unusual baryon states and/or those&lt;br/&gt;predicted by quark models?&lt;br/&gt;The hope is to answer such questions by examining the sensitivity of beam,&lt;br/&gt;target, and recoil-particle cross-sections and spin-observables to underlying resonances,&lt;br/&gt;t- and u-channel exchanges, and to threshold e.ects. In earlier publications,&lt;br/&gt;we deduced general features of spin observables for 0-(p, .,K) and&lt;br/&gt;1-(., ., f) meson production, which are helpful guides in amplitude analyses,&lt;br/&gt;model calculations and in planning experiments. We have been combining such&lt;br/&gt;insights with viable dynamical coupled-channels(CC) calculations, for which collaborations&lt;br/&gt;with Saclay and Argonne National Laboratory have been established&lt;br/&gt;and hopefully will continue. The codes we have developed provide .exible, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;(o.-shell) methods for including important spin-dependent .nal state&lt;br/&gt;interactions along with threshold, cusp, and isobar excitation e.ects. Recently,&lt;br/&gt;we .gured out how to incorporate quark model dynamics. Developing this code&lt;br/&gt;has been a slow process, but we are now ready to apply this project to recent&lt;br/&gt;data and to extend the research to a wider range of mesons and to electroproduction.</AbstractNarration>
