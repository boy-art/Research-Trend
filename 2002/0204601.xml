    <AbstractNarration>The PI plans to establish rigidity and finiteness results for&lt;br/&gt;infinite groups, both in geometric and dynamical contexts. In an&lt;br/&gt;attempt to broaden the scope of rigidity as initiated by Mostow,&lt;br/&gt;Margulis, Zimmer and others, we aim at results for very general&lt;br/&gt;(finitely generated) groups, notably fundamental groups arising&lt;br/&gt;in geometry. The proposed methods are however also new and&lt;br/&gt;relevant for the more classical study of arithmetic and&lt;br/&gt;S-arithmetic groups. There are three aspects to the project.&lt;br/&gt;The first is to construct cohomological invariants characterizing&lt;br/&gt;various geometric situations; a typical example is the&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of negative curvature in terms of bounded&lt;br/&gt;cohomology that we propose with Shalom. The second step is to&lt;br/&gt;develop a suitable theory to handle these invariants in an&lt;br/&gt;efficient way, notably by using tools from ergodic theory. Last,&lt;br/&gt;one has to apply this to concrete situations. We focus in&lt;br/&gt;particular on superrigidity and cocycle superrigidity for&lt;br/&gt;non-linear groups and on orbit equivalence of ergodic actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last forty years have witnessed the birth and remarkable&lt;br/&gt;development of what is now called ''rigidity theory''. The first&lt;br/&gt;discovery in that field was this: Even though a flat space (which&lt;br/&gt;is the kind of space one thought we live in, from the ancient&lt;br/&gt;Greeks to Newton) can be deformed in many ways, some curved&lt;br/&gt;spaces (whose relevance to our world has been discovered by&lt;br/&gt;Einstein) are in a sense rigid. Later came a discovery regarded&lt;br/&gt;as yet much more fundamental: The most symmetric geometric spaces&lt;br/&gt;turn out to be in fact arithmetic objects. The project under&lt;br/&gt;consideration here is to broaden the scope this rigidity theory&lt;br/&gt;to many more geometric spaces, and especially to deal with&lt;br/&gt;situations in which the geometry cannot be reduced to&lt;br/&gt;arithmetics. Actually, we propose new methods that stand out by&lt;br/&gt;their abstract nature and allow us to tackle situations which do&lt;br/&gt;not even stem from geometry, but rather regard the study of&lt;br/&gt;dynamics. (Dynamics is the theory of systems that evolve in&lt;br/&gt;time, typically ocean currents or galaxies, and may have chaotic&lt;br/&gt;behaviours.) Our project proposes new methods for obtaining more&lt;br/&gt;results both in this dynamical setting and in geometry, and this&lt;br/&gt;in a unified way.</AbstractNarration>
