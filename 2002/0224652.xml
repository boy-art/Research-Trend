    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This project is supporting a two-day national conference on "Undergraduate Research and Scholarship&lt;br/&gt; and the Mission of the Research University" at the Reinvention Center at SUNY Stony Brook. &lt;br/&gt;The conference, which will take place on November 14-15, 2002, will bring together&lt;br/&gt;university faculty, administrators, and students, as well as representatives of disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;associations, government agencies, and private foundations, to focus on fundamental, institutional,&lt;br/&gt;cultural, and academic issues that are inherent to research universities. Such issues must be&lt;br/&gt;addressed if research universities are going to maximize their potential and bring research,&lt;br/&gt;scholarship, and creative activity to the forefront of the undergraduate education they offer, as&lt;br/&gt;envisioned in the Boyer Commission report, "Educating Undergraduates in the Research&lt;br/&gt;University." Underlying the conference focus is the broader goal for research universities: (1) to&lt;br/&gt;define and articulate a vision of undergraduate education that builds upon and is synergistic&lt;br/&gt;with their research mission, and (2) to develop reasonable expectations for implementing this&lt;br/&gt;vision so that it impacts significant numbers of students.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the role of undergraduate research and mechanisms for realizing broader&lt;br/&gt;participation is a first step toward this goal. In their efforts to infuse research into the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate education, those in leadership roles in research universities confront the&lt;br/&gt;same panoply of issues and challenges that surround their larger efforts at reinvention. Thus&lt;br/&gt;the conference focus on undergraduate research provides a concrete and manageable way to&lt;br/&gt;address these issues.</AbstractNarration>
