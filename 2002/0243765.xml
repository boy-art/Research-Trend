    <AbstractNarration>The Program for Environmental Science at Arkansas State University (ASU) provides a 10-week summer research experience for 10 highly motivated traditionally under-represented minority undergraduate students interested in environmental research. The summer research program focuses on interdisciplinary investigation of aquatic agri-ecosystems in the Delta, Ozark, and Ouachita regions of Arkansas. The land-use in these regions strongly influences ecosystem processes such as runoff, nutrient cycling, and aquatic and terrestrial habitats. In addition, the dominance of agriculture significantly impacts land- and water-use policy, law and economics. Understanding the chemistry, ecology, geology, policy and economics of agri-ecosystems provides a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to investigate relations between natural and anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystem processes. The principal objectives are to promote the professional development of undergraduate researchers and instill a better appreciation for interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving. The REU scholars, individually and in small groups, work closely with faculty mentors on research projects ranging from ecotoxicology, geochemistry, biogeochemistry, vertebrate and invertebrate ecology, to resource management, policy, law and economics. The program challenges scholars to expand their disciplinary focus and develop an interdisciplinary perspective. Weekly project meetings are used to evaluate progress, examine interdisciplinary linkages between individual research components, and develop new and expanded research plans. Students also participate in ethics seminars where they have an opportunity to debate ethical, gender and minority, and environmental policy issues with the program staff and invited professionals.</AbstractNarration>
