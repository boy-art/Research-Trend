    <AbstractNarration>The University of Minnesota sponsors the Life Sciences Summer Undergraduate Research Program (LSSURP) through the College of Biological Sciences. This program offers undergraduates an opportunity to gain research experience in Neuroscience consisting of an intensive 3-week course in basic neurobiological research principles and a 7-week mentored research experience. The 3-credit course takes place at a remote biology field station attended by a diverse collection of students and abundant faculty, offering opportunities for unique scientific interactions. Following the course, students return to the Twin Cities campus to begin their research experience with a faculty mentor. The neuroscience students attend weekly research and information seminars specific to their discipline and gather with all LSSURP participants (80-100) for a program orientation weekend, weekly research presentations among peers, interactive career and bioethics workshops and evening/weekend social activities. The program culminates with a campus-wide research conference including a poster session and farewell banquet. Students are encouraged to take their research presentations to national meetings. The Neuroscience program provides many opportunities for participant interaction with current graduate students (~60), faculty (~90) and associated personnel. Funds are available for the participation of 8 students. To enhance the experience of each participant, recruiting efforts seek to include a broad spectrum of students across geographic, ethnic, gender and college/university backgrounds. Students from institutions with limited research opportunities are especially well served in the LSSURP programs. Students receive a stipend, tuition for the Neurobiology course, housing on the Medical school campus, travel accommodations and expenses and insurance coverage for accidents and emergency illness. Neurobiology course and summer program evaluations are completed by students to continually enhance this fifteen year-old University of Minnesota program.</AbstractNarration>
