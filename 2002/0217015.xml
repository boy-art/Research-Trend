    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the Seventh U.S. National Conference on Earthquake Engineering, 7NCEE by partially underwriting the administrative and development costs, and to make possible increased participation in the conference of graduate students in earthquake engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conference is the seventh in a series of national conferences on earthquake engineering. Previous conferences have been held in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Stanford, California; Charleston, South Carolina; Palm Springs, California; Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington. They are held every four years, midway in time between the dates of the quadrennial World Conferences on Earthquake Engineering. Each of the national conferences has been sponsored by EERI, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, a non-profit professional society devoted to earthquake engineering and earthquake loss reduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 7NCEE will be held in Boston, Massachusetts and will provide an opportunity for researchers and professional practitioners, in all the disciplines in the earthquake field, to come together and exchange research results, design practices, and organizational and policy perspectives that influence the effectiveness of earthquake preparedness, mitigation, and recovery. The Proceedings provide a valuable repository of information, critical to the future advancement of earthquake engineering.</AbstractNarration>
