    <AbstractNarration>0209343 Mathews The objective of the research is to investigate the feasibility of a novel concept in ozone generator design that should enhance mass transfer by in-situ ozone production using porous electrodes. In addition, enhanced reaction efficiencies will be achieved through the use of highly reactive ozone isotopomer species. Ozone is a powerful oxidant that is more potent than chlorine in the destruction of microbiological contaminants, and in the oxidation of recalcitrant organic compounds in wastewaters. Also, relative to chlorine, ozone is a benign oxidant since it does not generate a large number of toxic compounds as byproducts. However, ozone has not found widespread use due to its relatively high cost per unit volume of water treated, because of poor ozone mass transfer and reaction efficiencies. This exploratory research could help to improve the cost effectiveness of ozone treatment of wastewaters. ***</AbstractNarration>
