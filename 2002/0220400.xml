    <AbstractNarration>P.I. Stokes, Malcolm (Scripps Inst. of Oceanography) Proposal #: 0220400&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to construct a robust, inexpensive sensor array for use in marine and terrestrial environments. This system will utilize a combination of standard technologies that will enable easy deployment of densely populated sensor arrays, (up to 96 sensors, on 8 cables in a single logging unit) in high-energy environments. An important advantage of the proposed network of sensors is that it can be built at low cost thus increasing the likelihood that this instrumentation will be widely used. Another advantage is that, the time-division multiplexing technology developed for the prototype will be easily adaptable to other transducers (i.e. salinity, light intensity). A prototype array constructed to measure pressure and temperature was deployed off Scripps Pier and showed the utility of the design for studies requiring high-resolution monitoring of environmental conditions over spatial scales of 100 to 1000 m.&lt;br/&gt; This proposal requests funding for the development of two autonomous instrument packages based on the prototype technology. These new generation arrays will significantly extend the capabilities of the prototype by incorporating a more robust cabling scheme; utilizing surface mount circuitry for miniaturization of individual sensor modules; and adding an autonomous data-logging microcontroller for long-term, underwater deployments. One instrument package would include 96 pressure sensors (arranged as 12 individual transducers on 8 cable elements) and the other would include 96 precision thermistors. Each microcontroller could be programmed to record data from any combination of pressure, temperature, or other environmental sensors in a modular fashion. The PIs propose to test the instruments as part of currently funded projects that would benefit from higher resolution sampling.</AbstractNarration>
