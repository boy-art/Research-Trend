    <AbstractNarration>David Eisenbud will work on three groups of problems from commutative&lt;br/&gt;algebra and algebraic geometry: The use of exterior algebra methods&lt;br/&gt;in projective geometry and their extension to toric geometry; the study&lt;br/&gt;of infinite free resolutions; and the study of codimensions of determinantal&lt;br/&gt;(and related) ideals. This last includes the circle of problems around the &lt;br/&gt;existence of vector bundles of low rank on projective spaces. His activity&lt;br/&gt;will also include the development of fundamental algorithms in computational&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry and their implementation in the Macaulay2 package &lt;br/&gt;written by Grayson and Stilllman. By far the largest portion of the project&lt;br/&gt;budget is devoted to the support of graduate students. This and the computational&lt;br/&gt;tools produced by the project will broaden its impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry deals with geometric forms defined by&lt;br/&gt;simple equations (polynomials). The subject is central in mathematics&lt;br/&gt;because these forms include the fundamental examples in most disciplines&lt;br/&gt;of mathhematics; and it is important in the applications of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;because these forms provide the models most often used in representing&lt;br/&gt;nature in equations or in the computer. Over the last 150 years the group of&lt;br/&gt;techniques called commutative algebra has been developed to study and unify this&lt;br/&gt;and problems arising in number theory. Much more recently it was realized that&lt;br/&gt;an extension of commutative algebra into the noncommutative domain of&lt;br/&gt;exterior algebras gives a fruitful new approach to some old problems in this&lt;br/&gt;field. Independently, computers and algorithms became powerful enough to &lt;br/&gt;help research in algebraic geometry. Eisenbud's proposed work has to do&lt;br/&gt;with some of the most classical problems in algebraic geometry as well&lt;br/&gt;as with new uses of exterior algebra and computation in this domain, and&lt;br/&gt;he will also continue his work developing computational tools for others&lt;br/&gt;to use. The largest part of his grant will be devoted to the support&lt;br/&gt;of graduate students, whom he will train in these techniques and methods.</AbstractNarration>
