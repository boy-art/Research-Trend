    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204681&lt;br/&gt;Michael Hutchings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the development and application of new&lt;br/&gt;enumerative invariants in low-dimensional, symplectic, and contact&lt;br/&gt;topology. There are two main goals. The first is to develop and&lt;br/&gt;compute ``periodic Floer homology'', a theory defined for an&lt;br/&gt;area-preserving surface diffeomorphism, which counts periodic orbits&lt;br/&gt;together with embedded pseudoholomorphic curves in R cross the mapping&lt;br/&gt;torus. This theory is conjectured to agree with the Seiberg-Witten&lt;br/&gt;Floer homology of the mapping torus, thus giving a link between low&lt;br/&gt;dimensional topology and surface dynamics. Also, an analogue of&lt;br/&gt;periodic Floer homology for three-dimensional contact manifolds should&lt;br/&gt;have applications to the topology of overtwisted contact structures&lt;br/&gt;and smooth four-manifolds. The second main goal is to develop and&lt;br/&gt;compute invariants of families of equivalent objects in different&lt;br/&gt;versions of Floer theory. These give topological invariants of&lt;br/&gt;families of symplectomorphisms, three-manifolds, Legendrian knots, and&lt;br/&gt;any other type of object for which a version of Floer theory can be&lt;br/&gt;defined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project fits into the broad theme of developing tools to&lt;br/&gt;understand the possible global shapes of three and four dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces. For example the universe we live in is a four dimensional&lt;br/&gt;space if one includes time, and its global structure is not known.&lt;br/&gt;The tools used here to understand the shape of a space involve&lt;br/&gt;counting interesting geometric objects inside the space. An important&lt;br/&gt;class of such objects are pseudoholomorphic curves, which are surfaces&lt;br/&gt;resembling soap films. By counting the number of such surfaces with&lt;br/&gt;appropriate constraints that exist in a space, one can gain&lt;br/&gt;information about the global structure of the space.</AbstractNarration>
