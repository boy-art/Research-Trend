    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is to plan for an I/UCRC that aims to promote a research program of interest to both industry and universities on telecommunications circuits and systems, by joining with the currently established I/UCRC at Arizona State University. This proposed multi-university center will be able to have a broad impact on the telecommunications industry by using the joint resources of the multiuniversity faculties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center's goal is to focus on simplifying and advancing communications systems by identifying new circuits and new circuit-design techniques as well as new methods in systems design and information technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All research would be carried out within the multiuniversity center with its own resoueres aas well as those of the existing I/UCRC at Arizona State Universaity. The overall aim of this collaborator as well as the existing Center is to build partnerships between industry and academe through conducting appropriate research while transferring technology both ways to the benefit of both parties.</AbstractNarration>
