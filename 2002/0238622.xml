    <AbstractNarration>This is a CAREER project to investigate hybrid acoustic-infrared NDE imaging mechanisms. The proposed integrated application of infrared (IR) sensing and imaging with pulsed sonic/ultrasonic excitation represents a novel concept. Acoustic wave propagation within materials causes microscopic particle motions, including in the vicinity of defects. An IR camera records the surface temperature distribution above the crack, resulting from the heat flow. Fundamental issues related to this techniques will be studied and optimization of the parameters for the technology will be sought. This will include: mechanisms for heat generation, relative effects of different sound modes, and relative importance of friction and elastic hysteresis, repetitive bond formation and breaking, and other nonlinear effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will contribute to the establishment of a novel NDE technology and provide crossing-cutting impact through practical applications in aerospace, automotive, power and semiconductor industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several industrial institutions and two national labs are involved in this research, and an ambitious plan for education including out-reach to minority students is an integral part of this project.</AbstractNarration>
