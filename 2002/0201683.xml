    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT for DMS 0201683&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns problems at the juncture of geometry, topology, and&lt;br/&gt;physics. The mathematical challenge we address is :(i) to provide a&lt;br/&gt;rigorous framework for functional integrals in geometrical quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theories, and (ii) to use the rigorous framework to prove results&lt;br/&gt;which may be conjectured in the heuristic/informal setting suggested by&lt;br/&gt;physics. Specifically, we will be concerned with : (a) quantum Yang-Mills&lt;br/&gt;gauge theory over surfaces, (b) a three dimensional Chern-Simons gauge&lt;br/&gt;theory, and (c) other functional integrals arising from&lt;br/&gt;geometrical/topological quantum theories. The goal will be to give&lt;br/&gt;rigorous foundations to the mathematical expressions and objects which&lt;br/&gt;arise in these theories and then to use them to further develop&lt;br/&gt;mathematical ideas and solve specific problems. The mathematics involved&lt;br/&gt;includes geometry and topology connected with fiber bundles and Lie&lt;br/&gt;groups, as well as stochastic analysis and infinite-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;integration. Stochastic analysis has often been applied in the study of&lt;br/&gt;the geometry of manifolds. The present proposal addresses situations&lt;br/&gt;which promise deeper applications of stochastic analysis in settings&lt;br/&gt;enriched by geometry and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program will bring together geometry and topology with&lt;br/&gt;stochastic analysis to provide solid mathematical foundations for certain&lt;br/&gt;computations done in physics, solve certain specific problems and develop&lt;br/&gt;new mathematical ideas arising from quantum physics. The physics is quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theory, which describes the quantum behavior of forces that govern&lt;br/&gt;the interaction between elementary particles in nature such as those which&lt;br/&gt;make up protons and neutrons. This project is concerned with development&lt;br/&gt;of fundamental mathematics connected with an area of physics. There may&lt;br/&gt;be potential applications to surface physics and other phenomena involving&lt;br/&gt;geometry and stochastics, but this project itself is devoted primarily to&lt;br/&gt;foundations rather than application. History shows that mathematics&lt;br/&gt;arising through an investigation of fundamental notions associated to one&lt;br/&gt;particular context later finds application in areas far removed from the&lt;br/&gt;original context, this being an essential aspect of the centrality of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics to applied sciences.</AbstractNarration>
