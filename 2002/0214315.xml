    <AbstractNarration>This Doctoral Dissertation addresses the issue of party longevity (in government) in parliamentary democracies. Some political parties come into power and control government for less than a month, while others maintain power for decades. This project conducts cross-national quantitative analyses of party government duration and change in eighteen parliamentary democracies over fifty years. It examines party government in Japan, Norway, and Sweden more closely to better understand factors that may be imperfectly captured in the cross-national quantitative data. NSF support will be used to go to Japan, collect and code the necessary data and conduct elite interviews and archival work for further evidence on party government duration and change in Japan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The duration of party government has significant implications for policymaking and governance, for the very nature of democracy, yet it has not been rigorously studied -only cabinet duration has been carefully examined. This project uses a theoretic framework based on understanding party government as an equilibrium outcome of the strategic interaction among political actors. Party government duration is a function of the stability of the equilibrium and changes in the preferences and beliefs of parties, parliamentarians and voters. Hypotheses derived from a model of party government and the existing literature on parliamentary democracies, electoral systems, and voting behavior are tested using cross-national quantitative analyses and more in- depth case studies of three countries. Both existing data and newly collected and operationalized variables will be included in the analyses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissertation research made possible by this grant allows the co-Principal Investigator to collect and code data on party government in Japan in a manner that is standardized with other large cross-national databases of parliamentary democracies. The data collected will be made publicly available and will be useful for scholarship of Japanese politics that seeks to compare Japan to other parliamentary democracies as well as for cross-national quantitative scholarship on parliamentary and coalition government. The research helps promote the study of Japanese politics in the context of broader comparative study of parliamentary democracies and helps develop a better understanding the nature of democracy in parliamentary democracies and the dynamics of party government and political party systems.</AbstractNarration>
