    <AbstractNarration>A four day workshop in Algebraic Geometry is planned, focusing on the&lt;br/&gt;training of graduate students and junior faculty. The format will&lt;br/&gt;emphasize participants working together in small groups led by&lt;br/&gt;mentors. The workshop is designed to engage students and junior&lt;br/&gt;faculty in related areas of algebraic geometry focusing on stacks and&lt;br/&gt;perhaps including computational algebraic geometry. The working&lt;br/&gt;groups will organize around problems and topics within these&lt;br/&gt;subfields. Senior faculty will give plenary lectures to set the&lt;br/&gt;general direction. The expected composition of the workshop is&lt;br/&gt;approximately 60 graduate students, 15 junior faculty, and 8 senior&lt;br/&gt;faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is the study of the relationship between algebraic&lt;br/&gt;properties of polynomial equations and the geometry of their solution&lt;br/&gt;sets. During the past century, algebraic geometry has been applied&lt;br/&gt;repeatedly to a wide range of areas of study in pure algebra and pure&lt;br/&gt;geometry. More recently applications have emerged in theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics, cryptography, and engineering. The workshop is designed to&lt;br/&gt;complement other forms of training received by junior algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometers, providing them the experience of actively doing research&lt;br/&gt;with their peers and mentors.</AbstractNarration>
