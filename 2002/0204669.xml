    <AbstractNarration>0204669&lt;br/&gt;Duncan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major focus of this research is the application of a stochastic &lt;br/&gt;calculus for a fractional Brownian motion to stochastic systems, &lt;br/&gt;especially for the problems of identification and control. The &lt;br/&gt;importance of a fractional Brownian motion in stochastic models &lt;br/&gt;has been exhibited in a wide variety of applications, such as, &lt;br/&gt;hydrology, economics and telecommunications. One goal of the &lt;br/&gt;research is to develop further a stochastic calculus for a fractional &lt;br/&gt;Brownian motion similar to the way that the stochastic calculus for &lt;br/&gt;Brownian motion was developed to provide the tools for solving &lt;br/&gt;problems of stochastic systems with a fractional Brownian motion. &lt;br/&gt;Some tools of stochastic calculus that are planned for development &lt;br/&gt;are necessary for solving the problems of identification, filtering &lt;br/&gt;and control of a stochastic system with a fractional Brownian &lt;br/&gt;motion. The fractional Brownian motions for study include &lt;br/&gt;processes with values in both finite and infinite dimensional &lt;br/&gt;spaces. The study includes the existence and the uniqueness of &lt;br/&gt;solutions of stochastic differential equations and stochastic partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations with a fractional Brownian motion and &lt;br/&gt;martingales that are formed from a fractional Brownian motion. &lt;br/&gt;Another family of stochastic models that are planned for study is &lt;br/&gt;hidden Markov models. An investigation of adaptive control for &lt;br/&gt;systems described by both fractional Brownian motions and hidden &lt;br/&gt;Markov models is planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on a stochastic calculus for a fractional &lt;br/&gt;Brownian motion. A fractional Brownian motion is a stochastic &lt;br/&gt;process that has been important in modeling physical systems such &lt;br/&gt;as those arising in hydrology, economics and telecommunications. &lt;br/&gt;Stochastic calculus provides the basic tool for solving problems of &lt;br/&gt;stochastic models that contain a fractional Brownian motion. &lt;br/&gt;Fractional Brownian motions have a self similarity property and &lt;br/&gt;many have a long range dependence property that often occur in &lt;br/&gt;physical phenomena. It is planned to study the control of partially &lt;br/&gt;known systems that contain fractional Brownian motion and &lt;br/&gt;hidden Markov models. Such control problems naturally arise in &lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>
