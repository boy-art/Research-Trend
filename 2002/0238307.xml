    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses fundamental materials science issues relevant to potential utilization of organic semiconductors in thin film electronics. In addition to structural factors, such as defect density and domain boundaries, charge carrier mobility is the primary figure of merit in these ma-terials, and is ultimately determined by the electronic band structure and carrier localization dy-namics. The central scheme of this proposal is to use femtosecond two-photon photoemission spectroscopy (2PPE) to establish electronic band structure and electron localization dynamics in organic semiconductor crystals, thin films, and at their interfaces with metals, and to probe struc-ture-property relationship in these systems.&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues associated with organic electronic materials having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education. This project will support graduate, un-dergraduate, and post-doctoral researchers providing training in an exciting and interdisciplinary field spanning materials science, chemistry, solid-state physics, and laser spectroscopy. Addi-tionally, the academic and industrial collaborative nature of the project provides special opportu-nities for students.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
