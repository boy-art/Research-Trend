    <AbstractNarration>0201861&lt;br/&gt;Wyatt&lt;br/&gt;This research project is to develop and test a prototype prosthetic device for restoring some useful vision to blind humans who have retinal disease. The investigators will apply their microfabrication and surgical expertise to the development of a prosthesis, which can be successfully implanted for a period of months or years without affecting the delicate surrounding tissue in the eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wireless, inflatable prosthesis is to receive its power from outside the body by radio frequency transmission. A new form of low-power circuitry is to be developed for the implant to reduce heating effects in the eye. This thin silicon circuit, integral to the implant, will transmit simple patterns to an array of stimulating electrodes located on flexible, spider-like 'arms' which are to be folded-up for insertion through a small incision in the eye. Once inside the eye they can then be inflated for attachment to a larger area of retina. A parallel effort will develop encapsulation technology to protect these implants from bodily fluids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) under the terms of a Letter of Agreement of April 19, 2002. The research will be conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Cornell University Nanofabrication Facility. Testing of the various versions of the prototype implant is to be done at MIT and the DVA Center for Innovative Visual Rehabilitation in the DVA Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.</AbstractNarration>
