    <AbstractNarration>Exhumation in the northern California Coast Ranges, and orogens in general, results from&lt;br/&gt;the interplay of geodynamic processes that drive uplift and surface processes that respond to the&lt;br/&gt;rates and patterns of uplift. A variety of approaches have been used to determine patterns of&lt;br/&gt;exhumation, but placing robust, quantifiable constraints on these estimates is difficult because of&lt;br/&gt;the feedbacks and linkages among large scale geodynamic, thermal, and landscape evolution&lt;br/&gt;processes. There is a critical need for a technique to constrain the trajectory of rocks at shallow-&lt;br/&gt;crustal (low-temperature) levels to constrain uplift and exhumation in active orogenic belts. Most&lt;br/&gt;recently, (U-Th)/He thermochronometry has been identified as a potential tool to help&lt;br/&gt;quantitatively constrain exhumation and uplift. The (U-Th)/He system has the advantage of a low&lt;br/&gt;closure temperature (~ 60-70 C for apatite) and thus in principal it records the last few&lt;br/&gt;kilometers of unroofing. As a low-T thermochronometer the same characteristics that make (U-&lt;br/&gt;Th)/He so appealing for geomorphic studies also raise questions about its utility in regions of&lt;br/&gt;complex thermal and/or tectonic histories. It is uncertain whether this tool can extract meaningful&lt;br/&gt;information from a complex signal that incorporates both the exhumation history and the&lt;br/&gt;inevitable thermal feedbacks driven by that exhumation. In this project we will apply (U-Th)/He&lt;br/&gt;thermochronometry coupled with landscape evolution, thermal and geodynamic modeling, to&lt;br/&gt;evaluate if (U-Th)/He dating can be confidently applied in regions of active tectonism that are not&lt;br/&gt;in thermal or geomorphic steady-state.</AbstractNarration>
