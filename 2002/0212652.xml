    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Merrill Peterson, Western Washington&lt;br/&gt;University, to study the evolution of premating barriers between two&lt;br/&gt;hybridizing beetle species. The research combines lab and field studies to&lt;br/&gt;determine the costs of hybridizing across a 75km-wide zone of&lt;br/&gt;hybridization. In measuring these costs, the research will take into&lt;br/&gt;account the degree to which multiply-mating females preferentially use&lt;br/&gt;sperm from same-species males, and measure material benefits females may&lt;br/&gt;gain from hybrid matings. This study will also determine the balance&lt;br/&gt;between selection against hybridization and the rate of genetic exchange&lt;br/&gt;with populations outside of the zone of hybridization, a process that will&lt;br/&gt;tend to counter the effects of selection.&lt;br/&gt; This research program will address long-standing questions&lt;br/&gt;regarding the evolution of reproductive barriers between species, using a&lt;br/&gt;novel geographic perspective. In so doing, it will provide answers to&lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions in speciation research. The grant will also support&lt;br/&gt;the training and mentorship of underrepresented undergraduates through a&lt;br/&gt;summer internship program, Minority Opportunities for Research on Evolution&lt;br/&gt;(MORE). Participants in MORE will get hands-on experience and training for&lt;br/&gt;careers in biological research.</AbstractNarration>
