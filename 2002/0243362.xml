    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Conference on Water Purification and Reuse, in Potsdam, Germany, June 9-13, 2003&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-02043362&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Ralph Yang&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide travel grant awards to U.S. speakers, authors of&lt;br/&gt;papers, and young academic participants to the Conference on Water Purification and Reuse, to be held in Potsdam, Germany, on June 9-13, 2003. The purpose of the Conference is to discuss the latest advancements of the important technologies for purifying industrial and municipal wastewater for reuse and the latest developments of process design and integration methods for water treatment. The researchers in the water purification field have diverse background, mainly in chemical engineering, chemistry, civil engineering, and environmental engineering. It is important to provide a needed forum through this conference to bring researchers with different backgrounds and from different countries together for disseminating and exchanging the latest scientific information. It will provide an opportunity for developing international collaboration for solving the global problem of water purification and reuse. Moreover, plans are being made to publish a proceeding in the form of a book for dissemination of the state-of-the-art information on water purification and reuse. The proposed budget will provide for 15-20 partial travel grant awards to U.S. speakers, authors of papers, and young academic participants at the Conference.</AbstractNarration>
