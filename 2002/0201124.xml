    <AbstractNarration>The subject of the proposal is to understand the underlying physics of the standard model of particle physics, which unifies the strong and electro-weak forces but treats the gravitational force separately leading to a hierarchy of scales. to treat the forces from a more unified perspective we will look at the implications of formulating the laws of physics in higher dimensions and try to understand the implications of how the low energy theory contrains and leads insight into the higher dimensional theory and how the higher dimensional theory yeileds new ways of looking at field theory and cosmology in the more familiear three-space and one time dimensional universe we are familiear with. the hope is to have a better understanding of the hierarch of energy scales as well as cosmology from the study of geometries in extra diementions and the existence of extended objects (branes) in these higher dimensional spaces and their relevance to the universe we live in.</AbstractNarration>
