    <AbstractNarration>Gravitational aspects of string theory, a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, will be investigated by Horowitz. Einstein's general theory of relativity predicts that singularities are inevitably formed in gravitational collapse. When this occurs, general relativity breaks down. String theory will be used to search for the quantum description of the singularities inside black holes and at the big bang using string theory. Related questions that will also be investigated include properties of black holes in higher dimensions, and cosmic censorship -- the possibility of forming singularities not hidden inside event horizons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principles which determine the quantum state of the universe and the generalizations of quantum mechanics needed to understand it with special emphasis on Hawking's no-boundary quantum state will be investigated by Hartle. The origin of the predictable quasiclassical realm of every day experience in a universe governed generally by quantum uncertainty will also be &lt;br/&gt;investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will integrate research and teaching by hands on training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the knowledge and techniques that are central to understanding and discovery in gravitational physics. Questions such as the nature of space and time, the origin of the universe, and the nature of matter are of great interest to a wide audience. Through a range of forums from public lectures, to participation in programs for high school science teachers, to informing media reporters, the authors have disseminated the directions and results of current research to this broader audience. By being alert to appropriate opportunities we expect to continue this effort in the future. Society at large will benefit by increasing awareness of central problems in science.</AbstractNarration>
