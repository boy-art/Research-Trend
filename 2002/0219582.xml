    <AbstractNarration>Data storage systems represent one of the pillars supporting&lt;br/&gt;the modern information age. Advances in computing and communication&lt;br/&gt;technologies, and the networks that incorporate them, have increased&lt;br/&gt;the demand for high capacity data storage devices in applications&lt;br/&gt;ranging from biological research (e.g., the visualization and analysis&lt;br/&gt;of massive multimedia data-sets) to consumer electronics (e.g., the&lt;br/&gt;storage of high-resolution image, audio, and video data in digital cameras).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses&lt;br/&gt;analytic and numerical methods for determining the information-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;limits on achievable storage densities and data transfer rates in&lt;br/&gt;recording channels. It also develops and evaluates modulation, coding,&lt;br/&gt;and signal processing techniques that can approach or achieve these limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research considers both one-dimensional channel models applicable&lt;br/&gt;to "track-oriented" storage devices, such as disks and tapes, as well as&lt;br/&gt;higher-dimensional models relevant to exploratory page-oriented and&lt;br/&gt;volumetric storage technologies, such as holographic recording and&lt;br/&gt;thermomechanical recording based upon atomic force microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, new information-theoretic and algorithmic methods are&lt;br/&gt;being used to study lower and upper bounds on the capacity of recording&lt;br/&gt;channels, using analytical and empirically-based models for both longitudinal&lt;br/&gt;and perpendicular recording systems. Bounds on the information rates of&lt;br/&gt;channels in two and higher dimensions are also being developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve performance approaching the theoretical limits, new&lt;br/&gt;signal processing and coding methods are required. In the area&lt;br/&gt;of constrained modulation coding, the project is exploring the analysis&lt;br/&gt;and design of one-dimensional constrained codes that more efficiently&lt;br/&gt;combine the functions of modulation and error-correction. The nascent&lt;br/&gt;theory of constrained coding in two and higher dimensions is also being&lt;br/&gt;investigated, with a focus on fundamental problems, such as representation&lt;br/&gt;of multi-dimensional constrained systems, determination of constraint&lt;br/&gt;capacity, and efficient encoding and decoding algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Channel coding techniques based upon concatenation architectures,&lt;br/&gt;graphical code models, and iterative decoding have been shown to effectively&lt;br/&gt;achieve capacity on certain memoryless channels. The channel coding&lt;br/&gt;component of this project addresses theoretical and algorithmic problems&lt;br/&gt;associated with the application of these new and powerful coding concepts&lt;br/&gt;to data storage channels. In particular, the research considers the design&lt;br/&gt;and performance analysis of turbo-like and low-density parity-check codes&lt;br/&gt;for channels with intersymbol-interference, the trade-offs between latency&lt;br/&gt;and complexity in message-passing decoder architectures, and new approaches&lt;br/&gt;to combining coding, equalization, and detection that can more closely&lt;br/&gt;approach the recording channel capacity. The project also addresses&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems of channel coding and detection in two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;recording systems.</AbstractNarration>
