    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0203926.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to study analytic and geometric aspects of &lt;br/&gt;Hamilton's Ricci flow of Riemannian metrics, and related topics. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator proposes to investigate injectivity radius estimates &lt;br/&gt;for solutions to the Ricci flow. The PI proposes to study&lt;br/&gt;Li-Yau-Hamilton (Harnack) inequalities for both the Ricci flow and the &lt;br/&gt;linearized Ricci flow. The PI also proposes to study collapsing sequences of solutions &lt;br/&gt;to the Ricci flow and the related compactness theory. Finally, the PI proposes to &lt;br/&gt;study estimates for the linearized Ricci flow and&lt;br/&gt;their applications. The PI will focus on dimension 3, where there are the &lt;br/&gt;most tools available and the problems posed have the most topological applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ricci flow is an evolution equation which deforms geometric structures &lt;br/&gt;on surfaces and manifolds both improving and smoothing out the structures. &lt;br/&gt;It has been at the cutting edge of the recent rapid progress in geometric &lt;br/&gt;evolution equations and has greatly influenced the study of the mean curvature&lt;br/&gt;flow and many other geometric evolution equations. The work on &lt;br/&gt;understanding the singularities which develop under the flow has led to the development &lt;br/&gt;of new and powerful analytic and geometric tools, which have found applications in the&lt;br/&gt;study of many geometric evolution equations. Many phenomena are&lt;br/&gt;modeled by geometric evolution equations, such as heat transfer, the &lt;br/&gt;evolution of interfaces between molten and solid metal, and the interfaces between ice &lt;br/&gt;and water. Geometric evolution equations are also used to smooth out images and &lt;br/&gt;have applications in computer vision.</AbstractNarration>
