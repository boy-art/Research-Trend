    <AbstractNarration>Mark Schell of Southern Methodist University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study the electrochemical oxidation of oxygenated organics, using experimental and theoretical approaches to explore these processes and the nonlinear behavior that they exhibit. Most of the effort will focus on formic acid oxidation. Objectives are to characterize the different ways that anions affect the oxidation process, to find the origin of these effects, and to investigate whether these effects can be used to probe electrochemical mechanisms. Substantial new understanding is expected to be gained by studying anion interactions with surrounding stationary and transient neighbors. Research outcomes are expected to enhance the understanding of oxidation reactions that are important in fuel cell applications. This project will provide valuable introductory research opportunities to undergraduate students in both theoretical and experimental chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The electrocatalyzed oxidations of oxygenated organic compounds are important because of their applications in fuel cells. It is a goal of many academic and industrial researchers to improve the viability of commercial ambient methanol-air fuel cells to replace conventional fossil fuel sources. This goal is important because greenhouse gases are increasing in the environment, and as well because future fossil fuel energy shortages are probable. A practical objective of this research is to enhance methanol oxidation by methods similar to those used to enhance formic acid oxidation. Enhancing methanol oxidation translates into more efficient fuel cells.</AbstractNarration>
