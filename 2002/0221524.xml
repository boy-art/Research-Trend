    <AbstractNarration>Biology has become an information science, fueled by high throughput genomic sequencing and functional genomics analyses. However, although many biological data resources are available, there is little ability to interoperate and existing software and tools are reinvented. A set of data models and supporting software libraries will be developed that support database interoperation. This effort will occur in collaboration with other systems in development. Resources developed under the NSF Plan Genome Research Program will be the resource targets. The approach is to define XML-based descriptions for types of object that are likely targets for inter-database queries. The effort will be in the context of a series of workshop that will enable the community to identify the target data objects and to cooperate in the implementation of software. The project will provide electronic resources for a wide variety of data that will enhance both research and education and training.</AbstractNarration>
