    <AbstractNarration>Neuropeptide Modulation of a Vocal Motor Pathway&lt;br/&gt;Sunny K. Boyd, Principal Investigator&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0235903&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term objective of this research program is to identify the interactions among chemical messengers that control behaviors. Peptide and steroid hormones regulate social behaviors in representative species from all vertebrate classes. The mechanisms of action of these compounds and the site in the brain where they act on specific behaviors are poorly understood. The interaction of testicular steroids and the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin will be investigated in the vertebrate brainstem. Three experimental approaches will be used to assess the importance of these interactions in generation of vocalizations, which are a critical component of social behavior in many species. First, neuropeptide effects on the brainstem will be tested by analyzing vocalizations prior to, and following, neuropeptide administration. Second, whether the necessary anatomical conditions are met at a cellular level will be determined with tract-tracing and peptide or receptor double-labeling. Third, this project will determine whether peptide receptors in the brainstem are functional with receptor binding and electrophysiological recording techniques. Neuropeptides alter a variety of vertebrate behaviors, including parental, aggressive, and reproductive behaviors. However, little is known about the effects of these peptides at the motor output level. Findings from this research program will thus offer insight into conserved mechanisms for peptide control of behavior. These studies will provide excellent training for undergraduate and graduate students who will acquire skills at the organismal, tissue, cellular, and molecular levels. These projects will also train high school science teachers and minority undergraduates via two institutional programs.</AbstractNarration>
