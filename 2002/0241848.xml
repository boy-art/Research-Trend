    <AbstractNarration>SES-0241848&lt;br/&gt;Gordon F. De Jong&lt;br/&gt;Deborah J. Graefe, &lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study examines whether devolution of welfare policy in the 1996 welfare reform legislation created new state benefits and rules inequalities that engender inter- and intra-state migration among distinct groups of welfare poor families, specifically African American and white single mothers and immigrant families. This study uses data from three sources-- the 2001-2004 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the Urban Institute's Welfare Rules Database and a local labor market characteristics file created from 2003 American Community Survey census data. These databases will be merged to create a longitudinal, two-stage specification of welfare-benefit "push" and "pull" impacts on poor immigrant and single-mother-headed families' migration behavior. Using a state welfare policy inequality framework, the investigators will use factor analysis to develop measures from post-2000 textual policy manuals to operationalize multiple welfare benefit and eligibility rule dimensions and to test hypothesized state program effects on migration. A discrete-time event history analysis will be used to predict migration events (inter- and intra-state migration) in the SIPP data. The investigations will use a multi-level hierarchical modeling strategy, which is an integrated, and previously untested, micro-macro analysis of three determinant-of-migration hypotheses for welfare poor families. These tests evaluate effects of 1) time-varying state welfare policy characteristics; 2) individual and family characteristics, including fixed-time immigrant and marital status and race, from the information-rich SIPP files, and 3) local labor market-level economic opportunity structure indicators. Similar to previous studies, a separate analysis of push and pull migration effects of hypothesized co-variates will be completed first through, a "destination model" for identifying pull effects, and then, a "departure model" which identifies push effects for potential migrants' origin locations grouped by class of states according to state policy criteria. This two-stage model with state welfare policy, local labor market, and individual and household indicators will provide a strong test of the welfare policy impact on migration.</AbstractNarration>
