    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to John J. Marchalonis, Ph.D. for studies on &lt;br/&gt;"Primitive Antibodies". This project addresses the molecular basis of &lt;br/&gt;diversification of the recognition molecules that are essential for the &lt;br/&gt;generation of specific immunity. The project focuses upon the immune system &lt;br/&gt;of sharks because these are the most primitive vertebrates to share with &lt;br/&gt;humans the combinatorial immune response. This is based uniquely upon the &lt;br/&gt;recombination of gene segments to generate the variability in antigen &lt;br/&gt;receptor molecules present in serum and on blood cells. Sharks, which arose &lt;br/&gt;approximately 450 million years ago, like humans have immunoglobulins (also &lt;br/&gt;termed antibodies), T-cell receptors (TCRs), major histocompatability &lt;br/&gt;antigens (MHC), and recombination activating genes (RAGs) that are required &lt;br/&gt;to allow rearrangement of the gene segments making up the antibodies and &lt;br/&gt;T-cell receptors. The project will address both conserved and unique &lt;br/&gt;features of the combinatorial system of carcharhine sharks to elucidate the &lt;br/&gt;molecular underpinning of combinatorial immunity as it is expressed in all &lt;br/&gt;vertebrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes three major areas of focus: The first is the complete &lt;br/&gt;characterization of the shark RAG locus with emphasis upon its evolutionary &lt;br/&gt;emergence and functional similarities and differences to the molecular &lt;br/&gt;homologs found in mammals and other higher vertebrates. The second major &lt;br/&gt;area of concentration is the characterization of the genes specifying the &lt;br/&gt;alpha/beta and gamma/delta T-cell receptors of carcharhine sharks including &lt;br/&gt;their diversity and gene organization, and the construction of recombinant &lt;br/&gt;single chain TCRs for functional and structural analyses. Because of the &lt;br/&gt;pronounced differences in organization of shark and mammalian antibody gene &lt;br/&gt;segments, it is crucial to determine the arrangement of shark TCR genes. &lt;br/&gt;The third aim tests the generality of clonal selection theory by &lt;br/&gt;determining whether sharks which have a cassette organization of antibody &lt;br/&gt;gene as opposed to translocons of higher vertebrates show clonal &lt;br/&gt;restriction in their antibody forming lymphocytes. These studies are &lt;br/&gt;directed towards applying molecular and protein chemical technologies to &lt;br/&gt;obtain precise answers to fundamental problems of the system as it obtains &lt;br/&gt;in all vertebrates, with implications for defense against invading &lt;br/&gt;pathogens, cancers and immunological dysfunction in autoimmunity.</AbstractNarration>
