    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0203932&lt;br/&gt;Gortler, Steven&lt;br/&gt;Harvard University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Image based rendering is a promising area of innovation in computer graphics. In image based rendering,&lt;br/&gt;one starts with an input set of images or a video sequence. One then applies some degree of processing&lt;br/&gt;to this data to obtain an intermediate representation. This intermediate representation is then used in an&lt;br/&gt;interactive computer graphics setting. These interactive uses include but are not limited to: viewing the&lt;br/&gt;scene from novel points of view that were not available in the input sequence, relighting the scene using&lt;br/&gt;virtual lights that were not available in the input sequence, and geometrically manipulating the objects that&lt;br/&gt;make up the scene. This functionality greatly enlarges the uses of digital photographs, and introduces a rich&lt;br/&gt;source of content for use in interactive computer graphics.&lt;br/&gt;For image based rendering, we plan to focus on lumigraph representations, which are a sampled repre-sentation of the light that travels along the rays in the scene. In particular, the visual information of a static scene is represented by the five dimensional radiance function. This function describes the intensity and color of light for every 2D direction at every 3D spatial position (x; y; z). If we consider only the&lt;br/&gt;subset of light leaving the convex hull bounded object (or equivalently entering a bounded empty region of&lt;br/&gt;space), the fact that radiance along any ray remains constant 1 allows us to reduce the domain of interest of&lt;br/&gt;the radiance function from five to four dimensions.</AbstractNarration>
