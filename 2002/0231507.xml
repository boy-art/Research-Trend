    <AbstractNarration>This "proof of concept" project is developing a computer-animated, pedagogically-based, interactive learning prototype called "Integrative Metabolism". The purpose of this prototype is to enhance student exposure to and understanding of metabolism at two- and four-year undergraduate institutions comprised of diverse male and female students. By integrating nutrition, physiology and biochemistry, the prototype overcomes barriers to student engagement and understanding of metabolism. Two objectives are: (1) to produce a prototype that will allow self-paced learning of science terms and engage the user by framing nutrition, physiology, and biochemistry within everyday lifestyle choices, and (2) to overlay case-based, interactive learning onto the prototype to promote effective learning. Female and male students and faculty from a 2- and 4-year school are collaborating to technically enrich and pedagogically enhance a sample of this prototype developed this past year. Using a case-based and learner-centered design, students explore metabolism at the whole body, organ, cellular and enzyme levels. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its ability to demystify metabolism and engage students in risk-free, engaging and interactive learning. The broader impact resulting from this project is an infusion of enthusiasm and understanding of metabolism to our youth that could influence not only their choice of careers, but also their health. Results from this "proof of concept" project will serve as a basis for full development and a commercial publisher.</AbstractNarration>
