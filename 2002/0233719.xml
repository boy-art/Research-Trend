    <AbstractNarration>Costantino&lt;br/&gt;9981374&lt;br/&gt; Understanding the fluctuations in animal numbers is a&lt;br/&gt;central issue in population biology that has far-reaching impact&lt;br/&gt;on and implications for problems ranging from food production to&lt;br/&gt;the conservation of species. Nonlinear dynamics opens the way to&lt;br/&gt;a new phase of population research in which theory and&lt;br/&gt;experimentation focus on phenomena such as cycles and&lt;br/&gt;quasi-periodicity, chaos and strange attractors, multiple&lt;br/&gt;attractors and complicated basins of attraction, saddle sets and&lt;br/&gt;their stable manifolds, and so on. This interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;project, in which Robert Costantino, Jim Cushing, Brian Dennis,&lt;br/&gt;Robert Desharnais, and Shandelle Henson collaborate, covers a&lt;br/&gt;spectrum of activities essential to testing nonlinear population&lt;br/&gt;theory: the translation of the biology into the language of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and back again, the analysis of deterministic and&lt;br/&gt;stochastic models, the development and application of statistical&lt;br/&gt;techniques for the analysis of data, and the design and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of biological experiments. A series of experiments&lt;br/&gt;with flour beetles of the genus Tribolium provide rigorous&lt;br/&gt;experimental tests of nonlinear phenomena. Topics include&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearity in the context of stochasticity, chaos and&lt;br/&gt;population control, the impact of periodic environments on animal&lt;br/&gt;abundance, demographic dynamics and natural selection,&lt;br/&gt;nonequilibrium species interactions, and statistical questions&lt;br/&gt;concerning parameterization and validation of models.&lt;br/&gt; With a sound understanding of the underlying dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;animal populations, ecologists can anticipate the consequences of&lt;br/&gt;environmental degradation and learn better ways to manage natural&lt;br/&gt;populations and control populations of pests. For example, one of&lt;br/&gt;the experiments suggests that, by taking advantage of the&lt;br/&gt;"sensitivity to initial conditions" that is the hallmark of a&lt;br/&gt;chaotic system, managers can dramatically decrease pest&lt;br/&gt;population numbers without the use of chemical pesticides by&lt;br/&gt;making small perturbations at critical times. The marriage of&lt;br/&gt;ecological theory and experiments by the interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research team leads to new techniques for the application of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics to ecological problems. The project is supported by&lt;br/&gt;the Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, and&lt;br/&gt;Statistics programs in MPS and the Population Biology and Ecology&lt;br/&gt;programs in BIO.</AbstractNarration>
