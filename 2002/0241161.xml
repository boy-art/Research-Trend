    <AbstractNarration>0241161&lt;br/&gt;Doyle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Japan joint seminar on quantum correlation and coherence to be held in Hokkaido, Japan from September 12-18, 2003. The co-organizers are Professor John Doyle at Harvard University in Massachusetts and Professor Makoto Gonokami at Tokyo University in Japan. The meeting will bring together research scientists from the U.S. and Japan, two countries where important and exciting progress in the fields of quantum optics and atomic physics continues to strengthen our ability to observe and manipulate coherent quantum systems. Even though quantum mechanics is more than a century old, scientists are only just beginning to explore the fundamentals of quantum coherence. In addition to amplifying our understanding of fundamental issues of quantum coherence, these advances are opening exciting applications in the areas of atom optics and interferometry, precision measurements, non-linear optics, quantum measurement and quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field. This enables them to evaluate and attract the best physical scientists to participate. The seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve postdocs and graduate students as both participants and observers. The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects. Following the seminar the organizers plan to establish a workshop web page. Conference proceedings will be published on this web site.</AbstractNarration>
