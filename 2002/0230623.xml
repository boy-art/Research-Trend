    <AbstractNarration>Rice University engineering faculty, Texas Southern University education faculty, and Houston&lt;br/&gt;Independent School District teachers and administrators, propose Engineering Bridges, a&lt;br/&gt;planning project to develop a comprehensive program to systemically change science,&lt;br/&gt;technology, mathematics, and engineering instruction and culture in high-minority high schools&lt;br/&gt;in order to increase the number of underrepresented minority students excited and well-prepared&lt;br/&gt;to enter engineering university (STEM) majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For over thirty years our nation has attempted to increase participation of African American,&lt;br/&gt;Hispanic, and Native Americans in STEM fields. And even though there has been some growth&lt;br/&gt;in engineering degrees granted to those groups over the last twenty years, that growth has not&lt;br/&gt;kept up with those groups population growth in general. This program brings together a strong&lt;br/&gt;and varied collaborative to develop a systemic, coherent plan to tackle this problem in a systemic&lt;br/&gt;way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop a plan that will&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare underrepresented minority high school students so they will succeed with&lt;br/&gt;confidence and enthusiasm in university STEM courses;&lt;br/&gt;Inform, excite, and motivate underrepresented minority high school students towards&lt;br/&gt;engineering careers, and&lt;br/&gt;Increase underrepresented minority students admission into university engineering&lt;br/&gt;majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet these goals, the planning team will research and design engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Curriculum materials with appeal to students of underrepresented groups;&lt;br/&gt;. Career-driven professional development for teachers, principals, and counselors;&lt;br/&gt;. Content-driven professional development for science and mathematics teachers; and a&lt;br/&gt;. Multi-level (high school through university faculty/industrial worker) support&lt;br/&gt;community that provides academic support and personal and professional role models.</AbstractNarration>
