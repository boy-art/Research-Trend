    <AbstractNarration>Individual doctoral training programs in social psychology cannot span the broad range of concepts, content areas, and methodological skills that define the field. Even the very best graduate students tend to have significant gaps in what they know and what type of research they are prepared to do. To address the training needs of contemporary students of social psychology, the Society for Personality and Social Psychology has initiated a new Summer Institute in Social Psychology. The summer institutes provide graduate students and early-career professionals with two weeks of intensive instruction and supervision from senior social psychologists, and important opportunities for professional development and networking. The biennial summer institutes are staffed by leading researchers and modeled after the successful summer programs organized by the European Association of Experimental Social Psychology. The institutes are coordinated by an advisory committee appointed and overseen by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. This grant provides support for the first three summer institutes during the summers of 2003, 2005, and 2007.</AbstractNarration>
