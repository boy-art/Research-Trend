    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research and education plan is to broaden the participation of historically underserved groups in the information society by identifying cultural patterns, social networks and other socio-cultural factors that structure information technology access and use. The research approach will involve long-term partnerships and continuous interaction with the Belmont community in West Philadelphia, and will merge scholarship with ongoing programs in the community. Through reciprocal learning and sharing of expertise, researchers, university students, and community leaders will work together to identify the particular problems to be addressed, to define researchable questions, and to conduct research projects. Research findings and emergent theory will then be translated into culturally based, theory driven interventions aimed at increasing the technology capacity and sustainability of the community based organizations to better serve their clientele. The research results will also make broader scholarly contributions through the extension of midrange theory that explains the socio-cultural influences, differential impacts, and responses to information technology. In addition, the results will make practical contributions through the development of interventions such as educational opportunities and curricular resources, and recommendations for public policy and future research.</AbstractNarration>
