    <AbstractNarration>This award provides a three-year continuation of NSF support for the annual Summer Workshops on Economic Theory conducted each summer by the Stanford institute of Theoretical Economics.&lt;br/&gt;For more than 30 years, these workshops have attracted top scholars from around the world, giving them opportunities to present their research results as well as collaborate on new research. This collection of workshops brings together prominent scholars as well as younger economists for presentation and discussion of their research. A special effort is made to identify young economists who would benefit from attending these workshops, and give them extra help to make the trip. This outreach to newer members of the profession gives them opportunities to meet senior scholars as well as other young researchers in their fields. These workshops have been particularly effective in providing an atmosphere for scholars to learn from each other and engage in collaborative research on innovative topics in economic theory, mathematical economics, and related areas.</AbstractNarration>
