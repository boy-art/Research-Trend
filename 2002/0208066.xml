    <AbstractNarration>The Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh will conduct a longitudinal study in which researchers will create a three-year sequence of model-centered instruction in the context of the Model-Assisted Reasoning in Science (MARS). MARS current topics will be extended from sixth through eighth grades. The project seeks to: (1) understand how working external models support content and process learning, (2) develop an evaluation model to tap strengths and weaknesses of different kinds of external models, and (3) identify pedagogical strategies that elicit and support model-assisted reasoning. Student content knowledge and process skills will be measured through different test formats that include paper-and-pencil (TIMSS, NAEP, and Test of Scientific Reasoning items), written tests, class work, and classroom computer exercises. Student motivation will be measured at the beginning of each year. A small sample of students will be interviewed and given some transfer tasks twice a year. Interviews will focus on two aspects: properties of the different model types and student's metacognitive understanding of the function of models in science. Information on classroom implementation will be collected by direct observation, videotapes, and interviews with teachers. Results of the study are expected to help extend theories of model-based reasoning and its applicability in classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
