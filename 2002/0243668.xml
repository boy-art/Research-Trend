    <AbstractNarration>The Tufts University Department of Biology has a long-standing commitment to mentoring undergraduates in research, as well as a strong track record of highly productive interdisciplinary research collaborations. Science is an increasingly collaborative enterprise, requiring the combined expertise of researchers from diverse fields. Students thus require training not only in specific research skills within a discipline, but also need to learn how to build a successful collaboration. This REU Site provides a program that allows undergraduate students to undertake biological research as a collaborative enterprise. The goals of this summer program are: to increase students' proficiency in biological research and collaborative skills, to educate and inspire students toward future research careers, and to develop students' ability to effectively communicate scientific results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 10 week summer program entitled, "Integrative Approaches to Studying the Ecology of New England Organisms," will provide 10 students opportunities to work closely on one of eight collaborative, interdisciplinary projects combining faculty expertise in animal behavior, endocrinology, biochemistry, conservation biology, and plant ecology. The program is committed to provide research opportunities for undergraduates, including students traditionally underrepresented in science and those who might not have such opportunities at their home institutions (with an emphasis on local community college students). Students will work with two mentors, one serving as the primary mentor, to combine research techniques from different fields to design and conduct an independent project. In addition to research involvement, the program includes weekly discussions, seminars, field trips, and a student symposium.
