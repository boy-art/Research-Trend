    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 0244412&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Sheldon Katz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory has had a spectacular impact on many areas of&lt;br/&gt;modern mathematics, including algebraic geometry, differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry, topology, representation theory, analysis and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial geometry. In particular, string dualities suggest&lt;br/&gt;unexpected relations between these diverse areas, many of which&lt;br/&gt;have been proven mathematically. Recent advances in matrix model&lt;br/&gt;techniques suggest further relations in mathematics. It can now&lt;br/&gt;be expected that number theory will become related as well. It&lt;br/&gt;is proposed to investigate unifying themes in duality symmetries&lt;br/&gt;in search of a deeper understanding of these symmetries. It is&lt;br/&gt;also proposed to work on a range of mathematical problems which&lt;br/&gt;these dualities inspire. Particular dualities include mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry, originally elucidated in the context of Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory, and S-dualities, which are duality symmetries of&lt;br/&gt;supersymmetric gauge theories and string theories. More recently&lt;br/&gt;both have been related to Matrix integrals. In the case of&lt;br/&gt;supersymmetric gauge theories this gives a relation between&lt;br/&gt;perturbative Feynman diagrams on the one hand and certain&lt;br/&gt;computations on moduli spaces of instantons on the other, which&lt;br/&gt;the PIs propose to elucidate further. In the particular case of&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory, connections have been found with knot&lt;br/&gt;theory. This leads to a complete computation of the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding invariants for non-compact toric Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;threefolds. The PIs propose to extend these ideas to the compact&lt;br/&gt;case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will be exploiting existing connections and forging new&lt;br/&gt;ones between physics and mathematics to address a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;cutting-edge open problems in both fields. These ideas are&lt;br/&gt;expected to create new links between diverse areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, as certain ideas in physics are equivalent to&lt;br/&gt;important unsolved problems in mathematics. The techniques&lt;br/&gt;introduced into mathematics are expected to have a revolutionary&lt;br/&gt;influence on core areas of mathematics as related techniques have&lt;br/&gt;in the past. This project occurs at the same time as an ongoing&lt;br/&gt;effort by the string theory community and will help set future&lt;br/&gt;directions in that field. String theory seeks to unify the force&lt;br/&gt;of gravity with the electromagnetic and nuclear forces; this is&lt;br/&gt;the problem that eluded Einstein. It is anticipated that&lt;br/&gt;numerous diverse areas of mathematics will become related to each&lt;br/&gt;other in unexpected ways and that this will have profound&lt;br/&gt;consequences for mathematics and physics. Due to the broad scope&lt;br/&gt;of the project, a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional&lt;br/&gt;approach is indicated. The PIs will be bringing together their&lt;br/&gt;networks of collaborators, postdocs, and graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;directing an intense collaborative effort in these areas. An&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary math/physics curriculum will be created to&lt;br/&gt;train future leaders in areas at the interface of mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;physics. The PIs will expand their use of existing internet&lt;br/&gt;videoconferencing technologies for collaborative purposes, and&lt;br/&gt;will organize workshops on the topics of this project. This is a&lt;br/&gt;joint award of the Division of Mathematical Sciences programs in&lt;br/&gt;Geometric Analysis and Algebra, Number Theory, &amp; Combinatorics, and&lt;br/&gt;the Physics Division program in Mathematical Physics.</AbstractNarration>
