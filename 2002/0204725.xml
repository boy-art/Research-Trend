    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0204725. PI: Qiu-Dong Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal is mainly on the subject of non-uniformly&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic strange attractors. We propose to apply an abstract &lt;br/&gt;setting we previously formulated and studied to rigorously prove&lt;br/&gt;the existence of non-uniformly hyperbolic strange attractors&lt;br/&gt;in certain systems of ordinary differential equations, including a modified&lt;br/&gt;system of van der Pol and certain periodically excited systems experiencing&lt;br/&gt;Hopf bifurcations. We also propose to analytically establish the fact that&lt;br/&gt;non-uniformly hyperbolic strange attractors naturally arise when&lt;br/&gt;an asymptotically stable periodic solution of a given system&lt;br/&gt;of ordinary differential equations is periodically excited by generic&lt;br/&gt;external forcing. These non-uniformly hyperbolic strange attractors have &lt;br/&gt;properties that include most of standard mathematical notions associated&lt;br/&gt;with chaos: positive Liapunov exponents, positive entropy, SRB measure,&lt;br/&gt;exponential decay of correlation, nice symbolic coding of orbits etc.&lt;br/&gt;We also propose to study the geometric structure of the integral manifold&lt;br/&gt;of the spatial four-body problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal is mainly on the subject of non-uniformly hyperbolic &lt;br/&gt;strange attractors. In general an attractor is a state to which a system will &lt;br/&gt;eventually evolve. One of the most important way of studying systems in nature &lt;br/&gt;is to first model then study them as solutions of certain differential &lt;br/&gt;equations. We propose to apply a theory we previously developed &lt;br/&gt;to prove the existence of a class of strange attractors in some systems of &lt;br/&gt;differential equations arisen from various scientific disciplines including &lt;br/&gt;in the studies of turbulence, fluid mechanics and plasma mechanics. The &lt;br/&gt;attracting states we propose to study have very complicated dynamical &lt;br/&gt;properties and sophisticated geometric structures. They were observed in&lt;br/&gt;many numerical and laboratory experiments but their existence were rarely &lt;br/&gt;established mathematically in the past. We also propose to study the geometric&lt;br/&gt;structure of the integral manifold of the spatial four-body problem. This is a &lt;br/&gt;long standing mathematical problem with potential applications on orbit design&lt;br/&gt;for artificial celestial objects.</AbstractNarration>
