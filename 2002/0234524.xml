    <AbstractNarration>This research investigates scalable formal methods and their combinations as a way to reduce the gap between formal methods and software practice. These methods include domain-specific certification and runtime verification and monitoring. Important subthemes are: exploitation of domain-specific knowledge to derive efficient and scalable algorithms and decision procedures; strength through the combined use of several "lightweight" formal methods; multidimensional components to represent not only code, but also&lt;br/&gt;different views of the system from different perspectives; dependability metrics based on the notion of multidimensional component, so that increases in dependability along each dimension are aggregated into measurable overall dependability increases. Various prototypes are developed: safety policy certifier for units of measurement; coordinate frame safety certifier; optimality state estimation certifier; runtime verification and monitoring prototypes. These are experimentally evaluated using the NASA-HDCP testbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to lead to advances in software technology and to benefit advanced education. Novel combinations of software synthesis, certification and monitoring lead to new, powerful&lt;br/&gt;dependable software development methodologies ensuring safe execution with little or no overhead. Two graduate courses are planned. Supported graduate students are given a solid scientific foundation&lt;br/&gt;and acquire invaluable experience by working closely with NASA scientists.</AbstractNarration>
