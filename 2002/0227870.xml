    <AbstractNarration>AST-0227870&lt;br/&gt;Hemenway, Mary Kay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are awarded to Dr. Mary Kay Hemenway at the University of Texas at Austin to produce a web site and museum kiosk that will describe and explain how astronomers perform astronomical research. Specifically, the project will help adults understand how astronomers perform research at a major astronomical observatory; help students explore astronomical research, equipment, and careers; lead both a Science Education graduate student, a teacher intern, and other K-12 teachers to a deeper understanding of astronomical research while enhancing their contacts with astronomers; and give astronomers an organized way to share their research with the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web site and kiosk will open with a calendar outlining research scheduled on each of &lt;br/&gt;the major research telescopes at McDonald Observatory. Links to related visitor-friendly &lt;br/&gt;pages provide information on the astronomers using the telescopes; information on the telescopes, including their instrumentation and operation; rationale for using the chosen instrument for each particular project; and a glossary of astronomy terms. The primary audience will be the 1,500 teachers and their 150,000 students using "StarDate/Universo in the Classroom." The project team includes experts in astronomy public outreach and education, an astronomical research expert, a graduate student in Science Education, and a K-12 teacher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will also share the project's design and templates with other institutions with similar outreach missions. A national Education Advisory Board will evaluate the project as it develops. Planned evaluation techniques include interviewing Observatory visitors who use the kiosk, and surveying teachers about their and their students use of the web site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Actitivies in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
