    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0244844&lt;br/&gt;Denis Auroux&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to study the topology of symplectic manifolds using&lt;br/&gt;approximately holomorphic techniques (introduced by Donaldson and&lt;br/&gt;further developped by Auroux) and the corresponding monodromy&lt;br/&gt;invariants. Approximately holomorphic linear systems on symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds give rise to structures such as Lefschetz pencils and maps to&lt;br/&gt;the complex projective plane, whose monodromy is described by morphisms&lt;br/&gt;with values in mapping class groups or braid groups. By studying the&lt;br/&gt;monodromy invariants of symplectic manifolds, new insight will be&lt;br/&gt;obtained into the relationships between symplectic manifolds and&lt;br/&gt;complex projective manifolds: symplectic versus complex deformation&lt;br/&gt;equivalence, isotopy and non-isotopy phenomena, topological constraints&lt;br/&gt;on symplectic manifolds. In addition, relating monodromy invariants&lt;br/&gt;with Gromov-Witten invariants or Floer homology should help to&lt;br/&gt;understand mirror symmetry, while the more combinatorial aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;project are closely related to the algorithmics and computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity of mapping class and braid groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic manifolds are geometric spaces with special structures,&lt;br/&gt;which first arose in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics. Mathematicians have recently become very interested in their&lt;br/&gt;geometry and topology (intrinsic structure), in part due to motivating&lt;br/&gt;questions from theoretical physics (string theory). This project aims&lt;br/&gt;to study the topology of symplectic manifolds using an approach&lt;br/&gt;developped first by S. Donaldson and subsequently by Auroux, which&lt;br/&gt;makes it possible to obtain a complete description by combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;invariants involving braid groups (a concept closely related to knots).&lt;br/&gt;One of the main goals of the project is to relate the topological&lt;br/&gt;features of symplectic manifolds with those of complex algebraic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds (a more special, much better understood class of geometric&lt;br/&gt;spaces). In addition, some applications to other domains such as&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics (the "mirror symmetry" duality in string theory)&lt;br/&gt;and cryptography (the computational complexity of combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;problems involving braid groups) will be explored.</AbstractNarration>
