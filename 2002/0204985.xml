    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0204985 PI: Borthwick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will study spectral geometry in three basic contexts. &lt;br/&gt;For smooth infinite-volume hyperbolic manifolds (without cusps), he will study &lt;br/&gt;the question of finiteness of classes of surfaces with the same resonance set,&lt;br/&gt;refine techniques involving determinants that he and his co-authors &lt;br/&gt;have already developed, and study resonances as functions of the deformation&lt;br/&gt;space of a hyperbolic structure. For the more general class of asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic manifolds, the main goal is to analyze the determinants and relative&lt;br/&gt;determinants and use them to derive geometric constraints from resonance data.&lt;br/&gt;The techniques developed will be applied to define determinants and obtain&lt;br/&gt;constraints for exterior domains in two and three dimensions as well.&lt;br/&gt;A final goal is to understand the basic spectral theory of a broader &lt;br/&gt;class of negatively curved surfaces. Here the objectives are to determine &lt;br/&gt;the essential spectrum and prove a limiting absorption principle which will &lt;br/&gt;characterize the essential spectrum and lead towards the establishment of a &lt;br/&gt;scattering theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric spectral theory lies at the interface of the fields of differential &lt;br/&gt;geometry and mathematical physics. In physical theories such as quantum &lt;br/&gt;mechanics or wave propagation, one can draw a natural distinction&lt;br/&gt;between geometric properties of a system, meaning the underlying structure,&lt;br/&gt;and analytic properties, which reflect how the physics of the system behaves.&lt;br/&gt;Analytic properties, of which the spectrum is a prime example,&lt;br/&gt;are generally the aspects of a system most readily determined&lt;br/&gt;by experiment (for example, component colors of light emitted by stars, or&lt;br/&gt;frequency spikes in a radar scan). In many physical applications, &lt;br/&gt;the basic goal is to derive information about the geometric structure from the &lt;br/&gt;spectral data. The PI will pursue this goal in settings for which one already &lt;br/&gt;has good sources of conjectures and mathematical tools. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the spectral theory of these cases&lt;br/&gt;will provide new geometric invariants of interest in differential geometry,&lt;br/&gt;while developing intuition for problems of a more applied nature.</AbstractNarration>
