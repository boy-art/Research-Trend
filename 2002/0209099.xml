    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this research is to design and analyze discrete algorithms&lt;br/&gt;approximating solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.Because&lt;br/&gt;many of these problems are NP-hard,an exact solution is often not feasible;&lt;br/&gt;in such cases approximation algorithms are a viable alternative.In addition&lt;br/&gt;to attacking approximation problems that seem to require new strategies,&lt;br/&gt;another main goal is to investigate the applicability of design principles de-&lt;br/&gt;veloped successfully for traditional discrete optimization problems to com-&lt;br/&gt;parable tasks occurring in other areas.In any ase,a rigorous performance&lt;br/&gt;analysis is always intended.&lt;br/&gt;A .rst focus is the #P-complete permanent problem,which is of much&lt;br/&gt;importance in statistical physics and combinatorics.Rough approximations&lt;br/&gt;(up to an exponential factor)can be obtained in deterministic polynomial&lt;br/&gt;time and possibly even mu h faster on a parallel machine.Such a solution&lt;br/&gt;would allow to solve the outstanding bipartite matching problem of parallel&lt;br/&gt;computing.Even though the matching problem is easy for a sequential&lt;br/&gt;machine,it is very hallenging to coordinate the many processors of a parallel&lt;br/&gt;machine to worksimultaneously and e .ciently on the same matching.It is&lt;br/&gt;also proposed to attackthe parallel matching problem with a novel version&lt;br/&gt;of more traditional network .ow methods.&lt;br/&gt;Another theme of this proposal is the approximation of NP-hard opti-&lt;br/&gt;mization problems by traditional methods like lo al search,the comparison&lt;br/&gt;method,semide .nite optimization,or some combination of these.It is even&lt;br/&gt;proposed to investigate the approximation of some problems in P,as this&lt;br/&gt;could have interesting applications in parallel computing.</AbstractNarration>
