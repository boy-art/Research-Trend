    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204707&lt;br/&gt;William H. Jaco&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the development and use of efficient&lt;br/&gt;triangulations in the study and understanding of 3--manifolds. A&lt;br/&gt;triangulation of a 3-manifold determines a class of surfaces in the&lt;br/&gt;3--manifold called normal surfaces. A fundamental observation is that &lt;br/&gt;in most cases when a 3--manifold contains an interesting surface, then for&lt;br/&gt;any triangulation of the 3--manifold the same interesting feature is&lt;br/&gt;exhibited by a normal surface in the triangulation. This has provided a&lt;br/&gt;powerful method for studying 3-manifolds and solving certain decision&lt;br/&gt;problems. Normal surface theory has, for example, lead to the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;resolution of determining when two 3--manifolds, which contain injective&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, are homeomorphic, to the classification of these same manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;and to the determination of whether a knot in the three-sphere is the&lt;br/&gt;unknot. However, even with the presence of interesting normal surfaces, a&lt;br/&gt;given triangulation may have numerous uninteresting normal surfaces, which&lt;br/&gt;make theoretical arguments quite tedious and computational attempts nearly&lt;br/&gt;impossible. The guiding principle of efficient triangulations is reducing&lt;br/&gt;unnecessary normal surfaces and improving the efficiency of computations&lt;br/&gt;for triangulation based algorithms. They have exhibited remarkable&lt;br/&gt;success in doing this. However, more surprisingly, efficient&lt;br/&gt;triangulations have exposed interesting relations between one-vertex and&lt;br/&gt;ideal triangulations of three-manifolds and new combinatorial structures,&lt;br/&gt;which seem to be intimately related to the topology of the three-manifold.&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore efficient triangulations with particular&lt;br/&gt;emphasis of their application to the Homeomorphism Problem/Classification&lt;br/&gt;Problem for three-manifolds and issues of computational complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-dimensional topology brings together many areas of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research and provides a common ground for interaction and advance across&lt;br/&gt;all of mathematics. It provides a natural geometric model of most physical&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. Research in this area is making significant contribution to&lt;br/&gt;computational geometry and topology and complexity theory. It has&lt;br/&gt;consequences in physics, computer visualization and medical and biological&lt;br/&gt;modeling.</AbstractNarration>
