    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0226053&lt;br/&gt;Cary Coglianese&lt;br/&gt;Harvard University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government and E-Rulemaking: New Direction for Technology and Regulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rulemaking is the process by which government agencies take laws passed by Congress, provide the detailed scientific, engineering, and economic analyses necessary to reduce those laws to regulation and practice, and then consult with any interested parties. They must then consider any external recommendations and accept or reject them. Documenting their reasons for doing so. The entire process and decisions must be open and transparent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many Federal agencies have begun experimenting with using the Internet in the rulemaking process. The hope is that this will increase the accessibility of the process to the public, while providing an easier way to document the interactions between the agencies and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed workshop will bring together information technology researchers, legal and administrative experts, and agency personnel to develop an information technology and social/political science research agenda related to this very important democratic process.</AbstractNarration>
