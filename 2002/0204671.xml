    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0204671.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to continue his work on global problems &lt;br/&gt;in differential geometry and related areas. Special emphasis will be devoted &lt;br/&gt;to the pursuit of global Riemannian geometry via additional structures. &lt;br/&gt;This includes but is not limited to structures arising from the presence &lt;br/&gt;of symmetries, and to structures arising from taking external or internal limits. &lt;br/&gt;Our efforts concerning investigations of relations between curvature, &lt;br/&gt;symmetry and topology is guided by the program set forth by the aim: &lt;br/&gt;``Classify or describe the structure of manifolds with positive or &lt;br/&gt;nonnegative curvature and large isometry groups". This area is currently &lt;br/&gt;experiencing significant advances in various directions. The project will &lt;br/&gt;also include investigations of structures arising from the collapse &lt;br/&gt;of manifolds under a lower curvature bound, and of metric invariants &lt;br/&gt;coming from investigations of the structure of various spaces of finite metric spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of the main part of the proposal is twofold. On the one &lt;br/&gt;hand there are many geometric situations where no symmetries are present &lt;br/&gt;from the outset, but where symmetries emerge non-trivially from the geometry. &lt;br/&gt;Among such situations are rigidity problems and collapsing problems under &lt;br/&gt;bounded curvature. General results achieved through the work proposed can &lt;br/&gt;then be invoked and help solve the original problem, where no symmetries &lt;br/&gt;were present. This method has already been used successfully. &lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, the proposed work provides a systematic approach for &lt;br/&gt;finding new examples of spaces with positive or nonnegative curvature, &lt;br/&gt;arguably one the most central and difficult issues facing global &lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry today.</AbstractNarration>
