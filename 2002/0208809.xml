    <AbstractNarration>Moulin, Pierre&lt;br/&gt;U of Ill Urbana- Champaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enormous growth in electronic commerce has led to an urgent need for the protection and&lt;br/&gt;authentication of information, which now is stored and transmitted in massive amounts. There is a&lt;br/&gt;multitude of applications where a signal (typically audio, image or video) is to be communicated to&lt;br/&gt;a receiver, along with information such as ownership identification or a timestamp authenticating&lt;br/&gt;the signal. The communication channel on which the signal is transmitted may be insecure, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;an adversary may modify the signal in such a way that it can no longer be reliably authenticated.&lt;br/&gt;In some applications (e.g., wireless video transmission) the channel is considered to be insecure&lt;br/&gt;not due to the presence of an adversary, but because of the significant degradations introduced&lt;br/&gt;by the transmission medium. A secret message necessary for authentication may be embedded&lt;br/&gt;in the signal (watermarking-based authentication) or transmitted on a separate channel (hashing-&lt;br/&gt;based authentication). In watermarking, the host data set is intentionally corrupted, but in a covert&lt;br/&gt;way, designed to be imperceptible to a casual analysis. Hashing does not require the signal to be&lt;br/&gt;modified, but requires the transmission of side information about the signal (authentication tag)&lt;br/&gt;on a separate channel.&lt;br/&gt;Signal authentication encompasses applications such as forgery detection and analysis, copyright&lt;br/&gt;protection for digital media, copy control, fingerprinting (traitor tracing), and database query and&lt;br/&gt;retrieval [1]|[30]. Watermarking and authentication are now major activities in audio, image, and&lt;br/&gt;video processing, and standardization efforts for JPEG-2000, MPEG-4, and Digital Video Disks&lt;br/&gt;are well underway. Commercial products are being developed. Annual International Workshops&lt;br/&gt;on information hiding have been held in 1996, and every year since 1998. Special issues of major&lt;br/&gt;technical journals have recently been recently devoted to information protection [31, 32, 33, 34],&lt;br/&gt;and comprehensive surveys of image and multimedia watermarking techniques are available from&lt;br/&gt;[35, 36].</AbstractNarration>
