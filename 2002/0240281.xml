    <AbstractNarration>The World Summit will be the largest summit in UN history. This global summit is a follow-on to the1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro. The WSSD will be in Johannesburg 26 August-7 September and over 100 heads of state are expected to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key U.S. message for the WSSD is the importance of concrete action on sustainable development. To reinforce this message, the Smithsonian Institution is developing an exhibit that showcases projects and activities demonstrating the key U.S. themes for WSSD, interweaving governance, finance, science &amp; technology, and partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Smithsonian has taken the leadership in the USG interagency process on developing and coordinating the US exhibit at the World Summit. Federal Departments and agencies are co-funding the U.S. presence. NSF co-funding will provide supplies and services necessary to develop, install, and maintain the joint U.S. exhibit and to support the NSF involvement at the Exhibit.</AbstractNarration>
