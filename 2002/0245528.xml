    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0245528&lt;br/&gt;William E. Fulton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been exciting recent work involving interactions among Schubert&lt;br/&gt;calculus (intersection theory on Grassmannians and related flag&lt;br/&gt;varieties), eigenvalue and singular value problems in linear algebra,&lt;br/&gt;representation theory, geometric invariant theory and related symplectic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. In addition to solving the Horn conjecture about eigenvalues of&lt;br/&gt;sums of Hermitian matrices, a variety of related problems have been raised &lt;br/&gt;and are being solved. There are quantum analogues of many of these problems, &lt;br/&gt;which are part of this project. The project also involves a problem of &lt;br/&gt;enumerative geometry, and a more difficult problem of constructing moduli &lt;br/&gt;spaces of subvarieties to resolve away multiple components. Three writing &lt;br/&gt;projects, on stacks, toric varieties, and curves, have each already led to &lt;br/&gt;some new research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research concerns nine topics, most on the borders of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry with other areas. Much of algebraic geometry concerns&lt;br/&gt;the geometry of quite general spaces. This research, however,&lt;br/&gt;concentrates on a collection of special varieties which have a rich&lt;br/&gt;structure that one can hope to analyze in detail. These arise in&lt;br/&gt;neighboring areas of mathematics, especially representation theory, but&lt;br/&gt;also linear algebra, combinatorics, commutative algebra, and symplectic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. For example, although the notion of quantum cohomology -- which&lt;br/&gt;came from physics -- make sense in great generality, few spaces have had&lt;br/&gt;their quantum cohomology thoroughly worked out, and we plan to expand this&lt;br/&gt;knowledge in this project. Three book-writing projects are in progress,&lt;br/&gt;two of which should be useful to graduate students in algebraic geometry;&lt;br/&gt;the third is aimed at undergraduate mathematics majors.</AbstractNarration>
