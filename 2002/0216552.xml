    <AbstractNarration>OPP-0216552&lt;br/&gt;McConnell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty, scientists, and students of the Desert Research Institute (DRI) routinely need to quantify trace elements and isotopes in their research in atmospheric, hydrologic, earth, ecosystem, and anthropological sciences. DRI's quadrapole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) is widely used for such measurements, but the detection limits of this instrument are inadequate for many projects. Therefore, the Principal Investigators have requested funding for two new ICP instruments: a Finnigan MAT Element2 high-resolution, double focusing ICP-MS and a Varian Vista-Pro axially viewed inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program. Additional funds are requested for instrument development to incorporate the two ICP instruments into DRI's recently developed method for continuous trace element and isotope analyses in ice cores. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continual improvement of high-resolution capabilities specifically was identified by the NSF-sponsored U.S. Ice Core Working Group as a priority requirement for the continuation of U.S. ice core research. Given the high cost of collecting and storing ice cores and their potential to provide highly detailed information on past atmospheric chemistry, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and anthropogenic pollution across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, it is clear that the best possible analytical procedures and instrumentation for ice core analyses are warranted. DRI faculty has recently developed a novel, efficient method using ICP-MS to make continuous, high-resolution and exactly co-registered measurements of trace elements and chemical species on ice cores. Measurements of 15 chemical species and elements on a ~135 meter (M) core from Summit, Greenland, and pilot data developed using cores from Siple Dome, Antarctica, demonstrate the potential of this new approach as well as the limitations of DRI's quadrapole ICP-MS. In ice cores, the concentrations of some important elements and isotopes are below the detection limits of the quadrapole ICP-MS. This problem also hinders other environmental science applications where elemental and isotope data are fundamental to answering critical questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While a major objective of this proposal is to significantly advance the level and scope of U.S. ice core research, the availability of a state-of-the-art ICP-MS and ICP-OES will improve and expand research capabilities for DRI and University and Community College System of Nevada (UCCSN) faculty working in other fields (e.g., impact of pollution aerosols on precipitation, groundwater fingerprinting, determination of sources of colloidal material in surface waters, trace element analysis in archeology). In particular, as the only ICP-MS in Nevada capable of dedicated, high-resolution elemental and isotopic analyses, the acquisition of the Element2 ICP-MS will attract new faculty to DRI and the UCCSN system (with a goal of increasing diversity) as well as improve and expand opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student training throughout the state.</AbstractNarration>
