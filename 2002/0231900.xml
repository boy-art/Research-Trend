    <AbstractNarration>Basing their work on their expertise in science and mathematics, teams composed of teachers, and graduate and undergraduate Fellows are developing new materials and adopting and adapting existing materials for problem- based learning (PBL) and interactive case based learning (ICBL) cases that integrate grade appropriate science and math content into locally relevant classroom modules. The Fellows are assisting teachers in introducing and testing these cases and problems in a variety of middle and high schools in the Atlanta area. In preparation for this work, the teams are participating in workshops on PBL and ICBL pedagogy, as well as teacher- designed introductions to urban education. Each team is collaborating on developing plans that include a needs assessment, an action plan, an implementation plan and a communication plan. The teams are also providing professional development for other teachers in the school. The broader impacts of these activities include benefits to the Fellows, the teachers and the K-12 students involved. The Fellow are gaining the skills and knowledge necessary to: engage in active learning teaching pedagogies and reflective practice; practice the teamwork required for interdisciplinary science collaboration that leads to success in modern scientific research; communicate science effectively to a broader audience; and to include outreach activities in their career goals when they are practicing scientists. The teachers are enhancing and updating their Math /Science content knowledge and are sharing this knowledge with other teachers. They are benefiting as well from enhanced articulation and communication between middle school and high school teachers and between teachers and college faculty and students. The high school and middle school students involved are benefiting not only from the classroom modules being developed but are also interacting with role models to whom they can relate, leading to improved student interest in science and mathematics careers.
