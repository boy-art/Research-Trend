    <AbstractNarration>ALAN T. WATERMAN AWARD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jennifer A. Doudna&lt;br/&gt;(0003240)&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jennifer A. Doudna, a Professor at Yale University in the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry is the recipient of the 2000 Alan T. Waterman award. She has conducted innovative research that led to the development of a technique that facilitates crystallization of large RNA molecules, has determined the crystal structure of catalytic RNA molecules and a RNA molecule that forms the ribonucleoprotein core of the signal recognition particle, and has deciphered structural features of those molecules that permit a greater understanding of the mechanistic basis of RNA function in both catalysis and in protein synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;Her current research is reshaping basic theories regarding the roles of metal ions in ribozyme function. No longer viewed as strict metalloenzymes, some ribozymes can access alternative catalytic mechanisms depending on the identity and availability of metal ions. Similarly, reaction conditions can allow different folding pathways to predominate, with divalent cations sometimes playing opposing roles.</AbstractNarration>
