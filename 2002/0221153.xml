    <AbstractNarration>SES-0221153&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Charles Bidwell&lt;br/&gt; Julia Gwynne&lt;br/&gt; University of Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doctoral Dissertation Improvement project investigates the role of schools and neighborhoods in shaping early labor force experiences of non-college bound youth in Chicago. Specifically, it proposes that social experiences within schools and neighborhoods influence three dimensions of labor force participation: The choice of labor force participation versus college attendance, the type of first employment, and the early stages of development in an employment career. The proposal argues that social experiences within schools and neighborhoods are composed of two elements, form and content. While content involves any sort of interest, purpose or motive, form is the structuring mechanism by which content is experienced. Within the school context attention is focused on the form (degree of differentiation) and content (academic vs. vocational) of the curricular program as well as the form (frequency, intensity) and content (encouragement of information about college vs. labor force) of social interaction with school personnel. Within the neighborhood, the focus is on the form (frequency and intensity) and content (encouragement of and information about college vs. labor force) of social interaction with local adults. These two elements of social experiences in both neighborhood and school bear directly on the way in which youth make decisions about post-secondary opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project makes contributions to research on labor force experiences of non-college bound youth. First, it expands the literature on occupational attainment by examining mechanisms other than educational attainment that are important in facilitating the location of employment. Second, by simultaneously considering the role of both schools and neighborhoods in transition into the labor force, this project offers a more complete picture of resources available to youth as they negotiate the job search process.</AbstractNarration>
