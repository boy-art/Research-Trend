    <AbstractNarration>The investigator studies the dynamics of certain classes of&lt;br/&gt;integro-differential equations that arise in models of cortex. He&lt;br/&gt;examines how recurrent activity terminates due to any of several&lt;br/&gt;effects such as synaptic depression, depolarization block, and&lt;br/&gt;after-hyperpolarization. He also considers how recurrent&lt;br/&gt;connections lead to bistability and under what conditions this is&lt;br/&gt;sufficient to produce localized spatial states, wave fronts, and&lt;br/&gt;pulses. He uses methods of averaging and bifurcation theory to&lt;br/&gt;derive and analyse simplified dynamics from these models. The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical results explain a variety of experimental findings&lt;br/&gt;in both normal and pharmacologically manipulated neural tissue.&lt;br/&gt;These methods are applied to the Limax procerebral lobe, the&lt;br/&gt;turtle olfactory bulb, and various cortical slice preparations.&lt;br/&gt; Neurons, the main cells in the brain, are responsible for&lt;br/&gt;processing inputs from the outside world and converting this to&lt;br/&gt;motor actions. They communicate by producing spikes that are&lt;br/&gt;propagated to different regions of the brain by chemicals called&lt;br/&gt;transmitters. The nvestigator is interested in how this&lt;br/&gt;electrical and chemical information moves from one part of the&lt;br/&gt;brain to others. He uses simulations and mathematics to derive&lt;br/&gt;equations and general principles about how this is done.&lt;br/&gt;Experiments have shown that during some cognitive tasks, certain&lt;br/&gt;groups of neurons fire synchronously. He is interested in the&lt;br/&gt;conditions that are necessary to attain precise timing between&lt;br/&gt;different groups of neurons. In order to study these, he has&lt;br/&gt;developed mathematical software for the study of complex&lt;br/&gt;biological and physical systems. As part of this project, he&lt;br/&gt;continues to develop this software and to make it widely&lt;br/&gt;available. The project also provides interdisciplinary training&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for students and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>
