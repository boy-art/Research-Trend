    <AbstractNarration>This study will help us understand the exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the biosphere and the atmosphere. We will explore factors affecting the rates of gas exchange (photosynthesis and respiration) for representative ecosystems in the southwestern US. We will determine if remote sensing (optical and thermal measurement from a distance) can detect subtle alterations in the rates of photosynthesis and respiration. This "breathing of the planet" helps regulate our atmosphere and influences our climate, and is further being affected by human impacts on the atmosphere and climate in ways that are not yet fully understood. In addition to the science goals of understanding terrestrial gas exchange, we will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and master's students. Findings from the project will be made available to the larger community using the internet, and can be used to help validate data products emerging from new aircraft and satellite sensors.</AbstractNarration>
