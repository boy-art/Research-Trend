    <AbstractNarration>Layering has long been a basic architectural principal in communication &lt;br/&gt;networks. Recently, however, there has been much interest in exploring &lt;br/&gt;various techniques that allow for a stronger coupling across traditional &lt;br/&gt;layer boundaries, in particular between the physical layer and higher &lt;br/&gt;network layers in wireless networks. At the physical layer, the fundamental &lt;br/&gt;performance trade-offs as given by information theory are, in many cases, &lt;br/&gt;well understood. When higher layer objectives, such as delay, enter the &lt;br/&gt;picture, there is much less fundamental understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is addressing several key problems in cross-layer resource &lt;br/&gt;allocation in wireless networks. In these problems, physical layer "radio &lt;br/&gt;resources" are dynamically allocated over time and between users in order &lt;br/&gt;to satisfy both network layer and physical layer performance requirements. &lt;br/&gt;Ideas from information theory and communication theory are used for &lt;br/&gt;modeling the physical communication channels. Queueing theoretic models are &lt;br/&gt;used for incorporating network-level quality of service issues. The &lt;br/&gt;emphasis of this effort is to improve understanding of the basic &lt;br/&gt;architectural trade-offs and fundamental performance limitations in these &lt;br/&gt;settings.</AbstractNarration>
