    <AbstractNarration>Jason Halfen, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Department of Chemistry, is&lt;br/&gt;supported for his project making new synthetic analogs for superoxide&lt;br/&gt;reductase enzymes. This family of enzymes has a non-heme iron active site in&lt;br/&gt;a square pyramidal geometry. By preparing small molecule models of this&lt;br/&gt;active site, we can better understand the bonding and three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;structure, redox chemistry and reactivity of the enzyme. More specifically,&lt;br/&gt;Halfen will be preparing and studying thiolate-ligated iron and cobalt&lt;br/&gt;peroxo species, the propensity of the model complexes to dissociate these&lt;br/&gt;thiolates, and representative sulfur alkylation and oxidation reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)&lt;br/&gt;Program and incorporates undergraduate education and training. The range of&lt;br/&gt;synthetic and spectroscopic techniques proposed will provide a foundation&lt;br/&gt;for undergraduate students pursuing chemistry or biology as a career. The&lt;br/&gt;scientific impact will include a better understanding of metal-thiolate&lt;br/&gt;bonds and how these ubiquitous bonds are involved in enzymatic processes.</AbstractNarration>
