    <AbstractNarration>Northwestern University supports a Research Experiences for Science Teachers activity that hosts 15 teachers for each summer in 2002-2005. The goals of the activity are to facilitate meaningful interactions between college professors and pre-college teachers, to translate those interactions into practical classroom tools, and to develop a resource network for disseminating the insight and tools that teachers acquire. The RET activity, which continues throughout the school year and involves pre-college teachers as well as community college faculty, includes development by the teachers of "toolkits" or teaching tools that draw from the teachers' research experience and that relate to classroom curricula. The "toolkits" are made available online.</AbstractNarration>
