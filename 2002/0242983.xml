    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0242983&lt;br/&gt;Kantor, William M.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Groups, algorithms and geometry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic and asymptotic properties of finite groups will continue &lt;br/&gt;to be studied, including the statistical analysis of random elements &lt;br/&gt;of a finite simple group as well as probabilistic generation. The &lt;br/&gt;emphasis will be on algorithmic questions concerning permutation &lt;br/&gt;groups and matrix groups, and to more general questions concerning &lt;br/&gt;"black box groups". The main focus is the design and analysis of &lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms to determine the normal structure of a &lt;br/&gt;large-dimensional matrix group given by a small set of generators, &lt;br/&gt;where the algorithms have both fast asymptotic running time and good &lt;br/&gt;practical performance. This should produce a polynomial-time &lt;br/&gt;algorithm for the basic manipulation of arbitrary matrix groups, &lt;br/&gt;assuming that discrete logarithms in suitable fields can be computed &lt;br/&gt;quickly. Recent algorithms devised or proposed for the constructive &lt;br/&gt;recognition of most classes of finite simple groups are a major &lt;br/&gt;ingredient in this plan. The study of polynomial-time, nearly linear &lt;br/&gt;time and parallel (complexity class NC) permutation group algorithms &lt;br/&gt;also will be continued. Additional new practical algorithms will be &lt;br/&gt;obtained based on methods developed in these theoretical situations. &lt;br/&gt;All of this work will make detailed use of the classification and &lt;br/&gt;properties of the finite simple groups. Some of these &lt;br/&gt;algorithms depend on geometric methods. Other geometric projects will &lt;br/&gt;be continued, including asymptotic investigations into planes, &lt;br/&gt;designs and codes. There will be special emphases on nonassociative &lt;br/&gt;division algebras and their planes (and in some cases, associated &lt;br/&gt;codes), as well as on automorphism groups of symmetric designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of group theory is the mathematical theory of symmetry and &lt;br/&gt;interacts with many other disciplines, for example computer science, &lt;br/&gt;physics and chemistry outside of mathematics, number theory, &lt;br/&gt;topology and geometry inside mathematics. The fundamental building &lt;br/&gt;blocks of finite groups are the finite simple groups. One of the &lt;br/&gt;outstanding mathematical results in recent decades is the &lt;br/&gt;classification of the finite simple groups. A major portion of this &lt;br/&gt;research proposal is aimed at using properties of these simple groups &lt;br/&gt;in the computer-assisted study of arbitrary finite groups. &lt;br/&gt;Group-theoretic algorithms are fundamental to the computer group &lt;br/&gt;theory packages GAP and Magma, which are widely used in group theory &lt;br/&gt;and combinatorics. Many aspects of the PI's research program have &lt;br/&gt;led or will lead to significant improvements in this widely-available &lt;br/&gt;software. Another portion of this proposal concerns the generation &lt;br/&gt;of a finite group from a probabilistic standpoint, which also has &lt;br/&gt;applications in computer science. A third portion of the proposal &lt;br/&gt;concerns finite geometries, especially designs and codes. Designs &lt;br/&gt;first arose in the design of statistical experiments, and have many &lt;br/&gt;applications in other disciplines, including optics, coding theory &lt;br/&gt;and computer algorithms. Error-correcting codes are a fundamental &lt;br/&gt;engineering application of "pure" mathematics. This proposal will &lt;br/&gt;fund graduate students who will study and work in these areas on the &lt;br/&gt;border between mathematics and its applications.</AbstractNarration>
