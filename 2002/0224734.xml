    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the University of Hawaii's Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB), under the direction of Dr. Jo-Ann Leong, to improve the HIMB's linkage to the internet, and therefore the larger research community. Because of its location on a small island off Oahu, HIMB must negotiate daily with issues of transportation and communication. Communication links with other members of the research community both on the main campuses at the University of Hawaii in Manoa and Hilo as well as our collaborators on the mainland United States and the international community are critical to the success of the institute, its faculty and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This grant will help to improve HIMB data management and communication systems and provide vastly improved electronic communications. Gigabit microwave dishes, provided by the manufacturer, will soon connect HIMB to the University of Hawaii communications system via Windward Community College. This grant will provide high speed switches and routers on HIMB and allow the institute to take full advantage of the new high speed microwave connection to the internet. A new server will enhance HIMB's data management and reduce software costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The upgraded communications system will not only enhance HIMB's ability to communicate with colleague and collaborators the world over, but it will allow the high speed data transfer which is necessary for bioinformatics and the broadband communication needed for real time transmission of video. This NSF grant will HIMB to take full advantage of the opportunity created by the donation of the high speed microwave radios.</AbstractNarration>
