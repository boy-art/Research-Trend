    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of this research project is to improve understanding of the genesis, and the kinematics and dynamics of severe convective storms and tornadoes. The objective will be met primarily through analysis of data collected in both prior and future field experiments and through numerical simulation experiments. Mobile Doppler radar datasets from field experiments will be analyzed to detail the structure and evolution of tornadoes and their parent vortices and the vertical circulation associated with the dryline, a feature along which severe convective storms are often initiated. In particular, why some supercell storms produce tornadoes, while others do not, will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamics of convective-storm interaction and the role of the intersection of a dryline with a baroclinic boundary in triggering convective storms will be investigated using controlled numerical-model simulation experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, two new radar systems will be tested for use in severe storm/tornado research: one is a mobile, rapidly scanning, phased-array Doppler radar; the other is an existing system that will be fitted with a spaced antennae, which could provide transverse-wind measurements in addition to line-of-sight wind measurements. A collaborator under another NSF award is developing these radar systems (Dr. Andrew Pazmany, ATM-0242166). If the new radar systems are successful, then much higher quality datasets will be available for analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that this project will ultimately lead to a more accurate prediction of severe weather events.</AbstractNarration>
