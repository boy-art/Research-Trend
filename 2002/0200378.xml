    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "The fungal community on corn (Zea mays) resistant and susceptible to smut (Ustilago maydis)." The effects of selective breeding and changing host genetic environment on non-target, potentially beneficial microorganisms are often overlooked. This research investigates these effects by studying the fungal microbial community on corn plants resistant or susceptible to one its major pathogens, smut. It will have important implications for understanding how altering the host plant genetic environment can affect species diversity and genetic structure of non-target microorganisms.</AbstractNarration>
