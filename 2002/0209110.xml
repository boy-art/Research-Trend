    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this research is to produce practical codes that provide&lt;br/&gt;unequaled robustness, approaching the performance predicted by compound&lt;br/&gt;channel information theory for linear Gaussian channels. The resulting&lt;br/&gt;channel codes will find application in many scenarios including wired and&lt;br/&gt;wireless broadcast, wireless local area networks, asymmetric digital&lt;br/&gt;subscriber lines, military anti-jam communications, and frequency hopped&lt;br/&gt;communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from compound channel information theory state that a single code&lt;br/&gt;exists that supports communication over every channel that has a mutual&lt;br/&gt;information above the information rate of the code. Thus, once the&lt;br/&gt;transmitter power spectrum is fixed, a code need not be specialized to a&lt;br/&gt;particular frequency selective channel in a single antenna system or a&lt;br/&gt;particular space-time path-gain matrix in a multiple antenna system. While&lt;br/&gt;this theoretical result is more that thirty years old, practical code design&lt;br/&gt;has focused to date on a weaker notion of robustness, that of average&lt;br/&gt;performance according to a statistical channel model, such as Rayleigh&lt;br/&gt;fading. The power of the code design approach taken in this&lt;br/&gt;research is that the code design is independent of statistical assumptions&lt;br/&gt;about the channel. The code simply works on every channel that it possibly&lt;br/&gt;could.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second goal of this research is to develop codes that support multiple&lt;br/&gt;rates to different users. Here again, information theory (this time&lt;br/&gt;information theory for degraded broadcast channels) lays out the limits of&lt;br/&gt;performance. Our research will closely approach these performance limits by&lt;br/&gt;applying turbo codes to the concept of superposition coding for the degraded&lt;br/&gt;broadcast channel.</AbstractNarration>
