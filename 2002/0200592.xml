    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator is working in the field of&lt;br/&gt;representation theory of finite groups. Mainly he studies&lt;br/&gt;questions related to the conjectures of Alperin, Dade, and Broue.&lt;br/&gt;These conjectures state that certain invariants of a finite group&lt;br/&gt;and a fixed prime number can be determined by the same invariants&lt;br/&gt;of subgroups which are again related to that prime. The first&lt;br/&gt;conjectures are concerned with invariants that are integers,&lt;br/&gt;whereas the third conjecture predicts equivalences of categories.&lt;br/&gt;The first two conjectures and consequences of the third have been&lt;br/&gt;verified for a convincing number of examples. It is likely that&lt;br/&gt;these three conjectures are consequences of a single fact, object,&lt;br/&gt;theory, or construction which is still hidden. Probably more&lt;br/&gt;important than solving these particular conjectures would be the&lt;br/&gt;discovery of this hidden feature. The principal investigator works&lt;br/&gt;on general ideas of how to approach these conjectures. Graduate&lt;br/&gt;students are involved in this effort by writing computer programs&lt;br/&gt;which will either discard or give more evidence to the&lt;br/&gt;applicability of one of the suggested approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator studies representations of groups.&lt;br/&gt;Groups can be viewed as mathematical abstractions of the notion of&lt;br/&gt;symmetry. They are among the most basic notions in many fields of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and are applied widely, for example in cryptology,&lt;br/&gt;physics, chemistry, and computer science. Representations of&lt;br/&gt;groups are manifestations of a particular type of symmetry on&lt;br/&gt;other mathematical objects, as for example the four rotations and&lt;br/&gt;four reflections, that a square in the plane allows, form a&lt;br/&gt;representation of a group with 8 elements on a two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;vector space. More specifically, the principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies mysterious coincidences in the representation theory of&lt;br/&gt;finite groups which have been discovered about fifteen years ago&lt;br/&gt;but could not be explained so far. This research is not aimed at&lt;br/&gt;immediate applications outside mathematics. However, in the&lt;br/&gt;history of the interplay between mathematics and other sciences,&lt;br/&gt;in particular with physics, it is a repeated pattern that theories&lt;br/&gt;and results which were considered as important within the edifice&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics became precisely what was needed in the other&lt;br/&gt;sciences in order to describe our real world. For example, group&lt;br/&gt;representations which have been studied a century ago became much&lt;br/&gt;later the right tool to describe particles in nuclear physics.</AbstractNarration>
