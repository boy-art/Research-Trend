    <AbstractNarration>Thin film deposition processes are capable of nanometer and even&lt;br/&gt;atomically precise fabrication of layered structures. While the&lt;br/&gt;capabilities of deposition are well developed to the point of routine&lt;br/&gt;use by the optics and semiconductor devices manufacturers, application&lt;br/&gt;of deposition methods to extreme precision patterning and lithographic&lt;br/&gt;fabrication has received, at best, limited consideration. &lt;br/&gt;This degree of precision is especially needed in the fabrication of&lt;br/&gt;sub-wavelength diffractive optics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is aimed at a preliminary evaluation of the potential of&lt;br/&gt;multilayer stacks to be fabricated and processed into three dimensional&lt;br/&gt;master stampers for molding or casting high aspect ratio, nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;features in polymers. The vertical dimension of the pattern is produced&lt;br/&gt;by cleaving the material, polishing the cleaved surface as required, and&lt;br/&gt;chemically etching back selected layers of one material type to produce&lt;br/&gt;a bi-level topography. Not only can stamps for one-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;bragg-type gratings be produced by deposition, but curved stamps (used&lt;br/&gt;to mold sub-wavelength lenses) can be produced by deposition onto curved&lt;br/&gt;surfaces (e.g. optical fibers or anisotrpically etched silicon.) Layers&lt;br/&gt;of from 5 to 200 nanometers will be deposited using and extending our&lt;br/&gt;recent electroplating methods that are noted for increased mechanical&lt;br/&gt;strength, reduced grain size and the potential for producing films on&lt;br/&gt;the order of one nanometer roughness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most significant outcomes of this study would be the&lt;br/&gt;successful demonstration of electrodeposition to fabricate precisely&lt;br/&gt;controlled layers as an alternative to the more traditional, but much&lt;br/&gt;more expensive, physical deposition methods of sputtering and&lt;br/&gt;evaporation.</AbstractNarration>
