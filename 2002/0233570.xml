    <AbstractNarration>0233570&lt;br/&gt;Dasgupta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-France collaboration involves researchers and students at Columbia University and the University of Bordeaux. Gautum Dasgupta in the US and Jose Braga in France lead this interdisciplinary team of mechanical engineers and computer scientists. This research project addresses development of optimized computational codes, which can be employed in morphometric research in biology and anthropology. The US investigator has been developing growth calculation computer programs to yield quantitative descriptions of volume and shape change distributions. He proposes to apply these codes in morphometric research in biology and anthropology. The French team brings to this collaboration a focus on fundamental biological and anthropological issues and expertise in clinical implications in cranio-facial surgery and orthodontic treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS. NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators and graduate students. CNRS will support visits by French researchers and graduate students to the United States. The project will stimulate more accurate evaluation and efficient design of cranio-facial surgery and orthodontic treatments related to maxillo-facial structure.</AbstractNarration>
