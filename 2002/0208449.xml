    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues focus on several&lt;br/&gt;fundamental computational issues involved in the parallel&lt;br/&gt;implicit solution of optimization problems with partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equation The goal of the research is to advance the&lt;br/&gt;state of the art in four fundamental topics: (1) the formulation&lt;br/&gt;and analysis of algorithms for large-scale optimization; (2)&lt;br/&gt;adaptive mesh generation for partial differential equations; (3)&lt;br/&gt;multilevel partial differential equation solvers; and (4)&lt;br/&gt;parallel computation. Although each of these topics can be&lt;br/&gt;investigated in isolation, the exploitation of their interactions&lt;br/&gt;is crucial for the creation of effective global algorithms. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators are members of a Scientific Computation Group that&lt;br/&gt;offers a program of instruction and research emphasizing the role&lt;br/&gt;of scientific computation in the formulation, modeling, and&lt;br/&gt;solution of problems from diverse and changing areas. A major&lt;br/&gt;part of the project involves the development of software and its&lt;br/&gt;dissemination within the manufacturing, engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;scientific community. Software developed as part of the project&lt;br/&gt;provides an effective method of technology transfer and extends&lt;br/&gt;the scope and effectiveness of the existing codes PLTMG, MC, and&lt;br/&gt;SNOPT developed by the investigators.&lt;br/&gt; Because partial differential equations conveniently&lt;br/&gt;characterize the physical laws of many complex systems occurring&lt;br/&gt;in science and engineering, they also lie at the heart of the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models used to simulate and predict the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;these systems. The need to optimize the performance of such&lt;br/&gt;systems is the common feature of practical applications that&lt;br/&gt;range over such diverse areas as the optimal design of the hull&lt;br/&gt;of an America's Cup yacht, the cleanup of toxic waste sites, the&lt;br/&gt;construction of bioartificial arteries in tissue engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;the management of stock portfolios and hedge funds. Software&lt;br/&gt;developed in this project provides engineers and scientists with&lt;br/&gt;instant access to state-of-the-art methods for the modeling and&lt;br/&gt;optimization of complex systems involving partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equation constraints. The resulting improvements in the&lt;br/&gt;efficiency, accuracy and robustness of these models have a&lt;br/&gt;substantial impact in areas of manufacturing and engineering that&lt;br/&gt;are vital to US global competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>
