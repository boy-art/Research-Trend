    <AbstractNarration>0225346&lt;br/&gt;Grimes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support for the design and development of networked sensors capable of operating in aqueous environments. Development of an aqueous network sensor technology is a challenging prospect, requiring careful design and systematic integration of the sensor platforms incorporated into the network nodes for operation in liquids, packaging of the sensors for an aqueous environment, and burst-spread acoustic communication schemes (pulse modulation of a steady state carrier) able to compensate for reflections due to the water-ground and water-air interface. The PI will design and integrate sensor technologies capable of aqueous operation with acoustic based communication technologies and data processing protocols to achieve a network sensor technology able to autonomously, continuously, and in-real time monitor streams, lakes, ocean bays, liquid streams in processing plants, etc. He proposes to integrate arrays of magnetoelastic sensors into the nodes for measurement of liquid chemical composition, liquid density and viscosity, pH and temperature. Beyond helping to ensure water quality, the aqueous networked sensors would be a tremendous tool for biologists seeking to monitor the temperature, flow characteristics, and chemical environment of lakes and, ultimately when the technology is fully developed, oceans. Without question a viable networked sensor technology for aqueous environments would find great application for environmental monitoring, industrial process control, homeland security and scientific discovery.</AbstractNarration>
