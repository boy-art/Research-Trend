    <AbstractNarration>This research effort aims to study experimentally the effect of earthquake-induced lateral spreading due to liquefaction on pile foundations, both in full size and centrifuge model conditions. Comparable tests of instrumented single piles and pile groups embedded in 1-and 2-layer soil profiles will be conducted in slightly inclined laminar boxes subjected to base shaking at three facilities: 1) The 100g-ton geotechnical centrifuge, laminar box and in-flight shaker at RPI, 2) The 6m high laminar box and 1g shaking table at NIED, Japan (largest laminar box in the world), and 3) the 1.9m high laminar box and 1g shaking table at UCSD (largest laminar box in the US). Taking advantage of the successful experience at RPI in this kind of testing, this research constitutes the first opportunity for direct comparison of results in controlled experimental environments between centrifuge and full sized tests to be conducted at NIED. Additionally, centrifuge and full size NIED results will be used to validate the medium-size experiments to be performed using the UCSD shaking table and laminar box. Advanced data analysis techniques-including system identification and visualizations-will be used to process and compare the results from the three facilities, with engineering interpretations and computer simulations.</AbstractNarration>
