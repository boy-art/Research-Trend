    <AbstractNarration>The research project applies modern methods in analysis, computation&lt;br/&gt;and probability to the modeling turbulent flows arising in geophysical&lt;br/&gt;fluid dynamics. Specifically, the projects investigates statistical&lt;br/&gt;theories of coherent structures in turbulence, which in a model&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere or ocean usually take the form of long-lived, large-scale&lt;br/&gt;jets and vortices. The approach builds on recent developments in the&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium statistical theory of such structures, which has now&lt;br/&gt;matured to the point that it can be justified mathematically,&lt;br/&gt;implemented computationally and applied succesfully to geophysical&lt;br/&gt;models. A prime example is the recent model of the zonal jets and&lt;br/&gt;vortical spots in the atmosphere of Jupiter, whose predictions agree&lt;br/&gt;remarkably well with observational data. In light of these&lt;br/&gt;developments, the goals of the project are two-fold. First, the&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium statistical theory of coherent structures is elaborated&lt;br/&gt;for increasingly realistic geophysical models, such as multi-layer&lt;br/&gt;quasi-geostrophic models and shallow-water models. The physical&lt;br/&gt;implications of the theory are investigated by computing families of&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium structures and deriving nonlinear stability theorems for&lt;br/&gt;them. Second, a novel approach to statistical closure is developed&lt;br/&gt;from the corresponding nonequilibrium theory. Unlike traditional&lt;br/&gt;closure schemes for fluid turbulence, this new methodology derives&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic equations for some specified resolved variables by&lt;br/&gt;conditioning random paths of microstates on the ensemble-averaged&lt;br/&gt;dynamics for those resolved variables. A combined theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;computational investigation of this approximation to nonequilibrium&lt;br/&gt;behavior is undertaken for some prototype problems. In the context of&lt;br/&gt;model geophysical systems with damping and driving, this approach is&lt;br/&gt;envisioned as a general procedure for deriving effective subgrid-scale&lt;br/&gt;parametrizations of unresolved eddies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turbulent fluid flow remains one of the unsolved puzzles of physical&lt;br/&gt;science. A better theoretical understanding of turbulence is needed&lt;br/&gt;as a basis for the computational simulation of almost all natural&lt;br/&gt;fluid motions. This is especially true of geophysical fluid flows --&lt;br/&gt;the motions of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere -- which involve&lt;br/&gt;complex motions over a wide range of scales, from meters up to the&lt;br/&gt;planetary size. Every modern computer code used in weather&lt;br/&gt;forecasting or climate prediction requires special, but often&lt;br/&gt;unreliable, assumptions about how the small-scale turbulent motions&lt;br/&gt;affect the computed large-scale behavior. The research conducted in&lt;br/&gt;this project addresses the general issue of modeling a complex fluid&lt;br/&gt;flow -- a mathematical prototype of an atmosphere or ocean -- in such&lt;br/&gt;a way that its predominant large-scale features can be captured&lt;br/&gt;reliably without resolving the full complexity of its small-scale&lt;br/&gt;motions. In particular, the work seeks to develop the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;and computational tools necessary to predict the behavior of modeled&lt;br/&gt;geophysical fluid systems which exhibit organized features on large&lt;br/&gt;scales but disordered and random motions on a range of small scales.&lt;br/&gt;To do so, the project draws on sophisticated techniques from&lt;br/&gt;statistical physics to construct theoretical models of complex systems&lt;br/&gt;of this kind, and thereby to provide efficient and reliable methods&lt;br/&gt;for computing their expected or most probable behavior. A recent&lt;br/&gt;example of this approach is the remarkably successful explanation of&lt;br/&gt;the persistent jetstreams and vortices, such as the Great Red Spot, in&lt;br/&gt;the atmosphere of the giant planet Jupiter, which for the first time&lt;br/&gt;shows quantitative and qualitative agreement between mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theory and NASA spacecraft observations. In the context of Earth's&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere and oceans, such theoretical models and computational&lt;br/&gt;methods can used as building blocks in predictions about the long-term&lt;br/&gt;trends in the ocean-atmosphere system.</AbstractNarration>
