    <AbstractNarration>Stanford University continues operating a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with a multi-institutional Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) which includes, in addition to Stanford, UC-Davis, UC-Berkeley, and IBM-Almaden Research Center. The MRSEC research focuses on polymer interfaces and macromolecular assemblies. Eighteen undergraduate students are recruited nationwide with a recruitment focus on undergraduates from two-year and four-year institutions, as well as members form underrepresented groups. Students are involved in research in polymer science at all four US institutions, as well as at some of the industrial affiliates laboratories and at collaborating institutions in Germany. In addition, REU students participate in professional development and group social activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site includes a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) component. Four teachers are recruited every year for an 8-week summer research experience</AbstractNarration>
