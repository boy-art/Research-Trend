    <AbstractNarration>Massachusetts General Hospital, representing Partners HealthCare System, Inc., is producing a large format film on the brain that is designed to increase the popular understanding of brain biology and recent advances in neuroscience. Framed within the larger question of the unique abilities of the human mind, the project will take an interdisciplinary look at brain science and raise questions about the nature and biological basis of diverse aspects of human experience including consciousness. By following a rider in the Tour de France, the film will illustrate how the brain functions in both normal and stressful situations. Major sequences will explore vision, memory and emotion. Slightly shorter sequences will delve into imagination and creativity, language, dreams and pain. Brief "interludes" will allow the film to reflect on the brain as it is represented in a range of human capabilities. Finally, the film turns it attention to consciousness, self-awareness and the totality of experiencing life as a human. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach components of the project include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A weeklong national symposium for museum educators, teachers, and community organizations from all regions of the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow up regional "Brain Workshops" designed to provide more focused project support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The Brain: Exploratory Trips Into the Final Frontier" -- An Educator/Student Activity Guide&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun Facts Family Guide to "The Brain" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Educational Lobby Kiosk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Head Trip: A Voyage Through the Young Human Mind" -- An illustrated instructional brochure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Brain Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The film will be directed by Bayley Silleck whose prior large format films include "Cosmic Voyage" and "Lost Worlds: Life in the Balance." The lead scientific advisors are Dr. Dennis Selkow, Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Anne Young, Julieanne Dorn Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. There also will be a seven-member advisory committee composed of neuroscientists, psychologists and philosophers.</AbstractNarration>
