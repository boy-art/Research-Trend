    <AbstractNarration>In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. This proposal consists of various segments addressing GLOBE Program needs: support for an existing protocol, support for teacher training and outreach, data quality control, student surveys on attitudes about the environment and climate misconceptions, and finally, scientific research based on GLOBE data.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will support the existing Atmosphere Protocols including an assessment of the quality of the data already received. Information from other GLOBE investigations (Soils, Land Cover/Biology, Phenology) and external data will be used to address scientific questions relating to climate feedback, including that of human-caused land-use changes.</AbstractNarration>
