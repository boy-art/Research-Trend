    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to expand our knowledge of communication theory, information theory, and signal processing, and to make an immediate impact in practical wireless communication systems and networks. The research builds upon the general theory and code design strategy for space-time coding. The mathematical methods, algorithms, and concepts developed in this research is applicable and initiates new activities in many different areas of communications and applied mathematics. These areas include modem design, equalization, beam-forming, linear algebra, and so&lt;br/&gt;on. Of course, the immediate impacts are in increasing the data rates of wireless communication systems as well as advancing our understanding of the behavior of multiple-input multiple-output&lt;br/&gt;channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, there is a fundamental theoretical limit which prohibits us from designing full-rate orthogonal space-time block codes for more than two transmit antennas. Also, the available codes have not achieved the best performance claimed by information theory, so there exists a gap between what is possible, and the state of codes today. We seek to eliminate this gap by designing new classes of codes that provide full diversity, high rate, small complexity, high performance and mathematically interesting structures.</AbstractNarration>
