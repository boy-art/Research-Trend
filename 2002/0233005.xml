    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the skill gap that&lt;br/&gt;exists within the software development community in the production of work-centered&lt;br/&gt;software. To this end, Stottler Henke will develop a novel software development&lt;br/&gt;environment that reduces the complexity of interaction design &amp;#8211; bridging the gap&lt;br/&gt;between the analysis of the work domain and the development of well-designed supporting&lt;br/&gt;software. The proposed WorkWell system will provide for an enhanced Contextual Design&lt;br/&gt;process with tools that enable software developers to draw on the aggregate experience of&lt;br/&gt;other work-centered application designers. This will be achieved through the application&lt;br/&gt;of proven design/interaction patterns that will, for instance, enable software developers&lt;br/&gt;to resolve the conflicts between the desire for automation and user&amp;#8217;s need for a&lt;br/&gt;feeling of control. Further, WorkWell will support an incremental process for mapping the&lt;br/&gt;semantics of user goals to underlying software functionality and the user interface&lt;br/&gt;design. Phase I will result in a limited prototype that will demonstrate the feasibility&lt;br/&gt;of the proposed approach. The results of these efforts will have a great impact on&lt;br/&gt;society &amp;#8211; furthering the understanding of work-centered design and enabling&lt;br/&gt;corporations to produce software that will enjoy higher user adoption rates and improve&lt;br/&gt;efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;There is a large market for tools that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of&lt;br/&gt;software development efforts. The WorkWell system offers corporations the means to&lt;br/&gt;produce intuitive and effective software under the time and resource limitations that&lt;br/&gt;exist in the commercial world and thereby achieve much higher user adoption rates for&lt;br/&gt;their products.</AbstractNarration>
