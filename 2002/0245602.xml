    <AbstractNarration>Topology, as a branch of geometry, seeks to classify, characterize and &lt;br/&gt;explore those abstract spaces known as manifolds. Manifolds are locally &lt;br/&gt;like ordinary euclidean spaces(the line, the plane, etc.); however, they &lt;br/&gt;are allowed to have global twisting, curving and holes (e.g., circles, &lt;br/&gt;spheres, tori). They arise in many models of physical and biological&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. Manifolds with singularities, or stratified spaces, are even &lt;br/&gt;more ubiquitous as they appear as solution spaces of algebraic and &lt;br/&gt;differential equations and as limits, degenerations and compactifications &lt;br/&gt;of manifolds. Hughes has made a breakthrough in the understanding of &lt;br/&gt;topologically stratified spaces by establishing a theory of the&lt;br/&gt;neighborhoods of the singularities. This allows one to use geometric &lt;br/&gt;techniques almost as if the singularities were not present. The current &lt;br/&gt;project is largely concerned with exploiting this technique to further &lt;br/&gt;the understanding of manifolds with singularities. As an example, Hughes &lt;br/&gt;will investigate the extent of periodicity near the singular sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research concerns the topology and geometry of manifolds, &lt;br/&gt;stratified spaces, trees and metric spaces. The investigations are in &lt;br/&gt;the areas of stratified spaces, trees, ultrametrics and noncommutative &lt;br/&gt;geometry and the fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory. The main &lt;br/&gt;tools are controlled topology, surgery theory and C*-algebras of groupoids. &lt;br/&gt;Specific questions concern periodicity in the neighborhood of the singular &lt;br/&gt;set of a manifold stratified space, the classification of stratified &lt;br/&gt;h-cobordisms and stratified pseudoisotopies, and non-locally flat topological &lt;br/&gt;embeddings. In addition, techniques from noncommutative geometry will be &lt;br/&gt;applied to study the geometry of infinite trees and other non-compact spaces &lt;br/&gt;at infinity.</AbstractNarration>
