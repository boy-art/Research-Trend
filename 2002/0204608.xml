    <AbstractNarration>The work in this proposal is aimed at furthering our understanding of the basic laws and forces of nature. New ideas and techniques in string theory will be developed. String theory is currently the most succesful attempt to combine quantum mechanics and gravity into a unified framework with the strong, weak and electormagnetic forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard model of particle physics has had many experimental successes, but it must be replaced by a more complete theory at higher energies. Supersymmetry, a relation between particles with different spin, is an important ingredient in many theories of particle physics at higher energy scales. This work should lead to new insights into the role of supersymmetry in string theory and particle physics. This work is also likely to have applications to areas of mathematics concerned with geometry and singularities.</AbstractNarration>
