    <AbstractNarration>The overall research objective of this award is to advance the state-of-the-art in mechanistic theoretical modeling of the response of cells and tissues to cryopresevation in order to make possible the rational design of freeze/thaw protocols which cause minimal cell damage. This is to be done by: (1) modeling water &lt;br/&gt;transport in high Peclet number regimes; (2) modeling of the thawing process; (3) measuring physical properties of cryoprotectant solutions; (4) verifying the models; (5) analyzing tissue cryopreservation; and (6) integrating the optimization of freezing and thawing protocols. The educational objectives are to: (1) enhance awareness of biology among engineers and of engineering methods among biologists and clinicians via cross-cutting educational activities; and (2) use these interactions to enhance educational experiences for students. The educational objectives are to be achieved by using four integrated strategies.</AbstractNarration>
