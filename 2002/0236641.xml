    <AbstractNarration>The difficulties faced by second language learners with respect to novel phoneme contrasts are well-documented and are primarily attributed to the influence of the native language (e.g., the contrast between singleton /t/ and geminate /tt/ in languages like Japanese and Arabic is difficult for native speakers of English because /t/ and /tt/ are not contrastive in English). However, little is yet known about the nature of the evidence that learners can use to improve their ability to perceive such contrasts. Under the direction of Dr. Michael Hammond, and with NSF support, Ms. Rachel Hayes will study the acquisition of second language phoneme contrasts for her doctoral dissertation. The research involves training monolingual English speakers to perceive novel phoneme contrasts in a language that is new to them, and then testing participants on both their ability to perceive the difference between the phonemes and their ability to learn vocabulary in the new language that contains the contrasting phonemes.&lt;br/&gt;This research is significant for the fields of speech perception, second language acquisition, and second language pedagogy. A fuller understanding of the types of evidence that listeners can make use of to learn novel second language sound contrasts may ultimately contribute to improved pedagogical techniques for helping adults overcome their initial difficulties in perceiving novel second language phoneme contrasts.</AbstractNarration>
