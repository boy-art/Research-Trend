    <AbstractNarration>In this project, we propose an intensive program to develop new controller design&lt;br/&gt;methodologies for a variety of inherently nonlinear systems, and to apply the findings to&lt;br/&gt;the control problems of underactuated mechanical systems, mobile robots with flex link,&lt;br/&gt;and other practical systems with various uncertainties. The systems under consideration do&lt;br/&gt;not have a controllable linearization that is a common requirement of existing control&lt;br/&gt;schemes. Therefore, most of the control problems for these systems are still open and&lt;br/&gt;indeed bring new challenges to the control engineering. In this project, we concentrate on&lt;br/&gt;the development of both theoretically sound and practically useful controller design&lt;br/&gt;schemes, which enable us to solve the difficult problems of global stabilization, adaptive&lt;br/&gt;regulation, and output feedback control, for inherently nonlinear systems that cannot be&lt;br/&gt;adequately controlled using the existing methods.&lt;br/&gt;Our primary approach relies on the adding a power integrator technique developed by the&lt;br/&gt;proposer and collaborators, which fully utilizes the nonlinearity of the systems to&lt;br/&gt;effectively control the inherently nonlinear systems. The recent research work based on&lt;br/&gt;this tool has led to new solutions to a number of control problems for systems with&lt;br/&gt;uncontrollable linearization, and suggests that very promising advances can be achieved by&lt;br/&gt;this research program.&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this CAREER development plan aims at developing and reshaping&lt;br/&gt;courses, introducing innovative teaching techniques, mentoring undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, setting up new laboratories, and creating research-oriented projects and&lt;br/&gt;hands-on experiments. With all these efforts, we believe that the research program can be&lt;br/&gt;effectively integrated into the academic curriculum of the University of Texas at San&lt;br/&gt;Antonio. Moreover, while exposing the students to state-of-the-art techniques, the&lt;br/&gt;education plan will also help bridge the gap between theoretical research and engineering&lt;br/&gt;practice, and therefore stimulate students' interest in control engineering.</AbstractNarration>
