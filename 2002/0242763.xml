    <AbstractNarration>The Simplot Decision Support Center (SDSC, 1991) and National Information Assurance Training and Education Center (NIATEC, 1999), components of Idaho State University's College of Business were established in response to the overwhelming need for computer-related security education and research. In May 1999 the NSA designated the Idaho State University one of the initial seven Centers of Excellence in Information Assurance Education. This project will expand the Center's current role in relieving the shortage of qualified information assurance personnel by providing financial support through NSF's Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program for 30 graduate/undergraduate students as participants in a rigorous academic program. The highlights of Idaho State University's program are: &lt;br/&gt;__ Faculty committed to working with undergraduates in a training and education environment to support an ongoing research program. &lt;br/&gt;__ Immediate integration of students in existing research programs in information assurance &lt;br/&gt;__ A Cyber Research Seminar emphasizing critical thinking, leadership, and communication skills &lt;br/&gt;__ Expanding Horizons Seminars presented by experts in the field of information assurance &lt;br/&gt;__ An ethics component, in the form of an integrated sequence of lectures and discussion. &lt;br/&gt;__ Development of professional skills through mentoring, training, and experience. &lt;br/&gt;__ Service, as coordinated by the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM), to give students the opportunity to serve by solving specific real problems in information assurance.</AbstractNarration>
