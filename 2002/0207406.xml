    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this workshop is to bring together international researchers and practitioners dealing with localization in geomechanics. The focus of the 2002 workshop will be to collect and debate the applications that have taken place since the first workshop in 1988. The scope of the workshop will include analytical solutions, numerical methods, experimental techniques, and case histories. Besides the presentation of fundamental research findings, applications in geotechnical, petroleum, mining, and bulk materials engineering will be emphasized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Failure of many geotechnical structures is characterized by the formation and propagation of zones of localized deformation. For example, a noticeable feature of slope and underground failures in soft rock and overconsolidated clay is the appearance of slip surfaces or shear bands, the characteristics of which are associated with deformation being concentrated in narrow zones and the surrounding material appearing intact. The appearance of localization or other bifurcation modes often manifests itself in specimen or system instability under specific loading conditions. The mathematical formulation of bifurcation phenomena and related instabilities constitutes the basis of a continuum theory of failure. This theory and its applications, as well as the methodology of analyzing instabilities in general, are crucial in adequate modeling and safe design of numerous geotechnical engineering problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five international workshops on bifurcation and localization in geomechanics have been held in Europe, Japan, and Australia: 1. Karlsruhe, Germany: 1988. 2. Gdansk, Poland: 1989. 3. Aussois, France: 1993. 4. Gifu, Japan: 1997. 5. Perth, Australia: 1999. The University of Minnesota was selected as the site for the 6th Workshop to be held on June 2-5, 2002.</AbstractNarration>
