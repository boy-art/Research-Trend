    <AbstractNarration>Mathematics (21)&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics placement examinations are widely used in higher education because adequate preparation is extremely important for student success in mathematics courses. However, our survey indicates that most placement testing falls short of its potential value for assessment and learning due either to the tests themselves or the way in which they are (not) used. In this project, we are creating a testing system accessible on the Internet that includes placement tests, practice exams, and online explanations of concepts and solutions for students who require more assistance. One of the main aims of this project is to improve the curriculum through assessment. Therefore, we also plan to use this tool to assess the effectiveness of selected mathematics courses by administering "exit exams." Such "outcomes-based" assessment is currently being encouraged by accreditation agencies. Our plan is to do this by linking placement exams in a given course to the exit exam in its prerequisite course. We are also making the system available to high school students and their advisors in order to assess readiness for college level math courses. Such "Early Placement Tests" have been given to high school sophomores and juniors in several states across the country for years. The integration of an early placement test into our system is simply one more piece in a comprehensive system of placement, assessment and learning to improve curriculum and instruction.</AbstractNarration>
