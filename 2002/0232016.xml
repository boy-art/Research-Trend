    <AbstractNarration>Building on a currrent GK-12 project (DGE 9979656) the University of Hawaii and the the Hawaii Department of Education are working to ensure sustainability of the collaboration that has been forged between them. Graduate students in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology (EECB) are interacting with and improving the content knowledge and inquiry skills of students and teachers at K-12 schools in Hawaii. The graduate and undergraduate Fellows are learning current science education reform efforts including national and state standards for science education while teaching science through inquiry to improve their own communication and teaching skills. Science teachers are provided with professional development opportunities to gain current knowledge of research in ecology, evolution and conservation biology in Hawaii. The graduate and undergraduate Fellows serve as role models of practicing scientists by engaging K-12 students and teachers as active participants in ongoing research in the EECB program. Thus a culture of collaboration between science research and science education is being developed in Hawaii. The graduate fellows bring information from the natural laboratory to the K-12 students and teachers in the classroom, and also bring the K-12 students and teachers to the natural laboratory in field-based activities. Previous projects have contributed to real-life situations within the local communities. In one case, the data collected by the K-12 students resulted in the eradication of an incipient invasion of an alien ant species as well as the discovery of two previously unrecorded species of ants. Thus, besides the intellectual merits of the current program in Hawaii, the individual projects are having a broad impact on issues being addressed by the local communities. Collaborative relationships are being developed with more than 20 community, government (federal, state and county), and professional agencies/organizations. Through these collaborations K-12 educators and students are developing a better understanding of the fragility of the island ecosystems and the importance of efforts made to conserve them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project title: Using the Native Biota for Science Education&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Hawaii&lt;br/&gt;PI/Co-PI: Kenneth Kanashiro, Sheila Conant, Robert Kinzie, Donald Young&lt;br/&gt;Partner School Districts: Hawaii State Department of Education&lt;br/&gt;Funding: $ 1,482,270&lt;br/&gt;Number of fellows/year: 10 graduate, 2 undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Urban, Suburban, Rural&lt;br/&gt;Target audience: K-12&lt;br/&gt;NSF supported disciplines involved: Biology</AbstractNarration>
