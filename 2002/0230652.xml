    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230652&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Crumpton-Young, Lesia&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of Central Florida&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Reengineering The Undergraduate IEMS Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reengineering the Undergraduate IEMS Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this grant is to assess, strategize, and generate plans for enhancing the undergraduate program in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Systems at The University of Central Florida. Enhancement of the Undergraduate program should yield the following: an increased attraction by students to pursue degrees in IE, better retention of students in IE majors, and better preparation of IE graduates to meet the future workforce needs of engineers employed in a high-tech society. Additionally, planning efforts undertaken in this proposed planning grant will help to establish a framework that can be used by Industrial Engineering departments interested in improving their courses, curriculum, methods of delivery, instructional strategies, and overall preparation of their graduates. Planning activities undertaken in this proposed grant will initially be disseminated through the following venues: American Society of Engineering Education Conferences, Institute of Industrial Engineering National Conference, IIE Council of Academic Department Heads, ASEE Journal of Engineering Education, ASEE Prism Magazine, and the UCF WWW. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives to be pursued during this planning grant to ensure that the &lt;br/&gt;overall goals of this project are met include: 1) developing plans for introducing &lt;br/&gt;emerging topics into the IE curriculum; 2) developing plans for increasing student &lt;br/&gt;holistic problem solving capabilities; 3) developing plans for including more &lt;br/&gt;experiential/active learning exercises; 4) developing plans for incorporating more &lt;br/&gt;technology into classrooms; 5) developing plans for improving instructional strategies &lt;br/&gt;and faculty professional development; 6) developing plans for enhancing professional &lt;br/&gt;development and leadership capabilities of students; and 7) developing plans for &lt;br/&gt;exploiting partnerships to increase the number of talented students in IE disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
