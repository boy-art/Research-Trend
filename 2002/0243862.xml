    <AbstractNarration>Institution: Auburn University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EIA - 0243862&lt;br/&gt;PI: Saad Biaz&lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Proposal: REU Site for Pervasive and Mobile Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborator:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EIA - 0244156&lt;br/&gt;PI: Joel Jones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a collaborative effort of two Computer Science departments in two universities to establish an REU site in Pervasive and Mobile Computing. The collaboration supports 16 undergraduate students per year at the two campuses who would not be otherwise exposed to research. This Site builds on complementary expertise of the two institutions and on existing collaborative research projects in pervasive and mobile computing. One university contributes expertise in wireless systems and in minority student education, and the other will contributes expertise in emergency reporting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-university pervasive and mobile computing project is developing a system architecture for integrating information appliances such as PDA's and 3G mobile phones into first-responders' operations in emergency situations. The goal of the research in which the undergraduates participate is to define not a particular &lt;br/&gt;system but a framework for public-sector mobile data systems based on empirical data derived from ongoing development of such systems.</AbstractNarration>
