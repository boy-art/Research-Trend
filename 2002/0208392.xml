    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002. The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Comparing urban and rural forests: using city environments to model long-term changes in forests under predicted changes in global climates." Forests are predicted to change their distributions in response to global changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition, carbon dioxide, and temperature. Urban forests have experienced these conditions for decades and represent unique systems to look for novel changes in the dynamics of forests under predicted global change scenarios.</AbstractNarration>
