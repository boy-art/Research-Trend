    <AbstractNarration>0071858&lt;br/&gt;Zheng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to study some nonlinear partial differential equations from &lt;br/&gt;fluid dynamics and liquid crystal physics. These equations are the laws of &lt;br/&gt;motion of their respective physics. The turbulent nature and/or defects in &lt;br/&gt;the materials make the solutions of the equations singular, unstable, and &lt;br/&gt;hard to calculate. It is planned to use advanced analytical tools to study &lt;br/&gt;the structures of the singular solutions. In the case of the liquid crystal &lt;br/&gt;wave equation, for example, the plan is to study it as one of the simplest &lt;br/&gt;examples of nonlinear generalizations of the basic linear wave equation. It &lt;br/&gt;can be seen from its elegant form that there will be many applications of &lt;br/&gt;the equation in the future. Singularities of its solutions have been shown to &lt;br/&gt;exist recently by the principal investigator and his collaborators. It is these &lt;br/&gt;singularities that block the establishment of a general theory of existence, &lt;br/&gt;uniqueness, and stability of solutions. It is planned to do detailed estimates &lt;br/&gt;and analysis on the singularities and improve current compactness &lt;br/&gt;arguments to form an existence theory of solutions. The result of the &lt;br/&gt;investigation will be a clear understanding of the worst possible solutions, &lt;br/&gt;and thereby quantify our knowledge of the physics and offer guidance in &lt;br/&gt;numerical computations of general solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will involve the study of some applied mathematical &lt;br/&gt;problems in the fields of fluid dynamics (which includes motion of the air &lt;br/&gt;and water) and liquid crystal physics in material science. Scientists and &lt;br/&gt;engineers have used mathematical equations, called partial differential &lt;br/&gt;equations, to model the motions. The turbulent nature and/or defects in the &lt;br/&gt;materials show up in the form of singularities and instabilities in the &lt;br/&gt;solutions of the equations. It is these singularities and instabilities that &lt;br/&gt;often spoil accurate numerical computations of the solutions. It is planned &lt;br/&gt;to use the state of the art analytical tools to study the structures of the &lt;br/&gt;singular solutions. In the case of a compressible gas such as air, for &lt;br/&gt;example, the principal investigator plans to isolate typical singularities &lt;br/&gt;(hurricanes, tornadoes, shocks, etc.) and investigate their individual &lt;br/&gt;structures. The result of the investigation will be a clear understanding of &lt;br/&gt;the worst possible solutions, and thereby quantify our knowledge of the &lt;br/&gt;physics and offer guidance in high-performance numerical computations &lt;br/&gt;of general solutions.</AbstractNarration>
