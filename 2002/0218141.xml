    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed activities under the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) with Agere Systems Inc. is to develop a strong well-integrated research and education program focused on the understanding of the mechanical and tribological properties of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) processes for semiconductor manufacturing applications. Integration of low-k materials in the metallization structures creates severe problems during process integration. One of the major challenges in the process integration after the incorporation of low-k materials is CMP of these films due to the reduced modulus and cohesive strength. Due to the emergence of CMP as the method of choice for global planarization of dielectric and metal films, the frictional forces generated during the CMP process have assumed significant importance. Understanding the mechanical and tribological properties of complex stacks involving low-k dielectrics is critical for successful evaluation and implementation of these materials and the main goals of the proposed research are to obtain the fundamental understanding of the nature of surface planarization and identify the mechanism to control the CMP process. As part of this GOALI proposal, Agere Systems Inc. will support as in-kind services like: a) provide CMP consumables (wafer, slurry, and pad) to perform the CMP experiments, b) provide engineer/scientist from the industry to serve as a thesis/dissertation advisor, b) provide resident workspace for a graduate student together with all on-site cost of materials and supplies to support the research, c) assign one engineer/scientist (approximately 10 % of their time to work and monitor the progress of the research), e) to emphasize technology transfer and implementation of research findings in manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;This GOALI proposal aims to synergize the Agere-USF partnership by providing opportunities for faculty, postdoctoral fellows and students to conduct research and gain experience with production processes in an industrial setting. The university-industry collaboration will provide additional opportunity for students to work with industrial scientists and use of their additional state-of-the-art equipment facilities. Apart from providing hands-on experience, the proposed research will provide a unique opportunity for the students to be involved in interdisciplinary research- a must for future success. Results of the project will be disseminated by paper presentation in regional and national conferences, and published in appropriate scientific journals</AbstractNarration>
