    <AbstractNarration>This project will study interactions between three distinct systems: (1) photovoltaic molecules and/or membrane structures derived from green plants and artificial photosynthetic systems, (2) micron-scale electrode arrays formed by metal wires in microchannel glass, and (3) the retina. The proposed research will provide a knowledge and technology base necessary to integrate these systems towards the successful development of a novel, energy-efficient retinal prosthesis with a micron scale spatial resolution. More specifically, these objectives will be pursued:&lt;br/&gt; - Investigate interactions between natural and artificial photoactive structures and microchannel glass electrode arrays and to determine methods of attaching the structures to individual microwires.&lt;br/&gt; - Develop methods for depositing conductors throughout the entire length of the microchannels.&lt;br/&gt; - Determine the optimal size and shape for a retinal stimulating electrode.&lt;br/&gt; - Test the biocompatibility of the microchannel glass and photoactivated microchannel glass.&lt;br/&gt;Results of this research are likely to have broader application through improved understanding of metal/molecular interfaces, imaging technology, novel microfabrication techniques, and biological interfacing and testing.</AbstractNarration>
