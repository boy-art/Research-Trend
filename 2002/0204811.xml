    <AbstractNarration>0204811&lt;br/&gt;Fetea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current understanding of both nuclear structure and nucleo-synthesis is largely based on what is known of the properties of stable and long-lived near-stable nuclei. An unexplored landscape containing more than 90% of all expected bound nuclear systems, a region where many new nuclear phenomena are anticipated still needs to be explored. Early experiments on unstable nuclei have already revealed surprises. Such phenomena as halo nuclei suggest that some of the cherished concepts of nuclear structure may apply only to a set of relatively stable nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will theoretically study, the nuclei in the and 160 mass regions. These nuclei have shown a number of features that challenge our understanding of nuclear structure, of particular interest being the signature splitting/inversion and "chiral twin bands" phenomena. Calculations in various model frameworks (particle rotor model including both a residual pn interaction and a deformation, total routhian surface calculations, cranking shell and tilted axis cranking model) will be performed to elucidate the underlying physical properties responsible for the signature splitting/inversion and "chiral twin bands" phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The involvement of undergraduate students in this research project will enhance students' interest in physics and provide a training environment for their preparation for mainstream study.</AbstractNarration>
