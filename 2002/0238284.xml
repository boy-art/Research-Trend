    <AbstractNarration>Advances in robotics and computer-based technology have enabled complex work to be performed via remote control, such as in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The long-term goals of this research are to improve the development and integration of robotic technology into surgical practices and the training of surgical skills in MIS, which will have a significant impact on patient safety and healthcare delivery. The specific aims are to 1) study the effects of robotic technology on the surgical process in MIS, 2) develop methodologies for analyzing complex surgical processes in MIS, and metrics for assessing technology and surgeon performance in MIS, 3) design effective interfaces and informational aids to enhance surgeons' performance, 4) support the training of surgeons in MIS with modular computer-based training tools, 5) contribute to the theoretical understanding of human performance and error remediation in dynamic remote environments, 6) develop and promote the interdisciplinary approach to complex systems analysis and design in graduate and undergraduate curriculum, using the proposed research activities as course material for realistic case-based problem-solving exercises, 7) develop and promote hands-on learning through project related research activities in undergraduate education, and 8) train successful research scientists and human factors engineers through teaching and mentoring activities.</AbstractNarration>
