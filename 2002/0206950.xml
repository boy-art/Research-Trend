    <AbstractNarration>This research is focused on demonstrating novel ROOM TEMPERATURE&lt;br/&gt;infrared photodetectors based on electrochemically self assembled nanowire&lt;br/&gt;arrays. Photodetection is based on photoexcitation of electrons from&lt;br/&gt;subband states in the nanowire to trap states in the surrounding&lt;br/&gt;insulator. This leads to an "inverse" photodetection effect whereby the &lt;br/&gt;conductivity of the photodetector drops when irradiated with infrared radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary experiments [Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 79, 4423 (2001)] have&lt;br/&gt;shown that these photodetectors can operate at room temperature with a&lt;br/&gt;signal to noise ratio of 45 dB. The purpose of the NER project will&lt;br/&gt;be to extend this result to create (1) multi-colored detectors using&lt;br/&gt;different sized nanowires self assembled on the same wafer, and (2) a&lt;br/&gt;complementary photodetector where a normal photodetector is synthesized&lt;br/&gt;in series with an inverse photodetector. The complementary photodetector&lt;br/&gt;will be able to detect a very narrow band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will involve significant work by undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;The samples that exhibited the novel photodetection effect were&lt;br/&gt;prepared by an undergraduate student in the PI's lab.</AbstractNarration>
