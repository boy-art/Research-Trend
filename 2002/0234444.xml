    <AbstractNarration>Most modern single processor architectures focus on exploiting instruction-level parallelism. However, despite continued performance improvements, there is increasing doubt that aggressive ILP architecture techniques would continue bringing the desired improvements and that there will come about a diminishing return in the performance of single-chip architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multithreaded execution models promise to exploit thread-level parallelism (TLP) beyond a pure ILP approach. Multithreading can be applied directly at the level of uniprocessor instruction-set architectures. For example, Simultaneous MultiThreading (SMT) is a promising approach, which is attracting the attention of a number of academic and industrial research groups. This technique allows the various pipelines of a "superscalar" processor to be efficiently utilized by scheduling from several "coarse-grain" threads of one (or several) program(s). Although exploiting both ILP and TLP is attractive, the following questions are investigated in the project:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Can an architecture model, which integrates fine-grain multithreading support with a coarse-grain multithreaded architecture model such as SMT, be developed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- What are the design trade-off when mapping these architecture features to single-chip implementations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- What compiling methodology for the proposed architecture model would exploit thread-level parallelism at both coarse and fine-grain levels?</AbstractNarration>
