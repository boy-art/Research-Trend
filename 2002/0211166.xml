    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports theoretical research aimed at calculating and understanding the physical properties of strongly interacting, many-electron materials. Numerical, as well as phenomenological analytic calculations for basic models such as the Heisenberg, Hubbard, t-J, and the electron-phonon Holstein model are proposed. The goal of this research is to understand the properties of specific systems. In particular, what type of order or competing orders, such as antiferromagnetism, charge density wave, superconductivity, stripe domain wall formation, or hidden topological order with quantum number fractionalization does a given system exhibit. In addition, what are the basic mechanisms responsible for these phenomena and what limits the energy scales or temperatures, where these various orders appear. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This group is one of the world leaders in computational studies of strongly interacting many-body physics.&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;This grant supports theoretical research aimed at calculating and understanding the physical properties of strongly interacting, many-electron materials. The problems addressed are at the forefront of of the field and the numerical methods used are state-of-the-art. The PI has also been very successful working with students and postdoctoral associates.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
