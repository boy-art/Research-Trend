    <AbstractNarration>0243752&lt;br/&gt;Hobson&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish a summer research experience exchange program between Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Engineering and the Faculty of Engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. By facilitating the international exchange of students, ideas, and cooperative research opportunities among faculty, this project embodies the objective of the National Science Foundation to ensure "that future generations of U.S. scientists and engineers gain professional experience beyond the United States' borders early in their careers." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will work on research projects in mechanical, industrial, aeronautical, electrical, and information engineering and will have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation. The projects will be carefully chosen to address issues that the students would not normally see in the U.S. or at their home institution. The summer research experience will foster and strengthen collaborations between the partner universities, thus enhancing the research and educational opportunities for current and future students. This experience will provide students with top-notch research experiences, raise their awareness of global science and engineering challenges, and provide them with a greater appreciation for diverse cultures and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Directorate for Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
