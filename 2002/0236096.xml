    <AbstractNarration>Ectomycorrhizal (EM )spore banks are a fundamental,but poorly studied&lt;br/&gt;component,of plant-fungal community ecology.EM spore banks can provide&lt;br/&gt;the inoculum necessary for tree recruitment following severe disturbance and&lt;br/&gt;may facilitate tree invasion into bordering non-forested areas.Rhizopogon species&lt;br/&gt;are the most abundant component of spore banks in many western North&lt;br/&gt;American pinaceous ecosystems,and in some forest-border settings they appear&lt;br/&gt;to be virtually the entire spore bank.This proposal is focused on understanding&lt;br/&gt;the spatial and temporal dynamics of Rhizopogon spore banks in the context of&lt;br/&gt;cyclic fire and pine regeneration.A conceptual model for these interactions is&lt;br/&gt;proposed,and five specific hypotheses related to the model are tested.These&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses focus on differences in spore longevity and spore dispersal among&lt;br/&gt;Rhizopogon species,and on differences in mode and frequency of dispersal within&lt;br/&gt;mature-forests and post-fire forests.Measured parameters include:i)spatial&lt;br/&gt;pattern of the spore shadow in forest border zones,ii)current dispersal rates and&lt;br/&gt;modes into these zones,iii)spore longevity of three key Rhizopogon species and&lt;br/&gt;iv)longevity of complex native spore banks.Hypotheses will be tested by&lt;br/&gt;combining the techniques of bioassays,molecular ecology,large-scale spatial&lt;br/&gt;sampling,and seed bank ecology.The work addresses a crucial,but essentially&lt;br/&gt;unstudied,component of community ecology (i.e.,EM spore banks),and&lt;br/&gt;provides an analogous system in which to test ideas developed for plant seed&lt;br/&gt;banks.The broader impacts of this work are its direct relationship to forest&lt;br/&gt;regeneration and expansion;the ability to predict the spatial and temporal extent&lt;br/&gt;of the EM spore banks will provide forest managers with a rational way to assess&lt;br/&gt;the likelihood of EM inoculum in highly disturbed systems.</AbstractNarration>
