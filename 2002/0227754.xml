    <AbstractNarration>0227754&lt;br/&gt;Cheatham &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to the Middle Tennessee State University to support the activity described below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060). The partners include the Middle Tennessee State University (Lead Institution), Austin Peay State University, Tennessee State University, Tennessee Technological University, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Oakland High School, Riverdale High School, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Tennessee Department of Health, Communicable and Environmental; Disease Services, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, BioVentures Inc, Esoterx Center of Innovative Research, Orchid Cellmark, Tennessee Biotechnology Association. The program includes: establishment of training programs; provision of equipment and materials; development of laboratories for teachers to encourage the use of hands-on biotechnology exercises in science curricula; establishment of internships for teachers to work in the partner companies; establishment of a seminar course for students and company employees in biotechnology; and enhancement of biotechnological growth by developing and applying novel sensors in microarray technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently there are more than 50 biotech companies in the region that have started with research done at the regional universities. This proposed effort will provide the workforce to make and keep these companies competitive in the biotech industry. It will also provide the workforce for additional jobs created by the regional university research enterprise. These jobs will have considerably higher salaries than the traditional jobs in the region. The academic institutions involved serve traditionally underrepresented groups. In addition minority students will be involved in this effort.</AbstractNarration>
