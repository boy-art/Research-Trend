    <AbstractNarration>The establishment of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) at the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Arizona State University focuses on Telecommunication Circuits and Systems for the advancement of the next generation of telecommunication systems. The objective of the Center is to establish a cooperative research center for Arizona State University researchers and industry partners to work together on the advancement of integrated circuits and systems for telecommunication by identifying new technologies that will enable "system-on-a-chip" communication devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I/UCRC will comprise three major initiatives: Research, Internship, and Curriculum development. Research initiatives will provide consortium partners a complete spectrum of expertise in Telecommunications, RF Design, Wireless and Wireline communications, optical electronics, and analog/digital integrated circuits. The research roadmap of the center will be conceived and executed by the Center industrial Partners and will be monitored and evaluated by the Industrial Advisory Board.</AbstractNarration>
