    <AbstractNarration>0205625,0205118, 0205429, 0205627 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Collaborative Research: ITR: Acquiring Accurate Dynamic Field&lt;br/&gt;Data Using Lightweight Instrumentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic analyses, such as testing and profiling, play a key role in state-of-art approaches to software quality assurance (QA). With rare exception, these analyses are performed in-house, on developer&lt;br/&gt;platforms, using developer-provided input workloads. Shortcomings of this approach include that the results simply cannot be trusted to tell us how the software actually performs in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goal is to give developers unprecedented insight into the actual runtime behavior of their software, allowing developers (and ultimately the software itself) to change, optimize, and adapt the software based on highly accurate field data. Lightweight, collaborative dynamic analyses conducted around-the-world and around-the-clock form the new platform: (1) lightly instrument fielded software (i.e., each program copy performs a small part of the analysis) (2) collect the partial data from many instances of the software, fusing it to conduct the complete analysis, (3) change the running program instances based on the findings and (4) repeat the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven critical research challenges form the core of the project: &lt;br/&gt;1. Lightweight instrumentation--Develop instrumentation that is virtually transparent to individual users. 2. Compositional analysis techniques--Develop distributed analysis techniques that decompose&lt;br/&gt;traditional analyses into smaller steps, distribute the steps among multiple users, and then fuse each user's results into an accurate solution to the original problem. 3. Scalability--Develop storage&lt;br/&gt;and analysis techniques to deal with the high data volumes we expect to encounter. 4. Anomaly Detection--Define data-driven techniques to automatically identify anomalous behaviors of deployed&lt;br/&gt;software. 5. Privacy and Security--Incorporate privacy and security safeguards into our data collection and analysis approaches. 6. Dynamic updating mechanisms--Develop techniques to make runtime changes to the location and function of instrumentation, and to parts of the software itself. 7. Validate approach on industrial&lt;br/&gt;software.</AbstractNarration>
