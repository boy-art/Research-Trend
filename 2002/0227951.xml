    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Martha Mecartney is an Associate Professor at the University of California - Irvine. Dr. Mecartney has created outreach programs for K-12 students and developed summer programs for middle school teachers from low-income communities. She has had extensive involvement in the UC Irvine California Alliance for Minority Participation, and was the founder of the Alliance for Graduate Education Program (a nine-campus consortium) and the UC Irvine Fastrack to the Professoriate. Both of these were designed to advance minorities and women into graduate level engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Mecartney is commended for her effort that has led to the mobility of minorities and women into the professoriate and the engineering profession, especially through her attention to the interests and needs of undergraduate women. The sheer volume of programs and services that Dr. Mecartney has led exemplifies her creative academic leadership and insightful programming that listens to and is instructed by the voices of minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>
