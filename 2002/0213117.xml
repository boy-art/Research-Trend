    <AbstractNarration>B. Patrick Sullivan of the University of Wyoming is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on synthesis of linear oligomeric rhenium complexes, and investigation of their photoexcitation and electron-transfer properties. Both diphosphines and cyano groups will be used as bridging ligands, in order to favor directional electron or energy transfer through restriction of conformational flexibility. New synthetic procedures will be developed in order to build oligomeric rhenium complexes with specific lengths, and having properties that will facilitate directional energy and electron transfer. Studies of the dynamics of selected processes will also be carried out to optimize efficiency of energy transfer down the oligomeric chain. Later stages of the work will deal with rectification at semiconductor (titania) interfaces, and use of Mn-based chromophores as surrogates for Re complexes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses factors that facilitate directional electron and energy transport, an important problem with wide potential applicability. Substantial preliminary results indicate that the proposed research has a good likelihood of success. The results may well be important in development of practical methods for solar energy collection. The proposed research will also provide excellent training for students and post-doctoral associates.</AbstractNarration>
