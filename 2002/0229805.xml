    <AbstractNarration>Recent reports indicate that secondary mathematics teachers are most effective when they have a deep understanding of the mathematics they teach, and that teachers trained in the United States generally do not possess this depth of knowledge. In this proof of concept, the grantees address this problem by writing an innovative college-level mathematics textbook focusing on the secondary mathematics curriculum, and show that the use of this book by pre-service secondary mathematics teachers in a newly designed undergraduate course improves their knowledge of the mathematics they are teaching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of "Improving Pre-service Mathematics Teachers' Understanding of Fundamental Concepts in the Secondary Mathematics Curriculum" is that it aims to improve the knowledge base of pre-service teachers allowing for an increase in the depth of their mathematics knowledge. The intent is to produce a book ready for national dissemination that could be used in a wide variety of situations on both the undergraduate and graduate level, either as a main textbook or as a resource. Roughly speaking, the book exhibits three main features: First, coverage of carefully selected basic secondary mathematics topics (many of which are not explored sufficiently in high school due to the rush to calculus); second, an emphasis on connections between these topics; and finally extensions of these topics to challenging college-level problems and projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact of "Improving Pre-service Mathematics Teachers' Understanding of Fundamental Concepts in the Secondary Mathematics Curriculum" is realized through the development, testing, and revision of innovative materials through a collaboration of mathematics faculty, mathematics education faculty, and current high school teachers. These materials serve as the basis for a textbook, a draft of which is completed and field tested by the end of the grant period. At the same time, student knowledge is assessed via a variety of evaluation methods.</AbstractNarration>
