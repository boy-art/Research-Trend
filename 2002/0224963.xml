    <AbstractNarration>A new type of integration, called motivic integration, has been proposed&lt;br/&gt;by M. Konsevitch and developed by Denef and Loeser. They show that many&lt;br/&gt;of the classical properties of p-adic integration can be extended to to&lt;br/&gt;the motivic context. The research of this proposal will adapt motivic&lt;br/&gt;integration to the representation theory and the harmonic analysis of&lt;br/&gt;reductive groups over fields of formal Laurent series in characteristic&lt;br/&gt;zero. This new theory will be developed from first principles, starting&lt;br/&gt;with the existence of motivic Haar measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting point of much of modern mathematics is the theory of&lt;br/&gt;integration, as developed by Isaac Newton, and generations of&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians that have followed him. An unexpected development came in&lt;br/&gt;1995, when the mathematician M. Kontsevich developed an entirely new way&lt;br/&gt;to integrate. This new tool will allow mathematicians to significantly&lt;br/&gt;enlarge the scope of mathematics. The research of this grant will&lt;br/&gt;accomplish part of this project, by using this new tool to enlarge the&lt;br/&gt;scope of representation theory, a branch of modern algebra.</AbstractNarration>
