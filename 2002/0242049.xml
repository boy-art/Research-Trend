    <AbstractNarration>Framing effects are said to occur when "equivalent" redescriptions of objects or outcomes lead to different preferences or judgments. For example, a medical treatment will be seen more favorably when described as resulting in "75% survival" rather than "25% mortality." Such effects have traditionally been seen as irrational. However, preliminary research conducted by the PI has shown that even logically equivalent attribute frames can implicitly convey, or "leak," normatively relevant information. For instance, speakers were more likely to select the "75% survival" frame to describe a new treatment outcome if it led to a higher, rather than a lower, survival rate relative to an old treatment. Moreover, listeners "absorbed" this leaked information: They were more likely to infer that the old treatment led to a lower survival rate when the new treatment was described in terms of % survival rather than % mortality. The objective of the proposed research is to deepen and broaden our understanding of the role of information leakage in framing effects. Framing effects, rather than indicating irrational behavior, may instead indicate behavior that is rational, much richer, and more adaptive than previously thought.</AbstractNarration>
