    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204687&lt;br/&gt;Andrzej Zuk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research project the PI proposes to study &lt;br/&gt;different problems related to geometry, analysis and &lt;br/&gt;probability on discrete groups. The groups the PI is &lt;br/&gt;interested in are lattices in Lie groups, groups generated &lt;br/&gt;by finite automata, random and hyperbolic groups in&lt;br/&gt;the sense of Gromov, groups acting on buildings. &lt;br/&gt;The PI found recently new examples of groups with &lt;br/&gt;property (T) and the PI intends to continue the study &lt;br/&gt;of groups with this property. In particular, the PI would &lt;br/&gt;like to find other groups with property (T) and continue &lt;br/&gt;the study of automata groups. During this study the PI &lt;br/&gt;plans to investigate properties of these groups related &lt;br/&gt;to amenability, torsion, growth and the following famous &lt;br/&gt;conjectures: the Atiyah conjecture about L2 Betti numbers, &lt;br/&gt;the Baum-Connes conjecture, and the Kaplansky-Kadison conjecture &lt;br/&gt;about the idempotents. The PI proposes also to continue &lt;br/&gt;the study of spectral properties of random walks operators&lt;br/&gt;and more generally the Hecke operators for groups generated &lt;br/&gt;by finite automata and buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Property (T) is a quite abstract property of some groups,&lt;br/&gt;but which found applications in constructions of computer and communication networks. The PI proposes to find new groups&lt;br/&gt;with this property which would have applications to several &lt;br/&gt;problems related to efficiency of certain algorithms. The &lt;br/&gt;other project concerning automata groups combines the &lt;br/&gt;problems from the abstract group theory and applications &lt;br/&gt;in computer science. The PI plans to give several mini-courses &lt;br/&gt;for graduate students based on this research.</AbstractNarration>
