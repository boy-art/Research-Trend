    <AbstractNarration>This MRSEC at Pennsylvania State University is entitled "Center for Nanomolecular Structures" and supports three interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). Molecular Nanofabrication (IRG 1) combines self-assembly to advance nanolithography along several areas of emphasis. The aim is to bridge the gap between the scale of single molecules and the much larger scale defined by conventional lithography. &lt;br/&gt;Molecular Motors (IRG 2) has as its goal to advance the understanding of fundamental issues of molecular motion and to develop techniques to exploit such motors in nanoassembly and nanoscale motion. Both synthetic and hybrid biological motors are investigated. IRG 3 entitled Collective Phenomena in Restricted Geometries explores the collective molecular, photonic and electronic effects in systems with reduced dimensionalitiy. In addition to obtaining fundamental insights into the effects of reduced dimensionalities the work has potential applications for novel photonic and ferroelectric devices. The Center will partner with the Penn State node of the National Nanofabrication Users Network to create a national resource in the extension of nanolithography in the areas of chemical self-assembly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center's has education activities ranging from the graduate to the undergraduate and to K-12 teachers and students. The Center will also acquaint the general public with the Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia and the Exploratorium in San Francisco. An interactive exhibit in the area of nanotechnology is planned with each museum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center's participants include 34 faculty, 6 postdoctoral associates, 12 graduate students, and support for undergraduates and K-12 teachers. Professor Moses Chan directs the MRSEC.</AbstractNarration>
