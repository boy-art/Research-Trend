    <AbstractNarration>This project is a continuation of a search for the electron electric dipole moment (EDM), using the metastable state of PbO. Observation of an electron EDM would provide definitive evidence for phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Currently favored theories involving supersymmetry typically predict the EDM within a few orders of magnitude of the current limit. Recent results indicate that it should be possible to improve upon the current sensitivity by a factor of at least 100, within the three-year period of the project. In parallel with the EDM search, techniques for further extending the sensitivity of the method will be developed. We will search for unknown states which couple radiatively to the metastable state, using classical spectroscopic techniques. Successful completion of this search will allow us to identify suitable probe and/or pump transitions, which can be used for a more efficient excitation and detection of the PbO molecules. On the broader impact, the PI's search for the electron EDM will continue to involve extensive student training. Also the PI will continue to widely disseminate the results, through refereed publications, conference presentations, and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>
