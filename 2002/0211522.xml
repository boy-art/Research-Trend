    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Bowen will use negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy to investigate the stabilization of otherwise unstable anions by solvation and by counter ions, gas-phase double Rydberg anions, &lt;br/&gt;excess electron states in clusters including dipole-bound cluster anions and cluster analogs, and bio-molecular anions and their complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with several issues of contemporary physical chemistry, which impact on related fields and on biochemistry. The work will provide molecular level description of important condensed phase phenomena, including those in biological entities. The work will be assisted by graduate and undergraduate students and by postdoctoral research associates. In an active outreach program the work is also presented to middle school students to give them a feel of ongoing forefront scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
