    <AbstractNarration>0244170 Mantell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a five-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. The program will provide research opportunities in mechanical engineering for thirteen undergraduate students for ten weeks during the summer each year. The program is open to undergraduate engineering or science majors who have completed their sophomore or junior year. The recruiting efforts will focus on attracting students from population groups underrepresented in the United States in research fields in engineering and science. The program will include: (1) research projects under the direct supervision of a faculty member, (2) access to state-of-the-art laboratory and computing facilities, (3) a weekly seminar series with special topics in mechanical engineering research and engineering communication, (4) a three part seminar series on ethical practices in engineering, and (5) interdisciplinary collaboration with other engineering departments at the university. In addition, the program will provide opportunities for two teachers to participate in a research experience for five weeks during the summer. The teacher participants will receive graduate credit for their participation. The undergraduate participants will present their results in a university-wide event and have the opportunity to attend the National Conference on Undergraduate Research. It is anticipated that the teacher participants will update their technical knowledge and integrate the experience into their curriculum and thus improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education in their school district.</AbstractNarration>
