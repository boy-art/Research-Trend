    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0238061 Pamela A. Abshire University of Maryland College-Park CAREER: Physical Information Efficiency for Sensing, Communicating, and Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In physical computational efficiency, there is no free lunch. Tradeoffs of performance versus resources are everywhere, placing limits on performance and efficiency. To streamline technological processes, we may study and even mimic biology's highly efficient integrated systems that get the most bang for their resource bucks - the ultimate small smart systems that will revolutionize application design microelectronics, bioengineering, nanoscience and other fields. This line of intellectual inquiry opens up vistas to engage the minds of scientist and lay people alike. Consider a miniaturize autonomous cell clinic able to navigate your bloodstream and deliver therapy directly to damaged cells. Or environmental micro bots for security, monitoring and situation awareness. All are possible once we pinpoint ways to boost communication and computation to use resources in the most efficient ways. This research is laying critical groundwork for comparative analysis and application across biological and technological systems. Lunch may never be free-but it can become much cheaper and more nutritious.</AbstractNarration>
