    <AbstractNarration>Recent advances in microbiology such as cloning demonstrate that increasingly complex micromanipulation strategies for manipulating individual biological cells are required. From a robotics standpoint, the manipulation of biological cells presents several interesting research issues which extend well beyond biomanipulation. Biological cells are highly deformable objects, and the material properties of these objects are not well quantified, so developing strategies for manipulating deformable objects must be addressed. Most biological cells are between 1 and 100 microns in diameter, depending on the cell type, so micromanipulation issues must be explored, including the appropriate use of high resolution, low depth-of-field vision feedback and very low magnitude force feedback. Although multi-axis force sensing capabilities would be useful for handling cells by providing information on injection forces as well as tangential forces generated by improperly aligned cell probes, no sensors capable of multi-axis force sensing at the force scales required are available. Robotic devices capable of complex manipulation of biological cells do not exist, and robotic systems capable of integrating a variety of novel sensory information for cell manipulation have not been created. By pursing robotic manipulation of biological cells, many interesting robotics research avenues in micromanipulation, deformable object handling, multi-sensor integration, and force and vision feedback assimilation must be explored. In this project, an autonomous microrobotic system capable of manipulating individual biological cells using real-time vision and force feedback is being developed, and the micromanipulation of deformable biological cells are being investigated.</AbstractNarration>
