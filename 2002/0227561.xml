    <AbstractNarration>Ahmed H. Tewfik&lt;br/&gt;University of Minnesota-Twin Cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2002 International Conference On Multimedia &amp; Expo (ICME) is the third IEEE multimedia conference to take place in joint collaboration with four IEEE societies: the Circuits and Systems Society, the Computer Society, the Signal Processing Society, and the Communications Society. This year, the conference will take place in Lausanne, Switzerland, from August 26 to August 29. ICME serves as a forum for the dissemination of state-of-the-art IEEE as well as non-IEEE research, development, and implementations of multimedia systems, technologies and applications. It brings together researchers, developers and practitioners from&lt;br/&gt;academia and industry working in all areas in multimedia. It is arguably the most inter-disciplinary of all IEEE conferences. Furthermore, it provides industry an opportunity to showcase products. Typical topics covered by ICME include signal processing for media integration, components and technologies for multimedia systems, human-machine interface and interaction, multimedia databases and file systems, multimedia&lt;br/&gt;communication and networking, system integration, applications, standards (e.g., MPEG) and related issues.</AbstractNarration>
