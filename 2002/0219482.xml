    <AbstractNarration>This project will carry out the research needed to update a classic publication entitled, Designing for Earthquakes, originally published in 1978. One of the few technical documents that dealt with seismic design for members of the architecture profession, this publication is now out of print. The new document will improve vastly on the earlier publication by incorporating advances that have been made in engineering knowledge and the development of the concept of Performance Based Seismic Design. The absence of technical seismic design information for architects has ignored the pivotal role they play in communicating seismic resistant strategies to building owners and community leaders. EERI will carry out the necessary research to gain a better understanding of the current status and limitations of seismic design education in university architecture and continuing education programs, identify the kinds of information and training that architects need to better understand and design for specific seismic performance levels, update the chapters of the 1978 publication, and finally, add several new chapters that reflect current engineering research and topics that were not considered two decades ago. The final publication will enable architects to play a significant role in designing &lt;br/&gt;a safer society.</AbstractNarration>
