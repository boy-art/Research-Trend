    <AbstractNarration>The focus of the project is the observation of the dynamics of subaqueous volcaniclastic sedimentation from eruption-fed density currents, and the characteristics of the resulting deposits. Since the processes in question are almost impossible to observe in the field, an alternative approach will be employed here: the use of laboratory tanks to perform experiments that reproduce the deposits. The experiments have been designed to model as accurately as possible three settings: a) lacustrine turbidites of the Taupo volcano, New Zealand, b) submarine hyaloclastites consisting of limu shards and c) eruption-fed density currents of the style of Pahvant Butte. The results will be used to extend existing numerical models of turbidity currents to the case of 2-D and 3-D currents laden with vesiculated grains of variable size and density as well as hot water. The numerical models will provide new predictive tools for the study of volcaniclastic stratigraphy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research represents a collaborative effort between Gary Parker of the University of Minnesota (turbidity currents) and James White of the University of Otago, New Zealand (subaqueous volcaniclastic deposits).</AbstractNarration>
