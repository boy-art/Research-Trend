    <AbstractNarration>Nuclei with equal numbers of neutrons and protons near 72Kr provide&lt;br/&gt;interesting and important tests of nuclear theory, as they can supply information on&lt;br/&gt;the interaction of neutron-proton (np) pairs, and test our understanding of the evolution&lt;br/&gt;of nuclear shape. Recently, two possible consequences of np pairing have been offered: a&lt;br/&gt;delay in the rotational frequency at which nucleon pairs break and align with the&lt;br/&gt;angular momentum of the core, and the apparent low level density of odd-odd N=Z nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this work is the collection, analysis and interpretation of data on&lt;br/&gt;low-spin states in the odd-odd nuclei 74Rb and 88Y, of which little or nothing is known. The&lt;br/&gt;experiments will be carried out at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) using the&lt;br/&gt;Gammasphere array, an array of neutron detectors, and the Argonne Fragment Mass Analyzer&lt;br/&gt;(FMA). A secondary focus of this work is on studies of the nucleus 72Kr,&lt;br/&gt;including a low-spin experiment using the Gammasphere array coupled to the FMA. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;this experiment is to observe and characterize the states at low excitation&lt;br/&gt;energy and angular momentum, including the expected continuation of an oblate band that&lt;br/&gt;has remained elusive through the years. This work will be done with the support of&lt;br/&gt;two undergraduate research assistants who will have the opportunity to participate in the&lt;br/&gt;setup of experiments, and the collection and analysis of the data.</AbstractNarration>
