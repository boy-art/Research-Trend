    <AbstractNarration>The research builds upon previous work in the area of protein diffusion on the surface of erythrocytes. The investigator will develop numerical algorithms to efficiently evolve the shape of the cell membrane as a function of time. Thermal fluctuations insure that the membrane's dynamics will be stochastic and it is anticipated, on the basis of preliminary results, that these fluctuations will be sufficiently large in amplitude and sufficiently long in duration to account for the escape of band 3 protein from the cytoskeletal "corrals "on the surface of the red blood cell. The simulations may provide a microscopic justification for the choice of empirical parameters in earlier studies, or, it may prove necessary to include the dynamics of the cytoskeleton to achieve agreement with experiments. In either eventuality, the investigation will quantify the relative importance of membrane fluctuations and cytoskeletal dynamics on protein mobility. The algorithms developed will be of use in future studies of cell motility and other biological behavior that is dependent upon dynamic membrane fluctuations.</AbstractNarration>
