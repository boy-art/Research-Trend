    <AbstractNarration>The goal of our project is the creation, testing and dissemination of a prototype textbook entitled in Microtechnology and Nanotechnology: A Connected Approach to Small Systems, intended for upper-undergraduate and graduate level study of microtechnology, specially microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology. As new courses in these areas continue to emerge at American universities the need for an innovative well-written understandable textbook grows as well. We recognize that some MEMS-specific and nanotechnology-specific textbooks are available, but none that effectively tie these disciplines together. A broader and more cohesive viewpoint is overdue and a gap currently exists in the marketplace. Our book is being developed to appeal to a wide audience and to better augment instruction by representing all of the required knowledge bases from engineering and science. Expert colleagues currently working and teaching in the field will editorially evaluate our new textbook's materials throughout the composition process. Pilot tests in the form of courses taught by the PI will share the title and content of the proposed textbook and generate important feedback. Our final product will be a saleable first edition that, having proved effective in beta site testing, will be published by a major house. Preliminary discussions with McGraw-Hill suggest a market exists for such a product, as well as a desire to publish it.</AbstractNarration>
