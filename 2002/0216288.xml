    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project will continue the successful&lt;br/&gt;work from the Phase I project and develop integrated amplifier/splitters through laser&lt;br/&gt;direct writing of wet-chemically derived, erbium-doped coatings. Precursor solutions will&lt;br/&gt;be mixed on the molecular level to produce pure and homogeneous materials. Waveguide&lt;br/&gt;structures will be written into the erbium-doped fluoride coatings with a laser, which&lt;br/&gt;raises its index of refraction to confine light. The erbium-doped channel waveguides will&lt;br/&gt;be pumped with a 980 nm source to amplify 1550 nm signals.&lt;br/&gt;Markets in which integrated optical devices, such as amplified splitters, can be used&lt;br/&gt;total several $100 million. This device will expedite bringing fiber the last mile because&lt;br/&gt;it will replace the current serial arrangement of discrete splitters and amplifiers, which&lt;br/&gt;is bulky and expensive due to the number of components and interconnects. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;integration techniques will also enable optical integrated circuits and next-generation&lt;br/&gt;computing.&lt;br/&gt;Prototypes will be fabricated during Phase II. TPL has extensive experience in&lt;br/&gt;wet-chemical processing and demonstrated ability to commercialize its technologies. The PI&lt;br/&gt;is a pioneering researcher of laser-fired, sol-gel derived films. LightPath Technologies&lt;br/&gt;will assist TPL with device and marketing development.</AbstractNarration>
