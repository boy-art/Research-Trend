    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Bruce Kohorn at Bowdoin College in order&lt;br/&gt;to purchase a confocal laser scanning microscope. The microscope will&lt;br/&gt;provide the ability to obtain high resolution fluorescent images from both&lt;br/&gt;live and fixed biological samples, and will become the only such instrument&lt;br/&gt;in Maine at a liberal arts undergraduate college. The microscope will be&lt;br/&gt;used to explore fundamental questions in neurobiology and behavior, plant&lt;br/&gt;development, nuclear protein transport, evolutionary genetics, and&lt;br/&gt;biomechanics. Seven faculty and their students from the Biology and&lt;br/&gt;Psychology departments of Bowdoin College, and two faculty from Bates and&lt;br/&gt;Colby College will use the instrument to achieve high resolution images for&lt;br/&gt;basic biological research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The new instrument will be used by many faculty in their research on&lt;br/&gt;topics that include the function of the nervous system, the organization of&lt;br/&gt;cells, and the comparison of cellular structures so as to understand basic&lt;br/&gt;processes of evolution. The students in research labs will be exposed to&lt;br/&gt;current and standard technologies that they too will need to use once in&lt;br/&gt;more advanced degree programs. Students will be prepared for careers in&lt;br/&gt;Biology and related fields by providing the technical and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;background for one of the most common methods of imaging in cell and&lt;br/&gt;molecular biology.</AbstractNarration>
