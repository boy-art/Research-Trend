    <AbstractNarration>This proposal focuses on problems in q-series and partitions. &lt;br/&gt;There are five separate parts of this work. The first part &lt;br/&gt;considers research tied to applications of the construction &lt;br/&gt;of representations of Lie algebras. Next the investigator &lt;br/&gt;looks at new q-series methods related to special problems in &lt;br/&gt;number theory. The third part discusses applications of the &lt;br/&gt;Omega software package (http://www.uni-linz.ac.at/research/&lt;br/&gt;combinat/risc/software/Omega/) which is being developed by &lt;br/&gt;the investigator in collaboration with colleagues at Linz. &lt;br/&gt;The focus in this latter section is on mutli-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;partitions. The fourth section is devoted to the study of &lt;br/&gt;Bailey chains and a consideration ofhow recent discoveries of &lt;br/&gt;the investigator may lead to new applications of this concept. &lt;br/&gt;The proposal concludes with consideration of three major unsolved&lt;br/&gt;problems in the theory of partitions: (1) the Friedman-Joichi-&lt;br/&gt;Stanton conjecture, (2) the Borwein conjecture and (3) the &lt;br/&gt;Okada conjecture. Each of these three conjectures has been &lt;br/&gt;around for some time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this proposal put succinctly might be: Building &lt;br/&gt;bridges from partitions and q-series (two intrinsically deep and &lt;br/&gt;charming but sometimes rather introverted topics) to several &lt;br/&gt;branches of mathematics and science. The first two sections are &lt;br/&gt;devoted to relating this work to representation theory and number &lt;br/&gt;theory, two branches of mathematics; in each instance, it is clear &lt;br/&gt;that this interaction will not only enrich the object fields, but &lt;br/&gt;also will provide new insights for partitions and q-series. The &lt;br/&gt;work on the Omega package has great potential. Here the &lt;br/&gt;investigator and his collaborators have found numerous instances &lt;br/&gt;where research discoveries have gone from being unthinkable to &lt;br/&gt;easily reached. The possible applications to multi-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;partitions should lead to insights in combinatorics and, &lt;br/&gt;hopefully, the combinatorial aspects of physics. The work on &lt;br/&gt;Bailey chains in the past has had profound impact on statistical &lt;br/&gt;mechanics in physics. The more this method is advanced, the more &lt;br/&gt;we may expect these mutually beneficial applications to continue. &lt;br/&gt;The final section on three unsolved problems appears, at first, &lt;br/&gt;to be a purely internal study. However, as has often happend &lt;br/&gt;in the past, whenever new methods are discovered to solve really &lt;br/&gt;hard problems, there is almost always a spillover into vital &lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>
