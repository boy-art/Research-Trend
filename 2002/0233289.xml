    <AbstractNarration>0233289&lt;br/&gt;Coffino&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI and graduate and postdoctoral students from the University of California-San Francisco in a collaboration with Dieter Wolf of the Institute for Biochemistry at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. The combined efforts of the German and US groups will screen a yeast deletion library for mutations that alter proteasomal degradation of two enzymes: fructose-1,6-biophophatase and ornithine decarboxylase. Both are substrates of the proteasome, but differ in the initial mechanisms that are used to mark them for degradation. A detailed understanding of the common and distinct cellular functions that control degradation of these proteasome substrates will contribute to our understanding of a major pathway that controls critical regulatory functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has an educational objective. The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing research in another country. They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new technical skills.</AbstractNarration>
