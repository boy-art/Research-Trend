    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Noam Elkies &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies problems in number theory, notably&lt;br/&gt;the arithmetic of varieties such as elliptic curves and surfaces&lt;br/&gt;and their relations and applications to other areas of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;such as error-correcting codes and Euclidean lattices. Specific&lt;br/&gt;projects include: proof and computational exploitation of new&lt;br/&gt;relations between p-adic modular forms of weight 3/2 and the arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;of quadratic twists of odd analytic rank; refinement of the Shioda-Usui&lt;br/&gt;theory relating Mordell-Weil lattices with Weyl groups, and&lt;br/&gt;generalization to certain complex reflection groups; continued study&lt;br/&gt;of optimal recursive towers and the investigator's modularity conjecture&lt;br/&gt;for such towers; extended study of the connection between bilinear&lt;br/&gt;(Somos) recurrences, theta sequences, and explicit moduli spaces;&lt;br/&gt;and novel applications of lattice reduction to study and efficiently&lt;br/&gt;compute solutions of Diophantine equations and inequalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator continues his study of problems in number theory&lt;br/&gt;concerning the mathematical structure of algebraic solutions&lt;br/&gt;of equations. This should lead both to better understanding&lt;br/&gt;of those equations and their solutions (elliptic curves, etc.),&lt;br/&gt;and to further connections with other topics such as efficient&lt;br/&gt;computation, error-correcting codes, and sphere packing.</AbstractNarration>
