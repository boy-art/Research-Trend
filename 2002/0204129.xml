    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204129&lt;br/&gt;Paul G. Goerss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory is the study of topological phenomena that &lt;br/&gt;remain invariant under fairly flexible sorts of continuous deformations. Most basically, we seek to compute and to &lt;br/&gt;understand homotopy classes of maps between finite simplicial &lt;br/&gt;or CW complexes, perhaps after some sort of stabilization. &lt;br/&gt;Computation and understanding are not the same: we have forty &lt;br/&gt;or more years of computations, but only lately have we begun &lt;br/&gt;to have the language to in which to make a coherent theory out &lt;br/&gt;of the data we have. This project is, therefore, as much about exploring and refining the language as it is about calculations &lt;br/&gt;-- although there will be a mixture of both. The entry point &lt;br/&gt;is the observation that any cohomology theory with a good &lt;br/&gt;theory of Chern classes gives rise to a formal group law&lt;br/&gt;and, hence, a formal group. Conversely, given a formal group&lt;br/&gt;we can ask whether there is an associated cohomology theory.&lt;br/&gt;These cohomology theories then delineate the finer structure&lt;br/&gt;of stable homotopy theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the chromatic picture of stable homotopy: we seek&lt;br/&gt;to use the algebraic geometry of formal groups to organize and &lt;br/&gt;direct investigations into the deeper structure of computations &lt;br/&gt;and theory. This project seeks to develop this point of view &lt;br/&gt;in two directions, one local and one global. The first, or &lt;br/&gt;local, direction is an investigation into K(n)-local homotopy &lt;br/&gt;theory in general and into the K(n)-local sphere in particular. &lt;br/&gt;The second, or more global, direction, would be to make systematic&lt;br/&gt;our knowledge of structured ring spectra using stacks and &lt;br/&gt;the moduli stack of formal groups as the basic parametrizing&lt;br/&gt;device.</AbstractNarration>
