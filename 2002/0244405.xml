    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0244405&lt;br/&gt;Huneke, Craig L.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is in the field of commutative algebra, especially in the&lt;br/&gt;homological theory of Noetherian rings. The lever being used to study this&lt;br/&gt;area is in developing the understanding of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules&lt;br/&gt;and extensions of modules. In addition, the project also studies &lt;br/&gt;several areas central to commutative algebra, including the tight closure of&lt;br/&gt;ideals, integral closures of ideals, the core of an ideal, evolutions,&lt;br/&gt;symbolic powers, and rational singularities. The focus of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;is on several open conjectures, especially regarding rings of finite and&lt;br/&gt;countable Cohen-Macaulay type, conjectures of Auslander on the vanishing&lt;br/&gt;of extension modules, and questions of Schreyer, among others. Among&lt;br/&gt;the methods being used is the study of maximal Cohen-Macaulay&lt;br/&gt;modules not only through study of infinite resolutions, but with techniques&lt;br/&gt;coming from tight closure and reduction to characteristic p. The methods are&lt;br/&gt;in part classical methods as well as those being developed by the proposer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commutative algebra arose from the 19th century study of polynomial equations in&lt;br/&gt;many variables, and their solutions. The relationship between polynomial equations and&lt;br/&gt;geometry goes back at least to Descartes and the idea of coordinatizing the plane.&lt;br/&gt;Commutative algebra studies the solutions of such polynomial or power series equations&lt;br/&gt;by forming an algebraic object, called a ring, which consists of the 'generic' solutions.&lt;br/&gt;The algebraic properties of these generic solutions then give insight into the&lt;br/&gt;geometric and algebraic nature of the equations. An important technique in this&lt;br/&gt;field has been to study such equations by reducing the coefficients modulo prime numbers&lt;br/&gt;for all large primes. A particular example of this has been the explosive development&lt;br/&gt;of the theory of tight closure over the last fifteen years. Commutative algebra combines&lt;br/&gt;techniques from a number of other areas including combinatorics, topology, and analysis.</AbstractNarration>
