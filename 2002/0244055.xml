    <AbstractNarration>0244055 Van Der Spiegel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a five-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Pennsylvania entitled "SUNFEST - Summer Undergraduate Research Program in Sensor Technology". The REU Site will provide an eleven-week summer research experience for ten undergraduate students in the general area of sensor technologies. The goal of this program is to excite students' interest in research and encourage them to continue their studies through pursuit of a graduate degree. The program will make a special effort to recruit students from colleges with little or no opportunity for research activities for undergraduate students. The program will also focus on attracting students from groups underrepresented in research fields in engineering. Students will participate in research projects chosen for their educational value and appropriateness for undergraduate research. Research topics will include novel approaches to sensing; sensors and materials technology; modeling and design of sensors and microstructures; bio-inspired sensors; and sensor systems.</AbstractNarration>
