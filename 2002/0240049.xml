    <AbstractNarration>University of Maryland Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of the University of Maryland VIGRE project are Research Interaction Teams (RIT's), usually consisting of one or more faculty, a postdoc, three to five graduate students, and one or more undergraduates. Each team has a research focus with component projects appropriate to each of its members. Team Plans are advertised on the web. Students contract to an appropriate level of involvement. This format provides undergraduates with an introduction to research, graduate students with early entry into the research environment and postdoctoral fellows with a working community. Advising and mentoring form an intrinsic part of this team structure, as does oral and written presentation. The VIGRE Graduate Traineeship, Postdoctoral Associate and Research Experience for Undergraduate programs integrate naturally into this team approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three properties distinguish the Maryland VIGRE program from other team based approaches: First, the Research Team approach is becoming pervasive throughout all disciplines. Second, because of this the resources of the VIGRE program are accessible to all disciplines in our Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics programs. Third, our demonstrated success in addressing diversity, especially the retention of underrepresented groups, is strongly reinforced by the VIGRE program. The VIGRE Program at Maryland through its Research Interaction Teams brings a significant cultural change with increased activity, accessibility and accountability in our professional and educational practices.</AbstractNarration>
