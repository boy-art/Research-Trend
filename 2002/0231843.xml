    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teacher-Fellow GK-12 teams are introducing, ocean based science into Pineallis County K-8 classrooms, aligning their efforts with the Earth Science, Life Science, and Physical Science content strands in the Florida state science standards. The teams collaborate to discover and then meet the expressed needs of school district administrators. Through their work with the Fellows, the teachers, many of whom have little previous background in ocean science, are becoming adept at stimulating and elevating students' interest in a variety of science topics by capitalizing on the fact that Florida is surrounded on three sides by ocean. Faculty collaborators from the College of Marine Science and the College of Education serve as mentors and educators to provide professional support in content and pedagogy for Fellows and teachers. Recruiting strategies for student and faculty participation capitalize on the growing interest of College of Marine Science graduate students in education, outreach learning and teaching opportunities, and the initiation of expanded Ocean Science content based Science Education degree programs offered by the College of Education. The broader impacts of the project are reflected in the benefits accruing to each of the participants. The Fellows are becoming better prepared for the classroom environment and are developing improved communication skills in such areas as connecting with diverse audiences. The participating teachers, many of whom have little academic background in ocean science, by working with content experts, are becoming adept at capitalizing on the fact that Florida is surrounded on three sides by ocean to stimulate and elevate students interest generally in a variety of science topics. Other teachers benefit from the resources the teams have developed and put on the web. The K-8 students benefit from their interaction with real-life scientists who act as role models and content specialists, and who are a source of career information. Schools benefit through 1) professional development for teachers which expands both their content knowledge and inquiry-based instructional skills, and 2) an improved science learning environment for students which incorporates the local ocean setting into real world science applications. The higher education partners benefit because the project facilitates collaboration between scientists and educators, fosters development of innovative degree programs, and serves as a recruitment incentive for prospective graduate students in Marine Science and Education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title of Project: GK-12 OCEANS: Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education Institution: University of South Florida &lt;br/&gt;PI/CoPI: Teresa Greely and Paula Coble&lt;br/&gt;Cooperating District and Schools: Pinellas County, Canterbury School of Florida &lt;br/&gt;Number of Fellows per year: 10 graduates, 3 undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Urban, Suburban &lt;br/&gt;Target Audience of the project: K-8 &lt;br/&gt;NSF supported disciplines involved: Geosciences/Ocean Science</AbstractNarration>
