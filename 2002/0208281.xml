    <AbstractNarration>The Paleocene-Eocene boundary is marked by substantial global warming. The beginning of the Eocene (55 million years ago) in North America included the first immigration of many modern mammalian orders that dispersed during this warm interval. The objectives of this project are to collect and identify mammalian fossils from an earliest Eocene (Wa0) locality. A new Wa0 locality, "Castle Gardens", was discovered by the PI in the southeastern Bighorn Basin of Wyoming. Preliminary fieldwork indicates that it is the richest North American fossil vertebrate site of this age; over 300 specimens have been found including at least two new species and twelve other taxa unknown from other earliest Eocene localities. The recovered specimens will be documented in a detailed and interactive electronic database. All diagnostic specimens and appropriate comparative material will be scanned using a 3-D laser digitizer. Three-dimensional images will be created and published. The images will be able to be rotated, quantified, and downloaded by any Web user. &lt;br/&gt;The broader significance of this study is threefold. Firstly, with this new collection of earliest Eocene mammals, it will then be possible to use this fauna to contribute to studies of community structure, biodiversity, biostratigraphy, and faunal succession during this critical time period. The documented global changes in climate and resultant faunal turnover can provide insights to the possible effects of rapid climatic change today. Recent studies have suggested that the great transient shift in the stable carbon-isotope ratio near the Paleocene/Eocene boundary is similar to that currently being induced by humans today. Studies of the effects of ancient "green-house" warming can be used to model potential environmental outcomes of modern human activities. Secondly, the approach used to make the interactive database is unique. This database formation will serve as a model for other researchers and institutions that wish to make their collections easily and usefully accessible. Thirdly, this study will include substantial undergraduate participation (a minimum of 22 students). Students will be exposed to modern field methods and high-end state of the art technology and software.</AbstractNarration>
