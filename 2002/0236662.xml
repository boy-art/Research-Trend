    <AbstractNarration>The foci of this research are twofold. First, new cyclic ester polymerization catalysts that contain two metal ions (Zn2 and/or Co2) bound to binucleating ligands will be prepared and used to catalyze the transformation of lactide (LA) into polylactide (PLA). Second, the physical properties of PLA will be manipulated by the synthesis of a new class of alternating copolymers of lactic acid and a cyclic ether component. The physical properties of the new polymers and blends of the new polymers with PLA will be examined with the goal of developing macromolecular plasticizing agents useful for the toughening of crystalline PLA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Drs. William B. Tolman and Marc A. Hillmyer of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. The Principal Investigators will focus their work on the development of efficient, controlled and versatile methods for the synthesis of polymers derived from renewable resources. To this end, the cyclic dimer of lactic acid (LA) will be used as precursor to the aliphatic polyester polylactide (PLA). The design of discrete catalysts for the conversion and manipulation of the physical properties of PLA will be carried out. The project has broader impacts for the environment and as an excellent area for the training of students.</AbstractNarration>
