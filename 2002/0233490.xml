    <AbstractNarration>0233490&lt;br/&gt;Sanders&lt;br/&gt;This award supports William Sanders, a junior faculty member, and two students from the University of Illinois-Urban-Champaign in a collaboration with Peter Kemper of the Department of Information Science at the University of Dortmund, Germany. The project will focus on the use of Kronecker representations and analysis methods within the Moebius framework. The Moebius framework was developed at the University of Illinois and makes validation of large systems models possible by supporting many different model solution methods as well as model specification in multiple modeling formalisms. Kronecker representations, studied by the German group, area a mathematical way to handle large models for functional and quantitative analysis by exploiting the fact that complex models are often built by composition of submodels, and have revolutionized the way state-based models are represented and solved. The joint research will provide a formal semantics for model composition that will allow for investigating the use of Kronecker techniques for new model composition formalisms, and will make it possible to use Kronecker methods developed with other methods already supported by the Moebius tool.</AbstractNarration>
