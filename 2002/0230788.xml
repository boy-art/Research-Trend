    <AbstractNarration>National reports over the last decade have focused on the need for change in the way mathematics is taught at the secondary and post-secondary levels. Discovery-learning and the increased use of technology are two teaching strategies that have figured prominently in mathematics education reform efforts and are principal themes in the current standards for teaching mathematics at the secondary level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometry is an ideal course in which to model discovery-learning and the use of technology for future teachers is college geometry, since most mathematics education majors take it as a required course. There are few, if any, materials that successfully integrate these two themes as fundamental ways of investigating geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a textbook and computer software materials that use discovery-learning and computer exploration for the teaching of geometry offers significant intellectual merit to this project. This materials developed from this project provides a national model for discovery-learning that integrates technology, so that mathematics education students will be well versed in both themes useful in investigating geometry &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact of " Exploring Geometry: Integrated Textbook and Software for College Geometry" is realized through the development, testing, and revision of innovative materials that targets college and university faculty who teach geometry and pre-service teachers. In the area of teacher preparation, there are recognized needs for strengthening both subject knowledge and pedagogical technique of future teachers so that they can assist students from diverse backgrounds. This project is one attempt at addressing these needs.</AbstractNarration>
