    <AbstractNarration>The Arizona MESA works to increase the number of historically underrepresented minority and low-income students participating in mathematics, engineering, and science and to stimulate students starting at the elementary school level continuing through high school. This program's emphasis on yearlong academic stimulation was thought to be quite valuable, as was the engagement and support of both students and parents. There is a strong focus on leadership development, and the support systems embedded in program are excellent. Support for students is maintained through an organized, effectively executed plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a model program that extends deep roots into the community using creative methods, including the "train the trainer" methodology, thus leveraging it's ability to make a significant impact on children. Some of the program achievements include 89.5% of the participants pursue higher education opportunities, and 65% engage in some type of technical plan of study.</AbstractNarration>
