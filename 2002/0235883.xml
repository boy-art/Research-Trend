    <AbstractNarration>0235883&lt;br/&gt;Cummings&lt;br/&gt; The Workshop on Molecular Evolution, now in its 12th year of NSF support, is held for two weeks in the summer at the Woods Hole, MA, Marine Biological Laboratory to provide a rich and intensive learning experience for 60 students in the broad field of molecular evolutionary studies. Specific workshop objectives include: (1) to provide advanced training in practical, theoretical, and analytical aspects of molecular evolution; (2) to provide advanced training in computational resources and statistical and modelling techniques related to molecular biology, phylogenetics, and population genetics; (3) to promote molecular evolutionary approaches to questions in biological fields like anthropology, conservation genetics, development, behavior, physiology, and ecology; and (4) to expand accessibility and reach of the Workshop through the workshop's web site. These objectives are realized through a series of lectures by invited specialists, demonstrations, and computer training for 60 students drawn from throughout the country and abroad. &lt;br/&gt; Students receive intensive, high-level instruction and hands-on training in the use of major software employed in molecular evolutionary studies. Workshop faculty also learn about the latest developments in the field, and from each other, in ways that promote their own scientific research. Teaching assistants extend their knowledge and understanding of recent developments, assist in computer laboratory demonstrations and tutorials, and lead discussions regarding teaching strategies and pedagogy. The workshop helps promote understanding of molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics to society at large, and has involved science reporters and other communicators in years past as well as scientists from other Federal agencies.</AbstractNarration>
