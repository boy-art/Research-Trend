    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: PECASE: Superconductor/Carbon-Nanotube Junctions and Interfaces&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Georgetown University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PECASE project addresses nanoelectronics research and introduces this topic at the graduate level, and also to undergraduate non-science majors. The research focuses on carbon-nanotube/superconductor materials, and will explore nanotube/superconductor junctions. Spe-cific goals are: 1) Achieving control of superconductor/nanotube interfaces, both in the high-transparency and low-transparency contact regime, by using liquid metals and metals with low melting point. 2) Studying the superconducting proximity effect, DC and AC Josephson effect, and quantum entanglement in single and multiple junctions. Microfluidic MEMS techniques will be used to attach liquid metals and metals with low melting point to nanotubes. Properties of interfaces will be studied by varying the temperature through the liquid, solid and superconducting transitions. Nanotube devices will also be made using aluminum or niobium-aluminum bilayers as superconducting electrodes. Niobium-aluminum bilayers will also be used to form low-transparency interfaces by oxidizing the aluminum to form a tunnel barrier for the study of Cooper pair tunneling in nanotubes. The research has potential impact beyond the interplay of nanotubes and superconductivity. Control of the contact interface is essential for future mass-production of nanotube devices to assure reliability and to keep heating as low as possible. De-velopment of the integration of nanotubes with microfluidic MEMS techniques will also enhance the possibility to use nanotubes as biological and chemical sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental materials science research issues having technological relevance. The research program provides excellent opportunities for hands-on experience in the use of sophisticated scientific equipment. Additionally, research will be brought into the classrooms of non-science majors by introducing nanotechnology in a course on How Things Work. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004.</AbstractNarration>
