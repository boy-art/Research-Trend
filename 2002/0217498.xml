    <AbstractNarration>Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;SES 02-17498&lt;br/&gt;AAAS History and Archives Web Site Project&lt;br/&gt;Amy Crumpton &lt;br/&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) intends eighteen-month project to enhance the original content and technical development of its AAAS History and Archives Web site (http://archives.aaas.org). The intent is to: 1) expand the complexity of searchable historical information on the site, 2) evaluate and further develop the usefulness of the database and applications that provide access to this information, and 3) publish the design code for the database and applications as an open source tool for use by other archives, manuscript collections, and libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AAAS History and Archives site uses a content management system that generates pages by selecting information from a relational database containing data on people, meetings, documents, publications, awards, and archives collections related to the Association's history. Users have access to this information through links set between related elements in the database or through open queries. The site has several purposes: 1) an organizational management strategy for the AAAS archivist, 2) an online institutional memory for AAAS staff and membership, and 3) a research tool for scholars interested in the history of a key organization in American science or in broader issues related to the history of science for which the AAAS Archives might have pertinent information. This project is intended specifically to evaluate, refine, document, and publish the software code used for the project as a contribution to efforts to make database building tools accessible to archives, libraries, and other institutions. Interrelated with this task is the AAAS plan to increase the quality content of the database. The database lacks information on the scope and tenure of AAAS committees and programs, group data that provide context for the emergence of Association meetings, publications and resolutions. The database also lacks online finding aids for the collections. Gathering and editing this information will take place in conjunction with developments and refinements to our software code to ensure that new information connects well with other aspects of the database. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AAAS History and Archives Web site is an important mechanism to publicize the richness of the AAAS archives and the relevance of the Association's history to the development of science over the past 153 years. By enhancing the site's searchable content we will increase the breadth and usefulness of this research tool for scholars, AAAS staff and members, and the interested public. By publishing the software code for our system, we will make a content management tool available without charge to repositories with limited resources. Our proposal complements the interests of the NSF STS program to collect, preserve, and make accessible primary resources on the history of science and technology. It also complements efforts by the NSF National Digital Library Program to develop electronic infrastructure for archival and library resources on&lt;br/&gt;science, engineering, and mathematics via the World Wide Web.</AbstractNarration>
