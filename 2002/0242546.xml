    <AbstractNarration>This symposium is on "Increasing U.S. participation in the 2nd International Steroids and Nervous System Conference". This conference will update our current knowledge by describing new research on the relationships of steroid hormones synthesized in different organs and the nervous system. Participants in this program will include undergraduate students, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty. The symposium will engage participants in discussions regarding novel aspects of glucocorticoids and mineralcorticoids, non-classical mechanisms of steroid action, steroid regulation of reproduction, glial cells as targets for steroids, and the behavioral effects of steroids. Symposia, poster presentations, meet the professor lunches, and organized discussions on international research opportunities will encourage interactions between students, junior scientists, and senior scientists that are internationally recognized for their accomplishments. The organizing committee is committed to fostering the development of young scientists. Funds will help defray travel costs for participants to attend the meeting.&lt;br/&gt; The impact of this will extend to numerous fields of study, such as neuroendocrinology, behavioral neuroscience, animal behavior, and population biology. This meeting is a follow-up to the 1st International Meeting on Steroids and the Nervous System (NSF Supported), which was an unqualified success. Proceedings from the present meeting will be published as an issue of The Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
