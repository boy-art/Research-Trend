    <AbstractNarration>The members of Louisiana Tech University's Center for Applied Physics &lt;br/&gt;Studies (CAPS) are deeply involved in the current and future parity &lt;br/&gt;violation experiments at Jefferson lab. The Group's primary experimental &lt;br/&gt;involvements are the study of the substructure of the proton as members &lt;br/&gt;of the G0 experiment, and testing the basic theory of&lt;br/&gt;modern physics, the Standard Model, as members of the newly approved &lt;br/&gt;Qweak experiment. They are also developing their own scientific program &lt;br/&gt;as spokespersons for the E01-115 experiment which will measure the&lt;br/&gt;parity violating asymmetry in the reaction when the proton is excited &lt;br/&gt;into its first resonant state, the Delta. The experiment will be &lt;br/&gt;performed using the G0 apparatus in its backward angle mode, and will &lt;br/&gt;probe an important component of the proton's structure, a quantity known &lt;br/&gt;as the axial vector transition form factor, inaccessible in other &lt;br/&gt;reactions. This form factor measures the contribution of the proton's &lt;br/&gt;intrinsic spin to the dynamics of this transition. To facilitate the &lt;br/&gt;backward angle measurements for both the G0 elastic and N --&gt; Delta &lt;br/&gt;experiments, Louisiana Tech is working on the design, installation, and &lt;br/&gt;testing of the Cryostat Exit Detectors (CED's) which also includes&lt;br/&gt;development of the associated signal processing electronics. &lt;br/&gt;Commissioning for the G0 forward angle measurements has been completed, &lt;br/&gt;and the next set of measurements is scheduled to be run in October of&lt;br/&gt;2003. The backward angle measurements are expected to start early in 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Group has taken on a crucial role in the Qweak experiment which will &lt;br/&gt;search for physics beyond the standard model by measuring the proton's &lt;br/&gt;weak charge. Since the inception of the Qweak experiment,&lt;br/&gt;the CAPS Group has been working on the design of major components and &lt;br/&gt;attributes of the spectrometer and detector systems. The Group's &lt;br/&gt;responsibilities for the upcoming experiment will be the design,&lt;br/&gt;testing, construction, and installation of a component of the forward &lt;br/&gt;tracking system which will play a crucial role in measuring the &lt;br/&gt;kinematics and background of the experiment. These new detectors will be &lt;br/&gt;based on the innovative technology of Gas Electron Multiplication (GEMs) &lt;br/&gt;which have been recently developed at CERN. To continue Louisiana Tech's &lt;br/&gt;program of parity violation measurements, the group submitted an Letter &lt;br/&gt;of Intent to the JLab PAC to extend its own program of measurements of &lt;br/&gt;the the parity violating asymmetry in the N --&gt; Delta transition at &lt;br/&gt;forward angles. This experiment will measure a fundamental coupling &lt;br/&gt;constant of dynamic theories of the weak interaction of hadrons, and &lt;br/&gt;will also test symmetry breaking mechanisms which take place at higher &lt;br/&gt;energies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The involvement of CAPS in modern experiments is not unnoticed in North &lt;br/&gt;Louisiana. It is motivation and opportunity for students at all levels &lt;br/&gt;in this region to participate in state of the art science. It also &lt;br/&gt;provides an opportunity to involve local high school teachers in &lt;br/&gt;forefront science and, through their involvement, spread modern science &lt;br/&gt;and technology even further into the local student population. This &lt;br/&gt;component of the CAPS program is considered as important as their &lt;br/&gt;scientific contributions.</AbstractNarration>
