    <AbstractNarration>Opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in ongoing research projects in experimental physics are structured in a summer REU program. Students may choose from a wide variety of forefront physics activities, under the direction of senior faculty members from the Department of Physics at the University of Arizona, or also from in research groups located in several other university academic units including Astronomy, Optical Sciences, Lunar and Planetary Studies, and Atmospheric Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary source of participants is students who have completed the equivalent of the first or second year curriculum in science or engineering at the community college level, in preparation for transfer to a 4-year degree program. The 10-week program will support 12 students each summer. Graduate teaching assistants from the physics department serve as mentors. Special orientation and skills activities are individually tailored during the first two weeks of the program, which enhance the ability of the participants to make significant contributions to the research projects. Weekly participant meetings include interim oral reports and lead to a formal presentation and final written report.</AbstractNarration>
