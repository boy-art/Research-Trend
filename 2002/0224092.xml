    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for Proposal #0224092, "Researcher and student housing at the Rocky Mountain Biological&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL), under the direction&lt;br/&gt;of Dr. Ian Billick, to build researcher and student housing at the RMBL. The RMBL is a biological field&lt;br/&gt;station that was established in 1928 to promote research and education in the biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;Unaffiliated with any university, scientists from numerous institutions throughout the United States visit&lt;br/&gt;the RMBL to conduct research and teach classes. Because students and researchers come from around the&lt;br/&gt;world, the RMBL provides housing in cabins onsite. Many of these cabins were constructed by miners in&lt;br/&gt;the 1880s or biologists in the early 1930s. This grant will allow the RMBL to provide safe, clean living&lt;br/&gt;facilities in order for scientists to conduct their work and for students to take classes.&lt;br/&gt;This grant will pay for the construction of three cabins, one noncooking cabin and two cooking&lt;br/&gt;cabins. The noncooking cabin will house six students in a two-story building. Each student will have a&lt;br/&gt;private bedroom and there will be a shared living area. The cabin will be of basic wood construction with&lt;br/&gt;gas heating. The two cooking cabins will each house either a researcher family or four graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;There will be two bedrooms upstairs with a cooking and living area downstairs.&lt;br/&gt;The RMBL has been an important center for biological research and training. Scientists at the&lt;br/&gt;RMBL have published approximately 1000 papers in peer reviewed journals. In addition to basic research&lt;br/&gt;conducted at the Lab on diverse areas such as butterfly physiology, stream ecology, and marmot behavior,&lt;br/&gt;science at the RMBL has been used to shape the revision of the Clean Air Act and has documented how&lt;br/&gt;climate change will affect montane ecosystems. Scientists who have trained or worked at the Lab have&lt;br/&gt;been influential in identifying the problem of human population growth as well as founding the academic&lt;br/&gt;disciplines of Conservation and Restoration Biology to provide solutions to real world problems. By&lt;br/&gt;providing funding to renovate housing, the National Science Foundation will help ensure that scientists at&lt;br/&gt;the RMBL can continue to provide information policy makers need in making decisions concerning the&lt;br/&gt;environment.</AbstractNarration>
