    <AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to gain fundamental understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;deformation mechanisms that operate in nanostructured metals and&lt;br/&gt;alloys, in particular in those produced by severe plastic deformation&lt;br/&gt;(SPD) methods. Based on this knowledge it further aims to develop full&lt;br/&gt;capability to manufacture these materials in high quality bulk forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extremely attractive (and rare) combination of mechanical&lt;br/&gt;properties (high strength, ductility, fatigue resistance) and&lt;br/&gt;manufacturability of these materials leads to a new class of high&lt;br/&gt;performance alloys for structural uses. It is understood that this&lt;br/&gt;combination of properties is due to the formation of nano-scale grain&lt;br/&gt;sizes in these materials, but the mechanisms responsible for the high&lt;br/&gt;strength combined with high ductility are not well understood. This&lt;br/&gt;presents a fundamental obstacle to the optimization of these&lt;br/&gt;materials, or to predictions of the performance of these materials in&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An integrated approach with strong emphasis on manufacturing is&lt;br/&gt;proposed. On the theoretical side, deformation mechanisms will be&lt;br/&gt;simulated with crystal-plasticity aggregate models and with detailed&lt;br/&gt;models of the grains and grain boundaries. The experimental program&lt;br/&gt;covers a wide a range of strain rates and temperatures, texture&lt;br/&gt;development, and in situ transmission electron microscopy and atomic&lt;br/&gt;force microscopy to directly verify deformation mechanisms. The&lt;br/&gt;experimental results will provide validation to the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;modeling and manufacturing process simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, simulations of the manufacturing processes will enable&lt;br/&gt;process parameter optimization. A complete, miniature, yet fully&lt;br/&gt;scalable, manufacturing facility will be designed and implemented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significant impacts of the proposed research are made possible by&lt;br/&gt;the acquired fundamental understanding of the deformation mechanisms,&lt;br/&gt;and include advances in manufacturing techniques to produce these&lt;br/&gt;highly desirable materials in bulk. The miniature manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;facility will become a source of significant quantities of&lt;br/&gt;nano-structured alloys. Finally, the proposal will provide students at&lt;br/&gt;the UCSD and at local K-12 schools with interdisciplinary education in&lt;br/&gt;a cutting-edge area of research.</AbstractNarration>
