    <AbstractNarration>Professor Allen Bard of the University of Texas Austin is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study photoelectrochemical and optoelectronic effects in solid thin films and nanoparticle dispersions. The materials include traditional semiconductors like silicon and CdSe (quantum dots), as well as molecular films of substituted porphyrins, conjugated organics and inorganic salts. Low melting liquid crystals will be investigated, as well as inorganic molecular crystals like tris (2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II). Methods include electrochemistry and electrogenerated chemiluminescence as well as scanning probe microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charge transfer and electrical characteristics of novel material films are not well understood, and fundamental studies could lead to better high density memories, light emitting diodes and other electronic devices. Nontraditional semiconductor materials will be explored, with potential use in solar energy conversion and charge storage devices, for example.</AbstractNarration>
