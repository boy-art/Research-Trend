    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this Minority Research Planning Grant is to use non-cultivation based methods to&lt;br/&gt;characterize the microbial populations associated with natural hydrocarbon seeps in Yellowstone&lt;br/&gt;National Park. In addition to its well-known hot springs, Yellowstone has a few documented&lt;br/&gt;areas that contain hydrocarbon seeps. These seeps are typically associated with thermal vents and&lt;br/&gt;the best characterized ones occur in terrestrial areas. The proposed research will focus on soil&lt;br/&gt;samples to be taken from the Calcite Springs area, where several hydrocarbon seeps exist. The&lt;br/&gt;specific objectives of this planning grant are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Evaluate soil microbial diversity in Calcite Springs soil containing naturally occurring&lt;br/&gt;hydrocarbons.&lt;br/&gt;2. Examine functional gene diversity and evolutionary relatedness to characterized genes&lt;br/&gt;encoding hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes (PAH dioxygenases).&lt;br/&gt;3. Characterize the abundance and types of hydrocarbons present in Calcite Springs soil&lt;br/&gt;adjacent to hydrocarbon seeps.&lt;br/&gt;Clone libraries of 16S rRNA genes and PAH dioxygenase gene fragments will be constructed&lt;br/&gt;and sequenced to identify microorganisms and catabolic pathways present in hydrocarbon-&lt;br/&gt;impacted soil. A thorough chemical analysis of soil samples (GC-MS) will also be performed to&lt;br/&gt;identify and quantify the major hydrocarbons present. This study will provide the first&lt;br/&gt;investigation into the phylogenetic diversity of soil microbial populations associated with&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial hydrocarbon seeps in Yellowstone National Park. This information is of interest&lt;br/&gt;primarily due the extended exposure to hydrocarbons that these microbial populations have&lt;br/&gt;received. As such, novel microorganisms and/or metabolic pathways may have evolved in this&lt;br/&gt;setting. As a planning grant targeting underrepresented minorities in science, this award will help&lt;br/&gt;to increase the participation of a minority scientist in NSF-funded research. Furthermore, this&lt;br/&gt;planning grant will be used to generate sufficient preliminary data for an NSF CAREER proposal&lt;br/&gt;to combine research and teaching efforts focused on the microbial ecology of hydrocarbon seeps&lt;br/&gt;in Yellowstone National Park.</AbstractNarration>
