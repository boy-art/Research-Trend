    <AbstractNarration>The Energy-Aware Articulation in Sensor Networks program will develop and demonstrate a fundamental, new distributed sensing capability that combine intelligent nodes with articulated electromagnetic communication systems, articulated sensors, and articulated energy collection devices. This program directly addresses primary, long-standing problems in distributed wireless sensors with a comprehensive, new approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed, networked, wireless sensor systems are being developed and deployed for diverse applications ranging from physical security to environmental monitoring. In the past, conventional systems have been deployed in a static fashion with their critical components (communication, sensing, and energy collection) being fixed to the sensor node package. This limits the antenna structure choices and sensor systems to only general purpose, fixed systems that may operate at far from an optimal configuration with severe limitations on antenna gain and link energy requirements as well as sensor event detection and identification capability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Energy-Aware Articulation in Sensor Networks program will develop the principles for a direct solution to these system limitations through a convergence of actuator principles, energy-aware articulated networking, articulated distributed sensing, and distributed computing fundamentals. This will be based on distributed sensor node systems in an open, shared testbed that include nodes carrying articulated antenna structures (for optimized, high gain communication), articulated sensors (for optimized and cooperative event detection), and articulated solar energy collection (for extending operating life.) The combination of these capabilities promises to impact nearly all the system characteristics from deployment through detection capability.</AbstractNarration>
