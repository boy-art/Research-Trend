    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002. The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Influence of Nutritional Cues on Reproduction in Nomadic Songbirds." The objectives of this project are to investigate the influence of nutritional cues on the neuroendocrine regulation of reproductive development in two closely related nomadic songbirds (pine siskin and lesser goldfinch) that depend heavily upon foods that vary widely in availability between years and across broad geographic ranges.</AbstractNarration>
