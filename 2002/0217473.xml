    <AbstractNarration>0217473&lt;br/&gt;Rivers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GeoSoilEnviroCARS (GSECARS) is a national user facility for frontier research in the earth sciences using synchrotron radiation at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. GSECARS provides earth scientists with access to the high-brilliance hard x-rays from this third-generation synchrotron light source. The research conducted at this facility is advancing our knowledge of the composition, structure and properties of earth materials, the processes they control, and the processes that produce them. All principal synchrotron-based analytical techniques in demand by earth scientists are being brought to bear on earth science problems: (1) high-pressure/high-temperature crystallography and spectroscopy using the diamond anvil cell; (2) high-pressure/high-temperature crystallography using the large-volume press; (3) powder, single crystal and interface diffraction; (4) inelastic x-ray scattering; (5) x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy; (6) x-ray fluorescence microprobe analysis; and (7) microtomography. The unique capabilities of the APS and GSECARS have allowed groundbreaking experiments to be conducted in research areas relevant to the NSF-Earth Science program. This project will provide funds to: (1) to support the continued operation of GSECARS as a national-user facility; (2) to increase significantly the available beamtime by enabling simultaneous operation of the two experimental stations on the undulator beamline and completion of a second station on the bending magnet beamline; and (3) to develop and implement new experimental instrumentation to extend the capabilities of the facility. Major new instrumentation to be developed includes: (1) x-ray optics and shielded transport for tandem operation on the undulator beamline; (2) beamline components and diffraction instrumentation for a new side-station on the bending magnet beamline; (3) a monochromator for use at high-energy on the undulator beamline; and (4) tooling for deformation experiments in the multi-anvil press. Our mission is to provide a research environment where users receive expert assistance in planning and conducting experiments, and in analyzing data. This collaborative mode of operation, which allows the facility to be accessible to synchrotron radiation novices, requires a staff of highly qualified beamline scientists and technical personnel. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
