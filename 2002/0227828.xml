    <AbstractNarration>0227828&lt;br/&gt;Ramani &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to Purdue University to support the activity described below for 24 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060). The partners include Purdue University (Lead Institution), Alcoa, Caterpillar, Metal Technologies, GT Automation, Kirby Risk, Lear, Office of Technology Commercialization, Innovation Realization Lab, and WeToollT, 21st Century Research and Technology Fund, Cunningham Pattern &amp; Engineering, American Foundry Association, National Tooling and Manufacturers Association, Indiana Manufacturers Association, Mid-America Plastics Partners, and Central Indiana Corporate Partnership. The goals of the program include the following: (1) comprehensively integrate industrial tooling marketplace interactions into a streamlined structure and help manage the network using information technology, (2) use an advanced three-dimensional communication tool that will use and link geometry communication to partner manufacturing firms, and (3) promotion and use of advanced tools for rapid manufacturing by partnering with state-wide use in the tool and die education programs to enhance the readiness of the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;The program provides an integrated and structured development of the tooling/manufacturing capability for the manufacturing firms in Indiana. The infrastructure provides a common platform for all types of information exchanges including 3D Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing that will streamline and improve efficiency in the design to manufacturing cycle. Faculty of community colleges will be trained in advanced manufacturing technology so they can train the new workforce. A product informatics system is being developed at Purdue and will be made available to the manufacturing firms in Indiana. Technical support in rapid tooling, manufacture, and design will be provided to small manufacturing firms in the state. The program combines information technology with manufacturing technology and education programs that simultaneously develop the manufacturing workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to increase the efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing sector in Indiana. This will make the manufacturing sector in Indiana more competitive and contribute to the economic well-being of the region. Workforce development will provide workers for the growing industry. Underrepresented groups in technology-businesses will have a greater access to training and jobs in the manufacturing sector.</AbstractNarration>
