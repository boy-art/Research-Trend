    <AbstractNarration>National Wildlife productions is developing a large format film, "Predators and Prey," and related educational resources. The film will introduce audiences to cutting-edge scientific research through a topic that already captures their imagination and will use visually exciting scenes to present the science behind predator/prey relations. A preliminary conceptual structure, general approach and potential storyline have already been developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning phase will include the following activities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Further define the conceptual structure of the film&lt;br/&gt;-Conduct preproduction/front-end audience research&lt;br/&gt;-Refine the approaches to the film based on feedback from front-end research&lt;br/&gt;-Plan educational resources&lt;br/&gt;-Conduct a front-end survey of large-format film theaters to evaluate the title, approach and relevance of proposed educational resources.&lt;br/&gt;-Draft a film treatment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principals for the project bring a background of filmmaking and science. Christopher Palmer, President and CEO, National Wildlife Productions (NWP), will serve as Executive Producer for the film. Educational resources will be designed by Jim Stofan, Vice President, Education, NWP; and the Chief Science Consultant will be Sterling Miller, Senior Wildlife Biologist, NWP. Treatments and scripts will be written by Mose Richards and evaluation will be conducted by Robert Russell. A committee of scientists and science educators will help guide the project during the planning phase.</AbstractNarration>
