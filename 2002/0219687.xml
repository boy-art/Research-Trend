    <AbstractNarration>Evaluation and Personalization of Synthetic Voices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses two key issues in the generation of natural sounding spoken output by computer. The first aspect provides an evaluation strategy for synthetic voices. With no clear objective measure for speech synthesis quality, it is hard to show improvement in systems and compare techniques. This work provides a detailed list of evaluation techniques for sub-parts of the synthesis process including: text analysis, lexical pronunciation, prosody, and phonetic quality. The techniques are designed to act on existing and newly developed voices in other languages, where measures are often harder to come by. Appropriate human experimentation is used to justify the given metrics.&lt;br/&gt;The second aspect of this work is to improve modeling of speaker-specific acoustic phonetics. In unit selection synthesis techniques, matching the lexicon with the actual spoken form of a particular speaker can introduce significant noise in the selection process. Speakers will have particular idiolects for their dialect and style. Using data-driven techniques, within knowledge-based frameworks, we derive appropriate segmentation types for unit selection synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;Results are released through CMU's http://festvox.org site.</AbstractNarration>
