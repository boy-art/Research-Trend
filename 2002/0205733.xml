    <AbstractNarration>One of the difficulties facing computer security systems is getting users and administrators to adopt them. The project studies a new approach to deploying security services called Deployment-Oriented&lt;br/&gt;Security. The first question is how to deploy security services in a viral-like fashion. The idea is that once a small set of users adopt a security system, they gradually get their friends to adopt the&lt;br/&gt;system and as a result the service propagates through the population. The project studies how this meme-like strategy applies to various security services such as secure e-mail, anonymity mechanisms,&lt;br/&gt;electronic voting, secure file systems, e-cash, etc. Another approach to promoting the deployment of security systems is to deploy the required infrastructure on the fly. For example, can one deploy an&lt;br/&gt;anonymizing server or a fair-exchange service on the fly to enable that service? How does one identify trusted hosts to deploy the service and how does one revoke corrupt or misbehaving hosts? The&lt;br/&gt;third topic studied in this project is how to deploy protection mechanisms in environments where information is being shared. The project will use new cryptographic tools to develop efficient key &lt;br/&gt;management techniques for broadcast data.</AbstractNarration>
