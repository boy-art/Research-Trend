    <AbstractNarration>Continuing support via the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will permit U.S. ocean scientists in the academic research community to participate in specific activities of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research (SCOR). These activities are of particular interest to the ocean sciences community and the National Science Foundation. ICES is an intergovernmental organization that coordinates data and information exchange regarding scientific research, management of fisheries, environmental monitoring, and oceanographic research matters that are of common interest to countries bordering the North Atlantic. SCOR serves primarily as an organization to facilitate international collaboration of ocean research through the formation of working groups and publication of findings on various marine topics. Under this award U.S. academic research scientists will participate in selected ICES and SCOR activities in 2002-2004.</AbstractNarration>
