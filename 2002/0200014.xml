    <AbstractNarration>This project, in conjunction with similar support from American Automatic Control Council will support travel expenses to facilitate participation of roughly 50 students to the 2002 American Control Conference. It will provide a setting for exchanging ideas, cultivating friendships, building networks, educating students, and for preparing students for their professional careers in control engineering. Special sessions that should be of particular interest to students, including a session for graduate students seeking academic positions that will focus on proposal writing and the NSF CAREER program. Every effort will be made to select both an ethnically and scientifically diverse group of students to represent all areas of control engineering.</AbstractNarration>
