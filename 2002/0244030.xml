    <AbstractNarration>0244030 Guo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a five-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Pennsylvania State University's University Park Campus for 14 students each year for research in electrical engineering. The REU site is designed as a nine-week summer experience. Students will have an opportunity to participate in a broad range of research projects that include both traditional and emergent interdisciplinary fields of electrical and electronics engineering. The program will introduce participants to hands-on, cutting-edge research experiences especially designed for undergraduate students. Each student participant will be paired with a faculty mentor to work on a specific research topic. In addition students will participate in a number of group activities such as weekly research seminars and biweekly field trips to world-renown research centers. At the end of the summer program a mini research symposium will be held to give students an opportunity to share their experiences. Students will be selected nationwide with an emphasis on junior-level students outside of the University Park Campus that desire research opportunities. Current research collaborations with other universities will be used to assist in attracting students from population groups underrepresented in research fields in engineering. This program seeks to broaden opportunities and enable participation of domestic undergraduate students in research careers in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
