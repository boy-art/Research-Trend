    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204603&lt;br/&gt;Yakov Eliashberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposal is devoted to Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) whose&lt;br/&gt; framework was recently described by A. Givental, H. Hofer and the &lt;br/&gt; author of this proposal. SFT is a large project which lies on the &lt;br/&gt; borderline between Symplectic Geometry, Hamiltonian Dynamics, &lt;br/&gt; Enumerative Algebraic Geometry, Low-dimensional Topology, Theory of &lt;br/&gt; Integrable Systems in Mathematics, as well as String Theory and &lt;br/&gt; Mirror Symmetry in Theoretical Physics. Among the goals of the theory:&lt;br/&gt; - definition of new, SFT-based invariants of symplectic and contact &lt;br/&gt; manifolds and their Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds;&lt;br/&gt; - applications to the Low-dimensional topology;&lt;br/&gt; - development of new tools for proving enumerative results about &lt;br/&gt; periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems;&lt;br/&gt; - understanding of the appearance of integrable hierarchies in &lt;br/&gt; Gromov-Witten theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Symplectic Field Theory has already proved to have important &lt;br/&gt; applications. In particular, the ideas of the SFT were&lt;br/&gt; instrumental in the solution of several old outstanding questions&lt;br/&gt; in Symplectic Geometry and Hamiltonian Dynamics. There is a hope &lt;br/&gt; that some current research in the SFT may bring some breakthrough &lt;br/&gt; in the low-dimensional topology. Further development of the theory &lt;br/&gt; should also bring new applications not only inside Mathematics, but &lt;br/&gt; possibly in some areas of Theoretical Physics, including String &lt;br/&gt; Theory and Mirror Symmetry. Besides developing new applications the &lt;br/&gt; work under this project will also concentrate on building the &lt;br/&gt; rigorous foundations of the SFT.</AbstractNarration>
