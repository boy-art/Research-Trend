    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research involves various aspects of understanding the basic structure of string theory. Although many interconnections have been recently discovered between gauge theories, quantum gravity and conformal field theory as a result of string theory investigations, the organizing principle relating the different formulations of string theory has yet to be uncovered. It is hoped that by studying special limits of string theory, we will gradually reach a better understanding of the organizing principle. The PI intends to study the problem of the mixing of the ultraviolet and infrared properties in string theories in the simpler case of non-commutative field theory. By coupling non-commutative field theory to gravity it is hoped that some insight will be gained on the issue of the cosmological constant. The PI also intends to study solitons in non-commutative field theory as a tractable model for D-branes. He will also study non-commutative open string theories to better understand the high-energy behavior of such theories. As part of the PI's outreach program the PI will set up a program to have students from developing countries to come to Harvard for extended periods to be better exposed to forefront research in string theory. He will also develop a yearlong course on modern field theory based on new developments coming from string theory.</AbstractNarration>
