    <AbstractNarration>A central tenet of evolutionary biology is that natural selection leads to &lt;br/&gt;adaptation. Studies of house finches in Montana and Alabama have &lt;br/&gt;documented that indeed, these birds have rapidly adapted to the local &lt;br/&gt;environment, despite having colonized these highly ecologically distinct &lt;br/&gt;areas only in the last few decades. Local adaptations include different &lt;br/&gt;sizes and shapes for males and females but these changes have occurred too &lt;br/&gt;rapidly to be explained by genetically based changes alone. It has been &lt;br/&gt;documented previously that rapid changes in how male and female house &lt;br/&gt;finches grow and develop in Montana and Alabama are responsible for &lt;br/&gt;differences between the populations. In particular it is the allocation of &lt;br/&gt;males and females to different positions in the laying order and strong and &lt;br/&gt;sex-specific effects of laying order on growth and development that led to &lt;br/&gt;rapid changes in the populations. How such maternal effects can affect the &lt;br/&gt;growth of males and females is the focus of this study. This investigation &lt;br/&gt;will test whether female allocation of hormones such as testosterone and &lt;br/&gt;prolactin, specific nutrients such as carotenoids and lipids, overall &lt;br/&gt;nutrient content of eggs, or the timing of egg incubation varies across &lt;br/&gt;laying order and how each of these factors affects the growth and &lt;br/&gt;development of male and female offspring. Our investigation is fundamental &lt;br/&gt;to a better understanding of how natural selection can lead to rapid &lt;br/&gt;adaptation to local environments. The ability to adjust the growth patterns &lt;br/&gt;of males and females as an adaptation to local environments may have &lt;br/&gt;enabled the house finch and some other invasive vertebrate species to &lt;br/&gt;colonize highly distinct and changing environments.</AbstractNarration>
