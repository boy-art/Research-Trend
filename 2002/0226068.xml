    <AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;OIA-0226068&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the workshop are to: brief G-8 representatives on the roles, methodologies, and impacts of research assessment activities in the United States; compare and contrast U.S. and other G-8 approaches to research assessment; develop best-practices in research assessment; identify major unresolved research and implementation issues; and contribute to the development of collaborative policy and research networks in research assessment activities among G-8 members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assuming these objectives are realized, all US agencies that conduct or support &lt;br/&gt;research will benefit from the development and dissemination of best practices in &lt;br/&gt;research assessment and the identification of major unresolved issues. The research &lt;br/&gt;community will also benefit from the dissemination of information on comparative &lt;br/&gt;methodologies for research assessment.</AbstractNarration>
