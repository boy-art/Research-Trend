    <AbstractNarration>The curcuminoids and gingerols are medicinally important metabolites found in the rhizome tissue (underground stem) of turmeric and ginger plants. In addition to their role as colorants and flavorants in these plants, these compounds have been show to possess anti-inflammatory and other important pharmacological properties. Because of these properties, turmeric and ginger rhizome powder and extracts have been used for millennia as spices, as important elements in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, and as important parts of modern herbal remedies that are designed to reduce inflammation. In addition, these compounds may form the basis for future anti-inflammatory drugs. Despite their importance to human health, nothing is known about the biochemical pathways (the enzymes or the respective encoding genes) that produce these and structurally similar compounds. Furthermore, almost nothing is known about gene expression and metabolic regulation in plant rhizomes.&lt;br/&gt;The advent of large scale automated gene sequencing (genomics), related methods for analysis of gene function (functional genomics), and improvements in instrumentation for protein purification (biochemistry) and metabolite analysis (metabolic profiling), now allow for application of a biochemical functional genomics approach to this problem. These technologies will be used to investigate how turmeric and ginger produce the medicinally important natural products that accumulate in their rhizome tissues. A detailed characterization of all metabolites made in rhizomes of ginger and turmeric plants will be made (metabolic profiling). Genes that are actively expressed in the rhizomes will be isolated and sequenced. The sequence information will be used to identify the enzymes responsible for the formation of the metabolites in these rhizomes. This information will also be used to identify rhizome-specific genes. Interesting target genes and their corresponding proteins will be characterized for their specific roles in the production of specific metabolites in the rhizome or in the development and biology of the rhizome in general.</AbstractNarration>
