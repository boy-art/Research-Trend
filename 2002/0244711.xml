    <AbstractNarration>This NSF-Europe project involves a strong collaboration between experimentalists and theorists at Northwestern University in the US, and the Universities of Camerino, L,Aquila, and Perugia in Italy. Overall focus is on room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors for spintronics applications. The US workers will fabricate and characterize MBE heterostructures based on Mn-doped chalcopyrites; Italian workers focus on Mn-doped Ge. There is much complementary instrumentation available to study the materials. Theory is based on first principles density-functional methods that are used to accurately predict both electronic and magnetic properties of the semiconductor materials. The educational aspects are strong, and involve participation of students at all levels from undergraduate up, and with interchanges of students from the US and Italian universities. The students and post-docs will receive excellent training in topics of major current interest in condensed matter physics and nanoscience.</AbstractNarration>
