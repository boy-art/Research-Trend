    <AbstractNarration>Research diving over the last two decades has yielded important insights into the ecological importance of giant (&gt;1 mm) Foraminifera in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Unfortunately, due to logistics constraints the in-situ behavior of these single-celled organisms and their interactions within the food web can be observed only in 'snapshots' during summer dives, when algal production is at a maximum in conditions of 24-hour light. Much would be learned by observing Foraminifera over extended periods of time, to study mobility, response to food availability, and other directed behaviors. It would be very valuable to be able to extend observations to the winter months, in order to study these organisms under dark conditions with no algal production, and to experimentally manipulate in situ conditions and observe the behavioral response. Research diving requires costly support and cannot provide extended observation of individual organisms. Currently, logistical requirements, costs, complexities, and risks of winter diving at remote locations in Antarctica are prohibitive. However, manned diving is not required in order to make long-term in-situ observations. Technology and communications have advanced to the point where it is feasible and practical to install video macro- and micro-view cameras in a submersible enclosure, transmitting both live and sequential time-lapse images over the Internet to a remote user throughout the year. Such an instrumentation platform could then be used for experimental manipulation of the environment. The objective of this proposal is to develop a submersible, remotely-operable underwater observatory for the study of Foraminifera and associated benthic fauna. This observatory would be connected to a shoreline unit by fiber-optic cable and linked by radio to the Internet for year-round access. The design and operation of this observatory will function as a technology template to meet other year-round Antarctic research requirements by means of telescience rather than personnel deployment.</AbstractNarration>
