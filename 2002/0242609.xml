    <AbstractNarration>This project designs, produces and tests two professional development modules on the big ideas of early algebra. The modules, on themes of generalization and functions, are part of the "Developing Mathematical Ideas (DMI)," a series designed for K-8 teachers of mathematics. DMI seminars support teacher learning of mathematics and of children's mathematical thinking. Five modules have already been produced on themes of arithmetic, geometry and data. The modules on early algebra would complete the series. The materials include print and video cases, mathematics activities for adults, investigations into the mathematical thinking of participants' own students, analyses of lessons drawn from a variety of curricula, homework assignments, assessment items and an essay on highlights of related research. The materials are packaged in three pieces: the Facilitator's Guide, the Casebook and the Video. Each module is designed for 8 three-hour sessions. In addition to the development of the professional development materials, the project includes the pilot and field testing of professional development seminars</AbstractNarration>
