    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project designs and develops an adaptive remote-data access system for wireless handheld devices. The key innovations in the project include adaptive data compression and adaptive partitioning techniques to save network bandwidth and battery consumption. The central concept is the ability to adapt to the changing wireless network environment and to different types of data. The proposed techniques go beyond existing bandwidth-saving techniques such as nonadaptive compression and "diff"-based data synchronization. A research prototype will be built for extensive experimentation in order to measure the effectiveness of the proposed technique for the saving of network bandwidth and battery consumption. This prototype will integrate heterogeneous systems, runtime systems, and compiler techniques. &lt;br/&gt;Commercial Applications of Research: The success of this research will lead to a software product which provides users of wireless handheld devices with secure, convenient, and cost-effective access to the data (and associated applications) located on their stationary computer systems, such as desktop machines and servers. This product can be used by both business and individual users for various functionalities which require to access data stored on the main computer systems in the form of text, graphics, photographs, data images, speeches, sound, and so on. The adaptive features of the system fulfill the need of remote-centric workforce to access host-based data and applications from anywhere at any time over wireless connections in a highly cost-effective way.</AbstractNarration>
