    <AbstractNarration>This is a US-Polish collaborative research project on new possibilities for Higgs physics and electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). The principal investigator is Dr. John Gunion from the University of California at Davis. His Polish collaborator is Dr. Bohdan Grzadkowski from Warsaw University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will focus on exploring new possibilities for WESB and Higgs physics as well as on means for testing these new ideas using forthcoming accelerator data.&lt;br/&gt;Progress made in this research area could have profound impact on interpreting new accelerator data in such a way that fundamental progress in the construction of an ultimate theory of elementary particle/fundamental interactions will be possible. This project will also provide US graduate students opportunities to enhance their experience and familiarity with the global science and engineering world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in physics fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.</AbstractNarration>
