    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel material, Bio-Carbon Nano-Tube (BCNT), for a neural prosthetic application. The project involves a highly innovative approach, which uses a surface-engineered nanostructured silicon wafer as a template to grow the desired BCNT material. In this way, the carbon nanotubes nucleate will grow in a specific alignment due to the restrictions set by the size and shape of the nano-structured silicon matrix. Also, the project will investigate the feasibility of forming BCNT material on nanostructured porous silicon substrates and will conduct in-vitro studies on nerve cell function and fibrous scar tissue formation. Subsequent work will optimize the growth process for BCNT and conduct systematic studies aimed at demonstrating the medical, and possibly industrial, applications of the proposed functional nanostructured material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, the material is expected to perform many functions, in particular, as a neural prosthetic material to bridge damaged areas of the central and peripheral nervous systems in patients with neurological disorders. Preliminary studies conducted using existing nano-carbon tube technology, have had limited success due to the lack of control on growth of aligned nanotubes with desired size, shape, and electrical properties. The current approach will overcome these limitations.</AbstractNarration>
