    <AbstractNarration>This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students enrolled in Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics. The project brings faculty from the three campuses of Miami-Dade Community College together to help implement the program. Over a two-year period M-DCC seeks to award a total of forty scholarships to these students. Besides the financial eligibility, the scholarships recipients must also meet established academic criteria that will enable them to obtain Associate in Arts degrees in computer science, mathematics, and engineering. The students have the opportunity to get involved in summer internships with local industries. Upon completion of the program, the students may continue on to an upper division school or those who receive training, may directly enter into the workforce. Faculty Mentors are assigned to each scholarship recipient in order to improve the quality of their educational experience and thereby improve the student's chances for academic success.</AbstractNarration>
