The Limited-Service Brokerage Decision: Theory and Evidence								JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS				43	3			336	358		10.1007/s11146-009-9217-8			OCT 2011	2011	This study examines the home seller's brokerage services decision, comparing full-service brokerage and limited-service arrangements. A model is developed which considers seller motivation and availability of effort, along with the cost of brokerage services, broker productivity and market dynamics as factors of influence in this decision. Limited-service arrangements are found to have a significant impact on price and marketing time. The popularity of limited-service arrangements is strongly influenced by the total dollar cost of brokerage services, which, in turn, is determined by housing market conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0895-5638			WOS:000293393700004		
J	Von White, Gregory, II; Mohammed, Fiaz S.; Kitchens, Christopher L.				White II, Gregory/F-8267-2013				Small-Angle Neutron Scattering Investigation of Gold Nanoparticle Clustering and Ligand Structure Under Antisolvent Conditions								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				115	38			18397	18405		10.1021/jp112020r			SEP 29 2011	2011	Solution-based nanoparticle synthesis offers many benefits, primarily control over nanoparticle size, shape, and surface chemistry, as appropriate for different applications. Often, excess stabilizing ligand or surfactant is required during synthesis and remains in solution. This can be deleterious to end applications, and thus postsynthesis purification must be employed. Ethanol is a common liquid antisolvent used to purify and size-selectively fractionate hydrophobically modified metallic nanoparticles dispersed in organic solvents, particularly toluene or hexane. We have employed small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to investigate the nanoparticle ligand response to antisolvent conditions for gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in toluene-d(8) and n-hexane-d(14) at varying ethanol-d(6) antisolvent compositions. These conditions are common in postsynthesis nanoparticle purification, fractionation, and surface deposition. The ligand lengths and ligand solvation for octadecanethiol and dodecanethiol modified GNPs were found to decrease from 16 to 8 A and 13 to 7 A, respectively, with increasing ethanol-d(6) concentrations, directly impacting their dispersibility in solution. Calculated Flory-Huggins interaction parameters were found to support the trends determined by SANS. This research has led to a greater understanding of ligand structure and solvation during the nanoparticle precipitation process, providing critical results to model the ligand repulsion contributions to the interparticle interaction energy, which governs the nanoparticle behavior in solution. In addition, nanoparticle clustering was observed at dilute concentrations, and a fractal cluster model was used to interpret the SANS data.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447			WOS:000295058100001		
J	Hu, Meng-Jun; Cox, Kerik D.; Schnabel, Guido; Luo, Chao-Xi								Monilinia Species Causing Brown Rot of Peach in China								PLOS ONE				6	9					e24990	10.1371/journal.pone.0024990			SEP 27 2011	2011	In this study, 145 peaches and nectarines displaying typical brown rot symptoms were collected from multiple provinces in China. A subsample of 26 single-spore isolates were characterized phylogenetically and morphologically to ascertain species. Phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), b-tubulin (TUB2) revealed the presence of three distinct Monilinia species. These species included Monilinia fructicola, Monilia mumecola, and a previously undescribed species designated Monilia yunnanensis sp. nov. While M. fructicola is a well-documented pathogen of Prunus persica in China, M. mumecola had primarily only been isolated from mume fruit in Japan. Koch's postulates for M. mumecola and M. yunnanensis were fulfilled confirming pathogenicity of the two species on peach. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS, G3PDH, and TUB2 sequences indicated that M. yunnanensis is most closely related to M. fructigena, a species widely prevalent in Europe. Interestingly, there were considerable differences in the exon/intron structure of the cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene between the two species. Morphological characteristics, including spore size, colony morphology, lesion growth rate, and sporulation, support the phylogenetic evidence suggesting the designation of M. yunnanensis as a new species. A new multiplex PCR method was developed to facilitate the detection of M. yunnanensis and differentiation of Monilinia spp. causing brown rot of peach in China.									30	4	0	24	0	34			1932-6203			WOS:000295933700013	21980371

Glycerol 3-Phosphate Alters Trypanosoma brucei Hexokinase Activity in Response to Environmental Change								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				286	38			33150	33157		10.1074/jbc.M111.235705			SEP 23 2011	2011	The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, compartmentalizes some metabolic enzymes within peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. The amounts, activities, and types of glycosomal enzymes are modulated coincident with developmental and environmental changes. Pexophagy (fusion of glycosomes with acidic lysosomes) has been proposed to facilitate this glycosome remodeling. Here, we report that, although glycosome-resident enzyme T. brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1) protein levels are maintained during pexophagy, acidification inactivates the activity. Glycerol 3-phosphate, which is produced in vivo by a glycosome-resident glycerol kinase, mitigated acid inactivation of lysate-derived TbHK activity. Using recombinant TbHK1, we found that glycerol 3-P influenced enzyme activity at pH 6.5 by preventing substrate and product inhibition by ATP and ADP, respectively. Additionally, TbHK1 inhibition by the flavonol quercetin (QCN) was partially reversed by glycerol 3-P at pH 7.4, whereas at pH 6.5, enzyme activity in the presence of QCN was completely maintained by glycerol 3-P. However, glycerol 3-P did not alter the interaction of QCN with TbHK1, as the lone Trp residue (Trp-177) was quenched under all conditions tested. These findings suggest potential novel mechanisms for the regulation of TbHK1, particularly given the acidification of glycosomes that can be induced under a variety of parasite growth conditions.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0021-9258			WOS:000294968800034	21813651

We characterized a model system, a nickel sample infused with bismuth atoms, by using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and observed a bilayer interfacial phase that is the underlying cause of embrittlement. This finding provides a new perspective for understanding the atomic-scale embrittlement mechanism and for developing strategies to control the practically important liquid metal embrittlement and the more general grain boundary embrittlement phenomena in alloys. This study further demonstrates that adsorption can induce a coupled grain boundary structural and chemical phase transition that causes drastic changes in properties.									86	4	0	4	0	88			0036-8075			WOS:000295121500037	21940889

Thereafter, the hydrolysates were sequentially fractionated by ultra filtration membranes in cut-off molecular weight (MW) of 30, 10 and 1 kDa and tested in terms of their reducing power (RP). The results show that the alcalase hydrolysates possessed strong RP ability, particularly for the fraction within <1 kDa. This fraction was further treated by high-intensity pulsed electric field (PEF) to investigate its effect on the antioxidant activity of the peptide within 6 h. The result demonstrated that the PEF could significantly improve the antioxidant activity of the treated peptide fraction within 4 h, but the effects might be reversible.									16	5	0	14	0	21			1684-5315			WOS:000298538000042

For a small number of electrons, in the presence of an external magnetic field and of the Coulomb interaction, the energy spectrum of the system is calculated through an exact numerical diagonalization procedure. The eigenstates thus determined are used to estimate the charge and spin densities around the ring. We find that when more than two electrons are considered, the charge density deformations induced by SOIs are dramatically flattened by the Coulomb repulsion, while the spin density deformations are amplified.									13	0	0	1	0	13			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000295045200005

The galaxy was discovered at low Galactic latitude by 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen (H-I). We have obtained follow-up observations with the Expanded Very Large Array and the 0.9 m Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy optical telescope. The Hi distribution overlaps an uncataloged, potential optical counterpart. The H-I linear size is 1.4 kpc at our adopted distance of D = 7 Mpc, but the distance estimate is uncertain as Hubble's law is unreliable at low recessional velocities. The optical counterpart has m(B) = 16.9 mag and B - R = 0.1 mag. These characteristics, including M-HI = 10(7.0) M-circle dot and L-B = 10(7.5) L-circle dot, if at 7 Mpc, indicate that this galaxy is a blue compact dwarf, but this remains uncertain until further follow-up observations are complete. Optical follow-up observations are ongoing and near-infrared follow-up observations have been scheduled.									2	0	1	0	0	3			2041-8205			WOS:000294762900026

Measurement of other physical properties of the glasses, including the density, glass transition temperature, and coefficient of thermal expansion has been conducted in order to accurately calculate the viscosity as a function of temperature and glass composition. The variation in fragility of the glasses is explained in the context of frozen-in configurational entropy in the glasses. This configurational entropy has minima at the endpoints of the one-dimensional network of amorphous selenium and the fully three-dimensional network of As(40)Se(60), and an apparent maximum at the composition As(30)Se(70). The frozen-in configurational entropy can be well described by a modified entropy of mixing of two solid solutions model, implying that the topological contribution to configurational entropy is nearly constant across the composition space studied.

However, even though the analytical rate was only shown to be gamma(-1/2) (where gamma is the stabilization parameter), the computational results suggest the rate may be improvable to gamma(-1). We prove herein the analytical rate is indeed gamma(-1), and extend the result to other incompressible flow problems including Leray-alpha and MHD. Numerical results are given that verify the theory.

The study demonstrated that the anthocyanin extracts and the selected chemicals obeyed the competitive mode against the enzymes. The methanolic extracts of whole fruit, and skin Of the muscadine showed inhibitory activities against the alpha-glucosidase with their IC(50) values at 1.50 and 273 mg/mL, and those against the lipase at 16.90 and 11.15 mg/mL, respectively, which indicated that the muscadine extracts possessed strong antidiabetic activities. Particularly, the ethyl acetate (EtoAc) extract and the butanol (BuOH) extract exhibited much higher inhibitory activities against both enzymes than the CHCl(3) and water extracts, While the majority of anthocyanins existed in the BuOH Tractions. Moreover, cyanidin exhibited a much stronger antidiabetic activity than cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, suggesting that anthocyanins may have higher inhibitory activities after being digested. Further chromatographic analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry identified five individual anthocyanins, including cyanidin, delphinidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin glycosides.									31	1	0	23	0	32			0021-8561			WOS:000294585100058	21797278

The SL consists of an array of quantum wells equally spaced along a spatial direction separated by narrow barriers, such that, in the presence of inter-well tunneling, a miniband energy structure is established. The semi-metallic ErAs nanoparticles are embedded inside the quantum wells in the process of growth of the SL, as reported in several recent experiments. Their effect on thermoelectric transport is considered through an additional contribution to the electron scattering rate, that is correlated with a process of resonant tunneling through the nanoparticle-semiconductor interface modeled as a Schottky barrier. In a semi-classical approximation of the miniband conduction regime, we calculate the electric conductivity, the thermopower and the power factor as a function of the barrier height and demonstrate the presence of a filtering effect, whereby the Seebeck coefficient is enhanced by the additional scattering.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0953-8984			WOS:000294292900015	21857098

Enhances Plant Fungal Disease Resistance								PLOS ONE				6	9					e24677	10.1371/journal.pone.0024677			SEP 12 2011	2011	Background: Turfgrass species are agriculturally and economically important perennial crops. Turfgrass species are highly susceptible to a wide range of fungal pathogens. Dollar spot and brown patch, two important diseases caused by fungal pathogens Sclerotinia homoecarpa and Rhizoctonia solani, respectively, are among the most severe turfgrass diseases. Currently, turf fungal disease control mainly relies on fungicide treatments, which raises many concerns for human health and the environment. Antimicrobial peptides found in various organisms play an important role in innate immune response.Methodology/Principal Findings: The antimicrobial peptide - Penaeidin4-1 (Pen4-1) from the shrimp, Litopenaeus setiferus has been reported to possess in vitro antifungal and antibacterial activities against various economically important fungal and bacterial pathogens. In this study, we have studied the feasibility of using this novel peptide for engineering enhanced disease resistance into creeping bentgrass plants (Agrostis stolonifera L., cv. Penn A-4). Two DNA constructs were prepared containing either the coding sequence of a single peptide, Pen4-1 or the DNA sequence coding for the transit signal peptide of the secreted tobacco AP24 protein translationally fused to the Pen4-1 coding sequence. A maize ubiquitin promoter was used in both constructs to drive gene expression. Transgenic turfgrass plants containing different DNA constructs were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and analyzed for transgene insertion and expression. In replicated in vitro and in vivo experiments under controlled environments, transgenic plants exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to dollar spot and brown patch, the two major fungal diseases in turfgrass. The targeting of Pen4-1 to endoplasmic reticulum by the transit peptide of AP24 protein did not significantly impact disease resistance in transgenic plants.Conclusion/Significance: Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of Pen4-1 in a perennial species against fungal pathogens and suggest a potential strategy for engineering broad-spectrum fungal disease resistance in crop species.									13	1	0	13	0	14			1932-6203			WOS:000294803200037	21931807

This phase supports localized zero-energy Majorana fermions at the ends of the wire. However, the non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana fermions is difficult to verify because of the one-dimensional topology of such wires. In this paper we propose a scheme to transport Majorana fermions between the ends of different wires using tunneling, which is shown to be controllable by gate voltages. Such tunneling-generated hops of Majorana fermions can be used to exchange the Majorana fermions. The exchange process thus obtained is described by a non-Abelian braid operator that is uniquely determined by the well-controlled microscopic tunneling parameters.									66	0	0	4	0	66			1098-0121			WOS:000294773500009

Previous investigations identified five families within the uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) superfamily. All enzymes within the superfamily studied thus far exhibit uracil-DNA glycosylase activity. Here we identify a new class of DNA glycosylases in the UDG superfamily that lacks UDG activity. Instead, these enzymes act as hypoxanthine-DNA glycosylases in vitro and in vivo. Molecular modeling and structure-guided mutational analysis allowed us to identify a unique catalytic center in this class of DNA glycosylases. Based on unprecedented biochemical properties and phylogenetic analysis, we propose this new class of DNA repair glycosylases that exists in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as family 6 and designate it as the hypoxanthine-DNA glycosylase family. This study demonstrates the structural evolvability that underlies substrate specificity and catalytic flexibility in the evolution of enzymatic function.									16	0	0	15	0	16			0021-9258			WOS:000294487500023	21642431

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS				38						L17106	10.1029/2011GL048424			SEP 7 2011	2011	The Horizontal E-region Experiment (HEX) sounding rocket experiment deployed a nearly horizontal trimethyl aluminum trail over a horizontal distance that extended more than 200 km in the meridional direction. The trail was released in the upper part of the E region between 135 and 150 km during quiet conditions with a pair of narrow auroral arcs located near the northern end of the trail. A surprising result was that large zonal winds, exceeding 250 m s(-1), were present over most of the southern half of the region in spite of the fact that the auroral forcing was very localized in meridional extent. We show that the flow was inertially unstable and suggest that the instability can account for the observed winds by significantly broadening the meridional extent of the winds generated within narrow channels in the auroral oval. The analysis focuses on the HEX observations but has broader implications since it suggests that narrow discrete arcs can generate channels of enhanced flow that are much wider than the arcs themselves. Narrow arcs can therefore have a much larger effect on the neutral circulation than would otherwise be expected. Citation: Larsen, M. F., and M. G.

The semiannual oscillation (SAO) of tidal amplitudes is dominant above similar to 88 km, with amplitudes at equinoxes 2-3 times larger than at solstices. Below 88 km, the annual oscillation (AO) dominates, and its magnitude is smaller than the SAO. The AO dominates in the phase variation of the diurnal tide, which advances in winter and lags in summer as compared with equinoxes. The vertical wavelength also has a noticeable seasonal variation with shorter vertical wavelengths found at equinoxes. The reconstructed diurnal tide from the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) Doppler interferometer (TIDI) and Sounding the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) measurements is compared with the meteor radar observation, and a consistency is found in the seasonal variation of the tidal amplitude. On the basis of the TIDI and SABER measurements, the migrating diurnal tide (DW1) is the dominant tidal component, while three other nonmigrating tides, DW2, DS0, and DE3, are nonnegligible.

DETERMINING THE OPTIMUM TIMING FOR THE FINAL FURROW IRRIGATION ON MID-SOUTH COTTON								APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE				27	5			737	745					SEP 2011	2011	A common question from cotton farmers in the U.S. Mid-South is when to stop irrigating the crop. U.S. Cotton growers are adopting COTMAN to monitor crop development and aid in making end-of-season decisions concerning the optimal dates for safe termination of insect control and application of defoliants. The objective of this research was to investigate a similar crop-based recommendation for timing the final irrigation on cotton. Data sets from 28 Mid-South cotton fields conducting irrigation termination studies during the 2000 through 2007 growing seasons were analyzed. Day of year, days after planting, and growing degree days after planting, all until the last irrigation, did not provide a strong enough relationship with yield to guide late-season irrigation decisions. Days after nodes above white flower (NAWF)=5 (DA5) and growing degree days after NAWF=5 (GDDA5) of the last irrigation in the northern portion of the Mid-South did provide a yield impact estimate suitable for developing recommendations, but a relationship for fields south of 34 W latitude could not be established. Based on the resulting equations for a cotton price of $1.15 kg(-1) of lint, an irrigation applied after 18 days or 192 GDD, 15.6 degrees C base, after NAWF=5 would not be expected to produce enough additional yield to be profitable. The derived equations can also be used to determine the GDDA5 and DA5 of the last profitable irrigation for a known lint price and diesel cost, allowing the producer to react to his or her individual situation. Six of the fields were harvested twice and a later crop (i.e., a lower % first harvest) was associated with later irrigation, though the differences were not always significant. When fiber quality was measured, significant differences were seldom observed and no consistent trend relating to final irrigation was observed. However, because of the price discounts associated with low or high micronaire and the relationship between micronaire and crop maturity, additional research is needed to refine the fiber-quality relationship for the Mid-South.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0883-8542			WOS:000296997000008		
J	Bunget, C.; Salandro, W. A.; Mears, L.								Evaluation of lubricants for electrically-assisted forming								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE				225	B9			1692	1702		10.1177/0954405411401267			SEP 2011	2011	The automobile and aerospace sectors are increasingly turning their attention to the opportunities created by the use of lightweight alloys with large strength-to-weight ratios, such as aluminium, magnesium, stainless steel, and titanium alloys. However, when using conventional forming processes, these light materials create processing challenges: low formability and high yield strength. Electrically assisted forming (EAF) is a method that can overcome these limitations. Specifically, EAF is a novel forming process where electricity is applied to the metallic workpiece during deformation. Previous investigations have shown that EAF creates a reduction in flow stress, an increase in formability, an ability to reduce/eliminate springback, and an improved precision. This study investigates the influence of electricity on lubricant performance and identifies lubricant candidates for EAF. When electricity is applied, besides the changes due to surface expansion at the interface that occur in conventional processes, the lubricant is exposed to high localized temperatures and current fields. Electrically assisted ring compression tests are conducted and the performance characteristics of three lubricants are evaluated. By combining the experiments and finite element simulation results, friction coefficients can be estimated, and the effect of electric current flow on friction characteristics quantified.					36th MATADOR Conference on Advances in Machining Technology36th MATADOR Conference on Advances in Machining Technology	JUL, 2010JUL, 2010		Manchester, ENGLANDManchester, ENGLAND	1	0	0	0	0	1			0954-4054			WOS:000296162900021

We examine 213,579 voting decisions made by 1799 mutual funds from 94 fund families for 1047 shareholder proposals voted on between July 2003 and June 2005. In an analysis of voting across funds within the same fund family, we find significant divergence in voting within families, emphasizing the importance of focusing on voting by individual funds. We also find that, in general, mutual funds vote more affirmatively for potentially wealth-increasing proposals and funds' voting approval rates for these beneficial resolutions are significantly higher than those of other investors. Our results suggest that funds tend to support proposals targeting firms with weaker governance. We also find that funds with lower turnover ratios and social funds are more likely to support shareholder proposals. Finally, fund voting approval rates significantly impact whether a proposal passes and whether one is implemented.

Within the context of the optimal process target problem, a new model is proposed in this paper and two distinct contributions to the related topic are offered. First, while most research work assumes a given process distribution with a known variance, this paper integrates response surface designs into solving the optimal process target problem, thus removing the need to make assumptions regarding process parameters. Second, typical response surface designs consider second-order fitted functions; however, this paper considers a procedure to include higher-order polynomial terms that will result in higher prediction capabilities, thereby giving a more accurate representation of the true process. A constrained nonlinear optimization scheme is used to facilitate the development of this methodology and a numerical example is provided for illustration.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0268-3768			WOS:000293247100002

COMMENTARY: A SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE ON OBESITY AMONG LATINOS								ETHNICITY & DISEASE				21	4			467	472					FAL 2011	2011	The Southeast United States has experienced rapid growth in the Latino population - mostly Mexican immigrants - with the number of Latinos in the region nearly quadrupling over the past decade. These states, known as new settlement areas, are not as well prepared to meet the health needs of Spanish-speaking immigrants compared to traditional settlement states like Florida, Texas, and California. Unfortunately for these families, immigration to the United States is often associated with becoming obese, or having children at a higher risk for obesity. Rates of obesity have risen dramatically among all racial and ethnic groups in the past few decades, however, Latinos of all ages have the highest rates of overweight and obesity compared to other racial and ethnic groups. One explanation is that although adjustment to a new environment and culture takes considerable time, the adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet occurs more rapidly, leading to significant increases in obesity between first and subsequent generations. Families are important referents in establishing health behaviors in children, and there are broader social and physical environmental factors that have strong associations with the development of obesity as well. Moreover, immigrant families must strive to be healthy while coping with acculturative stressors. Relationships between all of these factors are typically studied in isolation. This article explores obesity among new settlement Latino families and provides an integrated conceptual model anchored in the social ecological perspective.

Component mode synthesis approaches for quantum mechanical electrostatic analysis of nanoscale devices								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ELECTRONICS				10	3			300	313		10.1007/s10825-011-0366-7			SEP 2011	2011	In this paper, two component mode synthesis (CMS) approaches, namely, the fixed interface CMS approach and the free interface CMS approach, are presented and compared for an efficient solution of 2-D Schrodinger-Poisson equations for quantum-mechanical electrostatic analyses of nanostructures and devices with arbitrary geometries. In the CMS approaches, a nanostructure is divided into a set of substructures or components and the eigen-values (energy levels) and eigenvectors (wave functions) are computed first for all the substructures. The computed wave functions are then combined with constraint or attachment modes to construct a transformation matrix. By using the transformation matrix, a reduced-order system of the Schrodinger equation is obtained for the entire nanostructure. The global energy levels and wave functions can be obtained with the reduced-order system. Through an iteration procedure between the Schrodinger and Poisson equations, a self-consistent solution for charge concentration and potential profile can be obtained. Numerical calculations show that both CMS approaches can largely reduce the computational cost. The free interface CMS approach can provide significantly more accurate results than the fixed interface CMS approach with the same number of retained wave functions in each component. However, the fixed interface CMS approach is more efficient than the free interface CMS approach when large degrees of freedom are included in the simulation.									3	1	0	0	0	4			1569-8025			WOS:000300736500003

Thermal inkjet printing for precision histological staining								JOURNAL OF HISTOTECHNOLOGY				34	3			123	131		10.1179/2046023611Y.0000000003			SEP 2011	2011	Inkjet printing techniques may allow enhanced analysis of tissues. When the tissue available for processing is limited, for example, the amount of information obtained could be increased if different stains could be applied to discrete areas of the same tissue sections. In addition, it may be more desirable to stain an intact tissue rather than sections of tissue. Currently, there are very few methods by which many different stains can be applied in a controlled manner to a single section and/or single block of tissue. This paper presents a liquid deposition system, based on thermal inkjet technology, capable of precisely applying histological processing liquids to form high precision patterns at desired locations on both fixed tissues and cell monolayers. Four experiments were conducted to show the potential of single-drop reagent application, using aniline blue, toluidine blue, fluorescent probes, and an immunofluorescence antibody to create different patterns. Tissue type was shown to affect the overall quality of staining. The flexibility, resolution, and precision of this system have the potential to enable the formulation of new staining techniques to maximize the amount of information gleaned from a given tissue sample.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0147-8885	2046-0236		WOS:000297332600004

CUTEREBRID MYIASIS (DIPTERA: OESTRIDAE) IN CAPTIVE RING-TAILED LEMURS (LEMUR CATTA) AT A SOUTH CAROLINA ZOO								JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE				42	3			504	507					SEP 2011	2011	In September 2008, two ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), comprising a mother daughter pair, at the Greenville Zoo, Greenville, South Carolina, USA, were diagnosed with cuterebrid myiasis (Diptera: Oestridae) subsequent to sudden death of the adult lemur. On necropsy, a single bot warble was discovered in the subcutis of the axillary region. Histopathology revealed a severe eosinophilic bronchopneumonia. The juvenile lemur was inspected and found to have warbles on three separate dates in late September. One representative bot fly larva was identified as a Cuterebra sp. that normally infests lagomorphs in the southeastern United States. Cuterebrid myiasis is rarely reported in lemurs and has not been previously associated with pneumonia or death in these animals.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1042-7260			WOS:000295421500020	22950327

Analysis of Microscopic Injuries Caused by Southern Green Stink Bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) Feeding on Cotton Bolls								SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST				36	3			233	245					SEP 2011	2011	The southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.), utilizes stylets while feeding to pierce the wall of a boll of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., and can inoculate disease-causing pathogens into developing green bolls. Detection of diseased bolls is difficult because the surface of the carpel wall frequently lacks apparent macroscopic evidence of insect feeding regardless of infection; blisters on the interior surface of the carpel wall are commonly masked by darkened necrotic tissue. The objectives of this study were to characterize microscopic evidence of feeding by laboratory-reared southern green stink bugs on greenhouse-grown cotton bolls and to use these findings to aid in detection of feeding evidence by piercing-sucking insects on field-collected bolls from four southeastern states. Microscopic analyses of greenhouse-reared bolls fed upon by southern green stink bug (n = 40) yielded definitive characteristics and imagery of feeding evidence. Salivary flanges on the exterior surface of the boll and blisters at the feeding site on the interior surface of the carpel wall were characteristic of feeding by southern green stink bug. Also, salivary flanges were associated with all external puncture wounds on the boll wall. These characteristics were used as the baseline to detect feeding by feral piercing-sucking pests on field-grown bolls during the 2008 and 2009 production seasons. Injury characteristics from field-grown bolls were comparable to characteristics observed in greenhouse-reared bolls after feeding by southern green stink bug. A few field-collected bolls (5%; n = 160) possessed discolored seeds and exhibited evidence of boll feeding externally but lacked blisters on the interior surface of the carpel wall, thus suggesting an incomplete breach of the interior carpel wall. Callus tissue, colloquially termed a 'wart,' on the interior surface of the boll carpel wall is typically associated with feeding by stink bugs but was not detected in bolls grown in a greenhouse and was only sporadically detected in bolls collected from the field. When present, callus tissue was always associated with an external puncture. This is the first study to unequivocally illustrate microscopic characteristics associated with feeding damage by southern green stink bug on cotton bolls. Findings are discussed in relation to evidence of feeding by insects in field-collected bolls of unknown age and history.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0147-1724			WOS:000297183500002		
J	Kholodenko, Arkady L.								GRAVITY-ASSISTED SOLUTION OF THE MASS GAP PROBLEM FOR PURE YANG-MILLS FIELDS								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC METHODS IN MODERN PHYSICS				8	6			1355	1418		10.1142/S0219887811005646			SEP 2011	2011	In 1979, Louis Witten demonstrated that stationary axially symmetric Einstein field equations and those for static axially symmetric self-dual SU(2) gauge fields can both be reduced to the same (Ernst) equation. In this paper, we use this result as point of departure to prove the existence of the mass gap for quantum source-free Yang-Mills (Y-M) fields. The proof is facilitated by results of our recently published paper, J. Geom. Phys. 59 (2009) 600-619. Since both pure gravity, the Einstein-Maxwell and pure Y-M fields are described for axially symmetric configurations by the Ernst equation classically, their quantum descriptions are likely to be interrelated. Correctness of this conjecture is successfully checked by reproducing (by different methods) results of Korotkin and Nicolai, Nucl. Phys. B 475 (1996) 397-439, on dimensionally reduced quantum gravity. Consequently, numerous new results supporting the Faddeev-Skyrme (F-S)-type models are obtained. We found that the F-S-like model is best suited for description of electroweak interactions while strong interactions require extension of Witten's results to the SU(3) gauge group. Such an extension is nontrivial. It is linked with the symmetry group SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) of the standard model. This result is quite rigid and should be taken into account in development of all grand unified theories. Also, the alternative (to the F-S-like) model emerges as by-product of such an extension. Both models are related to each other via known symmetry transformation. Both models possess gap in their excitation spectrum and are capable of producing knotted/linked configurations of gauge/gravity fields. In addition, the paper discusses relevance of the obtained results to heterotic strings and to scattering processes involving topology change. It ends with discussion about usefulness of this information for searches of Higgs boson.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0219-8878			WOS:000296625400012

The Influence of Online Gambling Environments on Self-Control								JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING				30	2			279	293					FAL 2011	2011	Online gambling has become a fast growing but controversial industry. This article summarizes two studies that investigate characteristics of Internet gambling environments that lead to problems with self-control. In-depth interviews with both online and casino gamblers reveal that their experiences are categorized differently in an online context, causing some informants to undertake less monitoring of spending. They also use their physical environment to impose boundaries. Next, an experiment investigates two characteristics of online gambling environments: the use of intangible currency and rapid sequential choice. Both traits negatively affect people's ability to maintain an accurate, in-the-moment account balance across a sequence of gambles. These studies suggest several policy and consumer welfare implications.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0743-9156			WOS:000296943500012

Gyration number and weight loss of various samples, indirect tensile strength (ITS), tensile strength ratio (TSR), rut depths of dry and moisture conditioned specimens, as well as failed temperatures and rutting factors of recovered binders were measured for all mixtures. The experimental design included two aggregate moisture contents (0 and similar to 0.5 % by weight of the dry mass of the aggregate), two lime contents (1 and 2 % lime by weight of dry aggregate) and one liquid anti-stripping agent (ASA), three non-foaming WMA additives (Cecabase (R), Evotherm (R), and Rediset (R)) with control, and two aggregate sources. A total of 34 mixtures were designed and a total of 340 specimens were tested in this study. The test results indicated that the aggregate source significantly affects the ITS and rutting resistance regardless of the WMA additive, ASA, and moisture content. In addition, the ITS and rut depth of the non-foaming WMA mixtures containing moist aggregates generally satisfied the demand of pavement without additional treatment. The mixtures with three WMA additives exhibited similar rutting resistance under dry and wet conditions. The liquid ASA, used in this study, for moisture resistance is not recommended to use in WMA mixtures containing moist aggregates as the aggregate is sensitive to moisture.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000296598400015

Alcohol and Marijuana Use among American High School Seniors: Empirical Associations with Competitive Sports Participation								SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT JOURNAL				28	3			362	379					SEP 2011	2011	Drawing on data gathered from high-school seniors in the 2008 Monitoring the Future Study of American Youth (N = 2,063), this research examined the explanatory effects of competitive sports participation on alcohol consumption and marijuana use using race and noncompetitive exercise frequency as controls. Among males, competitive sports included baseball, basketball, football, soccer, track and field, and weightlifting, and among females, sports included softball, basketball, soccer, swimming and diving, track and field, and volleyball. White males reported greater alcohol consumption than Black and Hispanic respondents, with competitors in baseball, football and weightlifting consuming alcohol more frequently. The use of marijuana did not depend on race, but baseball players and weightlifters reported significantly more use. Among females, race differences did not emerge in ordinal regression models testing effects on alcohol consumption, but participants in every sport reported drinking alcohol more frequently. White female athletes also appeared to smoke marijuana more frequently. Overall, results suggested comparably strong effects for female sport environments while male behaviors varied by race, noncompetitive exercise frequency, and sports competition. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future research are offered.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0741-1235			WOS:000296504700006

It is simple, cheap, and also free of fluid heating issues that accompany other common electric, acoustic, and optical methods. This work presents a fundamental study of diamagnetic particle motion in ferrofluid flows through a rectangular microchannel with a nearby permanent magnet. Due to their negligible magnetization relative to the ferrofluid, diamagnetic particles experience negative magnetophoresis and are repelled away from the magnet. The result is a three-dimensionally focused particle stream flowing near the bottom outer corner of the microchannel that is the farthest to the center of the magnet and hence has the smallest magnetic field. The effects of the particle's relative position to the magnet, particle size, ferrofluid flow rate, and concentration on this three-dimensional diamagnetic particle deflection are systematically studied. The obtained experimental results agree quantitatively with the predictions of a three-dimensional analytical model. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

The harms can be substantial, as our case studies vividly illustrate. Most degraded landscapes have at least some potential to be reclaimed. However, uncertainty plagues decision making regarding degradation and reclamation, in relation to the extent of the damage, the success of reclamation, and how exposure will change in the future. We examine how a range of observed decision biases can lead to far-from-optimal policies regarding how much degradation to allow and when, as well as how and how much, to reclaim degraded sites. Despite our focus on degraded landscapes, we believe these are generic biases present in a wide range of risk situations. Our three case studies show these biases at work. The first two studies are of mining operations in the United States and Canada, and the third is of climate change.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0272-4332			WOS:000295384900008	20738820

Autumn and winter 2007/2008 and 2008/2009								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				533						A52	10.1051/0004-6361/201015887			SEP 2011	2011	Context. Classical novae (CNe) represent the major class of supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) in the central region of the galaxy M 31.Aims. We performed a dedicated monitoring of the M 31 central region with XMM-Newton and Chandra between Nov. 2007 and Feb. 2008 and between Nov. 2008 and Feb. 2009, respectively, to find SSS counterparts of CNe, determine the duration of their SSS phase, and derive physical outburst parameters.Methods. We systematically searched our data for X-ray counterparts of CNe, determined their X-ray light curves and characterised their spectra using blackbody fits and white dwarf (WD) atmosphere models. Additionally, we determined luminosity upper limits for all previously known X-ray emitting novae that are not detected any more and for all CNe in our field of view with optical outbursts between one year before the start of the X-ray monitoring (Oct. 2006) and its end (Feb. 2009).Results. We detected 17 X-ray counterparts of CNe in M 31, only four of which were previously known. These latter sources are still active 12.5, 11.0, 7.4 and 4.8 years after the optical outburst. In addition, we detected three known SSSs without a nova counterpart. Four novae displayed short SSS phases (<100 d). Based on these results and previous studies we compiled a catalogue of all novae with SSS counterparts in M 31 known so far. We used this catalogue to derive correlations between the following X-ray and optical nova parameters: turn-on time, turn-off time, blackbody temperature (X-ray), t(2) decay time and expansion velocity of the ejected envelope (optical). Temperatures derived from blackbody fits and WD atmosphere models were found to characterise the effective SSS temperatures almost equally well. Furthermore, we found a first hint for the existence of a difference between SSS parameters of novae associated with the stellar populations of the M 31 bulge and disk. Additionally, we conducted a Monte Carlo Markov chain simulation on the intrinsic fraction of novae with SSS phase. This simulation showed that the high fraction of novae without detected SSS emission might be explained by the inevitably incomplete coverage with X-ray observations in combination with a large part of novae with short SSS states, as expected from the WD mass distribution.Conclusions. Our results confirm that novae are the major class of SSSs in the central region of M 31. The catalogue of novae with X-ray counterpart, mainly based on our X-ray monitoring, contains valuable insight into the physics of the nova process. In order to verify our results with an increased sample, more monitoring observations are needed.									19	0	0	0	0	19			0004-6361			WOS:000295168100052		
J	Alley, Bethany; Beebe, Alex; Rodgers, John, Jr.; Castle, James W.								Chemical and physical characterization of produced waters from conventional and unconventional fossil fuel resources								CHEMOSPHERE				85	1			74	82		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.05.043			SEP 2011	2011	Characterization of produced waters (PWs) is an initial step for determining potential beneficial uses such as irrigation and surface water discharge at some sites. A meta-analysis of characteristics of five PW sources [i.e, shale gas (SGPWs), conventional natural gas (NGPWs), conventional oil (OPWs), coal-bed methane (CBMPWs), tight gas sands (TGSPWs)] was conducted from peer-reviewed literature, government or industry documents, book chapters, internet sources, analytical records from industry, and analyses of PW samples. This meta-analysis assembled a large dataset to extract information of interest such as differences and similarities in constituent and constituent concentrations across these sources of PWs. The PW data analyzed were comprised of 377 coal-bed methane, 165 oilfield, 137 tight gas sand, 4000 natural gas, and 541 shale gas records. Majority of SGPWs, NGPWs, OPWs, and TGSPWs contain chloride concentrations ranging from saline (>30 000 mg L(-1)) to hypersaline (>40 000 mg L(-1)), while most CBMPWs were fresh (<5000 mg L(-1)). For inorganic constituents, most SGPW and NGPW iron concentrations exceeded the numeric criterion for irrigation and surface water discharge, while OPW and CBMPW iron concentrations were less than the criterion. Approximately one-fourth of the PW samples in this database are fresh and likely need minimal treatment for metal and metalloid constituents prior to use, while some PWs are brackish (5000-30 000 mg Cl(-) L(-1)) to saline containing metals and metalloids that may require considerable treatment. Other PWs are hypersaline and produce a considerable waste stream from reverse osmosis: remediation of these waters may not be feasible. After renovation, fresh to saline PWs may be used for irrigation and replenishing surface waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As none of the basal angiosperm genomes has been sequenced, examining large bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) inserts remains the main approach to providing a first glimpse of the structure and organization of their genomes. In this study, we sequenced a 126.9-kbp BAC contig harboring a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase gene (LtuCAD1) in a basal angiosperm species, Liriodendron tulipifera L., an important timber tree species with significant ecological and economic values. A key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis, CAD catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of monolignols. We carried out phylogenetic analyses of seven full-length CAD family genes (LtuCAD1-7) obtained from a comprehensive Liriodendron expressed sequence tag dataset. The phylogenetic tree suggests that LtuCAD1 is the primary CAD gene involved in lignifications as it is the only Liriodendron CAD grouped with the bona fide CADs class. As well as the LtuCAD1, the BAC contig contained fragmented sequences for one integrase, eight hypothetical proteins, two gag-pol polyproteins, one RNase H family protein, and one chromatin binding protein. Comparative analysis with other angiosperm species suggests that the genomic segment in this BAC has undergone frequent arrangement. This study is our initial step in identifying and understanding lignin biosynthesis genes from basal angiosperm species. Such knowledge can help bridge the information gap between hardwood (angiosperm) and softwood (gymnosperm) species and benefit potential breeding and biotechnology application for enhanced production of biomass and digestibility in L. tulipifera.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1674-4918			WOS:000295322200003

However, due to the locally amplified electric field around the in-channel insulator, Joule heating often becomes an unavoidable issue that may disturb the electroosmotic flow and affect the particle motion. This work presents the first experimental study of Joule heating effects on electroosmotic flow in a typical iDEP device, e. g. a constriction microchannel, under DC-biased AC voltages. A numerical model is also developed to simulate the observed flow pattern by solving the coupled electric, energy, and fluid equations in a simplified two-dimensional geometry. It is observed that depending on the magnitude of the DC voltage, a pair of counter-rotating fluid circulations can occur at either the downstream end alone or each end of the channel constriction. Moreover, the pair at the downstream end appears larger in size than that at the upstream end due to DC electroosmotic flow. These fluid circulations, which are reasonably simulated by the numerical model, form as a result of the action of the electric field on Joule heating-induced fluid inhomogeneities in the constriction region.									36	2	0	19	0	36			0173-0835			WOS:000295216200005	21792988	
J	Chen, Guihua; Wiatrak, Pawel								Seeding Rate Effects on Soybean Height, Yield, and Economic Return								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				103	5			1301	1307		10.2134/agronj2010.0427			SEP-OCT 2011	2011	The high cost of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seed has increased the importance of determining the optimum seeding rates for maximum yield and economic return. Previous research has evaluated vegetation indices of soybean cultivars in five maturity groups (MG IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII) at six seeding rates (68,000; 136,000; 204,000; 272,000; 340,000; and 408,000 seeds ha(-1)) under dryland conditions on a loamy sand soil in the southeastern Coastal Plain from 2007 to 2009. This study evaluated the effects of soybean seeding rate in 96-cm rows on mature plant height, grain yield, and economic return, and determined the optimum seeding rates. Plant height increased with increasing seeding rate for MGs IV, VII, and VIII in 2 of 3 yr and for MGs V and VI in all 3 yr. For MG V in 2009, and VII and VIII in 2008, optimum seeding rates were 255,200; 228,200; and 342,500 seeds ha(-1), respectively, at maximum yield, and 230,600; 179,100; and 325,900 seeds ha(-1), respectively, at maximum economic return. For MG IV in 2008 and VI in 2009, economic return decreased linearly with seeding rate. Seeding rates that produced economic returns within $ 2.50 ha(-1) of the maximum across years were 136,000; 208,600 to 252,600; 136,000; >= 172,300; and 308,400 to 343,200 seeds ha(-1) for soybean cultivars in MG IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII, respectively. These results suggest that optimum seeding rate varies for cultivars in different MGs and could be lower than current recommendations for MGs IV, VI, and VII, but higher for MG VIII.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0002-1962			WOS:000294483400001

Development of molecular markers and preliminary investigation of the population structure and mating system in one lineage of black morel (Morchella elata) in the Pacific Northwestern USA								MYCOLOGIA				103	5			969	982		10.3852/10-384			SEP-OCT 2011	2011	Phylogenetic analysis of LSU/ITS sequence data revealed two distinct lineages among 44 morphologically similar fruiting bodies of natural black morels (Morchella elata group) sampled at three non-burn locations in the St Joe and Kanisku National Forests in northern Idaho. Most of the sampled isolates (n = 34) represented a dominant LSU/ITS haplotype present at all three sites and identical to the Mel-12 phylogenetic lineage (GU551425) identified in a previous study. Variation at 1-3 nucleotide sites was detected among a small number of isolates (n = 6) within this well supported clade (94%). Four isolates sampled from a single location were in a well supported clade (97%) distinct from the dominant haplotypes and may represent a previously unsampled, cryptic phylogenetic species. Species-specific SNP and SCAR markers were developed for Mel-12 lineage isolates by cloning and sequencing AFLP amplicons, and segregation of AFLP markers were studied from single ascospore isolates from individual fruiting bodies. Based on the segregation of AFLP markers within single fruiting bodies, split decomposition analyses of two SCAR markers, and population genetic analyses of SNP, SCAR, and AFLP markers, it appears that members of the Morchella sp. Mel-12 phylogenetic lineage are heterothallic and outcross in nature similar to yellow morels. This is the first set of locus-specific molecular markers that has been developed for any Morchella species, to our knowledge. These markers will prove to be valuable tools to study mating system, gene flow and genetic structure of black morels at various spatial scales with field-collected fruiting bodies and eliminate the need to culture samples in vitro.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0027-5514			WOS:000294529400005	21642339

To micropattern individual cells to specific points on a substrate with high spatial resolution, we have developed a cell deposition microscope based on the laser-guidance technique. We discuss the theory of optical forces for generating laser guidance and the optimization of the optical configuration (NA approximate to 0.1) to manipulate cells with high speed in three dimensions. Our cell deposition microscope is capable of patterning different cell types onto and within standard cell research devices and providing on-stage incubation for long-term cell culturing. Using this cell deposition microscope, rat mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow were micropatterned with cardiomyocytes into a substrate microfabricated with polydimethylsiloxane on a 22 mm x 22 mm coverglass to form a single-cell coculturing microenvironment, and their electrophysiological property changes were investigated during the coculturing days.									12	0	0	9	0	12			1758-5082			WOS:000294955200009	21725149

Gyration number of various samples, indirect tensile strength (ITS), tensile strength ratio, rut depths of dry and conditioned specimens, and deformation (flow) were measured for all mixtures. The experimental design included two aggregate moisture contents (0 and similar to 0.5% by weight of the dry mass of the aggregate), two lime contents (1% and 2% lime by weight of dry aggregate), one liquid antistripping agent (ASA) and non-ASA, three foaming water contents (2, 3, and 4%) with control, and two aggregate sources. A total of 42 mixtures were used and 420 specimens were tested in this study. The test results indicated that the aggregate source significantly affects the ITS and rutting resistance regardless of the foaming water content, ASA, and aggregate moisture content. In addition, the ITS and rut depth of some foamed mixtures containing moist aggregate satisfies the demand of pavement performance without additional treatment, although some mixtures need a completely dry aggregate or additional treatments. The mixture with various hydrated lime contents exhibited similar rutting and moisture resistance under dry and wet conditions. The liquid ASA used in this study is not recommended for use in foaming WMA mixtures with moist aggregates, because it is sensitive to moisture. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000297.

Strategies to address development of faculty knowledge and expertise are suggested. Continuing education faculty development programs and strategies to develop doctorally prepared nurse scientists who will educate future students in the profession are described.Conclusions: Multiple faculty who are prepared to implement education on genetic and genomic topics are needed at all levels of nursing education. Faculty networking and application of genomic principles to nursing are key elements for sustaining nursing education to produce a nursing workforce that can apply essential genomic knowledge.Clinical Relevance: There is an urgent need to offer genomics in accessible and effective education for nursing practice to optimize health outcomes regardless of geographic location.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1527-6546			WOS:000294772700003	21884368

To search for more dust disks of the latter type, we have conducted a Spitzer MIPS 24 mu m survey of 71 hot WDs or pre-WDs, among which 35 are central stars of PNe (CSPNs). Nine of these evolved stars are detected and their 24 mu m flux densities are at least two orders of magnitude higher than their expected photospheric emission. Considering the bias against the detection of distant objects, the 24 mu m detection rate for the sample is greater than or similar to 15%. It is striking that seven, or similar to 20%, of the WD and pre-WDs in known PNe exhibit 24 mu m excesses, while two, or 5%-6%, of the WDs not in PNe show 24 mu m excesses and they have the lowest 24 mu m flux densities. We have obtained follow-up Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectra for five objects. Four show clear continuum emission at 24 mu m, and one is overwhelmed by a bright neighboring star but still shows a hint of continuum emission. In the cases of WD 0950+139 and CSPN K 1-22, a late-type companion is present, making it difficult to determine whether the excess 24 mu m emission is associated with the WD or its red companion. High-resolution images in the mid-infrared are needed to establish unambiguously the stars responsible for the 24 mu m excesses.									20	0	0	0	0	20			0004-6256			WOS:000294669700009

X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and selected area electron diffraction pattern were applied to characterize the crystals. The results indicated that collagen modulate crystallization of apatite both in composition and morphology. With the absence of collagen, the obtained crystals were ribbon-shaped octacalcium phosphate (OCP) at pH 6.5, the mixture of OCP and nanosize rod-shaped hydroxyapatite (HAP) at pH 7.0 and 7.5 respectively. OCP would be a precursor of HAP with the absence of collagen. With the presence of collagen, collagen acted more effectively in controlling crystallization of HAP than pH did in the system. Ribbon-shaped HAP was the main phase at pH 6.5, kept a very thin structure at pH 7.0 while the needle-shaped HAP with several nanometers in diameter was obtained at pH 7.5. It was discussed amorphous calcium phosphate would be an intermediate phase of HAP with the presence of collagen. Such understanding of collagen and pH control on biomineralization gives new insights on the controlled synthesis of apatite. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

The experiments proved that aggressive remedial efforts tailored to the contaminant can remove more than 90% of the NAPL-phase contaminant mass. Site-characterization methods were tested as part of these field efforts, including partitioning tracer tests, biotracer tests, and mass-flux measurements. A significant reduction in the groundwater contaminant mass flux was achieved despite incomplete removal of the source. The effectiveness of soil, groundwater, and tracer based characterization methods may be site and technology specific. Employing multiple methods can improve characterization. The studies elucidated the importance of small-scale heterogeneities on remediation effectiveness, and fomented research on enhanced-delivery methods. Most contaminant removal occurs in hydraulically accessible zones, and complete removal is limited by contaminant mass stored in inaccessible zones. These studies illustrated the importance of understanding the fluid dynamics and interfacial behavior of injected fluids on remediation design and implementation. The importance of understanding the dynamics of NAPL-mixture dissolution and removal was highlighted. The results from these studies helped researchers better understand what processes and scales are most important to include in mathematical models used for design and data analysis. Finally, the work at these sites emphasized the importance and feasibility of recycling and reusing chemical agents, and enabled the implementation and success of follow-on full-scale efforts.									12	1	0	7	0	13			0017-467X			WOS:000294737800008	21299555

In this study, different Al-4 wt%Mg-Cu alloys, and Al-4 wt%Mg-Cu/SiC composites were drilled on a vertical drilling machine using moderate speed and general purpose high-speed steel tools. The machinability parameters studied in this research were drilling forces (torque and thrust force) and surface roughness of the drilled holes. The results showed that the effect of the addition of copper as alloying element (up to 5 wt%) to Al-4 wt%Mg tends to decrease torque and thrust force. Also, it was found that the addition of SiC(P) (up to 10 vol.%) to the Al-4 wt%Mg-Cu alloys had little effect on the drilling torque and thrust force, but tends to improve the surface roughness of the drilled surfaces. Moreover, the analysis of the produced chips indicates that most of the produced chips by dry drilling of aluminum-based materials were of continuous type.									4	2	0	0	0	4			0021-9983			WOS:000294807000008

In this study the effects of pulsed electric field on the extraction of polysaccharides from corn silk were investigated.RESULTS: Polysaccharides in corn silk were extracted by pulsed electric field and optimized by response surface methodology (RSM), based on a Box-Behnken design (BBD). Three independent variables, including electric field intensity (kV cm(-1)), ratio of liquid to raw material and pulse duration (mu s), were investigated. The experimental data were fitted to a second-order polynomial equation and also profiled into the corresponding 3-D contour plots. Optimal extraction conditions were as follows: electric field intensity 30 kV cm(-1), ratio of liquid to raw material 50, and pulse duration 6 mu s. Under these condition, the experimental yield of extracted polysaccharides was 7.31% +/- 0.15%, matching well with the predicted value.CONCLUSION: The results showed that a pulsed electric field could be applied to extract value-added products from foods and/or agricultural matrix.

Insecticide use impacts of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Farmer Field Schools: Evidence from onion farmers in the Philippines								AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS				104	7			580	587		10.1016/j.agsy.2011.05.001			SEP 2011	2011	This article empirically examines the impact of Farmer Field Schools (FFS) on insecticide use by onion farmers in the Philippines. FFS is an intensive Integrated Pest Management (IPM) information dissemination method that encourages producers to lower their reliance on chemical insecticides for controlling pests and diseases in their farms. These FFS-IPM trainings have been conducted within vegetable-based production systems in the Philippines. The data used in the study are from a 2009 face-to-face farm-level survey of 200 onion growers in Nueva Ecija province. Using instrumental variable (IV) procedures to control for endogeneity and selection problems in the data, we find that FFS-trained onion farmers in the Philippines have significantly lower insecticide expenditures (similar to PhP5,000) than non-FFS trained control farmers. When econometric problems due to endogeneity and selection are not controlled for, the FFS training did not show any statistically significant effect on insecticide use. The insecticide reducing effect of FFS has important environmental and health implications, and provides evidence about the effectiveness of the FFS training method in disseminating important IPM concepts in the country.

The PDS technique first uses a short laser pulse to completely photodissociate iodine-containing species into iodine atoms, and then uses a second laser pulse to image the iodine atoms. Due to the completeness and rapidity of the photodissociation (PD), the concentration of I atoms after PD represents that of the iodine element seeded into the flow, which forms a conserved scalar and can be used to image the concentration field. The feasibility of the PDS technique is evaluated in three steps. First, a multi-level kinetic model was developed to capture the major physics relevant to the PDS technique. Second, controlled experiments were conducted to validate the multi-level kinetic model. Third, the validated model was applied to evaluate the applicable range and accuracy of the PDS technique in representative hydrocarbon flames. The results suggest a simple approach to implement the PDS technique using I-2 seeding in flames, which can provide good accuracy across a wide range of mixture fractions and strain rates.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0946-2171			WOS:000294493600030

The results from sediment batch experiments demonstrated that Fe(III) reduction did not inhibit complete dechlorination. TCE was reduced concurrently with Fe(III) in the first 40 days of the incubations. While all incubations (plus and minus Fe(III)) generated approximately the same mass of ethene within the experimental time frame, Fe(III) speciation (ferrihydrite versus Fe(III)-NTA) had an impact on daughter product distribution and dechlorination kinetics. 16S rRNA gene clone library sequencing identified Dehalococcoides and Geobacteraceae as dominant populations, which included G. lovleyi like organisms. Quantitative PCR targeting 16S rRNA genes and Reductive Dehalogenase genes (tceA, bvcA, vcrA) indicated that Dehalococcoides and Geobacteraceae were enriched concurrently in the TCE-degrading, Fe(III)-reducing sediments. Enrichment cultures demonstrated that soluble Fe(III) had a greater impact on cis-DCE and VC reduction than solid-phase Fe(III). Geobacteraceae and Dehalococcoides were also coenriched in the liquid cultures, and the Dehalococcoides abundance in the presence of Fe(III) was not significantly different from those in the cultures without Fe(III). Hydrogen reached steady-state concentrations most amenable to complete dechlorination very quickly when Fe(III) was present in the culture, suggesting that Fe(III) reduction may actually help dechlorination. This was contrasted to hydrogen levels in nitrate-amended enrichments, in which hydrogen concentration was too low for any chlororespiration.									29	3	0	28	0	32			0013-936X			WOS:000294373400047	21777002

Building a push-button RESOLVE verifier: Progress and challenges								FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTING				23	5			607	626		10.1007/s00165-010-0154-3			SEP 2011	2011	A central objective of the verifying compiler grand challenge is to develop a push-button verifier that generates proofs of correctness in a syntax-driven fashion similar to the way an ordinary compiler generates machine code. The software developer's role is then to provide suitable specifications and annotated code, but otherwise to have no direct involvement in the verification step. However, the general mathematical developments and results upon which software correctness is based may be established through a separate formal proof process in which proofs might be mechanically checked, but not necessarily automatically generated. While many ideas that could conceivably form the basis for software verification have been known "in principle" for decades, and several tools to support an aspect of verification have been devised, practical fully automated verification of full software behavior remains a grand challenge. This paper explains how RESOLVE takes a step towards addressing this challenge by integrating foundational and practical elements of software engineering, programming languages, and mathematical logic into a coherent framework. Current versions of the RESOLVE verifier generate verification conditions (VCs) for the correctness of component-based software in a modular fashion-one component at a time. The VCs are currently verified using automated capabilities of the Isabelle proof assistant, the SMT solver Z3, a minimalist rewrite prover, and some specialized decision procedures. Initial experiments with the tools and further analytic considerations show both the progress that has been made and the challenges that remain.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0934-5043			WOS:000294468000003		
J	Dalton, Derek; Ortegren, Marc								Gender Differences in Ethics Research: The Importance of Controlling for the Social Desirability Response Bias								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS				103	1			73	93		10.1007/s10551-011-0843-8			SEP 2011	2011	Gender is one of the most frequently studied variables within the ethics literature. In prior studies that find gender differences, females consistently report more ethical responses than males. However, prior research also indicates that females are more prone to responding in a socially desirable fashion. Consequently, it is uncertain whether gender differences in ethical decision-making exist because females are more ethical or perhaps because females are more prone to the social desirability response bias. Using a sample of 30 scenarios from prior studies that find gender differences, we examine whether these gender differences remain robust once social desirability is controlled for in the analysis. Our data suggest that the effect of gender on ethical decision-making is largely attenuated once social desirability is included in the analysis. In essence, the social desirability response bias appears to be driving a significant portion of the relationship between gender and ethical decision-making. We discuss several important research implications of this study.									35	0	0	4	0	35			0167-4544			WOS:000294353900004

Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of 18-24-year-old female students (n = 1,975) were assessed via an electronic survey. Mean HPV knowledge score, on a 10-point scale, was 6.8. A weak positive correlation (r (1,976) = 0.123, p < 0.001) was found between knowledge score and having received the vaccine. Parent recommendation, doctor recommendation, and perceiving the consequences of HPV as severe and prevalent were strongly related to previous vaccination. Data suggest a need for increased education about the vaccine and the importance of physician recommendation in increasing vaccine uptake.									26	0	0	8	0	26			0885-8195			WOS:000294266400010	21336980

This article reviews these tests, connects them with theoretical results, and compares their finite sample performance via simulation. We propose an adjusted CUSUM statistic which is closely related to the LR test and which links all tests. We find that tests based on CUSUMing estimated one-step-ahead prediction residuals from a fitted autoregressive moving average perform well in general and that the LR and F(max) tests (which induce substantial computational complexities) offer only a slight increase in power over the adjusted CUSUM test. We also conclude that CUSUM procedures work slightly better when the changepoint time is located near the centre of the data, but the adjusted CUSUM methods are preferable when the changepoint lies closer to the beginning or end of the data record. Finally, an application is presented to demonstrate the importance of the choice of method.									17	0	0	1	0	17			0143-9782			WOS:000294444400005

The ROOT DETERMINED NODULATION1 Gene Regulates Nodule Number in Roots of Medicago truncatula and Defines a Highly Conserved, Uncharacterized Plant Gene Family								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				157	1			328	340		10.1104/pp.111.178756			SEP 2011	2011	The formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules in legumes is tightly controlled by a long-distance signaling system in which nodulating roots signal to shoot tissues to suppress further nodulation. A screen for supernodulating Medicago truncatula mutants defective in this regulatory behavior yielded loss-of-function alleles of a gene designated ROOT DETERMINED NODULATION1 (RDN1). Grafting experiments demonstrated that RDN1 regulatory function occurs in the roots, not the shoots, and is essential for normal nodule number regulation. The RDN1 gene, Medtr5g089520, was identified by genetic mapping, transcript profiling, and phenotypic rescue by expression of the wild-type gene in rdn1 mutants. A mutation in a putative RDN1 ortholog was also identified in the supernodulating nod3 mutant of pea (Pisum sativum). RDN1 is predicted to encode a 357-amino acid protein of unknown function. The RDN1 promoter drives expression in the vascular cylinder, suggesting RDN1 may be involved in initiating, responding to, or transporting vascular signals. RDN1 is a member of a small, uncharacterized, highly conserved gene family unique to green plants, including algae, that we have named the RDN family.									29	2	0	29	0	31			0032-0889			WOS:000294491800026	21742814

New model-based population genetic methods can resolve complex demographic histories, but many studies in fields such as landscape genetics continue to rely on simple rules of thumb focused on gene flow to explain patterns of spatial differentiation. Here, we show how methods that use gene genealogies can reveal cryptic demographic histories and provide better estimates of gene flow with other parameters that contribute to genetic variation across landscapes and seascapes. We advocate for the expanded use and development of methods that consider spatial differentiation as the product of multiple forces interacting over time, and caution against a routine reliance on post-hoc gene flow interpretations.									91	0	0	88	0	91			0169-5347			WOS:000294577200008	21722987

Using whole genome array CGH analysis, we identified a microdeletion involving 4q21.3, unrelated to the translocations in both patients. We confirmed the 4q21.3 microdeletions using fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative genomic PCR. The corresponding deletion boundaries in the patients were further mapped and compared to previously reported 4q21 deletions and the associated clinical features. We determined a common region of deletion overlap that appears unique to ID, short stature, hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features.

Surface coating of medical devices/implants using antibacterial peptides and enzymes has recently emerged as a potentially effective method for preventing infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of hernia repair meshes coated by the antimicrobial enzyme lysostaphin at different initial concentrations. Lysostaphin was adsorbed on pieces of polypropylene (Ultrapro) mesh with binding yields of similar to 10 to 40% at different coating concentrations of between 10 and 500 mu g/ml. Leaching of enzyme from the surface of all the samples was studied in 2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline buffer at 37 degrees C, and it was found that less than 3% of adsorbed enzyme desorbed from the surface after 24 h of incubation. Studies of antibacterial activity against a cell suspension of S. aureus were performed using turbidity assay and demonstrated that the small amount of enzyme leaching from the mesh surface contributes to the lytic activity of the lysostaphin-coated samples. Colony counting data from the broth count (model for bacteria in wound fluid) and wash count (model for colonized bacteria) for the enzyme-coated samples showed significantly decreased numbers of CFU compared to uncoated samples (P < 0.05). A pilot in vivo study showed a dose-dependent efficacy of lysostaphin-coated meshes in a rat model of S. aureus infection. The antimicrobial activity of the lysostaphin-coated meshes suggests that such enzyme-leaching surfaces could be efficient at actively resisting initial bacterial adhesion and preventing subsequent colonization of hernia repair meshes.									20	1	0	9	0	21			0066-4804			WOS:000293953900058	21709102

It utilizes a physical-model-based field simulation to analyze the semiconductor devices in a circuit and incorporates the field simulation into an equivalent-model-based circuit simulation to simulate the circuit. For the field simulation, a genetic-algorithm-based curve-fitting approach is proposed to extract the parameters of the semiconductor devices' physical models. The proposed method is employed for the analysis of a few circuits containing a commercial p-i-n diode with model number mot_bal99lt1. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through a comparison of its simulation results with the measurement data, and good agreement is observed. The other merits of the proposed method are also illustrated, including its ability to provide useful physical mechanisms for the better understanding of the behavior of the p-i-n diode under various working conditions.									5	6	0	0	0	10			0018-9383			WOS:000294175900007

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression symptoms, combat exposure, deployment demands, and work impairment were measured. Soldiers higher in dispositional optimism showed weaker relationships between combat exposure and PTSD symptoms, and between deployment demands and PTSD and depression symptoms. Dispositional optimism also buffered mental health symptom effects on work impairment. Dispositional optimism may protect soldiers from warzone stress and mental health symptoms. Potential mechanisms explaining how dispositional optimism may serve as a protective factor are discussed. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Relationships among specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), fluorescence index (FI), specific differential ultraviolet absorbance (S Delta UVA), specific chlorine demand (SCD), and the dissolved organic carbon: dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC:DON) ratio to the specific DBP formation potential (SDBP-FP) were examined. The DOM derived from litter materials had considerable reactivity in forming trihalomethanes (THMs) (1.80-3.49 mmol mol(-1)), haloacetic acid (HAAs) (1.62-2.76 mmol mol(-1)), haloacetonitriles (HANs) (0.12-0.37 mmol mol(-1)), and chloral hydrate (CHD) (0.16-0.28 mmol mol(-1)). These values are comparable to other identified watershed sources of DBP precursors reported for the California Delta, such as wetlands and organic soils. Vegetation type and litter decomposition stage (fresh litter versus 1-5 yr-old duff) were key factors that determined characteristics of DOM and their reactivity to form DBPs. Pine litter had significantly lower specific THM formation potential compared with oak and grass, and decomposed duff had a greater DON content, which is a precursor of HANs and other nitrogenous DBPs. The SUVA and SDBP-FP were temporally variable and dependent on vegetation type, degree of decomposition, and environmental conditions. Among the optical properties of DOM, S Delta UVA was the only parameter that was consistently correlated with SDBP-FP.									14	1	0	14	0	15			0047-2425			WOS:000294244800029	21869524	
J	Zagenczyk, Thomas J.; Gibney, Ray; Few, W. Timothy; Scott, Kristin L.								Psychological Contracts and Organizational Identification: The Mediating Effect of Perceived Organizational Support								JOURNAL OF LABOR RESEARCH				32	3			254	281		10.1007/s12122-011-9111-z			SEP 2011	2011	Understanding the processes through which employees incorporate the organization's identity into their own identity is critical to building positive employer-employee relationships. We draw primarily on organizational support theory to advance the argument that psychological contract breach is negatively related to organizational identification and positively related to organizational disidentification because it makes employees believe that their organizations do not value their contributions or care about their well-being (reduces perceived organizational support). Results from two studies generally provide support for our hypotheses: in Study 1, perceived organizational support fully mediated the relationship between psychological contract breach and organizational identification. In Study 2, Time 2 perceived organizational support fully mediated the relationship between Time 1 relational psychological contract breach (e.g., promises related to training, development, job security) and organizational identification, but not the relationship between transactional psychological contract breach (e.g., promises related to pay and work hours) and organizational identification. Time 2 perceived organizational support partially mediated the relationship between relational psychological contract breach and organizational disidentification, but not the relationship between transactional psychological contract breach and organizational disidentification. We conclude that organizations should be concerned with this erosion of the positive employer-employee relationship (organizational identification) and fostering of a negative employer-employee relationship (disidentification).									14	2	0	0	2	18			0195-3613	1936-4768		WOS:000294115900004		
J	Arai, Yuji; Rick, Allison R.; Saylor, Tessa; Faas, Emily; Tappero, Ryan; Lanzirotti, Antonio								Macroscopic and molecular-scale assessment of soil lead contamination impacted by seasonal dove hunting activities								JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS				11	6			968	979		10.1007/s11368-011-0374-z			SEP 2011	2011	Environmental contamination of lead (Pb) in soils and sediments poses serious threats to human and ecological health. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of seasonal dove sports hunting activities on Pb contamination in acid forest soils.A grid sampling method was used to investigate the spatial distribution of Pb contamination in surface soils. Soils were analyzed for total metal(loid) concentration and characterized for physicochemical properties and mineralogy. Adsorption isotherm experiments were also conducted to understand the reactivity and retention capacity of Pb(II) in soils. Finally, synchrotron-based X-ray microprobe and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were used to understand the chemical speciation of Pb that controls the retention/release mechanisms of Pb in soils.There was no excessive accumulation of Pb at the site. However, the concentration of Pb in surface soils was greater than the background level (< 16 mg kg(-1)). The contamination level of Pb was as high as 67 mg kg(-1) near a patch of corn field where lime was frequently applied. A microfocused X-ray microprobe analysis showed the presence of Pb pellet fragments that predominantly contain oxidized Pb(II), suggesting that oxidative dissolution was occurring in soils. Dissolved Pb(II) can be readily retained in soils up to similar to 3,600 mg kg(-1) via inner-sphere and outer-sphere surface complexation on carbon and aluminol functional groups of soil components, suggesting that partitioning reactions control the concentration of Pb in soil solution.The fate of Pb is likely to be controlled by (1) oxidative dissolution process of Pb(0) pellets and (2) the release of outer-sphere and/or inner-sphere Pb surface complexes in humic substances and aluminosilicate/Al oxyhydroxides. Although no remedial actions are immediately required, the long-term accumulation of Pb in soils should be carefully monitored in protecting ecosystem and water quality at the dove hunting field.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1439-0108			WOS:000294065600010

J	Peterson, Kristin S.; Straka, Thomas J.								Specialized Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Formulas for Valuation of Benefits and Costs of Urban Trees and Forests								Arboriculture & Urban Forestry				37	5			200	206					SEP 2011	2011	Urban trees and forests have distinct benefits and costs that can be evaluated financially. While there are appraisal methods commonly used to value individual trees and urban forests, one method that is difficult to use in practice is a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. This is the appraisal method that best accounts for the time value of money and allows for a temporal comparison of benefits and costs. Current timber appraisal methods are discussed for urban situations and DCF analysis is presented as a viable supplemental appraisal method for valuation of the urban trees. Simple models are presented that allow for the solution of DCF-type urban forestry valuations using conventional software valuation packages. Examples are provided of typical urban tree benefit and cost scenarios, with DCF calculations of present value (PV) and net present value using the specialized DCF formulas.									4	0	0	4	1	5			1935-5297			BCI:BCI201200565225		
J	Straka, Thomas J.								Taxonomic Review of Classical and Current Literature on the Perennial American Family Forest Problem								FORESTS				2	3			660	706		10.3390/f2030660			SEP 2011	2011	One of the fundamental issues in American forest policy has been the small forest ownership problem. Early in the twentieth century, it was called the farm forestry problem, later, the nonindustrial private forest problem, and today, the family forest problem. Family forest owners are thought to manage their lands in a suboptimal manner resulting in low forest productivity relative to other ownership groups. This can lead to future timber supply problems. The exact nature of the problem, especially its social and economic basis, was a common subject of early forestry research studies. This article includes many of the major nonindustrial private forest or family forest studies, from early to current, and classifies them both by themes used by other authors and categories that relate to major research areas in the current literature. A major focus of this literature deals with promoting management on family forest holdings and possible land management incentives and disincentives. Natural trends in family forest ownership, like parcelization, also impact upon forest management opportunities. By developing a taxonomy that classifies these studies by research objective, methodology, owner motivation, and problem definition, this article serves to organize the family forest literature in a manner that provides a temporal framework for better understanding the historical motivation for and development of family forest research in the United States.									7	0	0	2	0	8			1999-4907			WOS:000208657200004		
J	Dyckman, Caitlin S.								Another Case of the Century? Comparing the Legacy and Potential Implications of Arizona v. California and the South Carolina v. North Carolina Proceedings								NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL				51	2			189	232					FAL 2011	2011	With growing demand throughout the United States, water allocation is shifting from traditional institutionally favored water users (i.e., agricultural and hydropower industries) to more wealthy urban centers through interbasin transfers and environmental flow restoration for endangered species. Even in the traditionally wet Southeast, this creates a powerful new tension between states. In a precedent-setting action in June 2007, South Carolina brought suit in the U.S. Supreme Court against the state of North Carolina over the approved interbasin transfer of 13 million gallons per day from the Catawba-Wateree River to two North Carolina cities, Concord and Kannapolis, in the Yadkin-Pee Dee River basin. This article examines the progression of the lawsuit and its settlement, using a triangulation of legal research and primary and secondary historical documents to compare the proceedings with those of the events in the seminal Colorado River lawsuit, Arizona v. California. The findings reveal that although most of the decisive water law precedent originates in the arid West, the present suit has the potential to set a new course in eastern water law, with bearing on future parens patriae legal strategies in interstate water disputes.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0028-0739			WOS:000209037900002

Fundamental low-J CO absorption lines are detected and strict upper limits are placed on the flux of v = 2-1 low-J CO emission lines. The limit on the UV fluorescent emission flux in the v = 2-1 lines is used to place a tight constraint on the inner extent of the CO gas. Assuming Hi is the primary collision partner, the sub-thermal population of the low-J v = 0 rotational levels constrains the density of the gas in the disk to n(H) = (2.5(-1.2)(+7.1)) x 10(5) cm(-3). If the distribution of hydrogen follows that of the other metals in the disk, we find that the mass of the gas in the disk is 0.17(-0.08)(+0.47) M-circle plus. We compare this mass to the gas mass necessary to brake the metals in the disk through ion-neutral reactions.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0004-637X			WOS:000294015500012		
J	Atamturktur, Sezer; Bornn, Luke; Hemez, Francois					Hemez, Francois/0000-0002-5319-4078			Vibration characteristics of vaulted masonry monuments undergoing differential support settlement								ENGINEERING STRUCTURES				33	9			2472	2484		10.1016/j.engstruct.2011.04.020			SEP 2011	2011	This paper assesses the feasibility of vibration testing to detect structural damage caused by the settlement of buttresses in the Beverley Minster, a Gothic church located in the UK. Over the past eight centuries, the accumulated support settlements of the buttresses of Beverley Minster have pulled the main nave walls outward, causing severe separation along the edges of the masonry vaults. Bays closer to the main crossing tower have remained intact: however, at the west end of the Minster, the crack width between the walls and vaults has reached about 150 mm, leading to approximately 200 mm of sag at the crown of the vaults. Due to uneven settlement of buttresses along the nave of the church, the Minster now has ten nominally identical vaults at different damage states. In this work, two of these vaults representing the two extremes, the most damaged and undamaged structural states, are subjected to vibration testing with impact hammer excitation. From these vibration measurements, damage indicators are extracted in the modal, frequency, and time domains. In the modal domain, the differences between modal parameters are observed to be comparable to measurement uncertainty and hence insufficient to reach conclusions about the presence of vault damage. However, the amplitudes of frequency response functions in the frequency domain are observed to indicate a clear difference between the damaged and undamaged states of the structure. A time domain autoregressive model, support vector machine regression, is also found to be successful at indicating the differences between the two structural states of the vaults. We conclude that vibration measurements offer a practical solution to detect wall-vault separation in historic masonry monuments, provided that multiple damage indicators are evaluated.

J	Klein, C. M.; Jenkins, T. C.								Docosahexaenoic acid elevates trans-18:1 isomers but is not directly converted into trans-18:1 isomers in ruminal batch cultures								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				94	9			4676	4683		10.3168/jds.2011-4344			SEP 2011	2011	Pathways of docosahexaenoic (DHA) biohydrogenation are not known; however. DHA is metabolized by ruminal microorganisms. The addition of DHA to the rumen alters the fatty acid profile of the rumen and milk and leads to increased trans-18:1 isomers, particularly trans-11 18:1. This study included 2 in vitro experiments to identify if the increase in trans-11 C18:1 was due to DHA being converted into trans-11 18:1 or if DHA stimulated trans-11 products from biohydrogenation of other fatty acids. In each experiment, ruminal microorganisms collected from a lactating Holstein cow were incubated in 10-mL batch cultures for 0, 6, 24, and 48 h and a uniformly C-13-labeled DHA was added to the cultures at 0 h as a metabolic tracer. Experiment 1 tested 0.5% DHA supplementation and experiment 2 examined 1, 2, and 3% DHA supplementation to determine if the level of DHA effected its conversion into trans-11 18:1. In both experiments, any fatty acid that was enriched with the C-13 label was determined to arise from DHA. Palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), all trans-18:1, eicosanoic (C20:0), and docosanoic (C22:0) acids were examined for enrichment. In experiment 1, the amount of trans-18:1 isomers increased 0.415 mg from 0 to 48 h; however, no label was found in trans-18:1 at any time. Docosanoic acid was highly enriched at 24 h and 48 h to 20.2 and 16.3%. Low levels of enrichment were found in palmitic and stearic acids. In experiment 2, trans-18:1 isomers increased 185, 256, and 272% from 0 to 48 h when DHA was supplemented at 1, 2, and 3%, respectively; however, as in experiment 1, no enrichment occurred of any trans-18:1 isomer. In experiment 2, low levels of label were found in palmitic and stearic acids. Enrichment of docosanoic acid decreased linearly with increased DHA supplementation. These studies showed that trans-18:1 fatty acids are not produced from DHA, supporting that DHA elevates trans-18:1 by modifying biohydrogenation pathways of other polyunsaturated fatty acids.									18	1	0	16	0	19			0022-0302			WOS:000294085600043	21854940

These undoped ZnO nanowire arrays showed close alignment with highly c-axis oriented and well-defined hexagonal facets (001). The coexistence of the nanowires and nanosheets was observed during the introduction of Al ions. The number of nanosheets increased due to the Al doping concentration and the lack of surface energy. The diameter of the nanosheets and the length of nanowire arrays also increased as a function of the growth time. Room-temperature photoluminescence spectra show that the ZnO:Al nanostructures on the ZnO seeded polyethylene terephthalate substrate yield low level of the defect density compared to the ZnO seeded glass substrate to remove post annealing process.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0957-4522			WOS:000293773500027

One disadvantage of these techniques is that they retrieve only superficial information. To study the interior of a sample, the sample must be cut, and the integrity of the structure can be destroyed. In this contribution, we present data on membrane morphology characterization by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), a minimally invasive technique that utilizes optical, rather than mechanical, sectioning to provide three-dimensional imaging. CLSM was used to characterize symmetric and asymmetric membranes with nominal pore sizes in the range 0.22-8.0 mu m. A standardized protocol for sample preparation and analysis by CLSM was developed for symmetric membranes to capture high resolution images at different depths. Optical sectioning of the membrane was performed at 0.4 mu m intervals from the surface to the depth-of-penetration limit. To characterize the asymmetry in the thickness direction of membranes with thicknesses greater than the observed light penetration depth, we developed a new cross-sectional CLSM method involving membrane cryosectioning that enabled imaging of the entire membrane cross section. Concerns about surface artifacts due to sample preparation were avoided by imaging just below the surface of the membrane cross section. Finally, porosity was quantified as a function of depth for the symmetric and asymmetric membranes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we determined the mycelial growth rate of Monilinia fructicola isolates on various media and picked the three that allowed the fastest growth to assess the sensitivity of mycelium to SDHI fungicides boscalid, fluopyram, and penthiopyrad. Minimal medium (MM) supported mycelial growth the best and yielded lowest EC(50) values for three SDHI fungicides. EC(50) values corresponded with disease incidence data obtained from detached fruit assays. Penthiopyrad had significantly greater intrinsic activity in vitro compared to fluopyram at the alpha = 0.05 level and compared to boscalid at the alpha = 0.1 level. However, detached fruit assays revealed that this 'advantage' did not carry over in vivo. In conclusion, MM appears to be the best medium currently available to assess the sensitivity of M. fructicola mycelium in vitro.									8	0	0	6	1	8			0931-1785			WOS:000293511300005

Laser-guidance based cell detection for identifying malignant cancerous cells without any fluorescent markers								BIOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS				33	9			1767	1772		10.1007/s10529-011-0649-x			SEP 2011	2011	Laser guidance technique employs the optical forces generated from a focused Gaussian laser beam incident on a biological cell to trap and guide the cell along the laser propagation direction. The optical force, which determines the guidance speed, is dependent on the cellular characteristics of the cell being guided, such as size, shape, composition and morphology. Different cell populations or subpopulations can be detected without any fluorescent markers by measuring their guidance speeds. We found that cell guidance speeds were sensitive enough to monitor the subtle changes during the progression of mouse fibroblast cells from normal to cancerous phenotype. The results also demonstrated that this technique can effectively distinguish mouse mammary cancerous cells with different metastatic competence. Laser guidance technique can be used as a label-free cell detection method for basic cell biological investigation and cancer diagnosis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0141-5492			WOS:000293752700009	21626416

Data were collected from 652 males via confidential, self-report surveys at the end of their 1st and 2nd years in college. Results indicated that attitudes conducive to SA and perceived norms supportive of SA were associated with a higher likelihood of engaging in SA 1 year later, and mediated the associations of some established risk factors for SA. The findings identify potentially changeable risk factors for perpetrating SA and can thus contribute to the foundation on which to build theoretical and empirically based prevention programs.									25	0	0	7	0	25			0886-2605			WOS:000293732200009	21118861

To our knowledge, the TR has been for the first time achieved to 5-10 mu s, about 100 times better than that published from state-of-the-art micro particle image velocimetry (mu PIV), which is currently the most widely used velocimetry in the microfluidics community. The new method provides us with new opportunities to study experimentally the fundamental phenomena of unsteady electrokinetics (EK) and to validate relevant theoretical models. One application of the new method is demonstrated by measuring the rise time of DC electroosmotic flows (EOFs) in a microcapillary of 10 mu m in diameter.									10	0	0	3	0	10			1613-4982			WOS:000293640000011

The cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) enzyme catalyzes the conversion of cinnamoyl-CoAs to cinnamaldehydes, i.e. the first specific step in lignin synthesis. The CCR and CCR-like gene family was studied partially in several plant species. This is a comprehensive study of the CCR and CCR-like gene family including genome organization, gene structure, phylogeny across land plant species, and, expression profiling in Populus. Analysis of amino acid motifs enabled the identification of sequence variations in the CCR catalytic site and annotates CCR and CCR-like genes. CCR and CCR-like genes were distributed in three major phylogenetic classes of which one includes the bona fide CCR genes. The other two classes include CCR and CCR-like, of which several genes present a high similarity to cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, or dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) genes. All CCR, CCR-like, and DFR classes were deeply rooted in the phylogeny of land plants suggesting that their evolution preceded the evolution of lycophytes. Over two thirds of CCR and CCR-like Populus genes were physically distributed on duplicated regions. This suggests that these duplication/retention processes contributed significantly to the size of the CCR and CCR-like gene family. The Populus CCR and CCR-like genes showed six expression patterns in the tissues studied with a preferential expression of PoptrCCR12 in xylem. The other genes present divergent expression profiles with some preferentially expressed in leaves, bark, or both. Several CCR and CCR-like genes were induced or repressed under various abiotic stresses suggesting that their duplication was followed by the evolution of divergent expression profiles and divergence of functions.

Mares (n = 11) were randomly assigned into a control (non-exercised) or treatment (exercised) group. Treatment mares (n = 5) were moderately exercised for 30 min, 6 d/wk. All mares underwent daily transrectal ultrasonographic examinations and ovarian follicles > 6 mm were measured. Blood samples were collected during the first (Cycle 1) and last (Cycle 4) cycle, and serum concentrations of cortisol, LH, and FSH were determined. Mean cortisol concentrations were elevated (P < 0.05) in exercised mares, 6.29 +/- 0.22 compared with 5.62 +/- 0.16 ng/dL (mean SEM), 30 min post exercise. There were no significant differences between groups in mean FSH concentrations; however, exercised mares had lower (17.3 +/- 6.4 vs 41.1 +/- 5.5 ng/mL; P < 0.05) peak LH concentrations. Furthermore, exercised mares experienced a longer (24.7 +/- 0.8 vs 22.2 +/- 0.8 d; P < 0.05) mean interovulatory interval for all cycles combined, fewer (P < 0.05) follicles 6 to 20 mm in diameter, and an increased (P < 0.05) number of follicles >20 mm following deviation. The dominant and largest subordinate follicle in exercised mares had a greater (P < 0.05) mean diameter on the day of deviation, suggesting delayed deviation. Exercised mares also tended (P = 0.06) to have an increased number of cycles with at least two dominant follicles compared to control (62 vs 36%, respectively), indicating a decreased ability of the largest follicle to assert dominance. Under the conditions of this study, moderately exercising mares induced higher cortisol concentrations, lowered peak LH concentrations, and altered ovarian follicular dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J	Denham, Bryan E.								Adolescent Self-Perceptions and Attitudes Toward School as Determinants of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Risk Estimates and Normative Judgments								YOUTH & SOCIETY				43	3			1041	1065		10.1177/0044118X10379736			SEP 2011	2011	Grounded in symbolic interactionism and drawing on data gathered in the 2007 Monitoring the Future Study (n = 2,201), this research examines how self-esteem and perceived intelligence, as well as attitudes and behaviors related to school environments, associate with perceptions of anabolic-androgenic steroids. With perceived risk and approval/disapproval of steroid use as dependent measures, logistic regression models identified explanatory effects for sex, race, newspaper exposure, and peer use of steroids, with males, Whites, those who seldom read the newspaper, and those with friends who had used steroids estimating lower levels of risk and indicating less disapproval. Those who viewed themselves as being more intelligent than their peers as well as those with higher levels of self-esteem estimated higher levels of risk and expressed greater disapproval, whereas those who indicated "hating" school and those who had skipped school the most estimated lower risk and less disapproval. Logit log-linear models identified the most parsimonious representations of variable relationships, demonstrating how the presence of a self-esteem index stands to reduce the centrality of sex and race as explanatory measures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0044-118X	1552-8499		WOS:000293641600010		
J	Hemez, Francois M.; Atamturktur, Sezer					Hemez, Francois/0000-0002-5319-4078			The dangers of sparse sampling for the quantification of margin and uncertainty								RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY				96	9	SI		1220	1231		10.1016/j.ress.2011.02.015			SEP 2011	2011	Activities such as global sensitivity analysis, statistical effect screening, uncertainty propagation, or model calibration have become integral to the Verification and Validation (V&V) of numerical models and computer simulations. One of the goals of V&V is to assess prediction accuracy and uncertainty, which feeds directly into reliability analysis or the Quantification of Margin and Uncertainty (QMU) of engineered systems. Because these analyses involve multiple runs of a computer code, they can rapidly become computationally expensive. An alternative to Monte Carlo-like sampling is to combine a design of computer experiments to meta-modeling, and replace the potentially expensive computer simulation by a fast-running emulator. The surrogate can then be used to estimate sensitivities, propagate uncertainty, and calibrate model parameters at a fraction of the cost it would take to wrap a sampling algorithm or optimization solver around the physics-based code. Doing so, however, offers the risk to develop an incorrect emulator that erroneously approximates the "true-but-unknown" sensitivities of the physics-based code. We demonstrate the extent to which this occurs when Gaussian Process Modeling (GPM) emulators are trained in high-dimensional spaces using too-sparsely populated designs-of-experiments. Our illustration analyzes a variant of the Rosenbrock function in which several effects are made statistically insignificant while others are strongly coupled, therefore, mimicking a situation that is often encountered in practice. In this example, using a combination of GPM emulator and design-of-experiments leads to an incorrect approximation of the function. A mathematical proof of the origin of the problem is proposed. The adverse effects that too-sparsely populated designs may produce are discussed for the coverage of the design space, estimation of sensitivities, and calibration of parameters. This work attempts to raise awareness to the potential dangers of not allocating enough resources when exploring a design space to develop fast-running emulators. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, new methods to improve the quality and application of indicator data have been proposed and developed. Here we propose the use of detection probability in the selection and application of indicator species. We evaluated environmental and observer factors believed to affect detection of potential species. Observer effects were the most evident factor and may necessitate the greatest consideration in the use of indicator species. Our results call attention to the fact that raw counts are far from accurate and that the use of detection probability can and should be incorporated into sampling protocols, species selection, and the allocation of effort for projects that use indicator species as part of monitoring and management programs.

To gain a deeper understanding of the electron-mediating function of triazoles, we have synthesized a family of new triazole-based electron donor-acceptor conjugates. We have connected zinc(II)porphyrins and fullerenes through a central triazole moiety-(ZnP-Tri-C(60))-each with a single change in their connection through the linker. An extensive photophysical and computational investigation reveals that the electron transfer dynamics-charge separation and charge recombination-in the different ZnP-Tri-C(60) conjugates reflect a significant influence of the connectivity at the triazole linker. Except for the m4m-ZnP-Tri-C(60) 17, the conjugates exhibit through-bond photoinduced electron transfer with varying rate constants. Since the through-bond distance is nearly the same for all the synthesized ZnP-Tri-C(60) conjugates, the variation in charge separation and charge recombination dynamics is mainly associated with the electronic properties of the conjugates, including orbital energies, electron affinity, and the energies of the excited states. The changes of the electronic couplings are, in turn, a consequence of the different connectivity patterns at the triazole moieties.									60	0	0	8	0	60			0002-7863			WOS:000294591300034	21702513

Demonstration of the anyonic statistics using Majorana fermion interferometry in this system is a necessary first step toward topological quantum computation (TQC). However, since all isolated chiral edges that can be created in the semiconductor are charge neutral, it is not clear if electrically controlled interferometry is possible in this system. Here we show that when two isolated chiral Majorana edges are brought into close contact, the resultant interface supports charge current, enabling electrically controlled Majorana fermion interferometry in the semiconductor structure. Such interferometry experiments on the semiconductor are analogous to similar interferometry experiments on the v = 5/2 fractional quantum Hall systems and on the surface of a three-dimensional (3D) strong topological insulator, illustrating the usefulness of the 2D semiconductor heterostructure as a suitable TQC platform. In particular, we propose thatMajorana interferometers may be the most direct method for establishing non-Abelian braiding statistics in topological superconductors.									23	0	0	0	0	23			1098-0121			WOS:000294132600001

Stellar parameters are derived directly from our high-quality spectra, and the stars are found to be physically similar, with Delta T-eff = +43 K, Delta log g = -0.02 dex, and Delta xi = +0.10 km s(-1) ( in the sense of A - B), consistent with previous findings. Abundances of 15 elements are derived and are found to be indistinguishable between the two stars. The abundances of each element differ by <= 0.026 dex, and the mean difference is +0.003 +/- 0.015 (sigma) dex. Aside from Li, which has been previously shown to be depleted by a factor of at least 4.5 in 16 Cyg B relative to 16 Cyg A, the two stars appear to be chemically identical. The abundances of each star demonstrate a positive correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements (T-c); the slopes of the trends are also indistinguishable. In accordance with recent suggestions, the positive slopes of the [m/H]-T-c relations may imply that terrestrial planets have not formed around either 16 Cyg A or 16 Cyg B. The physical characteristics of the 16 Cyg system are discussed in terms of planet formation models, and plausible mechanisms that can account for the lack of detected planets around 16 Cyg A, the disparate Li abundances of 16 Cyg A and B, and the eccentricity of the planet 16 Cyg B b are suggested.									34	0	0	0	0	34			2041-8205			WOS:000294837500007

Therefore, some concerns about the possible human health and environmental impacts of manufactured MWCNTs are rising. We hypothesized that instillation of MWCNTs impairs pulmonary function in C57BL/6 mice due to development of lung inflammation and fibrosis.Methods: MWCNTs were administered to C57BL/6 mice by oropharyngeal aspiration (1, 2, and 4 mg/kg) and we assessed lung inflammation and fibrosis by inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen content, and histological assessment. Pulmonary function was assessed using a FlexiVent system and levels of Ccl3, Ccl11, Mmp13 and IL-33 were measured by RT-PCR and ELISA.Results: Mice administered MWCNTs exhibited increased inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition and granuloma formation in lung tissue, which correlated with impaired pulmonary function as assessed by increased resistance, tissue damping, and decreased lung compliance. Pulmonary exposure to MWCNTs induced an inflammatory signature marked by cytokine (IL-33), chemokine (Ccl3 and Ccl11), and protease production (Mmp13) that promoted the inflammatory and fibrotic changes observed within the lung.Conclusions: These results further highlight the potential adverse health effects that may occur following MWCNT exposure and therefore we suggest these materials may pose a significant risk leading to impaired lung function following environmental and occupational exposures.									59	2	0	40	0	61			1743-8977			WOS:000294857000001	21851604

Matina 1-6								BMC GENOMICS				12						413	10.1186/1471-2164-12-413			AUG 16 2011	2011	Background: The fermented dried seeds of Theobroma cacao (cacao tree) are the main ingredient in chocolate. World cocoa production was estimated to be 3 million tons in 2010 with an annual estimated average growth rate of 2.2%. The cacao bean production industry is currently under threat from a rise in fungal diseases including black pod, frosty pod, and witches' broom. In order to address these issues, genome-sequencing efforts have been initiated recently to facilitate identification of genetic markers and genes that could be utilized to accelerate the release of robust T. cacao cultivars. However, problems inherent with assembly and resolution of distal regions of complex eukaryotic genomes, such as gaps, chimeric joins, and unresolvable repeat-induced compressions, have been unavoidably encountered with the sequencing strategies selected.Results: Here, we describe the construction of a BAC-based integrated genetic-physical map of the T. cacao cultivar Matina 1-6 which is designed to augment and enhance these sequencing efforts. Three BAC libraries, each comprised of 10x coverage, were constructed and fingerprinted. 230 genetic markers from a high-resolution genetic recombination map and 96 Arabidopsis-derived conserved ortholog set (COS) II markers were anchored using pooled overgo hybridization. A dense tile path consisting of 29,383 BACs was selected and end-sequenced. The physical map consists of 154 contigs and 4,268 singletons. Forty-nine contigs are genetically anchored and ordered to chromosomes for a total span of 307.2 Mbp. The unanchored contigs (105) span 67.4 Mbp and therefore the estimated genome size of T. cacao is 374.6 Mbp. A comparative analysis with A. thaliana, V. vinifera, and P. trichocarpa suggests that comparisons of the genome assemblies of these distantly related species could provide insights into genome structure, evolutionary history, conservation of functional sites, and improvements in physical map assembly. A comparison between the two T. cacao cultivars Matina 1-6 and Criollo indicates a high degree of collinearity in their genomes, yet rearrangements were also observed.Conclusions: The results presented in this study are a stand-alone resource for functional exploitation and enhancement of Theobroma cacao but are also expected to complement and augment ongoing genomesequencing efforts. This resource will serve as a template for refinement of the T. cacao genome through gapfilling, targeted re-sequencing, and resolution of repetitive DNA arrays.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1471-2164			WOS:000294902600001	21846342

Monitoring basic water quality measurements such as turbidity, silt density index (SDI), dissolved oxygen, and bulk fluorescence can approximate algal activity; however, these measurements lack the resolution needed to accurately track growth throughout all phases of a bloom event. This study investigates the use of a laser scanning cytometer (LSC) that detects algal cells over a wide range of concentrations (50-150,000 cells/ml), and characterizes cell shape, size, and distribution parameters through fluorescence signal imaging. Water samples are filtered to collect algae on a 0.2-mu m membrane surface. Sample volume is variable so cells can be concentrated. The membrane surface is scanned with a 635-nm diode laser and the signal is processed to generate a cell count and distribution image. LSC performance was comparable to fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry over a range of concentrations that may be encountered during a bloom event. The applicability of LSC was demonstrated using laboratory-grown cultures and seawater samples taken during a bloom event off of the coast of Long Beach, CA. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

What are the most remarkable signatures of fast adaptive genes, besides the commonly revealed rapid divergence and high non-synonymous substitution rate? Here we investigated these changes in five R-loci following recent differentiation between Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata. Extreme differences in evolutionary rates were observed: e.g., an overall 5.46-9.83-fold different nucleotide diversity at two R-loci between species, ten-fold higher non-synonymous substitution rates within one species versus the other, significantly different Ka/Ks ratios between species for the same R-gene, and high interspecific divergence at one R-locus. Particularly, we observed an elevated level of trans-specific polymorphism at one R-locus and a differentially maintained presence/absence polymorphism at another. The high frequency of ancestral polymorphisms amongst R-genes suggests that the persistence of some functional variation is an important evolutionary mechanism shaping genetic variation in R-genes, while the variation of presence/absence polymorphisms provides a potential mechanism for malleable activation of adaptive resistance response pathways. The distinct patterns among R-genes suggest that the same R-gene ortholog can be quickly shaped by different evolutionary processes, e.g., purifying selection in one species but positive selection in a closely-related species.

Recognition of HIV TAR RNA by triazole linked neomycin dimers								BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS				21	16			4788	4792		10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.06.058			AUG 15 2011	2011	A series of neomycin dimers have been synthesized using 'click chemistry' with varying linker functionality and length to target the TAR RNA region of HIV virus. TAR (trans activation response) RNA region, a 59 base pair stem loop structure located at 5'-end of all nascent HIV-1 transcripts interacts with a key regulatory protein, Tat, and necessitates the replication of HIV-1 virus. Neomycin, an aminosugar, has been shown to exhibit more than one binding site with HIV TAR RNA. Multiple TAR binding sites of neomycin prompted us to design and synthesize a small library of neomycin dimers using click chemistry. The binding between neomycin dimers and HIV TAR RNA was characterized using spectroscopic techniques including FID (Fluorescent Intercalator Displacement) titration and UV-thermal denaturation. UV thermal denaturation studies demonstrate that neomycin dimer binding increase the melting temperature (T(m)) of the HIV TAR RNA up to 10 degrees C. Ethidium bromide displacement titrations revealed nanomolar IC(50) between neomycin dimers and HIV TAR RNA, whereas with neomycin, a much higher IC(50) in the micromolar range is observed.

Tunnel junction devices with ion-irradiated barriers were used to amplify the effect of charge-dependent cratering through the exponential dependence of tunneling conductance on barrier thickness. Electrical conductance of a crater sigma(c)(Q) increased by 4 orders of magnitude (7.9 x 10(-4) mu S to 6.1 mu S) as Q increased, corresponding to crater depths ranging from 2 to 11 angstrom. By employing a heated spike model, we determine that the energy required to produce the craters spans from 8 to 25 keV over the investigated charge states. Considering energy from preequilibrium nuclear and electronic stopping as well as neutralization, we find that at least (27 +/- 2)% of available projectile neutralization energy is deposited into the thin film during impact.									18	0	0	2	0	18			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000293562900002	21902321

The gravure ink was effectively dispersed through the clay using an ultrasonic homogenizer. Barrier properties of OPP films coated by the gravure ink-containing nanoclays were evaluated with respect to dispersion time, clay content, and different types of nanoclays (Cloisite Na(+), Cloisite 25A, and Cloisite 30B). Barrier and morphology properties of the OPP films were tested by measuring selected film properties such as O(2) transmission rate (OTR), and water vapor transmission rate, and by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). OTR of control OPP film coated solely with gravure ink was 1653 cm(3) m(-2) day, while use of OPP films coated by the three different types of gravure ink-containing nanoclays (nanoclay content: 1% w/w) reduced OTR by 12-37%. OTR values measured using the gravure ink-containing modified montmorillonite (Cloisite 25A and Cloisite 30B) were markedly lower than measured by pristine gravure ink-containing unmodified montmorillonite (Cloisite Na(+)). On the other hand, no remarkable differences were evident in the water vapor barrier performance of control OPP film and gravure ink-containing nanoclay-coated OPP film. As nanoclay content and dispersion time increased, OTR values of the OPP films coated by gravure ink-containing nanoclays decreased. And the TEM and XRD observation indicated that intercalated and exfoliated types were generated. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hydromechanical behavior during constant-rate pumping tests in fractured gneiss								HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL				19	5			963	980		10.1007/s10040-011-0728-z			AUG 2011	2011	Deformation and fluid pressure during constant-rate pumping tests were characterized by sensitivity analyses using a theoretical model of a deformable fracture, and by conducting and analyzing field tests at a site underlain by fractured biotite gneiss in western South Carolina, USA. The sensitivity analysis indicates that displacement is a hysteretic function of fluid pressure during constant-rate pumping tests, and the signals are affected by properties of the fracture (normal stiffness, aperture, and heterogeneities in the fracture plane) and enveloping rock (elastic modulus and permeability). The field tests used a removable borehole extensometer to measure axial displacements in the pumping well. The field results are generally similar to simulations, and the hydraulic and mechanical properties obtained by inversion of the pumping test results are essentially the same as results from hydromechanical slug tests. The observed displacements early in the pumping tests are less than, whereas late in the test they are greater than predicted values assuming a uniform fracture. This difference can be explained as a consequence of preferential flow within the fracture. These results indicate that displacements in a wellbore are sensitive to details of fracture connectivity and preferential flow that are difficult to detect through the pressure signal alone.									8	0	0	1	0	8			1431-2174			WOS:000293474100003

The nominal boric acid concentrations were 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 12.5% and 15%. This resulted in a nonmonotonic variation of carrier concentration in the resulting samples. The 7.5% boric acid treated sample showed the least magnitude and weakest temperature-dependence for the thermopower with a distinct phonon-drag peak that was absent in the other samples. These results are discussed within the framework of the doping-induced shift of the Fermi level and changes in the electron-phonon coupling.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1793-2920			WOS:000293296900006

However, mitigating the significant cost of FPGA development requires efficient design-space exploration to plan and evaluate a range of potential algorithm and platform choices prior to implementation. The authors propose the RC Amenability Test for Scalable Systems (RATSS), an analytical model which enables straightforward, fast, and reasonably accurate performance prediction prior to implementation by extending current modeling concepts to multi-FPGA designs. RATSS provides a comprehensive strategic model to evaluate applications based on the computation and communication requirements of the algorithm and capabilities of the FPGA platform. The RATSS model targets data-parallel applications on current scalable FPGA systems. Three case studies with RATSS demonstrate nearly 90% prediction accuracy as compared to corresponding implementations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-7406	1936-7414		WOS:000299337400007

Two models are presented. First, more general polyhedral cones are assumed so determine the equitable preference. Second, the Pareto cone appearing in the monotonicity axiom of equitability is replaced with a permutation-invariant polyhedral cone. The conditions under which the new models are related and satisfy original and modified axioms of the equitable preference are developed. Relationships between generalized equitability and relative importance of criteria and stochastic dominance are revealed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kuehn, Thomas								DEBT AND BANKRUPTCY IN FLORENCE STATUTES AND CASES								QUADERNI STORICI				46	2			355	+					AUG 2011	2011	Trust was the basis of credit in early modern markets, but it was a fragile basis. Trust could be, and too frequently was, betrayed. Florence, like many other communities, wove kinship into a legal system of protection of trust and credit. If a man failed to meet his financial obligations, his sons, brothers, or father would nominally become liable for the debt. Such laws did not always have the desired effect, however, and Florentines fashioned various pieces of legislation across the fifteenth century to remedy flaws that emerged. Florentines themselves were highly aware of the fragility of trust, both as a threat to them and as a device at their disposal. But part of the problem also was the tendency of lawyers, while providing expert counsel in cases, to interpret narrowly statutory rules that sought to extend liabilities beyond the principal debtors to their kinsman, at least when such kin were innocently caught up in others' failings. Lawyers operated generally with a principle of individual responsibility, even as they well understood the more collective responsibility embodied in civic statutes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0301-6307			WOS:000296691100002

Improving Thermoelectric Performance of Pulverized p-Type Bi2Te3 via a Grain Boundary Engineering Approach								SCIENCE OF ADVANCED MATERIALS				3	4	SI		596	601		10.1166/sam.2011.1188			AUG 2011	2011	It has been previously demonstrated that the hydrothermal treatment of polycrystalline p-Bi2Te3 by alkali metal salt XBH4 (X = Na or Rb) solution resulted in lower thermal conductivity for Na-treatment and higher power factor for Rb-treatment due to a thin layer formed at the grain boundary. One step further, we herein report the results of an approach combining both Na- and Rb-treatment with various molar ratios. It is found that a similar grain boundary layer is formed with a compositional gradient along the depth direction. Hall coefficient measurements have shown that the grain boundary phase introduced new carriers into the system and thereby compensated for the loss in mobility. With the Seebeck coefficient largely retained, the electrical conductivity to thermal conductivity ratio has been optimized by varying the Na:Rb ratio in the starting solution. As a result, the Na:Rb similar to 1:2 ratio yields the best dimensionless figure of merit ZT value similar to 0.92 at 350 K, comparable with that of the start-of-the art p-type Bi2Te3 commercial ingot.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1947-2935			WOS:000296672800009

On the other hand, oxides were believed to make poor TEs because of the low carrier mobility and high lattice thermal conductivity. That is why the discoveries of good p-type TE properties in layered cobaltites Na(x)CoO(2), Ca(4)Co(3)O(9), and Bi(2)Sr(2)Co(2)O(9), and promising n-type TE properties in CaMnO(3)- and SrTiO(3)-based perovskites and doped ZnO, broke new ground in thermoelectrics study. The past two decades have witnessed more than an order of magnitude enhancement in ZT of oxides.

(Bi,Sb)(2)Te-3 possesses a highly anisotropic crystal structure; therefore, it is important to investigate any potential correlation between the SPS conditions, the as-formed microstructures, and the resulting TE properties. In this work, we investigate the correlation between the SPS pressure, the microstructure texture, and the anisotropy of the total thermal conductivity in these melt-spun spark-plasma-sintered (Bi,Sb)(2)Te-3 compounds. The thermal conductivity has been measured in directions that are both perpendicular and parallel to the pressing (or force) direction by rearranging the sample geometry as described in the text. The results show that the anisotropy of thermal conductivity is similar to 0, 2-3, 6-7, and 13-15% for the samples sintered at pressures of 20, 30, 45, and 60 MPa, respectively. These results are consistent with an increasing degree of orientation observed by x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy.									19	0	0	1	0	19			0884-2914			WOS:000296080700007

Process optimization studies revealed that a very narrow process window exists for the growth of single-phase skutterudite films. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measured in the temperature range 300-700 K revealed an irreversible change on the first heating cycle in argon ambient, which is attributed to the enhanced surface roughness of the films or trace secondary phases. A power factor of 0.68Wm(-1) K-1 was obtained at similar to 700 K, which is nearly six times lower than that of bulk samples. This difference is attributed to grain boundary scattering that causes a drop in film conductivity.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0884-2914			WOS:000296080700012

In this work, a series of FeSb2 polycrystalline samples with different amounts of additional Indium were prepared by a quench-and-anneal method followed by a spark plasma sintering procedure. The x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and elemental analysis verified that the Sb/InSb nanoinclusions were formed in situ on the boundaries of coarse FeSb2 grains. The presence of such nanoinclusions and other as-formed multiscale microstructures can scatter phonons and thus dramatically reduce the corresponding lattice thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the electrical properties can be also improved because of the addition of high mobility carriers from the InSb nanoinclusions. Overall, FeSb2-based materials have shown some promising potential for possible thermoelectric cooling applications at cryogenic temperatures.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0884-2914			WOS:000296080700021

Simulium arakawae differs from the subgeneric standard by eight fixed inversions, apparently none of which are shared with any of the other 17 chromosomally studied nominal members of the group. The chromosomal features that indicate group membership might have been lost in S. arakawae, particularly if they were polymorphic in an ancestor.									2	0	0	3	0	3			0127-5720			WOS:000295948100020	22041759

DISTRIBUTION RECORDS AND COMMENTS ON FLEAS IN SOUTHWESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA								WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST				71	2			240	246					AUG 2011	2011	From October 2003 through April 2006, we collected 565 fleas incidental to a distribution survey of mammals in southwestern South Dakota. Sixty-one specimens, representing 18 species of mammals, possessed 20 species of fleas. The geographic distributions of these flea species revealed 8 new records for the Black Hills and its adjacent grasslands. Four species-Megarthroglossus divisus, Stenoponia americana, Odontopsyllus dentatus, and Amaradix euphorbi-constitute new records for South Dakota, thus increasing the state's known flea fauna to 42 species. Hunters, trappers, and field biologists should be aware that serosurveillance during the 1990s revealed the presence of sylvatic plague and tularemia in the Black Hills area.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1527-0904			WOS:000295203900011

Identification of Enriched Conjugated Linoleic Acid Isomers in Cultures of Ruminal Microorganisms after Dosing with 1-C-13-Linoleic Acid								JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY				49	4			622	627		10.1007/s12275-011-0415-8			AUG 2011	2011	Most studies of linoleic acid biohydrogenation propose that it converts to stearic acid through the production of cis-9 trans-11 CLA and trans-11 C18:1. However, several other CLA have been identified in ruminal contents, suggesting additional pathways may exist. To explore this possibility, this research investigated the linoleic acid biohydrogenation pathway to identify CLA isomers in cultures of ruminal microorganisms after dosing with a C-13 stable isotope. The C-13 enrichment was calculated as [(M+1/M)x100] in labeled minus unlabeled cultures. After 48 h incubation, significant C-13 enrichment was observed in seven CLA isomers, indicating their formation from linoleic acid. All enriched CLA isomers had double bonds in either the 9,11 or 10,12 position except for trans-9 cis-11 CLA. The cis-9 trans-11 CLA exhibited the highest enrich ment (30.65%), followed by enrichments from 21.06 to 23.08% for trans-10 cis-12, cis-10 trans-12, trans-9 trans-11, and trans-10 trans-12 CLA. The remaining two CLA (cis-9 cis-11 and cis-10 cis-12 CLA) exhibited enrichments of 18.38 and 19.29%, respectively. The results of this study verified the formation of cis-9 trans-11 and trans-10 cis-12 CLA isomers from linoleic acid biohydrogenation. An additional five CLA isomers also contained carbons originating from linoleic acid, indicating that pathways of linoleic acid biohydrogenation are more complex than previously described.									5	1	0	4	0	6			1225-8873			WOS:000294443100014	21887646

In vivo strains in the femur of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) during terrestrial locomotion: testing hypotheses of evolutionary shifts in mammalian bone loading and design								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				214	15			2631	2640		10.1242/jeb.049544			AUG 2011	2011	Terrestrial locomotion can impose substantial loads on vertebrate limbs. Previous studies have shown that limb bones from cursorial species of eutherian mammals experience high bending loads with minimal torsion, whereas the limb bones of nonavian reptiles (and amphibians) exhibit considerable torsion in addition to bending. It has been hypothesized that these differences in loading regime are related to the difference in limb posture between upright mammals and sprawling reptiles, and that the loading patterns observed in non-avian reptiles may be ancestral for tetrapod vertebrates. To evaluate whether non-cursorial mammals show loading patterns more similar to those of sprawling lineages, we measured in vivo strains in the femur during terrestrial locomotion of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), a marsupial that uses more crouched limb posture than most mammals from which bone strains have been recorded, and which belongs to a clade phylogenetically between reptiles and the eutherian mammals studied previously. The presence of substantial torsion in the femur of opossums, similar to nonavian reptiles, would suggest that this loading regime likely reflects an ancestral condition for tetrapod limb bone design. Strain recordings indicate the presence of both bending and appreciable torsion (shear strain: 419.1 +/- 212.8 mu e) in the opossum femur, with planar strain analyses showing neutral axis orientations that placed the lateral aspect of the femur in tension at the time of peak strains. Such mediolateral bending was unexpected for a mammal running with near-parasagittal limb kinematics. Shear strains were similar in magnitude to peak compressive axial strains, with opossum femora experiencing similar bending loads but higher levels of torsion compared with most previously studied mammals. Analyses of peak femoral strains led to estimated safety factor ranges of 5.1-7.2 in bending and 5.5-7.3 in torsion, somewhat higher than typical mammalian values for bending, but approaching typical reptilian values for shear. Loading patterns of opossum limb bones therefore appear intermediate in some respects between those of eutherian mammals and non-avian reptiles, providing further support for hypotheses that high torsion and elevated limb bone safety factors may represent persistent ancestral conditions in the evolution of tetrapod limb bone loading and design.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000292694500029	21753057

Near-Field Distance Perception in Real and Virtual Environments Using Both Verbal and Action Responses								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED PERCEPTION				8	3					18	10.1145/2010325.2010328			AUG 2011	2011	Few experiments have been performed to investigate near-field egocentric distance estimation in an Immersive Virtual Environment (IVE) as compared to the Real World (RW). This article investigates near-field distance estimation in IVEs and RW conditions using physical reach and verbal report measures, by using an apparatus similar to that used by Bingham and Pagano [1998]. Analysis of our experiment shows distance compression in both the IVE and RW conditions in participants' perceptual judgments to targets. This is consistent with previous research in both action space in an IVE and reach space with Augmented Reality (AR). Analysis of verbal responses from participants revealed that participants underestimated significantly less in the virtual world as compared to the RW. We also found that verbal reports and reaches provided different results in both IVEs and RW environments.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1544-3558			WOS:000294815800003

A device that counts bites can provide bite-rate feedback to the user. The purpose of this study was to explore the bite counter's utility for slowing bite-rate and reducing energy intake. The study was a within-participants design with three conditions. From February to April 2009, university students (N=30) ate three meals in the laboratory: a baseline meal without feedback (Baseline), a meal during which participants received bite-rate feedback (Feedback), and a meal during which participants followed a 50% slower bite-rate target (Slow Bite-Rate). Kilocalories of food consumed, ratings of satiation and food-liking, and milliliters of water consumed were statistically compared across conditions using repeated-measures analyses of variance. Overall, participants ate 70 kcal fewer during the Slow Bite-Rate condition compared with the Feedback condition. In addition, when baseline energy consumption was added. post hoc as a grouping variable, participants who ate more than 400 kcal at baseline (n=11) ate 164 kcal fewer during the Slow Bite-Rate condition compared to Baseline, and 142 kcal fewer in the Feedback condition compared with Baseline. However, the Slow Bite-Rate condition did not significantly affect participants who ate fewer than 400 kcal at baseline (n=19). Therefore, it seems that slowing bite-rate with the bite counter may be most effective for individuals who consume larger amounts of food. Future research should explore more foods and drinks, more diverse groups of individuals, potential moderating variables, and additional applications of the bite counter.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of a new 16-item transition scale were conducted with 2 samples and resulted in 4 factors (Benefit, Appreciation, Anger/Alienation, and Guilt/Remorse). In Study 1 (N = 1,65 1), the number of combat events was positively related to Anger/Alienation 4 months later even after controlling for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, partial r = .18, p < .001. In Study 2 (NI = 647), after controlling for PTSD symptoms, Anger/Alienation assessed at 4 months postdeployment predicted more risk-taking behaviors 4 months later, partial r = .10, p = .01. Appreciation predicted fewer unhealthy habits, partial r = .13, p = .001, whereas Anger/Alienation predicted more unhealthy habits, partial r = .09, p = .024. Results demonstrate the importance of broadening the conceptualization of adjustment in combat veterans.									23	0	0	6	0	24			0894-9867			WOS:000294575800002	21818784

This trans-layer Seebeck effect exists on account of the inter-layer long-range electron-electron scattering and represents a generalization of the Coulomb drag phenomenon, defined as the mutual friction of two electron systems, to thermal perturbations. An effective thermopower coefficient alpha(D) is calculated within the random-phase approximation for the Coulomb interaction. At low temperature, alpha(D) is found to be directly proportional to the electron-electron scattering rate in 2D, tau(-1)(ee). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The market for audit services has undergone dramatic change in recent years, resulting in a substantial increase in the number of clients realigning to smaller auditors. This shift in the audit market raises concern about the potential adverse effects of clients moving away from larger, and perhaps more effective, auditors. Consistent with this concern, our analysis of auditor switches occurring between 2003 and 2005 indicates that downgrade clients reported a significant increase in signed discretionary accruals over the two years following the switch. In contrast, we find no significant change in discretionary accruals for a control sample of lateral switches. However, between-sample comparisons fail to provide consistent evidence that the two groups reported accrual changes differently following the auditor switch.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0278-0380			WOS:000294154500002

Fiber reinforcement can reduce the crack width in cementitious materials, thereby reducing fluid transport. Substantial research has been performed to better understand how fabric reinforcement can be used to improve the mechanical behavior of cement-based composites. As a result, the use of fabric reinforcement is being increasingly used in these applications. Fabric reinforcement is being increasingly selected based on the mechanical properties the fabric provides, but unfortunately, the influence of fabric reinforcement on fluid transport is less frequently considered in the fabric selection process. This paper attempts to provide experimental measurements that indicate the importance of fabric properties on fluid transport. This paper describes a series of experiments in which fluid transport was measured using X-ray radiography in cracked cement paste samples that were reinforced with different commercially available fabrics made with monofilament and multifilament yarns that were both coated and uncoated. Results show that fabrics made of multifilament yarns without coating may be problematic from a durability point of view. However, when multifilament yarns are coated, the fabric behaves as a monofilament system. The transport behavior was observed to be highly dependent on the quality of the coating. This should be considered in addition to mechanical performance in assessing the type of fabrics that should be used for a specific application. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000289.

The Inhibition was mainly attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonding between the nanoparticle and the tubulin heterodimer, the building block of the microtubule, as evidenced by docking and molecular dynamics simulations our circular dichroism spectroscopy measurement indicated changes In the tubulin secondary structures, while our guanosine-5'-triphosphate hydrolysis assay showed hindered release of inorganic phosphate by the nanoparticle. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that C(60)(OH)(20) binds to tubulin at a molar ratio of 9:1 and with a binding constant of 1.3 +/- 0.16 x 10(6) M(-1), which was substantiated by the binding site and binding energy analysis using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations further suggested that occupancy by the nanoparticles at the longitudinal contacts between tubulin dimers within a protofilament or at, the lateral contacts of the M-loop and H5 and H12 helices of neighboring tubulins could also influence, the polymerization process.

This study investigated abiotic and biological degradation of RDX in contaminated aquifer material. Anoxic batch systems were started with and without pre-aeration of aquifer material to distinguish initial biological RDX reduction from abiotic RDX reduction. Aerating the sediment eliminated chemical reductants in the native aquifer sediment, primarily Fe(II) sorbed to mineral surfaces. RDX (50 mu M) was completely reduced and transformed to ring cleavage products when excess concentrations (2 mM) of acetate or lactate were provided as the electron donor for aerated sediment. RDX was reduced concurrently with Fe(III) when acetate was provided, while RDX, Fe(III), and sulfate were reduced simultaneously with lactate amendment. Betaproteobacteria were the dominant microorganisms associated with RDX and Fe(III)/sulfate reduction. In particular, Rhodoferax spp. increased from 21% to 35% and from 28% to 60% after biostimulation by acetate and lactate, respectively. Rarefaction analyses demonstrated that microbial diversity decreased in electron-donor-amended systems with active RDX degradation. Although significant amounts of Fe(III) and/or sulfate were reduced after biostimulation, solid-phase reactive minerals such as magnetite or ferrous sulfides were not observed, suggesting that RDX reduction in the aquifer sediment is due to Fe(II) adsorbed to solid surfaces as a result of Fe(III)-reducing microbial activity. These results suggest that both biotic and abiotic processes play an important role in RDX reduction under in situ conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It is prized on the international market resulting in an increased production with significant contributions to local economic development. Longan fruit contains significant amounts of bioactive compounds such as corilagin, ellagic acid and its conjugates, 4-O-methylgallic acid, flavone glycosides, glycosides of quercetin and kaempferol, ethyl gallate 1-beta-O-galloyl-D-glucopyranose, grevifolin and 4-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-ellagic acid. The fruit has been used in the traditional Chinese medicinal formulation, serving as an agent in relief of neural pain and swelling. The application of ultrasonic-assisted extraction or high pressure-assisted extraction greatly increases the yield from longan pericarp or seeds. In recent years, some pharmacological activities such as anti-tyrosinase, anti-glycated and anticancer activities, and memory-enhancing effects of longan aril, pericarp or seed extract have been found, implicating a significant contribution to human health. Regarding the increasing cultivation area and increasing quantity of longan fruit in the world, further utilization of this fruit is expected in an effort to use more efficiently the inherent bioactive compounds. The paper reviews the recent advances in the extraction and pharmacological activities of bioactive compounds from longan fruit. Some novel pharmacological potential of longan fruit is also discussed in this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									40	7	0	23	0	48			0963-9969			WOS:000293759400017

R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 234, 1956, pp. 1-23) is re-cast in terms of the non-dimensional plume radius, the plume 'laziness' defined as the squared ratio of the source radius and the jet length, and the buoyancy flux. It is shown that many of the key results of this classical model can then be read straight from the equations without recourse to solving them. Based on this observation, derivative models that consider plumes propagating through stratified environments or undergoing chemical reactions are similarly re-cast. We show again that key results can be read straight from the governing equations and results that have previously only been demonstrated numerically can be found analytically. In particular, we unify two previously distinct models that consider plumes propagating through stable and unstable stratified environments whose stratification has a power-law dependence on height. We present analytical solutions for the range of stratification power-law decay rates for which straight-sided plumes are possible. This result unifies the sets of solutions by Batchelor (Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., vol. 80, 1954, pp. 339-358) and Caulfield & Woods (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 360, 1998, pp. 229-248). We are able to explain the unstable behaviour previously found when the power lies in the range (-4,-8/3). Finally we show that this method also has limited advantages when applied to plumes with unsteady source conditions.									6	1	0	1	0	7			0022-1120			WOS:000294111100023

Dynamics of polymers across an interface								EPL				95	4					46001	10.1209/0295-5075/95/46001			AUG 2011	2011	The migration of polymers across an interface as welding and self-healing of polymer layers takes place, is in the core of polymer-based devices. Using large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations the motion of polymer chains across an interface has been investigated. Unlike self-diffusion of polymers in melts where the early stages of diffusion are characterized by the reptation-like motion of chains in constraining tube formed by neighboring molecules, we find that interdiffusion across an interface is dominated by motion of the chain ends.

J	Salandro, Wesley A.; Bunget, Cristina; Mears, Laine								Electroplastic Modeling of Bending Stainless Steel Sheet Metal Using Energy Methods								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				133	4					041008	10.1115/1.4004589			AUG 2011	2011	Automotive manufacturers are continuously striving to meet economic demands by designing and manufacturing more efficient and better performing vehicles. To aid this effort, many manufacturers are using different design strategies such to reduce the overall size/weight of certain automotive components without compromising strength or durability. Stainless steel is a popular material for such uses (i.e., bumpers and fuel tanks), since it possesses both high strength and ductility, and it is relatively light for its strength. However, with current forming processes (e.g., hot working, incremental forming, and superplastic forming), extremely complex components cannot always be easily produced, thus, limiting the potential weight-saving and performance benefits that could be achieved otherwise. Electrically-assisted manufacturing (EAM) is an emerging manufacturing technique that has been proven capable of significantly increasing the formability of many automotive alloys, hence the "electroplastic effect". In this technique, electricity can be applied in many ways (e.g., pulsed, cycled, or continuous) to metals undergoing different types of deformation (e.g., compression, tension, and bending). When applied, the electricity lowers the required deformation forces, increases part displacement or elongation and can reduce or eliminate springback in formed parts. Within this study, the effects of EAM on the bending of 304 Stainless Steel sheet metal will be characterized and modeled for different die widths and electrical flux densities. In previous works, EAM has proven to be highly successful on this particular material. Comparison of three-point bending force profiles for nonelectrical baseline tests and various EAM tests will help to illustrate electricity's effectiveness. An electroplastic bending coefficient will be introduced and used for modeling an electrically-assisted (EA) bending process. Additionally, the springback reductions attained from EAM will be quantified and compared. From this work, a better overall understanding of the effects and benefits of EAM on bending processes will be explained.

In this research, the frictional behavior of N-BK7, an oxide glass, at elevated temperatures in contact with polished and coated tungsten carbide (WC) material and under conditions similar to the PGM process has been studied. The experimental results show that the friction coefficient between a polished and coated WC mold and N-BK7, which is a typical material for glass molding, and in conditions similar to those used in the PGM process ramps up to 0.7 and then levels off around 0.6 with a smooth transition, meaning that there is not a specific point to differentiate between static and dynamic friction. The friction coefficient of 0.6 is reported in literature for best fitting in micro lens molding simulation. Moreover, increasing the temperature in the transition regime in the mold/glass interface causes the friction force to increase which is in good agreement with the data published for the friction between soft polymeric material and metal in the transition regime.

In Ca-3(Co,Zn)(4)O9-z, which has a misfit layered structure, Zn was found to substitute in the Co site to a limit of Ca-3(Co3.8Zn0.2)O9-z. The compound Ca-3(Co,Zn)(2)O6-z, (n=1 member of the homologous series, Can+2(Co,Z(n))(n)(Co,Zn)'O3n+3-z) consists of one-dimensional parallel (Co,Zn)(2)O-6(6)- chains that are built from successive alternating face-sharing (Co,Zn)O-6 trigonal prisms and 'n' units of (Co,Zn)O-6 octahedra along the hexagonal c-axis. Zn substitutes in the Co site of Ca3Co2O6 to a small amount of approximately Ca-3(Co1.95Zn0.05)O6-z. In the ZnO-CoOz system, Zn substitutes in the tetrahedral co site of Co3O4 to the maximum amount of (Co2.49Zn0.51)O4-z and Co substitutes in the Zn site of ZnO to (Zn0.94Co0.06)O. The crystal structures of (Co2.7Zn0.3)04-z, (Zn0.94Co0.06)O, and Ca-3(Co-1.95 Zn-0.05)(06-z) are described. Despite the Ca-3(Co, Zn)(2)O6-z, series having reasonably high Seebeck coefficients and relatively low thermal conductivity, the electrical resistivity values of its members are too high to achieve high figure of merit, ZT.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD). Raman, and photoluminescence (PL) were carried out to investigate the structural and the optical properties of ZnO thin films on PS. The surface morphology of the ZnO thin films on PS exhibits an island structure. Nanosized craters were formed on the surfaces of the ZnO thin films by the post-annealing. lit comparison with the ZnO thin films on Si, a higher and a narrower (002) diffraction peak was observed front the ZnO thin films on PS, and their residual stress was relaxed. By the post-annealing, the crystallinity of the ZnO thin films on PS was further enhanced, and the residual stress was further relaxed.

However, we know very little about the manifestation and consequences of PTSD in more complicated patient populations. The purpose of the current paper is to provide a comprehensive review of PTSD within the context of severe mental illness (SMI; i.e., schizophrenia spectrum disorders, mood disorders). Extant data suggest that trauma and PTSD are highly prevalent among individuals with SMI relative to the general population, and both are associated with adverse clinical functioning and increased healthcare burden. However, trauma and PTSD remain overlooked in this population, with low recognition rates in public-sector settings. Additionally, there are few data on the clinical course and treatment of PTSD among individuals with SMI. Particularly lacking are longitudinal studies, randomized controlled treatment trials, and studies using ethno-racially diverse samples. Furthermore, there is a need to better understand the interplay between trauma. PTSD, and severe forms of mental illness and to further develop and disseminate evidence-based PTSD treatments in this population. The current state of the literature and future directions for practice are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.									56	1	0	16	1	58			0272-7358			WOS:000293676800001	21596012

Two variants of the Zr-B potentials have been obtained, and one for Hf-B. The potentials have been tested against a variety of properties of the compound, with the conclusion that they are stable and provide a reasonable representation of the desired properties of the two diborides.

We use Symbolic Transfer Functions (STF), developed by the authors for modeling stochastic input/output systems whose inputs and outputs are both purely symbolic. We apply STF to our problem by assuming that the input symbols represent regions of space through which a track is passing while the output represents specific linear functions that more precisely model the behavior of the track. A target's behavior is modeled at two levels of precision: The symbolic model provides a probability distribution on the next region of space and behavior (linear function) that a vehicle will execute, while the continuous model predicts the position of the vehicle using classical statistical methods. The following results are presented: (i) An algorithm that parsimoniously partitions the space of the vehicle and models the behavior in the partitions with linear functions. (ii) A demonstration of our approach using real-world ship track data.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0018-9286			WOS:000293750600017

Many single-gene traits have been well-characterized at the genomic level, and recent advances in whole-genome association studies will allow for better understanding of complex, multigenic hereditary diseases. Additionally, the dog serves as an invaluable large animal model for assessment of novel therapeutic agents. Thus, the dog has filled a crucial step in the translation of basic research to new treatment regimens for various human diseases. Four well-characterized diseases in canine models are discussed as they relate to other animal model availability, novel therapeutic approach, and extrapolation to human gene therapy trials.									11	0	0	10	0	11			0938-8990			WOS:000293639500009	21732191

This paper investigates the use of the functional basis, a function vocabulary developed to aid in communication and archiving of product function information, in describing consumer products that have been decomposed, analyzed, modeled functionally, and stored in a Web-based design repository. The frequency of use of function terms and phrases in 11 graphical and 110 list-based representations in the repository is examined and used to analyze the organization and expressiveness of the functional basis and function models. Within the context of reverse engineering, we determined that the modeling resolution provided by the hierarchical levels, especially the tertiary level, is inadequate for function modeling; the tertiary terms are inappropriate for capturing sufficient details desired by modelers for archiving and reuse, and there is a need for a more expressive flow terms and flow qualifiers in the vocabulary. A critical comparison is also presented of two representations in the design repository: function structures and function lists. The conclusions are used to identify new research opportunities, including the extension of the vocabulary to incorporate flow qualifiers in addition to more expressive terms.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0890-0604			WOS:000293378000005

We also present a forward model describing the 2D interferograms. To investigate the robustness and accuracy of the analysis, we perform several Monte Carlo simulations using this forward model for an FPI that has recently been developed and deployed to northeastern Brazil. The first simulation shows that a slight cross-contamination at high temperatures exists between neighboring orders in the interferogram, introducing a bias in the estimated temperatures and increasing errors in both the estimated temperatures and winds when each order is analyzed in full. The second simulation investigates how using less than an entire order in the analysis reduces the cross contamination observed in the first set of simulations, improving the accuracy of the estimated temperatures. The last simulation investigates the effect of the signal-to-noise ratio on the errors in the estimated parameters. It is shown that, for the specific FPI simulated in this study, a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5 is required to obtain thermospheric wind errors of 5m/s and temperature errors of 20 K.

An Information-Processing Approach for Evaluating In-Store Retail Operational Design Strategies								DECISION SCIENCES				42	3			619	653		10.1111/j.1540-5915.2011.00325.x			AUG 2011	2011	We develop a model to evaluate retail store operational design strategies using an information-processing perspective of organizational design. We propose that three model constructs pertaining to in-store shopper task uncertainty-the product mix complexity, the service production complexity, and the product mix changeover-create shopper encounter information requirements (IR). These requirements can be met using specific retail service operational design choices for managing shopper encounters, namely, designing layouts for self-service (SS) and providing employees with task empowerment (TE). The model is then operationalized using a two-stage approach to develop new multi-item, measurement scales. The psychometric properties and predictive validity of the scales and model are then confirmed by using structural equation modeling with survey data from 175 merchandise retail store managers. We find that our model can be generically applied across the retail industry to understand how shopper encounter IR motivate retailer store design choices and can be used to determine whether to design stores for SS or to provide store employees with TE. We then evaluate the efficacy of the studied store design choices on customer delivery satisfaction, and offer some suggestions for future research. [Submitted: December 31, 2009.

Secular Changes in Craniofacial Morphology of the Portuguese Using Geometric Morphometrics								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY				145	4			548	559		10.1002/ajpa.21531			AUG 2011	2011	This study examines patterns of secular change in cranial morphology in the New Lisbon collection, a documented skeletal collection from Lisbon, Portugal with birth years from 1806 to 1954. This period represents a time when Lisbon was undergoing increased urbanization and population growth, as well as changes in mortality and fertility patterns. Previous studies from the U.S., Europe, and Japan have reported significant secular changes in cranial morphology over the past 200 years. In the current study, secular changes were analyzed using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics methods. The results from this study demonstrate a significant change in cranial morphology over the roughly 150-year period. Allometry was rejected as a causal factor of this change because there was no association found between temporal change and size. The pattern of temporal change is similar to that observed in other populations in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, including decreased facial breadth and a more inferiorly placed cranial base. This study, along with previous research, suggests a similar pattern of change occurs in genetically and geographically diverse populations experiencing modern environmental conditions. We argue that because the secular changes are focused in the cranial base, a region of the skull that experiences a relatively early growth curve, changes related to declines in childhood morbidity and mortality are likely important factors related to the observed changes.

Biohydrogenation of Linolenic Acid to Stearic Acid by the Rumen Microbial Population Yields Multiple Intermediate Conjugated Diene Isomers								JOURNAL OF NUTRITION				141	8			1445	1450		10.3945/jn.111.138396			AUG 2011	2011	The current literature suggests that linolenic acid biohydrogenation converts to stearic acid without the formation of CLA. However, a multitude of CLA were identified in the rumen that are generally attributed to linoleic acid biohydrogenation. This study used a stable isotope tracer to investigate the biohydrogenation intermediates of (13)C-linolenic acid, including CLA. A continuous culture fermenter was used to maintain a mixed microbial population obtained from the rumen of cattle at pH 6.5 for 6 d. The mixed fermenter contents were then transferred to batch cultures containing either (13)C-labeled or unlabeled linolenic acid, which were run in triplicate for 0, 3, 24, and 48 h. The (13)C enrichment was determined by GC-MS. After 48 h of incubation, 8 CLA isomers were significantly enriched, suggesting that these CLA isomers originated directly from linolenic acid. The cis-10, cis-12 CLA isomer exhibited the highest enrichment (21.7%), followed by cis-9, cis-11 and trans-8, trans-10 CLA. The enrichment of these 2 CLA isomers ranged from 20.1 to 21.1% and the remaining 5 CLA including cis-9, trans-11 CLA were <15.0%. A multitude of nonconjugated and partially conjugated 18:2 and 18:3 isomers was enriched during the 48 h of incubation. The results of this study confirm that mixed ruminal microbes are capable of the formation of several CLA and 18:3 isomers from linolenic acid, indicating that linolenic acid biohydrogenation pathways are more complex than previously reported.

A VOLUME-LIMITED PHOTOMETRIC SURVEY OF 114 gamma DORADUS CANDIDATES								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				142	2					39	10.1088/0004-6256/142/2/39			AUG 2011	2011	We have carried out a photometric survey of a complete, volume-limited sample of gamma Doradus candidates. The sample was extracted from the Hipparcos catalog and consists of 114 stars with colors and absolute magnitudes within the range of known gamma Doradus stars and that also lie within a specified volume of 266,600 pc(3). We devoted one year of observing time with our T12 0.8 m automatic photometric telescope to acquire nightly observations of the complete sample of stars. From these survey observations, we identify 37 stars with intrinsic variability of 0.002 mag or more. Of these 37 variables, 8 have already been confirmed as gamma Doradus stars in our earlier papers; we scheduled the remaining 29 variables on our T3 0.4 m automatic telescope to acquire more intensive observations over the next two years. As promising new gamma Doradus candidates were identified from the photometry, we obtained complementary spectroscopic observations of each candidate with the Kitt Peak coude feed telescope. Analysis of our new photometric and spectroscopic data reveals 15 new gamma Doradus variables (and confirms two others), 8 new delta Scuti variables (and confirms one other), and 3 new variables with unresolved periodicity. Therefore, of the 114 gamma Doradus candidates in our volume-limited sample, we find 25 stars that are new or previously known gamma Doradus variables. This results in an incidence of 22% for. Doradus variability among candidate field stars for this volume of the solar neighborhood. The corresponding space density of gamma Doradus stars in this volume of space is 0.094 stars per 10(3) pc(3) or 94 stars per 10(6) pc(3). We provide an updated list of 86 bright, confirmed, gamma Doradus field stars.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0004-6256			WOS:000292888200006

The literature contains examples of such damage occurring during actual earthquakes, significantly impacting the functionality of the pipelines. Detecting the location of the damage and the extent of the damage in pipelines can significantly accelerate post-earthquake repair efforts. In this paper, electrical sensing methods, magnetic sensing, and acoustic emission are used to monitor structural damage in a segmental concrete pipeline during a large-scale test. In this test, the segmental concrete pipeline was subjected to a concentrated transverse permanent ground displacements (PGDs). The majority of the damage to the pipe segments was localized at the joints, especially the bell sections while the damage to the spigots was minimal. The damage extended away from the joints in the pipe segments in the immediate vicinity of the fault line. Telescoping (i.e., crushing of the bell-and-spigot) was a primary mode of failure that was observed. The results of this study indicate that electrical sensing methods (including the use of conductive grout), magnetic sensing, and acoustic emission, employed alone or in combination, can detect and quantify the damage in segmental concrete pipelines.

J	Quarles, C. Derrick, Jr.; Marcus, R. Kenneth; Brumaghim, Julia L.								Competitive binding of Fe3+, Cr3+, and Ni2+ to transferrin								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				16	6			913	921		10.1007/s00775-011-0792-9			AUG 2011	2011	Competitive binding of Fe3+, Cr3+, and Ni2+ to transferrin (Tf) was investigated at various physiological iron to Tf concentration ratios. Loading percentages for these metal ions are based on a two M (n+) to one Tf (i.e., 100% loading) stoichiometry and were determined using a particle beam/hollow cathode-optical emission spectroscopy (PB/HC-OES) method. Serum iron concentrations typically found in normal, iron-deficient, iron-deficient from chronic disease, iron-deficient from inflammation, and iron-overload conditions were used to determine the effects of iron concentration on iron loading into Tf. The PB/HC-OES method allows the monitoring of metal ions in competition with Fe3+ for Tf binding. Iron-overload concentrations impeded the ability of chromium (15.0 mu M) or nickel (10.3 mu M) to load completely into Tf. Low Fe3+ uptake by Tf under iron-deficient or chronic disease iron concentrations limited Ni2+ loading into Tf. Competitive binding kinetic studies were performed with Fe3+, Cr3+, and Ni2+ to determine percentages of metal ion uptake into Tf as a function of time. The initial rates of Fe3+ loading increased in the presence of nickel or chromium, with maximal Fe3+ loading into Tf in all cases reaching approximately 24%. Addition of Cr3+ to 50% preloaded Fe3+-Tf showed that excess chromium (15.0 mu M) displaced roughly 13% of Fe3+ from Tf, resulting in 7.6 +/- A 1.3% Cr3+ loading of Tf. The PB/HC-OES method provides the ability to monitor multiple metal ions competing for Tf binding and will help to understand metal competition for Tf binding.									10	0	0	8	0	10			0949-8257			WOS:000292887500010	21678080

At the same time, numerous nsSNPs (nonsynonomous SNP) have been reported in the CLIC2 gene in healthy individuals indicating that the CLIC2 protein can tolerate amino acid substitutions and be fully functional. To test the possibility that p.H101Q is a disease-causing mutation, we performed in silico simulations to calculate the effects of the p.H101Q mutation on CLIC2 stability, dynamics, and ionization states while comparing the effects obtained for presumably harmless nsSNPs. It was found that p.H101Q, in contrast with other nsSNPs, (a) lessens the flexibility of the joint loop which is important for the normal function of CLIC2, (b) makes the overall 3D structure of CLIC2 more stable and thus reduces the possibility of the large conformational change expected to occur when CLIC2 moves from a soluble to membrane form, and (c) removes the positively charged residue, H101, which may be important for the membrane association of CLIC2. The results of in silico modeling, in conjunction with the polymorphism analysis, suggest that p.H101Q may be a disease-causing mutation, the first one suggested in the CLIC family.									18	0	0	15	0	18			0887-3585			WOS:000292925200008	21630357

The "Back to Sleep" program was implemented in 1992 to promote supine sleeping in efforts to prevent SIDS. Along with this implementation came several consequences that are avoidable in infants. The purposes of this article are to describe the Back to Sleep program and its intended purpose, to identify the adverse consequences, and to develop a teaching program for nurse practitioners to use with parents that will both promote safe sleeping and reduce the untoward consequences of the back to sleep program while maintaining the integrity of the SIDS prevention advice.

The intent of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which PUFAs affect the response to anticancer chemotherapy.Methods: Human colorectal cancer cell line Caco-2 was used as a model system in this study. Caco-2 cells were treated with different concentrations of three PUFAs: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine mdr1 gene (codes for P-glycoprotein [P-gp]) expression. Western blotting and calcein-acetoxymethylester efflux assay were used for P-gp expression and functional evaluation, respectively. Furthermore, apoptosis assay was conducted by adding PUFAs with paclitaxel to confirm the synergetic effect. Finally, gene expression of nuclear receptors CAR and PXR were estimated to evaluate the possible mechanisms.Results: Both classes of PUFAs, omega-3 (omega-3) and omega-6 (omega-6), can cause a modest but very reproducible reduction of gene expression, protein production, and pump activity of MDR1. Incubation of cells with PUFAs greatly enhanced the cytotoxicity of the anticancer drug paclitaxel, manifested mainly through enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, PUFAs increased the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of the nuclear receptors CAR and PXR, thus implicating these two transcription factors as cellular targets of PUFAs in cells but not directly affecting MDR1 regulation.Conclusions: Our results suggest that inhibition of the multidrug resistance MDR1/P-gp is one mechanism through which dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids exert a synergetic effect on the response of tumor cells to anticancer drugs.									24	1	0	15	0	25			0731-5724			WOS:000208685400006	21917707	
J	Gacchina, Carmen; Brothers, Thomas; Ramamurthi, Anand								Evaluating Smooth Muscle Cells from CaCl2-Induced Rat Aortal Expansions as a Surrogate Culture Model for Study of Elastogenic Induction of Human Aneurysmal Cells								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A				17	15-16			1945	1958		10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0475			AUG 2011	2011	Regression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) via regeneration of new elastic matrix is constrained by poor elastin synthesis by adult vascular cells and absence of methods to stimulate the same. We recently showed hyaluronan oligomers (HA-o) and TGF-beta 1 (termed elastogenic factors) to enhance elastin synthesis and matrix formation by healthy rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). We also determined that these factors could likewise elastogenically induce aneurysmal RASMCs isolated from periadventitial CaCl2-injury induced rat AAAs (aRASMCs). However, the factor doses should be increased for these diseased cell types, as even when induced, elastic matrix amounts are roughly one order of magnitude lower than those produced by healthy RASMCs. We presently investigate the dose-specific elastogenic effects of HA-o (0-20 mu g/mL) and TGF-beta 1 (0-10 ng/mL) factors on aRASMCs and compare their phenotype and elastogenic responses to those of human AAA-derived SMCs (aHASMCs); we seek to determine whether aRASMCs are appropriate surrogate cell types to study in the context of inducing elastic matrix regeneration within human AAAs. The periadventitial CaCl2-injury model of AAAs exhibits many of the pathological characteristics of human AAAs, including similarities in terms of decreased SMC contractile activity, enhanced proliferation, and reduced elastogenic capacity of aneurysmal SMCs (relative to healthy SMCs) when isolated and expanded in culture. Both aRASMCs and aHASMCs can be elastogenically stimulated by HA-o and TGF-beta 1 and show broadly similar trends in their dose-specific responses to these factors. However, compared with aHASMCs, aRASMCs appear to be far less elastogenically inducible. This may be due to differences in maturity of the AAAs studied, with the CaCl2-injury induced aortal expansion barely qualifying as an aneurysm and the human AAA representing a more well-developed condition. Further study of SMCs from stage-matched CaCl2-injury induced rat aortal expansions and human AAAs will be necessary to more rigorously evaluate their basal and induced elastogenic responses.									10	1	0	7	0	11			1937-3341			WOS:000293217700005	21417692

The process consisted of pretreatment by soaking in aqueous ammonia followed by enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis, during which the hemicellulose B was solubilized by cleavage into xylo-oligosaccharides and subsequently recovered by precipitation with ethanol. The pretreatment step resulted in high retention of major sugars and improvement of subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. The recovered hemicellulose B was hydrolyzed by a cocktail of enzymes that consisted of beta-glucosidase, pectinase, xylanase, and ferulic acid esterase (FAE). Xylanase alone was ineffective, demonstrating yields of less than 2% of xylose and arabinose. The greatest xylose and arabinose yields, 44% and 53%, respectively, were obtained by the combination of pectinase and FAE. A mass balance accounted for 87% of the initially present glucan, 91% of the xylan, and 90% of the arabinan. The developed process offered a means for production of corn fiber gum as a value-added co-product and C5 sugars, which could be converted to other valuable co-products through fermentation in a corn wet-milling biorefinery.									11	0	0	7	0	11			0273-2289			WOS:000292554500013	21399929

J	Sheffield, K. Megan; Blob, Richard W.								Loading mechanics of the femur in tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) during terrestrial locomotion								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				214	15			2603	2615		10.1242/jeb.048736			AUG 2011	2011	Salamanders are often used as representatives of the basal tetrapod body plan in functional studies, but little is known about the loads experienced by their limb bones during locomotion. Although salamanders' slow walking speeds might lead to low locomotor forces and limb bone stresses similar to those of non-avian reptiles, their highly sprawled posture combined with relatively small limb bones could produce elevated limb bone stresses closer to those of avian and mammalian species. This study evaluates the loads on the femur of the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) during terrestrial locomotion using three-dimensional measurements of the ground reaction force (GRF) and hindlimb kinematics, as well as anatomical measurements of the femur and hindlimb muscles. At peak stress (29.8 +/- 2.0% stance), the net GRF magnitude averaged 0.42. body weights and was directed nearly vertically for the middle 20-40% of the contact interval, essentially perpendicular to the femur. Although torsional shear stresses were significant (4.1 +/- 0.3MPa), bending stresses experienced by the femur were low compared with other vertebrate lineages (tensile: 14.9 +/- 0.8MPa; compressive: -18.9 +/- 1.0MPa), and mechanical property tests indicated yield strengths that were fairly standard for tetrapods (157.1 +/- 3.7MPa). Femoral bending safety factors (10.5) were considerably higher than values typical for birds and mammals, and closer to the elevated values calculated for reptilian species. These results suggest that high limb bone safety factors may have an ancient evolutionary history, though the underlying cause of high safety factors (e.g. low limb bone loads, high bone strength or a combination of the two) may vary among lineages.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0022-0949			WOS:000292694500027	21753055	
J	Sheffield, K. Megan; Butcher, Michael T.; Shugart, S. Katherine; Gander, Jennifer C.; Blob, Richard W.								Locomotor loading mechanics in the hindlimbs of tegu lizards (Tupinambis merianae): comparative and evolutionary implications								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				214	15			2616	2630		10.1242/jeb.048801			AUG 2011	2011	Skeletal elements are usually able to withstand several times their usual load before they yield, and this ratio is known as the bone's safety factor. Limited studies on amphibians and non-avian reptiles have shown that they have much higher limb bone safety factors than birds and mammals. It has been hypothesized that this difference is related to the difference in posture between upright birds and mammals and sprawling ectotherms; however, limb bone loading data from a wider range of sprawling species are needed in order to determine whether the higher safety factors seen in amphibians and non-avian reptiles are ancestral or derived conditions. Tegus (family Teiidae) are an ideal lineage with which to expand sampling of limb bone loading mechanics for sprawling taxa, particularly for lizards, because they are from a different clade than previously sampled iguanas and exhibit different foraging and locomotor habits (actively foraging carnivore versus burst-activity herbivore). We evaluated the mechanics of locomotor loading for the femur of the Argentine black and white tegu (Tupinambus merianae) using three-dimensional measurements of the ground reaction force and hindlimb kinematics, in vivo bone strains and femoral mechanical properties. Peak bending stresses experienced by the femur were low (tensile: 10.4 +/- 1.1MPa; compressive: -17.4 +/- 0.9MPa) and comparable to those in other reptiles, with moderate shear stresses and strains also present. Analyses of peak femoral stresses and strains led to estimated safety factor ranges of 8.8-18.6 in bending and 7.8-17.5 in torsion, both substantially higher than typical for birds and mammals but similar to other sprawling tetrapods. These results broaden the range of reptilian and amphibian taxa in which high femoral safety factors have been evaluated and further indicate a trend for the independent evolution of lower limb bone safety factors in endothermic taxa.									10	0	0	9	0	10			0022-0949			WOS:000292694500028	21753056

Statistical Analysis of High-Cycle Fatigue Behavior of Friction Stir Welded AA5083-H321								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				20	6			855	864		10.1007/s11665-010-9725-y			AUG 2011	2011	A review of the literature revealed that high-cycle fatigue data associated with friction stir-welded (FSW) joints of AA5083-H321 (a solid-solution-strengthened and strain-hardened/stabilized Al-Mg-Mn alloy) are characterized by a relatively large statistical scatter. This scatter is closely related to the intrinsic variability of the FSW process and to the stochastic nature of the workpiece material microstructure/properties as well as to the surface condition of the weld. Consequently, the use of statistical methods and tools in the analysis of FSW joints is highly critical. A three-step FSW-joint fatigue-strength/life statistical-analysis procedure is proposed in this study. Within the first step, the type of the most appropriate probability distribution function is identified. The parameters of the selected probability distribution function, along with their confidence limits, are computed in the second step. In the third step, a procedure is developed for assessment of the statistical significance of the effect of the FSW process parameters and fatigue specimen surface conditions. The procedure is then applied to a set of stress-amplitude versus number of cycles to failure experimental data in which the tool translational speed was varied over four levels, while the fatigue specimen surface condition was varied over two levels. The results obtained showed that a two-parameter weibull distribution function with its scale factor being dependent on the stress amplitude is the most appropriate choice for the probability distribution function. In addition, it is found that, while the tool translational speed has a first-order effect on the AA5083-H321 FSW-joint fatigue strength/life, the effect of the fatigue specimen surface condition is less pronounced.									19	0	0	0	0	19			1059-9495			WOS:000292749800003

Fluid/Structure Interaction Computational Investigation of Blast-Wave Mitigation Efficacy of the Advanced Combat Helmet								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				20	6			877	893		10.1007/s11665-010-9724-z			AUG 2011	2011	To combat the problem of traumatic brain injury (TBI), a signature injury of the current military conflicts, there is an urgent need to design head protection systems with superior blast/ballistic impact mitigation capabilities. Toward that end, the blast impact mitigation performance of an advanced combat helmet (ACH) head protection system equipped with polyurea suspension pads and subjected to two different blast peak pressure loadings has been investigated computationally. A fairly detailed (Lagrangian) finite-element model of a helmet/skull/brain assembly is first constructed and placed into an Eulerian air domain through which a single planar blast wave propagates. A combined Eulerian/Lagrangian transient nonlinear dynamics computational fluid/solid interaction analysis is next conducted in order to assess the extent of reduction in intra-cranial shock-wave ingress (responsible for TBI). This was done by comparing temporal evolutions of intra-cranial normal and shear stresses for the cases of an unprotected head and the helmet-protected head and by correlating these quantities with the three most common types of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), i.e., axonal damage, contusion, and subdural hemorrhage. The results obtained show that the ACH provides some level of protection against all investigated types of mTBI and that the level of protection increases somewhat with an increase in blast peak pressure. In order to rationalize the aforementioned findings, a shockwave propagation/reflection analysis is carried out for the unprotected head and helmet-protected head cases. The analysis qualitatively corroborated the results pertaining to the blast-mitigation efficacy of an ACH, but also suggested that there are additional shockwave energy dissipation phenomena which play an important role in the mechanical response of the unprotected/protected head to blast impact.									30	0	0	4	0	30			1059-9495			WOS:000292749800005

For inference about efficiency of a single, fixed point, drawing bootstrap pseudo-samples of size m < n provides consistent inference, although coverages are quite sensitive to the choice of subsample size m. We provide a probabilistic framework in which these methods are shown to valid for statistics comprised of functions of DEA or FDH estimators. We examine a simple, data-based rule for selecting m suggested by Politis et al. (Stat Sin 11:1105-1124, 2001), and provide Monte Carlo evidence on the size and power of our tests. Our methods (i) allow for heterogeneity in the inefficiency process, and unlike previous methods, (ii) do not require multivariate kernel smoothing, and (iii) avoid the need for solutions of intermediate linear programs.									28	0	0	1	0	28			0895-562X			WOS:000292554100003

In previous studies, we showed that platelet adhesion response to adsorbed Fg and Alb was strongly influenced by the degree of adsorption-induced protein unfolding and that platelet adhesion was only partially blocked by soluble RGD, with RGD-blocked platelets adhering without activation. Based on these results, we hypothesized that in addition to the RGD-specific GPIIb/IIIa receptor, which mediates both adhesion and activation, a non-RGD-specific receptor set likely also plays a role in platelet adhesion (but not activation) to both Fg and albumin (Alb). To identify and elucidate the role of these receptors, in addition to GPIIb/IIIa, we also examined the GPIb-IX-V receptor complex, which has been shown to mediate platelet adhesion (but not activation) in studies by other groups. The platelet suspension was pretreated with either a GPIIb/IIIa-antagonist drug Aggrastat (R) or monoclonal antibodies 6134 or 24G10 against GPIb-IX-V prior to adhesion on Fg- and Alb-coated OH- and CH(3)-functionalized alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer surfaces. The results revealed that GPIIb/IIIa is the primary receptor set involved in platelet adhesion to adsorbed Fg and Alb irrespective of their degree of adsorption-induced unfolding, while the GPIb-IX-V receptor complex plays an insignificant role. Overall, these studies provide novel insights into the molecular-level mechanisms mediating platelet interactions with adsorbed plasma proteins, thereby assisting the biomaterials field develop potent strategies for inhibiting platelet-protein interactions in the design of more hemocompatible cardiovascular biomaterials and effective anti-thrombotic therapies.

J	Zhang, Jack Z.; Hongsirikarn, Kitiya; Goodwin, James G., Jr.								The effect of low concentrations of CO on H-2 adsorption and activation on Pt/C: Part 2-In the presence of H2O vapor								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				196	15			6186	6195		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.048			AUG 1 2011	2011	CO affects H-2 activation on supported Pt in the catalyst layers of a PEMFC and significantly degrades overall fuel cell performance. This paper establishes a more fundamental understanding of the effect of humidity on CO poisoning of Pt/C at typical fuel cell conditions (80 degrees C, 2 atm). In this work, direct measurements of hydrogen surface concentration on Pt/C were performed utilizing an H-2-D-2 switch with Ar purge (HDSAP). The presence of water vapor decreased the rate of CO adsorption on Pt, but had very little effect on the resulting CO surface coverage on Pts (theta(CO)) at steady-state. The steady-state theta(CO)s at 80 degrees C for Pt exposed to H-2 (P-H2 = 1 atm) and a mixture of H-2/H2O (1 atm H-2, 10%RH) were 0.70 and 0.66 ML, respectively. Furthermore, total strongly bound surface hydrogen measured after exposure to H-2/H2O was, surprisingly, the sum of the exchangeable surface hydrogen contributed by each component, even in the presence of CO. In the absence of any evidence for strong chemisorption of H2O on the carbon support with/without Pt, this additive nature and seemingly lack of interaction from the co-adsorption of H-2 and H2O on Pt may be explained by the repulsion of strongly adsorbed H2O to the stepped-terrace interface at high coverages of surface hydrogen.

The 3D model utilizes a finite differencing (FD) heat transfer algorithm, complemented with experimental boundary conditions. The experimental setup is configured to acquire the battery current, voltage, and its inner and surface temperatures in discrete and in full-field scans. The power-split hybrid configuration is tested using a standard and artificial driving cycles. A battery resistance model is then used to couple the experimental boundary conditions with the finite differencing code, which employed a cell-based internal heat generation model to describe the pack chemical reaction mechanism. This study presents a complete analysis based on battery current and voltage in relation to vehicle speed. The proposed model also predicts the powertrain spatial and temporal temperature profiles in agreement with the vehicle actual conditions as indicated by the On-Board Diagnosis (OBD) module.

Only a few resistance sources have been found in apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.), and most studies have located a major PPV resistance locus (PPVres) on linkage group 1 (LG1). However, the mapping accuracy was not sufficiently reliable and PPVres was predicted within a low confidence interval. In this study, we have constructed two high-density simple sequence repeat (SSR) improved maps with 0.70 and 0.68 markers/cm, corresponding to LG1 of 'Lito' and 'Goldrich' PPV-resistant cultivars, respectively. Using these maps, and excluding genotype-phenotype incongruent individuals, a new binary trait locus (BTL) analysis for PPV resistance was performed, narrowing down the PPVres support intervals to 7.3 and 5.9 cm in 'Lito' and 'Goldrich', respectively. Subsequently, 71 overlapping oligonucleotides (overgo) probes were hybridized against an apricot bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library, identifying 870 single BACs from which 340 were anchored onto a map region of approximately 30-40 cm encompassing PPVres. Partial BAC contigs assigned to the two allelic haplotypes (resistant/susceptible) of the PPVres locus were built by high-information content fingerprinting (HICF). In addition, a total of 300 BAC-derived sequences were obtained, and 257 showed significant homology with the peach genome scaffold_1 corresponding to LG1. According to the peach syntenic genome sequence, PPVres was predicted within a region of 2.16 Mb in which a few candidate resistance genes were identified.									13	0	0	12	0	13			1464-6722	1364-3703		WOS:000292309700002		
J	Young, Frank W.; Robinson, Kenneth								An Ecological Regional Analysis of South Carolina								SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH				103	1			109	117		10.1007/s11205-010-9699-z			AUG 2011	2011	This study of the counties of South Carolina introduces a limited purpose, modifiable technology that is designed to reproduce the rapid discovery strategy of the natural sciences. It uses factor analysis to identify types of communities and the threats they face, and evaluates their success in dealing with these by comparisons based on age-adjusted mortality rates. The factor analysis of mostly census indicators generated an Urbanization factor along with two measures of the interaction with the environment, Growth and Poverty. Growth was expected to predict mortality negatively while Poverty should predict positively. Regression analysis confirms both predictions but only for each race. That is, Growth predicted lower mortality, but only for African-Americans. Poverty predicted higher mortality, but only for whites. These and other puzzling findings are explored, illustrating the "rapid discovery" technology that is the central feature of this paper.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0303-8300			WOS:000291653900007

Comparison of test specimen preparation techniques for pervious concrete pavements								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				25	8			3480	3485		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.03.039			AUG 2011	2011	The objective of this study was to evaluate different pervious concrete test specimen preparation techniques in an effort to produce specimens having properties similar to in-place pervious concrete pavement. Cylinders and slabs were cast using pervious concrete from three different paving projects using different procedures. The comparisons of cast specimens to pavement cores were based on infiltration rate, density, and porosity. Of the cylinder consolidation procedures tested, the standard Proctor hammer provided the least variability of results and yielded properties similar to the in-place pavement. However, 600 mm square slabs were even more consistent with the in-place pavement density and porosity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jun, Jungwook; Guensler, Randall; Ogle, Jennifer								Differences in observed speed patterns between crash-involved and crash-not-involved drivers: Application of in-vehicle monitoring technology								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES				19	4			569	578		10.1016/j.trc.2010.09.005			AUG 2011	2011	Due to the lack of data collection systems in previous studies, it is not clear whether driving speed patterns in everyday conditions of crash-involved drivers were really different from those of crash-not-involved drivers. This study evaluated these differences through various potential speed metrics created from longitudinally-measured GPS speed data of light-duty vehicles. As a result, this study found that at most times (spatially and temporally), drivers who had crash experiences tended to drive at higher speeds than crash-not-involved drivers except in freeway travels during a.m. peak hours. Crash-involved drivers also showed higher tendencies of non-compliance with the posted speed limit. In addition, this study confirmed that the speed difference might or might not be obtained, depending on which speed metrics are applied, so researchers needed to select specified speed metrics based on roadway types and trip start times to better understand the speed patterns of drivers. Finally, the result suggests that there is a real potential to identify at-risk drivers based on data obtained from in-vehicle data collection technologies for driver education, re-training programs, or pay-as-you-drive insurance programs. Much effort needs to be devoted to this application in future research. An observational study with more samples in the future would provide better interpretations about the speed patterns of individual drivers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zheng, Liqiu; Marinescu, D. C.								Helical antiferromagnetic ordering in the lowest Landau level of a semiconductor superlattice								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				84	3					035327	10.1103/PhysRevB.84.035327			JUL 29 2011	2011	When subjected to a tilted magnetic field, the ground state of a semiconductor superlattice (SL) with two identical quantum wells per unit cell is shown to exhibit different magnetic configurations that are dependent on the strength and direction of the field and the SL characteristics. Intra- and interunit cell tunneling between the wells, assumed to be infinitely attractive, generate an energy miniband structure of the lowest Landau level that, in cooperation with the Zeeman splitting, creates, at certain points in the momentum space, an energy difference between opposite-spin single-particle states that can be overcome by the Coulomb interaction. Within the Hartree-Fock approximation, we show that the minimum free energy is reached in ground states with different magnetic characteristics: ferromagnetic, helical antiferromagnetic (HAFM) or paramagnetic, depending on the system parameters and the external field. The HAFM phase results from an antiferromagnetic coupling of opposite electron spins that are rotated in respect to the (z) over cap axis by an angle that varies continuously within the Brillouin zone between [0,pi/2]. As a result, a finite polarization is registered in real space. The self-consistent equation satisfied by the inclination angle is solved numerically at T = 0 K for an array of SL parameters. Its solutions demonstrate that a continuous driven transition between ferromagnetic, HAFM, and paramagnetic states can be realized by adjusting the parameters of the system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1098-0121			WOS:000293304200017

Such a region can be approached with next-generation whole-genome sequencing and assembly as if it were an independent small genome. Using the minimum tiling path as a guide, specific BAC clones representing the prioritized genomic interval are selected, pooled, and used to prepare a sequencing library.Results: This pooled BAC approach was taken to sequence and assemble a QTL-rich region, of similar to 3 Mbp and represented by twenty-seven BACs, on linkage group 5 of the Theobroma cacao cv. Matina 1-6 genome. Using various mixtures of read coverages from paired-end and linear 454 libraries, multiple assemblies of varied quality were generated. Quality was assessed by comparing the assembly of 454 reads with a subset of ten BACs individually sequenced and assembled using Sanger reads. A mixture of reads optimal for assembly was identified. We found, furthermore, that a quality assembly suitable for serving as a reference genome template could be obtained even with a reduced depth of sequencing coverage. Annotation of the resulting assembly revealed several genes potentially responsible for three T. cacao traits: black pod disease resistance, bean shape index, and pod weight.Conclusions: Our results, as with other pooled BAC sequencing reports, suggest that pooling portions of a minimum tiling path derived from a BAC-based physical map is an effective method to target sub-genomic regions for sequencing. While we focused on a single QTL region, other QTL regions of importance could be similarly sequenced allowing for biological discovery to take place before a high quality whole-genome assembly is completed.									8	0	0	7	0	8			1471-2164			WOS:000293750300001	21794110

Such excitations are known to obey non-Abelian statistics in two dimensions, and are thus relevant to topological quantum computation (TQC). In a one-dimensional system, Majorana states are localized to phase boundaries. In order to bypass the constraints of one dimension, a wire network may be created, allowing the exchange of Majoranas by way of junctions in the network. Alicea et al. have proposed such a network as a platform for TQC, showing that the Majorana bound states obey non-Abelian exchange statistics even in quasi-one-dimensional systems.(1) Here we show that the particular realization of non-Abelian statistics produced in a Majorana wire network is highly dependent on the local properties of individual wire junctions. For a simply connected network, the possible realizations can be characterized by the chirality of individual junctions. There is in general no requirement for junction chiralities to remain consistent across a wire network. We show how the chiralities of different junctions may be compared experimentally and discuss the implications for TQC in Majorana wire networks.									42	0	0	3	0	42			1098-0121			WOS:000293128900003

The results of single factor design revealed that the concentration of feather at 20 g/l and the initial pH at value 8 was the best for the production of keratinase and the degradation of feather. Ammonia salt and nitrate salt strongly restricted the production of keratinase and the degradation of feather. Result of Box-Behnken design (BBD) experiment which was used to optimize concentrations of glucose, corn steep flour and K2HPO4 for further improvement of keratinase productivity showed that the optimal medium was composed of glucose (20 g/l), corn steep flour (7.5 g/l), K2HPO4 (1 g/l) and feather (20 g/l). The result of submerged batch cultivation of B. licheniformis ZJUEL31410 in the 5 L fermentor indicated that the optimal medium had the highest keratinase and the degree of feather degradation (DFD) at 54.9 U/ml and 72.4%; both were 5 times more than the basal medium. The degradation of feather was verified by the analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This study provides a foundation for the production of keratinase and the conversion of feather to soluble protein through submerged fermentation process by B. licheniformis ZJUEL31410.									6	0	0	6	1	6			1684-5315			WOS:000294673800016

Calculation of Phase Diagrams (CalPhaD) methods and Miedema-type statistical interfacial thermodynamic models are combined to forecast the formation and stability of subsolidus quasiliquid GB phases in binary alloys. This work supports a long-range scientific goal of developing "GB (phase) diagrams" as a new materials science tool to help controlling the materials fabrication processing and resultant materials properties. Using nickel-doped molybdenum as a model system, a type of GB diagram (called "lambda diagram") is computed to represent the temperature-and composition-dependent thermodynamic tendency for general GBs to disorder. Subsequently, controlled sintering experiments are conducted to estimate the GB diffusivity as a function of temperature and overall composition, and the experimental results correlate well with the computed GB diagram. Although they are not yet rigorous GB-phase diagrams with well-defined transition lines, the predictability and usefulness of such lambda diagrams are demonstrated. Related interfacial thermodynamic models and computational approaches are discussed.									22	0	0	1	0	22			1098-0121			WOS:000292923800003

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH				5	14			1717	1722					JUL 18 2011	2011	The use of microbes in pest control is an important aspect of integrated pest management (IPM). A Zimbabwean isolate of the fungal entomopathogen Zoophthora radicans was tested for efficacy in the control of Brassica infesting lepidopteran larvae. Z. radicans caused 98.68% mortality on small (1(st) - 2(nd) instar) diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.) larvae and 21.34% mortality on large (3(rd) - 4(th) instar) diamondback moth (DBM) larvae 6 days after treatment. Z. radicans was not effective against larvae of Helicoverpa armigera, webworm (Hellula undalis), cabbage moth (Crocidolomia sp.) and cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni). There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in adult Cotesia plutellae emergence from cocoons treated with Z. radicans and cocoons sprayed with water. There was 95% emergence of C. plutellae adults from cocoons treated with Dimethoate 40 EC. No adults of C. plutellae emerged from cocoons treated with Carbaryl 75 WP, Malathion 25 WP and Malathion 50 EC. The study showed that Z. radicans was effective against early instar DBM larvae and did not have adverse impacts on the emergence of C. plutellae adults from cocoons and Diaeretiella rapae adults from aphid mummies.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1996-0808			WOS:000297671800002		
J	Saski, Christopher A.; Li, Zhigang; Feltus, Frank A.; Luo, Hong								New genomic resources for switchgrass: a BAC library and comparative analysis of homoeologous genomic regions harboring bioenergy traits								BMC GENOMICS				12						369	10.1186/1471-2164-12-369			JUL 18 2011	2011	Background: Switchgrass, a C4 species and a warm-season grass native to the prairies of North America, has been targeted for development into an herbaceous biomass fuel crop. Genetic improvement of switchgrass feedstock traits through marker-assisted breeding and biotechnology approaches calls for genomic tools development. Establishment of integrated physical and genetic maps for switchgrass will accelerate mapping of value added traits useful to breeding programs and to isolate important target genes using map based cloning. The reported polyploidy series in switchgrass ranges from diploid (2X = 18) to duodecaploid (12X = 108). Like in other large, repeat-rich plant genomes, this genomic complexity will hinder whole genome sequencing efforts. An extensive physical map providing enough information to resolve the homoeologous genomes would provide the necessary framework for accurate assembly of the switchgrass genome.Results: A switchgrass BAC library constructed by partial digestion of nuclear DNA with EcoRI contains 147,456 clones covering the effective genome approximately 10 times based on a genome size of 3.2 Gigabases (similar to 1.6 Gb effective). Restriction digestion and PFGE analysis of 234 randomly chosen BACs indicated that 95% of the clones contained inserts, ranging from 60 to 180 kb with an average of 120 kb. Comparative sequence analysis of two homoeologous genomic regions harboring orthologs of the rice OsBRI1 locus, a low-copy gene encoding a putative protein kinase and associated with biomass, revealed that orthologous clones from homoeologous chromosomes can be unambiguously distinguished from each other and correctly assembled to respective fingerprint contigs. Thus, the data obtained not only provide genomic resources for further analysis of switchgrass genome, but also improve efforts for an accurate genome sequencing strategy.Conclusions: The construction of the first switchgrass BAC library and comparative analysis of homoeologous harboring OsBRI1 orthologs present a glimpse into the switchgrass genome structure and complexity. Data obtained demonstrate the feasibility of using HICF fingerprinting to resolve the homoeologous chromosomes of the two distinct genomes in switchgrass, providing a robust and accurate BAC-based physical platform for this species. The genomic resources and sequence data generated will lay the foundation for deciphering the switchgrass genome and lead the way for an accurate genome sequencing strategy.									15	0	0	13	0	15			1471-2164			WOS:000294115000001	21767393

These compounds crystallize in the space group R3m, and the unit cell parameters are a = 10.277(15) angstrom and c = 8.484(17) angstrom for land a = 10.5615(15) angstrom and c = 8.8574(18) angstrom for 2. The structures consist of a network of [Be2B4O12(OH)] units interwoven with a network consisting of MO9 polyhedra (M = Sr, Ba) and BO3 triangles and exemplify how acentric building blocks such as [BO3](3-), [BO4](5-), and [BeO4](6-) can be especially suitable to build noncentrosymmetric long-range structures. Both networks are centered on the 3-fold rotation axis and present themselves in alternating fashion along [001]. Acentricity is imparted by the alignment of the polarities of BO3 and BeO4 environments. Infrared spectroscopy has been used to confirm the local geometries of B and Be, as well as the presence of hydroxide in the crystal structure. Another interesting feature of these compounds is the presence of disorder involving Be and B at the tetrahedral Be site. The degree of the disorder has been confirmed by observing a noticeable shortening of average Be-O bond distances.									29	0	0	1	0	29			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000292618000046	21667938

We consider a firm that faces multi-class demand and has additional capacity options that are temporary and randomly available. We formulate the model as a Markov decision process (MDP) and prove that a solution to the optimal joint control problem exists. For several special cases we characterize the structure of the optimal policy. For the general case, however, we show that the optimal policy is state-dependent, and in many instances non-monotone and difficult to implement. Therefore, we consider three pragmatic heuristic policies and assess their performance. We show that the majority of the savings originate from the ability to dynamically adjust capacity, and that a simple heuristic that can adjust production capacity (based on workload fluctuation) but uses a static production/rationing policy can result in significant savings.

Figure of merit enhancement in bismuth telluride alloys via fullerene-assisted microstructural refinement								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				110	2					023706	10.1063/1.3606547			JUL 15 2011	2011	Nanocomposite materials based on bismuth telluride with fullerene additions have been synthesized via ball milling and spark plasma sintering. The impact of fullerene addition upon the composites is studied with respect to both fullerene volume percentage and ball-mill duration. It is demonstrated that fullerenes can engage in significant microstructural refinement even when present in small quantities. The lattice thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and Hall coefficient are analyzed with a view to the impact of fullerene incorporation upon these properties. Fullerene-assisted microstructural refinement causes a decrease both in lattice thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity, but a corresponding increase in the Seebeck coefficient results in an enhancement in the figure of merit at low volume fractions.

Demographic Processes Underlying Subtle Patterns of Population Structure in the Scalloped Hammerhead Shark, Sphyrna lewini								PLOS ONE				6	7					e21459	10.1371/journal.pone.0021459			JUL 14 2011	2011	Genetic diversity (theta), effective population size (N-e), and contemporary levels of gene flow are important parameters to estimate for species of conservation concern, such as the globally endangered scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini. Therefore, we have reconstructed the demographic history of S. lewini across its Eastern Pacific (EP) range by applying classical and coalescent population genetic methods to a combination of 15 microsatellite loci and mtDNA control region sequences. In addition to significant population genetic structure and isolation-by-distance among seven coastal sites between central Mexico and Ecuador, the analyses revealed that all populations have experienced a bottleneck and that all current values of h are at least an order of magnitude smaller than ancestral theta, indicating large decreases in N-e (theta= 4N(e)mu), where mu is the mutation rate. Application of the isolation-with-migration (IM) model showed modest but significant genetic connectivity between most sampled sites (point estimates of Nm= 0.1-16.7), with divergence times (t) among all populations significantly greater than zero. Using a conservative (i.e., slow) fossil-based taxon-specific phylogenetic calibration for mtDNA mutation rates, posterior probability distributions (PPDs) for the onset of the decline in N-e predate modern fishing in this region. The cause of decline over the last several thousand years is unknown but is highly atypical as a post-glacial demographic history. Regardless of the cause, our data and analyses suggest that S. lewini was far more abundant throughout the EP in the past than at present.									14	1	0	14	1	15			1932-6203			WOS:000292811300009	21789171

Although a number of health effects are attributed to 8PN, few reports are available about the production of it. In this work, screening of fungi to efficiently transform isoxanthohumol (IXN) into 8PN was designed. The biotransformation of IXN was significantly observed in Eupenicillium javanicum, Cunninghamella blakesleana, and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora under five kinds of transformation conditions. As a comparative result of IXN transformation, E. javanicum was the optimal biocatalyst to produce 8PN. Transformation caused by growing precultured fungal mycelia, a process designated as G2, was a favorable condition for IXN transformation in view of the yield of 8PN. The possible transformation pathway of 8PN bioproduction is postulated in this work. The construction of fungus and transformation mode derived from the current work is viable and an alternative procedure for 8PN formation.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0021-8561			WOS:000292417700078	21634799	
J	Li, Xianfeng; Murthy, N. Sanjeeva; Latour, Robert A.								Construction and Validation of All-Atom Bulk-Phase Models of Amorphous Polymers Using the TIGER2/TIGER3 Empiricald Sampling Method								MACROMOLECULES				44	13			5452	5464		10.1021/ma200128c			JUL 12 2011	2011	A new empirical sampling method termed "temperature intervals with global exchange of replicas and reduced radii" (TIGER3) is presented and demonstrated to efficiently equilibrate entangled long-chain molecular systems such as amorphous polymers. The TIGER3 algorithm is a replica exchange method in which simulations are run in parallel over a range of temperature levels at and above a designated baseline temperature. The replicas sampled at temperature levels above the baseline are run through a series of cycles with each cycle containing four stages: heating, sampling, quenching, and temperature level reassignment. The method allows chain segments to pass through one another at elevated temperature levels during the sampling stage by reducing the van der Waals radii of the atoms, thus eliminating chain entanglement problems. Atomic radii are then returned to their regular values and re-equilibrated at elevated temperature prior to quenching to the baseline temperature. Following quenching, replicas are compared using a Metropolis Monte Carlo exchange process for the construction of an approximate Boltzmann-weighted ensemble of states and then reassigned to the elevated temperature levels for additional sampling. Further system equilibration is performed by periodic implementation of the previously developed TIGER2 algorithm between cycles of TIGER3, which applies thermal cycling without radii reduction. When coupled with a coarse-grained modeling approach, the combined TIGER2/TIGER3 algorithm yields fast equilibration of bulk-phase models of amorphous polymer, even for polymers with complex, highly branched structures. The developed method was tested by modeling the polyethylene melt. The calculated properties of chain conformation and chain segment packing agreed well with published data. The method was also applied to generate equilibrated structural models of three increasingly complex amorphous polymer systems: poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(butyl methacrylate), and DTB succinate copolymer. Calculated glass transition temperature (;) and structural parameter profile (S(q)) for each resulting polymer model were found to be in close agreement with experimental T, values and structural measurements obtained by X-ray diffraction, thus validating that the developed methods provide realistic models of amorphous polymer structure.									7	0	0	2	0	7			0024-9297			WOS:000292417800047	21769156

A pH-dependent specificity was observed for the dendrimer in hosting the chemical species, and the stoichiometric ratios of their binding were determined using UV-vis spectrophotometry. Specifically, cationic copper and anionic nitrate coordinated with the amine groups of the dendrimer through complexation and electrostatic interaction, while phenanthrene partitioned into the dendrimer interior through hydrophobic interaction. The binding and dielectric properties of the dendrimer-ligand complexes were further examined by microfluidics, at pH values optimized for the dendrimer and for species of picomolar concentrations. This study points to the vast potential of using tris-dendrimers for supramolecular assembly, environmental remediation, and nanomedicine.									10	2	0	2	0	12			1932-7447			WOS:000292281100013

Poly(propargyl acrylate) (PA) particles were surface modified through the copper-catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition of azide-terminated indocyanine green (azICG), a near-infrared emitter, and poly(ethylene glycol) (azPEG) chains of various molecular weights. The placement of azICG onto the surface of the particles allowed for the chromophores to complex with bovine serum albumin when dispersed in PBS that resulted in an enhancement of the dye emission. In addition, the inclusion of azPEG with the chromophores onto the particle surface resulted in a synergistic ninefold enhancement of the fluorescence intensity, with azPEGs of increasing molecular weight amplifying the response. Human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) overexpress albumin proteins and could be employed to activate the fluorescence of the nanoparticles. Preliminary PDT studies with HepG2 cells combined with the modified particles indicated that a minor exposure of 780nm radiation resulted in a statistically significant reduction in cell growth.									16	0	0	5	0	16			1616-5187			WOS:000292540900008	21480531

Solutions of N-(2-aminoethyl)(3-aminopropyl)methyldimethoxysilane (AEAPMDS),N-(6-aminohexyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (AHAPTS), and trimethoxysilylpropyl(polyethleneimine) (PEI-silane) were exposed to CO2, producing the respective carbamate species. The reacted CO2 was readily released by application of moderate heating and reduced pressure. Thermogravametric analysis (TGA) showed a weight loss percentage corresponding to 1 mol of CO2 per 1 mol of diamine at roughly 50 degrees C, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the formation of the carbamate species. Well-ordered amino-terminal SAMs of AEAPMDS, AHAPTS, and PEI-silane were prepared on silicon substrates from toluene solutions and were then exposed to CO2. The subsequent changes in the surface structure and wettability were characterized by variable-angle ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and static contact-angle goniometry. The SAMs showed a reversible change in layer thickness coupled with an increase in hydrophilicity upon CO2 exposure.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0888-5885			WOS:000292069000037

First, each combination of two PMA binders (performance grade (PG) 76-22 from two different sources) and two WMA additives (i.e., Aspha-min (R) and Sasobit (R)) were blended to produce warm PMA binders. They were then artificially short-term and long-term aged through the rolling thin film oven and pressure aging vessel procedures. Second, long-term aged warm PMA binders were recycled using two virgin binders (PG 76-22 and PG 70-22), and the recycled binders were artificially aged again. Lastly, Superpave binder tests were performed through the rotational viscometer, the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and the bending beam rheometer (BBR). In general, the results of this study suggested that (1) the WMA additives and the aged PMA binders were found to have a significant influence on the performance properties of recycled binders (measured by the DSR and the BBR); (2) the use of PG 70-22 as a virgin binder was effective in offsetting the increase of binder stiffness due to the additives and the aged binders; and (3) the recycled warm PMA binders can result in satisfactory binder performance that meets current Superpave binder requirements.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000296596400026

Here we describe a novel random matrix theory (RMT)-based conceptual framework to discern phylogenetic molecular ecological networks using metagenomic sequencing data of 16S rRNA genes from grassland soil microbial communities, which were sampled from a long-term free-air CO2 enrichment experimental facility at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Minnesota. Our experimental results demonstrated that an RMT-based network approach is very useful in delineating phylogenetic molecular ecological networks of microbial communities based on high-throughput metagenomic sequencing data. The structure of the identified networks under ambient and elevated CO2 levels was substantially different in terms of overall network topology, network composition, node overlap, module preservation, module-based higher-order organization, topological roles of individual nodes, and network hubs, suggesting that the network interactions among different phylogenetic groups/populations were markedly changed. Also, the changes in network structure were significantly correlated with soil carbon and nitrogen contents, indicating the potential importance of network interactions in ecosystem functioning. In addition, based on network topology, microbial populations potentially most important to community structure and ecosystem functioning can be discerned. The novel approach described in this study is important not only for research on biodiversity, microbial ecology, and systems microbiology but also for microbial community studies in human health, global change, and environmental management.IMPORTANCE The interactions among different microbial populations in a community play critical roles in determining ecosystem functioning, but very little is known about the network interactions in a microbial community, owing to the lack of appropriate experimental data and computational analytic tools. High-throughput metagenomic technologies can rapidly produce a massive amount of data, but one of the greatest difficulties is deciding how to extract, analyze, synthesize, and transform such a vast amount of information into biological knowledge. This study provides a novel conceptual framework to identify microbial interactions and key populations based on high-throughput metagenomic sequencing data. This study is among the first to document that the network interactions among different phylogenetic populations in soil microbial communities were substantially changed by a global change such as an elevated CO2 level. The framework developed will allow microbiologists to address research questions which could not be approached previously, and hence, it could represent a new direction in microbial ecology research.									34	9	0	33	0	44			2150-7511			WOS:000296844000009

Optical Characteristics of Southeast Asia's Regional Aerosols and Their Sources								JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION				61	7			747	754		10.3155/1047-3289.61.7.747			JUL 2011	2011	The dominant optical characteristics of Southeast Asia (SEA)'s regional aerosols were determined from the cluster analysis of the 26 AERONET aerosol inversion products, including aerosol light scattering/absorption indicators and aerosol size/shape parameters retrieved from 2003 to 2007. The data sets were acquired from four stations: Bac Giang in Vietnam and Mukdahan, Pimai, and Silpakorn University in Thailand. The cluster analysis showed agreement among the aerosol optical characteristics, land cover/uses, season as the surrogate of the prevailing winds, and observations from the literature. The results of this study showed that during the northeast prevailing winds from mid-September to December, the high aerosol exposure events were most frequently observed over the upwind station and less often over the downwind stations. This aerosol exhibited a single scattering albedo (SSA) of approximately 0.95 (440 nm), a relatively low refractive index, and a larger fine-mode size, suggesting it had the characteristics of urban/industrial aerosols reported in the literature. These aerosol sources were upwind from Bac Giang, probably in eastern China. From January to April, the aerosol exhibited a lower SSA of approximately 0.90, a higher refractive index, and a smaller fine-mode size, suggesting biomass burning smoke reported in the literature. The SEA urban aerosol exhibited a mean SSA of approximately 0.90 (440 nm) or lower, and the coarse-mode aerosol, possibly road dust or soil dust, played a role from October to January when seasonal winds are strongest. The results from a canonical discriminant function analysis suggest that the dominant SEA aerosol clusters tended to be separated by a canonical function positively correlated with SSA, the fine-mode asymmetry factor, and the overall fine-mode size and negatively correlated with the refractive index.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1047-3289			WOS:000296269400005	21850829

SWAT-BASED STREAMFLOW AND EMBAYMENT MODELING OF KARST-AFFECTED CHAPEL BRANCH WATERSHED, SOUTH CAROLINA								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				54	4			1311	1323					JUL-AUG 2011	2011	SWAT is a GIS-based basin-scale model widely used for the characterization of hydrology and water quality of large, complex watersheds; however, SWAT has not been fully tested in watersheds with karst geomorphology and downstream reservoir-like embayment. In this study, SWAT was applied to test its ability to predict monthly streamflow dynamics for a 1,555 ha karst watershed, Chapel Branch Creek, which drains to a large embayment and is comprised of highly diverse land uses. SWAT was able to accurately simulate the monthly streamflow at a cave spring (CS) outlet draining mostly agricultural and forested lands and a golf course plus an unknown groundwater discharging area, only after adding known monthly subsurface inputs as a point source at that location. Monthly streamflows at two other locations, both with multiple land uses, were overpredicted when lower lake levels were prevalent as a result of surface water flow to groundwater (losing streams). The model underpredicted the flows during rising lake levels, likely due to high conductivity and also a deep percolation coefficient representing flow lost to shallow and deep groundwater. At the main watershed outlet, a wide section performing as a reservoir embayment (R-E), the model was able to more accurately simulate the measured mean monthly outflows. The R-E storage was estimated by using a daily water balance approach with upstream inflows, rainfall, and PET as inputs and using parameters obtained by bathymetric survey, LiDAR, and downstream lake level data. Results demonstrated the substantial influence of the karst features in the water balance, with conduit and diffuse flow as an explanation for the missing upstream flows appearing via subsurface conveyance to the downstream cave spring, thus providing a more accurate simulation at the embayment outlet. Results also highlighted the influences of downstream lake levels and karst voids/conduits on the watershed hydrologic balance. Simulation performance of hydrology could be improved with more accurate DEMs obtained from LiDAR for karst feature identification and related modification of SWAT parameters. This SWAT modeling effort may have implications on nutrient and sediment loading estimates for TMDL development and implementation in karst watersheds with large downstream embayments that have significant changes in water level due to adjoining lakes.									9	0	0	3	0	9			2151-0032			WOS:000295662300012

Does frequent surface fire stimulate bark production compared with a fire-suppressed control? Based on data from an ongoing, long-term prescribed fire study, we explored differences in bark thickness from 0 to 200 cm above the ground for longleaf pine (Pinus palustris P. Mill.) trees on burned and control sites. Biennial prescribed fires, applied between 1973 (stand age = 14 years) and 2006 (stand age = 47 years), significantly reduced diameter at breast height. After adjusting for differences in diameter at breast height, we found no difference in bark thickness of trees from the burn and control sites, except for bark thickness measured at 0 cm aboveground where control sites had significantly thicker bark than burned sites. Results suggest that frequent burning did not stimulate bark production in longleaf pine.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0045-5067			WOS:000295185600018

Performance Characteristics of an Operational WiMAX Network								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING				10	7			941	953		10.1109/TMC.2010.226			JUL 2011	2011	The term WiMAX is used to refer to a collection of standards, products, and service offerings derived from the IEEE 802.16 family of standards for wireless networks. These standards define physical and MAC layer elements that ensure interoperability of compatible equipment. However, the standards leave both the details of the packet scheduling algorithms and the values of performance related configuration parameters to the discretion of the equipment vendor or network operator. These algorithms and parameters ultimately determine fundamental performance characteristics such as round-trip latency and sustainable throughput on the network. In this paper, we examine performance characteristics of an operational WiMAX testbed upon which we were able to conduct controlled experiments in the absence of competing traffic. We characterize latency, throughput, protocol overhead, and the impact of WiMAX on TCP dynamics. We show that scheduling policies and parameter values impact actual performance in ways that are not possible to characterize in generic studies of WiMAX.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1536-1233			WOS:000290668400003

However, most of existing distributed methods lack optimization for spatial-temporal search to query events occurred in a certain geographical area and a certain time period. Furthermore, for data search routing, most methods rely on locating systems (e. g., GPS), which consume high energy. This paper proposes a distributed spatial-temporal Similarity Data Storage (SDS) scheme. SDS provides efficient spatial-temporal and similarity data searching service, and is applicable for both static and dynamic WSNs. It disseminates event data in such a way that the distance between WSN neighborhoods represents the similarity of data stored in them. In addition, SDS carpooling routing algorithm efficiently routes messages without the aid of GPS. Theoretical and experimental results show that SDS yields significant improvements on the efficiency of data querying compared with existing approaches, and obtains stable performance in dynamic environments.									18	1	0	0	0	19			1536-1233	1558-0660		WOS:000290668400006

Volatile Emissions from Developing Cotton Bolls in Response to Hemipteran Feeding Damage								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				46	3			177	190					JUL 2011	2011	Hemipteran pests feed directly on cotton fruiting structures (bolls) causing damage to fiber and yield. Herbivore-induced volatile emissions have been well studied with regard to leaf-chewing insects, but no research has examined the release of volatiles from developing cotton bolls in response to damage from piercing-sucking insects. We compared volatile emissions from bolls in response to feeding damage by brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say), southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula, (L.), and the leaf footed bug, Leptoglossus phyllopus (L.) under laboratory conditions. Volatile emissions from bolls in response to N. viridula and mechanical damage were investigated under field conditions. Volatiles were collected using dynamic head-space sampling and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Under laboratory conditions, feeding by hemipterans resulted in a significant increase in volatile emissions from bolls compared with undamaged bolls. Damaged bolls released significantly greater amounts of acyclic terpenes and methyl ketones compared with undamaged bolls. Feeding by different hemipteran species elicited a similar quantitative increase in emissions, but significant differences were detected in the emissions of some individual compounds. Under field conditions, feeding damage by N. viridula resulted in significantly greater volatile emissions compared with undamaged and mechanically-damaged bolls indicating that physical damage alone did not account for the complete blend of volatiles released in response to biotic injury. During feeding, hemipterans inject a complex blend of salivary and digestive enzymes, and some of these compounds may activate volatile induction from bolls. The implication for piercing-sucking damage on biochemical pathways mediating volatile synthesis is discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0749-8004			WOS:000292951000001

Here, we investigated the effects of experimentally elevated T and locomotor training on muscle physiology and running performance in a nonterritorial male lizard species (Aspidoscelis sexlineata). Additionally, several morphological attributes were quantified to examine other characters that are likely affected by T and/or a training regimen. Neither training alone nor training with T supplementation resulted in increased locomotor performance. Instead, we found that T and training resulted in a decrease in each of three locomotor performance variables as well as in hematocrit, ventral coloration, and testis size. Strikingly, neither the size nor the fiber composition of the iliofibularis or gastrocnemius muscles was different among the two treatments or a group of untrained control animals. Hence, the relationships among T, training, and associated characters are not clear. Our results offer important insights for those hoping to conduct laboratory manipulations on nonmodel organisms and highlight the challenges of studying both training effects and the effects of steroid hormones on locomotor performance.									8	0	0	7	0	8			1522-2152			WOS:000292925900006	21743253

Nurse educators can use this technology to advance nursing research. Social networks provide new opportunities for locating potential research participants and maintaining contact during the research process. The purpose of this article is to explain how the researcher used Facebook to locate previous nursing students to ask them to participate in a qualitative study. Between 2006 and 2008, 22 nursing students had participated in international trips over a 3-year period. Because the students had graduated and moved to other geographical areas, the researcher had little or no contact information to use to follow-up with them. The researcher used Facebook to locate 18 of the 22 nursing graduates and invite them to participate in a qualitative research study. A discussion of the process and the potential ethical issues are provided.									5	1	0	0	0	6			0148-4834			WOS:000294255500009	21449530	
J	Kalariya, Hetal M.; Schnabel, Guido; Petri, Cesar; Scorza, Ralph								Generation and Characterization of Transgenic Plum Lines Expressing gafp-1 with the bul409 Promoter								HORTSCIENCE				46	7			975	980					JUL 2011	2011	The Gastrodia antifungal protein (GAFP-1) is a mannose-binding lectin that can confer increased disease resistance in transgenic tobacco and plum. In all previously generated, transgenic lines, the gene was under the control of the 35SCaMV promoter. In this study, transgenic plum lines were created from seeds derived from open pollination of the cultivar Bluebyrd (BB-OP) with gafp-1 under the control of the polyubiquitin promoter bul409 and evaluated for Phytophthora root rot (PRR) and Root knot nematode (RKN) susceptibility. One of nine transgenic lines synthesizing GAFP-1 exhibited increased tolerance to PRR caused by P. cinnamomi. The same line (BB-OP-1) was also significantly more tolerant to RKN infection caused by Meloidogyne incognita. BB-OP-1 was more resistant to PRR and equally resistant to RKN compared with the cultivar Stanley-derived 4J line, which expresses gafp-1 under the control of the 35SCaMV promoter. GAFP-1 synthesis in BB-OP-1 was not elevated by pathogen infection, suggesting that the bul409 promoter is not inducible in the plum/GAFP-1 system. This study confirms the usefulness of the gafp-1 gene in various cultivars of transgenic plum and establishes that the bul409 promoter is at least equal in effectiveness to the 35SCaMV promoter for gafp-1 expression in transgenic lines of woody plants.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-5345			WOS:000293160000002

The link between the duration of GRBs and the nature of their progenitors remains disputed. Short bursts (with durations of less than similar to 2 s) are less frequently observed, technically more difficult to localize, and exhibit significantly fainter afterglows.Aims. It is of critical importance to establish whether the burst duration can reliably distinguish the different GRB population models of collapsars and compact stellar mergers. The Swift GRB 090426 provides an unique opportunity to address this question. Its duration (T-90 = 1.28 s) places GRB 090426 firmly in the short burst population, while the high redshift (z = 2.609), host galaxy properties, and prompt emission spectral characteristics are more similar to those of long-duration GRBs.Methods. On the basis of data obtained with the Tautenburg 2 m telescope (Germany) and the 7-channel imager GROND (La Silla, Chile), we compiled the most finely sampled light curve available for a short burst optical/NIR afterglow. The light curve was then analysed in a standard fashion. GROND and XRT data were used to determine the broad-band spectral energy distribution of the afterglow across more than three orders of magnitude.Results. Our data show that a light curve break exists at 0.4 days, which is followed by a steep decay. This light curve decay is achromatic in the optical/NIR bands, and interpreted as a post-jet break phase. The X-ray data do not disagree with this interpretation.Conclusions. The half-opening angle of the suspected jet as well as the luminosity of the optical afterglow provide additional evidence that GRB 090426 is probably linked to the death of a massive star rather than to the merger of two compact objects.									26	0	0	0	0	26			1432-0746			WOS:000293017700110

After the launch of the Swift satellite, the gamma-ray burst (GRB) optical light-curve smoothness paradigm has been questioned thanks to the faster and better sampled optical follow-up, which has unveiled a very complex behaviour. This complexity is triggering the interest of the whole GRB community. The GROND multi-channel imager is used to study optical and near-infrared (NIR) afterglows of GRBs with unprecedented optical and near-infrared temporal and spectral resolution. The GRB 081029 has a very prominent optical rebrightening event and is an outstanding example of the application of the multi-channel imager to GRB afterglows.Aims. Here we exploit the rich GROND multi-colour follow-up of GRB 081029 combined with XRT observations to study the nature of late-time rebrightenings that appear in the optical-NIR light-curves of some GRB afterglows.Methods. We analyse the optical and NIR observations obtained with the seven-channel Gamma-Ray burst Optical and Near-infrared Detector (GROND) at the 2.2 m MPI/ESO telescope and the X-ray data obtained with the XRT telescope on board the Swift observatory. The multi-wavelength temporal and spectral evolution is discussed in the framework of different physical models.Results. The extremely steep optical and NIR rebrightening observed in GRB 081029 cannot be explained in the framework of the standard forward shock afterglow model. The absence of a contemporaneous X-ray rebrightening and the evidence of a strong spectral evolution in the optical-NIR bands during the rise suggest two separate components that dominate in the early and late-time lightcurves, respectively. The steepness of the optical rise cannot be explained even in the framework of the alternative scenarios proposed in the literature unless a late-time activity of the central engine is assumed.									25	1	0	0	0	25			1432-0746			WOS:000293017700141

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				531						A22	10.1051/0004-6361/201116756			JUL 2011	2011	Context. In the central part of M 31, a high number of optical novae can be targeted within the field of view of the XMM-Newton EPIC and Chandra HRC-I X-ray detectors. A special monitoring program of the area has allowed us to investigate supersoft emission of individual novae in detail and perform a statistical analysis of the sample.Aims. For the He/N nova M31N 2007-12b, we aimed to constrain the time of appearance of a supersoft source (SSS) and the duration of the SSS state as well as determine the spectral and time variability while the source was bright.Methods. We analyzed XMM-Newton EPIC and Chandra HRC-I observations of our monitoring program performed at intervals of ten days and added results of a XMM-Newton target of opportunity observation and Swift XRT observations. We performed source detection, determined long-term time and spectral variation of M31N 2007-12b, and searched for shorter-term time variability in the individual observations when the source was bright, using fast Fourier and folding techniques to analyze periodicities.Results. The SSS emission started between 21 and 30 d after the optical outburst and ended between 60 and 120 d after outburst, making M31N 2007-12b one of the few novae with the shortest SSS phase known. The X-ray spectrum was supersoft and can be fitted with a white dwarf (WD) atmosphere model with solar abundances absorbed by the Galactic foreground. The temperature of the WD atmosphere seems to increase at the beginning of the SSS phase from similar to 70 to similar to 80 eV. The luminosity of M31N 2007-12b during maximum was at the Eddington limit of a massive WD and dropped by similar to 0% in the observation 60 d after outburst. The radius of the emission region is similar to 6 x 10(8) cm. In the four bright state observations, we detected a stable 1110 s pulsation, which we interpret as the WD rotation period. In addition, we detect dips in three observations that might represent a 4.9 h or 9.8 h binary period of the system.Conclusions. Nova envelope models with less than or similar to 50% mixing between solar-like accreted material and the degenerate core of the WD can be used to describe the data. We derive a WD mass of 1.2 M-circle dot, as well as an ejected and burned mass of 2.0 x 10(-6) M-circle dot and 0.2 x 10(-6) M-circle dot, respectively. The observed periodicities indicate that nova M31N 2007-12b erupted in an intermediate polar (IP) system. The WD photospheric radius seems to be larger than expected for a non-magnetic WD but in the range for magnetic WDs in an IP system.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1432-0746			WOS:000293017700127

However, a universal mechanism that encompasses the breadth of experimental evidence is still lacking. Here we show, using molecular dynamics simulations, that the "apparent" thickening of interfacial fluids in electrokinetic transport near molecularly smooth surface originates mainly from the fact that ion-wall interactions are not accounted for in the hydrodynamic model of classical electrokinetic theories. Specifically, strong ion-wall interactions cause intermittent adsorption of ions on charged walls, and this in turn leads to loss of driving force for flow and screening of fluid flow by the adsorbed ions. Although not considered in the classical electrokinetic theories, these effects can significantly suppress electrokinetic transport. Consequently, when the classical theories are used to interpret the electrokinetic data, the viscosity of interfacial fluids appears to be greatly enhanced even if their material viscosity is similar to that of the bulk fluids. This mechanism for the apparent thickening of interfacial fluids is applicable to electrokinetic transport near any type of charged surface. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

The key components of the model are developed by first constructing a simple molecular-level microstructure model and by relating the microstructural elements and intrinsic material processes to the material mechanical response. The new feature of the present material model relative to the ones currently used is that the physical origin and the evolution equation for the deformation-induced softening and inelasticity observed in polyureas are directly linked to the associated evolution of the soft-matrix/hard-segment molecular-level microstructure of this material. The model is first developed for the case of uniaxial loading, parameterized using one set of experimental results, and finally validated using another set of experimental results. The validation procedure suggested that the model can reasonably well account for the equilibrium mechanical response of polyureas under the simple uniaxial-loading conditions. In the last portion of this study, a general finite-strain three-dimensional material model for polyureas was developed and cast as a subroutine suitable for linking with commercial finite-element programs.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1464-4207			WOS:000293924800007

Wave reflection by submerged vertical and semicircular breakwaters								OCEAN ENGINEERING				38	10			1269	1276		10.1016/j.oceaneng.2011.05.003			JUL 2011	2011	This short manuscript presents a laboratory investigation on the effects of submerged vertical and semicircular breakwaters on local wave characteristics, particularly with the aim of determining the parameterizations for the wave reflection coefficients for submerged vertical and semicircular breakwaters. Experiments were conducted with normally incident monochromatic waves breaking at the breakwater on both sloping and horizontal sandy bottoms. The reflection coefficient (C(r)) is observed to rely mainly on the dimensionless submergence parameter, a/H(i) (a-the breakwater's depth of submergence and H(i)-the height of the incident wave at the breakwater). Two semi-empirical parameterizations are proposed to predict reflection coefficients for submerged vertical and semicircular breakwaters. While both parameterizations share the same functional dependency on the functions have different constant coefficients. For the limiting case when a approaches zero (breakwater crest is at the mean water level), the C(r) value tends toward 0.53 for both breakwaters. However, as a increases, the submerged vertical breakwaters reflect more energy than submerged semicircular breakwaters for the same a/H(i) value. Results of this study are expected to be of use to coastal engineers for preliminary feasibility and desk design of submerged vertical and semicircular breakwaters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Moussa, B.; Lowenberg-DeBoer, J.; Fulton, J.; Boys, K.								The economic impact of cowpea research in West and Central Africa: A regional impact assessment of improved cowpea storage technologies								JOURNAL OF STORED PRODUCTS RESEARCH				47	3			147	156		10.1016/j.jspr.2011.02.001			JUL 2011	2011	Researchers from the Bean/Cowpea Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP), a program supported by the USAID, developed several non-chemical cowpea grain storage technologies in the 1980s. These included hermetic storage in airtight containers, improved ash storage, and the solar heater. Impact studies conducted at the country level showed that the research program was economically a good investment. As the CRSP new storage technologies spread throughout West and Central Africa, a regional assessment including spillover effects became necessary to fully comprehend the impact and guide future research investments. Therefore, this study sought to measure the economic impact of the new CRSP cowpea storage technologies at a regional level. Surveys in seven countries were used to estimate storage technology adoption. Economic surplus was used to estimate annual benefits and internal rate of return (IRR), and net present value (NPV) were calculated to summarize the net benefits. From the perspective of recipients' countries the project was a good investment. The IRR, is found to be much greater than the cost of capital. The regional IRR was found to be about 29%, much higher than the real interest rate on government bonds in West Africa at the time. For example the real interest rate on bonds issued by the government of Ghana in 2004 and 2005 was 8.9% and 5.4% respectively. The IRR is also higher than the private bank real lending rates in West Africa. From the perspective of the principal donor, the US government, the project was a good investment given that the average real interest rate on US government's bonds was 4.8% during the period. The net present value of the investment amounts to more than 295 million US dollars which yields an annualized value of about 17 million. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, twenty-one observational sessions of the medication administration process were conducted on a Medical/Surgical unit, and the processes used by nurses were analyzed to discover systemic process variability and determine possible best practices. When nurses instituted a patient medication order and medication review cycle prior to the other activities associated with medication administration, it was more likely that discrepancies in physician orders, electronic medication administration records, and missing medications would be mitigated within the same medication pass.Relevance to industry: This research specifically investigates the process flows involved in medication administration This work is a starting point in an effort to establish industry best practices and to identify the variables, such as technology use, facility layout, and process interruptions, which impact their standardization.

Prior to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for ethanol production, solid-state fermentation was performed for four days on ground corn stover using either P chrysosporium or G trabeum to induce in situ cellulase production. During SSF with S. cerevisiae or E. coli, ethanol production was the highest on day 4 for all samples. For corn stover treated with P chrysosporium, the conversion to ethanol was 2.29 g/100 g corn stover with S. cerevisiae as the fermenting organism, whereas for the sample inoculated with E. coli K011, the ethanol production was 4.14 g/100 g corn stover. Corn stover treated with G trabeum showed a conversion 1.90 and 4.79 g/100 g corn stover with S. cerevisiae and E. coli K011 as the fermenting organisms, respectively. Other fermentation co-products, such as acetic acid and lactic acid, were also monitored. Acetic acid production ranged between 0.45 and 0.78 g/100 g corn stover, while no lactic acid production was detected throughout the 5 days of SSF. The results of our experiment suggest that it is possible to perform SSF of corn stover using P chrysosporium, G trabeum, S. cerevisiae and E. coli K011 for the production of fuel ethanol.									7	1	0	4	0	7			1017-7825	1738-8872		WOS:000293359600006	21791956

Regional cell density distribution and oxygen consumption rates in porcine TMJ discs: an explant study								OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE				19	7			911	918		10.1016/j.joca.2011.03.002			JUL 2011	2011	Objective: To determine the regional cell density distribution and basal oxygen consumption rates (based on tissue volume and cell number) of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discs and further examine the impact of oxygen tension on these rates.Design: TMJ discs from pigs aged 6-8 months were divided into five regions: anterior, intermediate, posterior, lateral and medial. The cell density was determined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The change in oxygen tension was recorded while TMJ disc explants were cultured in sealed metabolism chambers. The volume based oxygen consumption rate of explants was determined by theoretical curve-fitting of the recorded oxygen tension data with the Michaelis-Menten equation. The rate on a per-cell basis was calculated based on the cell density measurements and volume based rate measured in another group of discs.Results: The overall cell density [mean, 95% confidence interval (CI)] was 51.3 (21.3-81.3) x 10(6) cells/mL wet tissue. Along the anteroposterior axis, the anterior band had 25.5% higher cell density than the intermediate zone (P < 0.02) and 29.1% higher than the posterior band (P < 0.008). Along the medio-lateral axes, the medial region had 26.2% higher cell density than the intermediate zone (P < 0.04) and 25.4% higher than the lateral region (P < 0.045). The overall volume and cell based maximum oxygen consumption rates were 1.44 (0.44-2.44) mu mol/mL wet tissue/h and 28.7 (12.2-45.2) nmol/10(6) cells/h, respectively. The central regions (intermediate, lateral, and medial) had significantly higher volume based (P < 0.02) and cell based (P < 0.005) oxygen consumption rates than the anterior and posterior bands. At high oxygen tension, the oxygen consumption rate remained constant, but dropped as oxygen tension fell below 5%.Conclusions: The TMJ disc had higher cell density and oxygen consumption rates than articular cartilage reported in the literature. These results suggest that a steeper oxygen gradient may exist in the TMJ disc and may be vulnerable to pathological events that impede nutrient supply.

J	Joshi, Hem; Moser, Bryan R.; Toler, Joe; Smith, William F.; Walker, Terry								Ethyl levulinate: A potential bio-based diluent for biodiesel which improves cold flow properties								BIOMASS & BIOENERGY				35	7			3262	3266		10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.04.020			JUL 2011	2011	Biodiesel, defined as mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, is an attractive renewable fuel alternative to conventional petroleum diesel fuel. Biodiesel produced from oils such as cottonseed oil and poultry fats suffer from extremely poor cold flow properties because of their high saturated fatty acid content. In the current study, Ethyl Levulinate (ethyl 4-oxopentanoate) was investigated as a novel, bio-based cold flow improver for use in biodiesel fuels. The cloud (CP), pour (PP), and cold filter plugging points (CFPP) of biodiesel fuels prepared from cottonseed oil and poultry fat were improved upon addition of ethyl levulinate at 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0% (vol). Reductions of 4-5 degrees C in CP, 3-4 degrees C in PP and 3 degrees C in CFPP were observed at 20 vol % ethyl levulinate. The influence of ethyl levulinate on acid value, induction period, kinematic viscosity and flash point was determined. The kinematic viscosities and flash points decreased with increasing content of ethyl levulinate. All samples (<= 15 vol % ethyl levulinate) satisfied the ASTM D6751 limit with respect to flash point, but none of the 20 vol % blends were acceptable when compared to the higher EN 14214 specification. Acid value and oxidative stability were essentially unchanged upon addition of ethyl levulinate. In summary, ethyl levulinate appears acceptable as a diluent for biodiesel fuels with high saturated fatty acid content.

Performance, optimization, and fitness: Connecting applications to architectures								CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE				23	10			1066	1100		10.1002/cpe.1688			JUL 2011	2011	Recent trends involving multicore processors and graphical processing units (GPUs) focus on exploiting task- and thread-level parallelism. In this paper, we have analyzed various aspects of the performance of these architectures including NVIDIA GPUs, and multicore processors such as Intel Xeon, AMD Opteron, IBM's Cell Broadband Engine. The case study used in this paper is a biological spiking neural network (SNN), implemented with the Izhikevich, Wilson, Morris-Lecar, and Hodgkin-Huxley neuron models. The four SNN models have varying requirements for communication and computation making them useful for performance analysis of the hardware platforms. We report and analyze the variation of performance with network (problem size) scaling, available optimization techniques and execution configuration. A Fitness performance model, that predicts the suitability of the architecture for accelerating an application, is proposed and verified with the SNN implementation results. The Roofline model, another existing performance model, has also been utilized to determine the hardware bottleneck(s) and attainable peak performance of the architectures. Significant speedups for the four SNN neuron models utilizing these architectures are reported; the maximum speedup of 574x was observed in our GPU implementation. Our results and analysis show that a proper match of architecture with algorithm complexity provides the best performance.

Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy] cultivars require considerable field research to determine best management practices for successful long-term culture. A field study was conducted in 2004 and 2005 on an experimental 'TifEagle' bermudagrass putting green in Clemson, SC, to examine effects of plant growth regulators (PGRs) applied bimonthly and three mowing heights on turf performance. The PGRs included ethephon [(2-chloroethyl) phosphonic acid] at 1.91 kg a.i. ha(-1), flurprimidol [alpha-(1-methylethyl)-alpha-[4-(trifluoro-methoxy) phenyl]-5-pyrimidine-methonol] at 0.07 kg a.i. ha(-1), trinexapac-ethyl [4-(cyclopropyl-alpha-hydroxymethylene)-3,5-dioxo-cyclohexane carboxylic acid ethyl ester] at 0.0175 kg a.i. ha(-1), all pairwise PGR combinations at half the individual rates, and a nontreated control. Turf was mowed five times weekly at 2.50, 3.25, or 4.00 mm. Lateral regrowth with ethephon and trinexapac-ethyl was comparable to nontreated turf, while flurprimidol impeded lateral regrowth similar to 25%. All three PGRs reduced dry clipping weights, with flurprimidol most effective (>50% each harvest) and ethephon least effective (maximum 17%). Turf quality for trinexapac-ethyl, ethephon, and flurprimidol was excellent (8.0-8.4), acceptable (6.8-7.1) and unacceptable (3.6-5.2), respectively. Compared to the control, root length density increased 33% with trinexapac-ethyl, unaffected by ethephon, and reduced 25% with flurprimidol. Flurprimidol increased ball roll distances in morning (AM) and (PM) by 21 and 26 cm, respectively, trinexapac-ethyl provided increases of 5 and 10 cm, respectively, while ethephon had no effect, compared to the control. No evidence of synergistic effects was observed for PGR combinations. Raising mowing heights increased lateral regrowth, turf quality, and root length density but decreased ball roll distances. Best overall performance of TifEagle bermudagrass was achieved with trinexapac-ethyl, as it increased root length density, provided excellent turf quality, reduced vertical growth, did not impede lateral regrowth, and increased ball roll distances, compared to the control.									10	0	0	6	3	10			0002-1962			WOS:000292637800004

Validation of a Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for the Identification of Meloidogyne arenaria								PLANT DISEASE				95	7			835	838		10.1094/PDIS-09-10-0668			JUL 2011	2011	Meloidogyne arenaria is an economically important parasite of many crops worldwide. Identification and detection of this species in soil samples is necessary for the design of crop rotation systems, selection of resistant cultivars, and potential use of biological control options. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, using species-specific primers and SYBR Green I Dye, for identification of M. arenaria. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by testing for amplification of DNA from other Meloidogyne spp. and from M. arenaria populations of different geographic origins. Field soil samples containing a mixture of M. arenaria and M. incognita were used to compare identification by the real-time PCR assay with identification by esterase phenotype analysis of mature females and by morphometrics of juveniles. The real-time PCR assay provided an accurate and sensitive means for the identification of single juveniles from soil samples.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0191-2917			WOS:000291893300007

Design: The ACT program was a randomized controlled school-based trial testing the efficacy of a motivational plus behavioral skills intervention on increasing MVPA in underserved adolescents. Twenty-four middle schools were matched on school size, percentage minorities, percentage free or reduce lunch, and urban or rural setting before randomization. A total of 1,563 6th grade students (mean age, 11.3 years, 73% African American, 71% free or reduced lunch, 55% female) participated in either a 17-week (over one academic year) intervention or comparison after-school program. Main Outcome Measure: The primary outcome measure was MVPA based on 7-day accelerometry estimates at 2-weeks postintervention and an intermediate outcome was MVPA at midintervention. Results: At midintervention students in the intervention condition engaged in 4.87 greater minutes of MVPA per day (95% CI: 1.18 to 8.57) than control students. Students in intervention schools engaged in 9.11 min (95% CI: 5.73 to 12.48) more of MVPA per day than those in control schools during the program time periods; indicating a 27 min per week increase in MVPA. No significant effect of the ACT intervention was found outside of school times or for MVPA at 2-weeks postintervention. Conclusions: Motivational and behavioral skills programs are effective at increasing MVPA in low-income and minority adolescents during program hours, but further research is needed to address home barriers to youth MVPA.									39	0	0	9	0	39			0278-6133			WOS:000292809100011	21534677

Inhibitory effects of enterococci on the production of hydrogen sulfide by hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria in raw meat								JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY				111	1			83	92		10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.05034.x			JUL 2011	2011	Aims: Applying competitive exclusion micro-organisms to control hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) gas produced by hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria (SPB) in chicken meat.Methods and Results: Five SPB strains, isolated from animal by-products, were used for screening lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that can inhibit the production of H(2)S by SPB in trypticase soy broth supplemented with l-cysteine (TSB-L-cys). A sensitive and accurate test strip method was developed for H(2)S determination in real time. One LAB strain, isolate L86, from cheese whey, demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity against the production of H(2)S by SPB. The isolate L86 was confirmed as Enterococcus faecium that does not possess genes encoding for vancomycin resistance based on PCR analysis. Enterococcus faecium strain L86 reduced (P < 0.05) the yield of H(2)S upto 51.2% in 10 h at 35 degrees C in TSB-L-cys medium. In fresh chicken meat, the yield of H(2)S produced by the artificially inoculated SPB was reduced (P < 0.05) by 48.6, 49.7 and 69.8% in 10 h at 35, 30 and 25 degrees C, respectively. Enterococcus faecium strain L86 also reduced (P < 0.05) by 53.8% on the yield of H(2)S produced by the indigenous SPB in partially spoiled chicken meat at 35 degrees C for 10 h.Conclusions: Enterococcus faecium strain L86 is effective on inhibiting the production of H(2)S by SPB.Significance and Impact of the Study: The application of this biological agent to raw animal by-products will provide a safer working environment in rendering processing plants and produce higher-quality rendered products.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1364-5072			WOS:000292884000009	21518155

The ZnO grown at 800 degrees C had a soccer ball structure with diameters of <500 nm. The ZnO soccer ball structure was, for the first time, observed in this work. The structural and the optical properties of the ZnO soccer balls were investigated by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoluminescence. The preferred orientation of the ZnO soccer balls was along the c-axis with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The ZnO soccer balls exhibited an overall tensile residual stress, and the bond length of Zn-O was 1.951 angstrom. In the room-temperature PL of the ZnO soccer balls, a near-band-edge emission (NBE) and a deep-level emission were observed at 3.25 and 2.47 eV, respectively. The full width at half maximum of the NBE peak was 110 meV.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0374-4884			WOS:000292860000025

We tested the model in 2 studies using multisource data: a 3-wave investigation of 184 full-time employees (Study 1) and a 2-wave investigation of 188 restaurant workers (Study 2). Results revealed that (a) abusive supervision mediated the relationship between aggressive norms and psychological distress, (b) psychological distress mediated the effects of abusive supervision on spouse undermining, (c) abusive supervision had a direct positive relationship with supervisor-directed deviance, (d) the positive relationship between psychological distress and spouse undermining was stronger for men as opposed to women, and (e) employees engaged in relationship-oriented occupations reported greater levels of abusive supervision and psychological distress.

We measured their thermal, optical and structural properties and compared with those of the parent bulk. The probe penetration temperature (T-p) of the bulk glass, measured using a micro-thermal analyzer, was found to be 412 +/- 10 degrees C, while those of the TE and PLD films were 468 and 470 +/- 10 degrees C, respectively. The refractive index of the bulk and thin films was measured by ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared transmission spectroscopy, and we show that the films have similar refractive indices, which are lower than those of the parent bulk glass. Using micro-Raman spectroscopy, the structure of the film was investigated. The films contain homopolar Ge-Ge bonds and a lower number of homopolar S-S bonds compared to bulk material, which leads to an increase in the proportion of corner shared GeS4/2 units in the films as compared to the bulk glass. Comparison of structural entities associated with each deposition process showed that the TE film possesses a lower number of S-S bonds and a slightly higher number of SbS3/2 units compared to the PLD film. These structural changes lead to a more interconnected glass network, and therefore to a higher viscosity at elevated temperatures, as well as a higher refractive index, presumably through increased density. Post-deposition of annealing of these films causes their thermal and optical properties to revert to a more bulk-like state, suggesting that these property differences are due to a difference in the thermal histories of the bulk and film glass networks. For the first time to our knowledge, the refractive index of the bulk glass in the 0.6-10.6 mu m range, measured using the prism coupling technique, is also presented. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF GENETIC VARIATION AMONG NATIVE AND INTRODUCED POPULATIONS OF CHINESE TALLOW TREE, TRIADICA SEBIFERA (EUPHORBIACEAE)								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY				98	7			1128	1138		10.3732/ajb.1000297			JUL 2011	2011	Premise of the study: Invasive plants often display genetically determined variation in patterns of growth and resource allocation between native and introduced genotypes, as well as among genotypes within different regions of the introduced range. We examined patterns of genetic variation within and among native and introduced populations of the tetraploid Chinese tallow tree (Triadica sebifera, Euphorbiaceae) to determine whether nonselective evolutionary processes or the introduction history could contribute to previously observed phenotypic differences between native and introduced populations as well as among introduced populations.Methods: We used six microsatellite markers to study 12 native populations in China, 51 introduced populations in the southeastern USA, and one introduced population in Australia.Key results: Genetic diversity was greater within and among native populations than introduced populations. Within the southeastern USA, populations in Georgia and South Carolina differed substantially in their genetic composition and had greater genetic diversity than the rest of the southeastern USA. Greater genetic similarity between some populations in the native range and introduced range indicate a common provenance for Georgia and South Carolina populations that could have come from any of several western or southern Chinese populations and a different provenance for other southeastern USA populations and the Australian population, which were most similar to more northeastern Chinese populations.Conclusions: Differences among introduced populations in potentially adaptive traits (e. g., herbivore tolerance, herbivore resistance, growth rates) may result in part from the introduction history, in particular from differences present among source populations in the native range.									25	0	0	24	0	25			0002-9122			WOS:000292377000020	21730337

The ratio N(T)*/N(chem) (amount of chemisorption by SSITKA vs. by static chemisorptions) was found to be almost always ca. unity for Co catalysts. SSITKA can, thus, be used as a complementary characterization technique to TEM, XRD, and static chemisorption for better understanding of Co metal catalyst dispersion and metal surface site availability for Co catalysts with a wide variety of promoters/supports. Unfortunately, application of SSITKA chemisorption measurements under reaction conditions for characterizing metal dispersion for the other metals is limited at this time. However, the results do suggest some possibilities for Ru and Rh. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0021-9517			WOS:000292488600013		
J	Rapaport, Lisa G.								Progressive parenting behavior in wild golden lion tamarins								BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY				22	4			745	754		10.1093/beheco/arr055			JUL-AUG 2011	2011	Young primates in the family Callitrichidae (the marmosets and tamarins) receive extensive and relatively prolonged care from adults. Of particular note, callitrichid young are routinely provisioned until well after weaning by parents and helpers, which is in stark contrast to typical juvenile primates, who must acquire most of their food independently once they are weaned. Adults of some callitrichid species produce a specialized vocalization that encourages immature group members to take proffered food from the caller. Here, I report that wild adult golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) not only used this food-offering call to encourage young, mobile offspring to approach and take captured prey from them, but as the young began to spend significant time foraging for themselves and to acquire prey by independent means, the frequency of these vocalizations in the context of food transfer declined. Adults then began to use food-offering calls in a novel context: to direct juveniles to foraging sites that contained hidden prey that the adults had found but not captured. During the period of these most frequent adult-directed prey captures, the independent prey-capture success rates of juveniles improved. Thus, adults modified their provisioning behavior in a progressive developmentally sensitive manner that may have facilitated learning how to find food. I hypothesize that as a result of these demonstrations by adults, juveniles either may be encouraged to continue foraging despite low return rates or to learn the properties of productive prey-foraging substrates in a complex environment.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1045-2249			WOS:000291750000010

They usually represent entire populations; they are timely; and have direct influence on their sources which are mostly governmental agencies. We argue in this paper that administrative data can and should be used as indicators of children's well-being as they constitute an existing body of knowledge that has the potential to form and influence policy. Such use of administrative data as of child well-being indicators is demonstrated by the South Carolina Data Bridge Project, initiated with a child care research capacity grant awarded in 2007 by the Office of Planning, Research and Families (OPRE) to study the impact of Child Care and Development Fund on the quality of care available to and utilized by low-income working parents and at-risk families. The project's goal was achieved by linking different sources of child care administrative data to create analytic data cubes that allow the examination of quality of care provided to children and factors contributing to it. This project indicates the importance of administrative data and their potential impact on well-informed decision making and policy change to improve children and families' well-being.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1874-897X			WOS:000291694500005

Kou, Jie/I-4234-2012				The temperature statistics of a surfactant-covered air/water interface during mixed convection heat transfer and evaporation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER				54	15-16			3394	3405		10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2011.03.047			JUL 2011	2011	Surface temperature fields were measured of an air/water interface where heat was transferred from the water to the air under mixed convection conditions. The interfacial temperature field was measured using an infrared (IR) camera for mean wind speeds ranging from 0 to 4.0 m/s, in 1.0 m/s increments. Statistics of these surface temperature fields, specifically, the root mean square (rms) and the skewness were obtained. Plots of the rms versus the heat flux showed linear behavior for low wind speeds (U = 0-3 m/s), and the skewness was also found to increase with heat flux for U = 0-3 m/s, although these data exhibited significant scatter. The scaled root mean square temperature was revealed to be governed by the ratio Ra(1/3)/(Re*(4/5)Pr(1/3)) where Ra is the Rayleigh number, Re* the Reynolds number based on water side friction velocity and Pr is the Prandtl number.

Multiphysics Substrate Scale Modeling and Analysis of Chemical Vapor Deposition-Based Carbon Nanotube Fabrication Process								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL NANOSCIENCE				8	7			1226	1241		10.1166/jctn.2011.1803			JUL 2011	2011	A multiphysics, multiphase model has been recently developed and utilized to study the major physical phenomena occurring inside the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor chamber for a Carbon Nanotube (CNT) fabrication process. We observed that the position of the substrate significantly affected the types of CNTs formed by carbon species during surface phase reactions. However, these investigations did not include the effect of position of the substrate with respect to the inserted gas flow direction. In general, CNT formation reactions occur between the deposited metal nanoparticles on the substrate surface and gases flowing in a closed region around the substrate. Along this line, this study undertakes the investigation of several physical phenomena near the substrate in great detail. Moreover, the effects of substrate lateral displacement and ever-present angle between the substrate and the gas flow direction are investigated.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1546-1955			WOS:000291846800020

The sensor surface consists of an X-ray scintillator film coated in a thin film loaded with chemical indicator dye. A narrow scanning X-ray beam is used to excite luminescence from X-ray scintillators located within the beam. This luminescence passes through the indicator film, and the spectrum is analyzed to measure chemical concentrations at that location. A pH sensor is demonstrated with a dynamic range between pH 6-9 and noise level of 0.05 pH units using methyl-red dyed pH paper. The location of the interface between two types of scintillator films is obtained with 0.30 mm spatial resolution even though the images are highly blurred by 10 mm of chicken breast. This work has important applications for detecting pH changes on surfaces of implanted medical devices.									16	0	0	6	0	16			0003-2700			WOS:000292280900004	21619005	
J	Taneja, Vipul; Vertegel, Alexey; Langan, Eugene M., III; LaBerge, Martine								Influence of Topography of an Endovascular Stent Material on Smooth Muscle Cell Response								ANNALS OF VASCULAR SURGERY				25	5			675	685		10.1016/j.avsg.2011.03.002			JUL 2011	2011	The phenotypic shift of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from contractile to synthetic phenotype after endovascular stenting has been deemed to be the predominant cause of restenosis. Although substrate topography has been shown to affect SMC response for a variety of polymers, effect of topography on phenotype of SMCs has not been well studied for endovascular stent materials. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate SMC phenotype, manifested in morphology, proliferation, and contractile marker smooth muscle alpha-actin expression, as a function of 316L stainless steel topography. Results of this study showed that the cells grown on micro-grooved surface (groove depth: 13 mu m) were significantly more elongated than those on the electropolished surface. Ascertained by repeated proliferation studies, cells grown on micro-grooved surface demonstrated a significantly lower proliferation rate relative to the electropolished surface. An enhanced expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin grown on micro-grooved surface was also found near confluence. Furthermore, cells on electropolished surface demonstrated a substantial loss of smooth muscle alpha-actin between days 1 and 4. Therefore, given the favorable SMC response reported in this study, our findings suggest that a micro-grooved topography might prove beneficial for endovascular stent applications.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0890-5096			WOS:000292303400016	21724105

Thus, community-wide ecological initiatives are needed to create environments that support incorporating physical activity into residents' daily lives. In this article we describe an ongoing collaborative service-learning partnership between Clemson University, a community coalition, and a neighboring small rural town to address local social and physical environment supports for walking. Years 1 to 3 of this collaborative initiative were evaluated using a mixed-method approach to assess physical environment changes, social environment changes, community perceptions of support for walking, community perceptions of collaborating with university students, and students' skill development. Results revealed several key environmental changes such as mapping and marking 3 walking trails in the community, development of broad marketing efforts linked to the trails that promote community health and heritage, and annual community events to promote walking and the newly developed walking trails. Interview data with community leaders identified several key themes critical to facilitating and enhancing our university and community collaboration. Lastly, students developed skills in developing partnerships, mapping, advocacy, event planning, critical reflection, and qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. Through this process community members and students learn evidence-based public health skills for using data and planning frameworks to guide local initiatives, engage community members in decision making, and conducting evaluations.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1078-4659			WOS:000291022300016	21617413

However, the use of this technology has not been explored in detail in the area of asphalt binder materials. The objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate the high temperature rheological properties of the binders containing various percentages of carbon nano particles. The experimental design for this study included the utilization of five binder sources, three binder grades (PG 64-22, PG 64-16, and PG 52-28), one type of nano particle, and four percentages of nano particles (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 %, and 1.5 % by weight of the virgin binder). Some of the rheological characteristics of these binders were obtained, including rotational viscometer (four testing temperatures of 120, 135, 150, and 165 degrees C) and dynamic shear rheometer. The results of the experiments indicated that the addition of nano particles was helpful in increasing the viscosity, failure temperature, phase angle, and viscous and elastic modulus values and in improving the rutting resistance of the binders. On the other hand, the binder sources and grades generally influenced their rheological properties as the nano particles were added to the asphalt binder.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000296596400009

Mapping Fusarium wilt race 1 resistance genes in cotton by inheritance, QTL and sequencing composition								MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS				286	1			21	36		10.1007/s00438-011-0616-1			JUL 2011	2011	Knowledge of the inheritance of disease resistance and genomic regions housing resistance (R) genes is essential to prevent expanding pathogen threats such as Fusarium wilt [Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum (FOV) Atk. Sny & Hans] in cotton (Gossypium spp.). We conducted a comprehensive study combining conventional inheritance, genetic and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, QTL marker-sequence composition, and genome sequencing to examine the distribution, structure and organization of disease R genes to race 1 of FOV in the cotton genome. Molecular markers were applied to F(2) and recombinant inbred line (RIL) interspecific mapping populations from the crosses Pima-S7 (G. barbadense L.) x 'Acala NemX' (G. hirsutum L.) and Upland TM-1 (G. hirsutum) x Pima 3-79 (G. barbadense), respectively. Three greenhouse tests and one field test were used to obtain sequential estimates of severity index (DSI) of leaves, and vascular stem and root staining (VRS). A single resistance gene model was observed for the F(2) population based on inheritance of phenotypes. However, additional inheritance analyses and QTL mapping indicated gene interactions and inheritance from nine cotton chromosomes, with major QTLs detected on five chromosomes [Fov1-C06, Fov1-C08, (Fov1-C11 (1) and Fov1-C11 (2)) , Fov1-C16 and Fov1-C19 loci], explaining 8-31% of the DSI or VRS variation. The Fov1-C16 QTL locus identified in the F(2) and in the RIL populations had a significant role in conferring FOV race 1 resistance in different cotton backgrounds. Identified molecular markers may have important potential for breeding effective FOV race 1 resistance into elite cultivars by marker-assisted selection. Reconciliation between genetic and physical mapping of gene annotations from marker-DNA and new DNA sequences of BAC clones tagged with the resistance-associated QTLs revealed defenses genes induced upon pathogen infection and gene regions rich in disease-response elements, respectively. These offer candidate gene targets for Fusarium wilt resistance response in cotton and other host plants.									19	2	0	19	0	21			1617-4615			WOS:000292047600002	21533837

Four fuel reduction treatments were applied to three sites in a southern Appalachian Mountain forest in western North Carolina: prescribed burning, mechanical fuel reduction, mechanical fuel reduction followed by prescribed burning, and a nontreated control. To determine the effects of fuel reduction treatments on Phytophthora spp. in soil, incidences were assessed once before and twice after fuel reduction treatments were applied. Also, the efficiency of the baiting bioassay used to detect species of Phytophthora was evaluated, and the potential virulence of isolates of Phytophthora spp. collected from forest soils was determined. Phytophthora cinnamomi and P heveae were the only two species recovered from the study site. Incidences of these species were not significantly affected by fuel reduction treatments, but incidence of P cinnamomi increased over time. In the baiting bioassay, camellia leaf disks were better than hemlock needles as baits. P. cinnamomi was detected best in fresh soil, whereas P heveae was detected best when soil was air-dried and remoistened prior to baiting. Isolates of P. heveae were weakly virulent and, therefore, potentially pathogenic causing lesions only on wounded mountain laurel and rhododendron leaves; however, isolates of P cinnamomi were virulent and caused root rot and mortality on mountain laurel and white pine plants.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0191-2917			WOS:000291893300004

The use of genetic and genomic resources combined in a systems genetics approach offers a means for approaching this goal. This study describes a maize (Zea mays) gene coexpression network built from publicly available expression arrays. The maize network consisted of 2,071 loci that were divided into 34 distinct modules that contained 1,928 enriched functional annotation terms and 35 cofunctional gene clusters. Of note, 391 maize genes of unknown function were found to be coexpressed within modules along with genes of known function. A global network alignment was made between this maize network and a previously described rice (Oryza sativa) coexpression network. The IsoRankN tool was used, which incorporates both gene homology and network topology for the alignment. A total of 1,173 aligned loci were detected between the two grass networks, which condensed into 154 conserved subgraphs that preserved 4,758 coexpression edges in rice and 6,105 coexpression edges in maize. This study provides an early view into maize coexpression space and provides an initial network-based framework for the translation of functional genomic and genetic information between these two vital agricultural species.									60	4	0	53	1	62			0032-0889			WOS:000292294100024	21606319	
J	Gacchina, Carmen E.; Deb, Partha; Barth, Jeremy L.; Ramamurthi, Anand								Elastogenic Inductability of Smooth Muscle Cells from a Rat Model of Late Stage Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A				17	13-14			1699	1711		10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0526			JUL 2011	2011	Although abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) can be potentially stabilized by inhibiting inflammatory cell recruitment and their release of proteolytic enzymes, active AAA regression is not possible without regeneration of new elastic matrix structures. Unfortunately, postneonatal vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), healthy, and likely more so, diseased cells, poorly synthesize or remodel elastic fibers, impeding any effort directed at regenerative AAA treatment. Previously, we determined the eleastogenic benefits of oligomers (HA-o; 4-6 mers) of the glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan (HA) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) to healthy SMCs. Since AAAs are often diagnosed only late in development when matrix disruption is severe, we now determine if elastogenic upregulation of SMCs from late-stage AAAs (> 100% diameter increase) is possible. AAAs were induced by perfusion of rat infrarenal aortae with porcine pancreatic elastase. Elastic matrix degradation, vessel expansion (similar to 120%), inflammatory cell infiltration, and enhanced activity of matrix-metalloproteases (MMPs) 2 and 9 resulted, paralleling human AAAs. Aneurysmal SMCs (EaRASMCs) maintained a diseased phenotype in 2D cell culture and exhibited patterns of gene expression different from healthy rat aortic SMCs (RASMCs). Relative to passage-matched healthy RASMCs, unstimulated EaRASMCs produced far less tropoelastin and matrix elastin. Exogenous TGF-beta and HA-o (termed "factors") significantly decreased EaRASMC proliferation and enhanced tropoelastin synthesis, though only at the highest provided dose combination (20 mg/mL of HA-o, 10 ng/mL of TGF-beta); despite such enhancement, tropoelastin amounts were only similar to 40% of amounts synthesized by healthy RASMC cultures. Differently, elastic matrix synthesis was enhanced beyond amounts synthesized by healthy RASMCs (112%), even at lower doses of factors (2 mg/mL of HA-o and 5 ng/mL of TGF-beta). The factors also enhanced elastic fiber deposition over untreated EaRASMC cultures and restored several genes whose expression was altered in EaRASMC cultures back to levels expressed by healthy RASMCs. However, the activity of MMPs 2 and 9 generated by EaRASMC cultures was unaffected by the factors/factor dose. The study confirms that SMCs from advanced AAAs can be elastogenically induced, although much higher doses of elastogenic factors are required for induction relative to healthy SMCs. Also, the factors do not appear to inhibit MMP activity, vital to preserve existing elastic matrix structures that serve as nucleation sites for new elastic fiber deposition. Thus, to enhance net accumulation of newly regenerated elastic matrix, toward possibly regressing AAAs, codelivery of MMP inhibitors may be necessitated.									13	0	0	8	0	13			1937-3341			WOS:000292022300005	21341992

Radio transmitters were implanted in both juvenile and adult lake sturgeon in the Grasse River, New York, and individuals were relocated over a 2-year period. Adult lake sturgeon demonstrated greater minimum daily distance moved, absolute distance moved, and mean home range size than juvenile lake sturgeon during the spring. During the course of the study, both adult and juvenile lake sturgeon exhibited movements upstream and downstream through a breached low-head weir, and individuals did not necessarily remain resident on an annual basis in the Grasse River. Mesohabitat and substrate use patterns were determined based on comparisons of frequency distributions for relocated lake sturgeon and quantified mesohabitat and substrate over a 15-km river reach. Lake sturgeon used pool mesohabitat and limited their use of run mesohabitat under both low- and mid-flow conditions. During most of the year, adult and juvenile lake sturgeon were detected over silt substrate. This study illustrates behavioral differences and similarities between the movements and habitat use of adult and juvenile lake sturgeon in a riverine system.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000296142700013

Effect of cultural practices and fungicides on Phytophthora fruit rot of watermelon in the Carolinas								CROP PROTECTION				30	7			888	894		10.1016/j.cropro.2011.03.012			JUL 2011	2011	Phytophthora fruit rot of watermelon, caused by Phytophthora capsici, is an important and emerging disease in Southeastern U.S.A. The effects of two cultural practices (raised bare ground and raised plastic mulched beds) used for growing watermelon and different fungicide treatments on development of Phytophthora fruit rot were evaluated. The experiments were conducted over three years (2005-2008) at research stations in North Carolina and South Carolina, U.S.A. Fungicides were applied at weekly intervals on the diploid cv. Mickey Lee for an average of five applications. Fruit rot incidence was recorded at the end of each experiment. Fruit rot incidence in the non-treated plots was 66% across two states and six trials. Overall, the levels of fruit rot on the raised bare ground and raised plastic mulched beds were not significantly different. Based on percent disease reduction relative to the non-treated check plots, the fungicide Captan was the most effective across years and locations (range = 23-70%, mean = 57%), followed by mandipropamid (25-65%, mean = 50%), fluopicolide (24-65%, mean = 43%) and cyazofamid (0-48%, mean = 31%). Mefenoxam, the current standard treatment reduced fruit rot by 8-28% (mean = 18%). The addition of copper hydroxide to the spray mix did not significantly enhance effectiveness of Captan or mandipropamid. The variability in fungicide efficacy observed in these experiments across locations and years demonstrates the importance of environmental conditions in disease development and management. Even when the most effective fungicides are used, heavy losses may occur when conditions are highly favorable for disease development. Ultimately, effective control of Phytophthora fruit rot of watermelon will require an integrated management strategy that includes well-drained fields, water management and crop rotation in addition to fungicides.

J	Fleming, Jeff; Kirby, Chris								Long memory in volatility and trading volume								JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE				35	7			1714	1726		10.1016/j.jbankfin.2010.11.007			JUL 2011	2011	We use fractionally-integrated time-series models to investigate the joint dynamics of equity trading volume and volatility. Bollerslev and Jubinski (1999) show that volume and volatility have a similar degree of fractional integration, and they argue that this evidence supports a long-run view of the mixture-of-distributions hypothesis. We examine this issue using more precise volatility estimates obtained using high-frequency returns (i.e., realized volatilities). Our results indicate that volume and volatility both display long memory, but we can reject the hypothesis that the two series share a common order of fractional integration for a fifth of the firms in our sample. Moreover, we find a strong correlation between the innovations to volume and volatility, which suggests that trading volume can be used to obtain more precise estimates of daily volatility for cases in which high-frequency returns are unavailable.

The children targeted for this study were at elevated risk for problem behavior according to teachers' nominations and ratings. Three teachers in Head Start settings were selected to participate in this study. The Multi Option Observation System for Experimental Studies coding system was used to collect data on teacher and student behavior. The intervention included providing teachers with specific instruction in implementing precorrective statements and behavior-specific praise statements and then, after the intervention sessions, providing feedback on implementation. A multiple-baseline design was used, and baseline, intervention, and maintenance data were collected.

J	Gong, Zhiyun; Kiessler, Peter; Lund, Robert								A prediction-residual approach for identifying rare events in periodic time series								JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS				32	4	SI		407	419		10.1111/j.1467-9892.2011.00725.x			JUL 2011	2011	Many environmental time series have seasonal structures. This article presents an approach to identifying the rare events of such series based on time-series residuals. The methods justify the application of classical peaks over threshold methods to estimated versions of the one-step-ahead prediction errors of the series. Such methods enable the seasonal means, variances and autocorrelations of the series to be taken into account. Even in stationary settings, the proposed strategy is useful as it bypasses the need for blocking runs of extremes. The mathematics are justified via a limit theorem for a periodic autoregressive moving-average time series. A detailed application to a daily temperature series from Griffin, Georgia, is pursued.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0143-9782			WOS:000291402300007

The equipment used in this study was originally designed for the precision glass molding (PGM) process and was then modified for friction measurement. The ultimate aim of this research is to study and characterize the frictional behavior between glass and a mold surface at elevated temperatures typical of the PGM process and under conditions similar to those for this process. This paper describes the design of the apparatus, and validation experiments using a steel-steel material pair at room temperature for comparison with values reported in the literature. The average friction coefficient between the steel-steel pair was found to be 0.17. Subsequent experiments using steel against steel and BK-7 glass against steel, found the stick-slip phenomena is happening at 577 degrees C. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The reaction of Pd(OAc)(2) and bis(benzimidazolium) salts in DMSO gave the monomeric palladium complex in which the N-heterocyclic carbene was bound to the metal centre. The crystal and molecular structure of the cis-dibromo{1,1'-di[2,3,4,5,6-pentamethylbenzyl]-3,3'-butylene-dibenzimidazol-2,2'-diylidene}-palladium(II) complex was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The activity of the Pd(II) complexes in the direct arylation of benzothiazole with arylbromides was investigated.

Production of Astaxanthin from Cellulosic Biomass Sugars by Mutants of the Yeast Phaffia rhodozyma								APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				164	5			655	665		10.1007/s12010-011-9165-7			JUL 2011	2011	Astaxanthin is a potential high-value coproduct in an ethanol biorefinery. Three mutant strains of the astaxanthin-producing yeast Phaffia rhodozyma, which were derived from the parent strain ATCC 24202 (UCD 67-210) and designated JTM166, JTM185, and SSM19, were tested for their capability of utilizing the major sugars that can be generated from cellulosic biomass, including glucose, xylose, and arabinose, for astaxanthin production. While all three strains were capable of metabolizing these sugars, individually and in mixtures, JTM185 demonstrated the greatest sugar utilization and astaxanthin production. Astaxanthin yield by this strain (milligrams astaxanthin per gram of sugar consumed) was highest for xylose, followed by arabinose and then glucose. The kinetics of sugar utilization by strain JTM185 was studied in fermenters using mixtures of glucose, xylose, and arabinose at varied concentrations. It was found that glucose was utilized preferentially, followed by xylose, and lastly, arabinose. Astaxanthin yield was significantly affected by sugar concentrations. Highest yields were observed with sugar mixtures containing the highest concentrations of xylose and arabinose. Hydrolysates produced from sugarcane bagasse and barley straw pretreated by the soaking in aqueous ammonia method and hydrolyzed with the commercial cellulase preparation, Accellerase (TM) 1000, were used for astaxanthin production by the mutant strain JTM185. The organism was capable of metabolizing all of the sugars present in the hydrolysates from both biomass sources and produced similar amounts of astaxanthin from both hydrolysates, although these amounts were lower when compared to yields obtained with reagent grade sugars.									8	1	0	5	0	9			0273-2289			WOS:000290803900009	21274657

Such claims are predicated on a presumption that markets and polities are meaningfully separate entities. To the contrary, we argue that contemporary arrangements create an entangled political economy that renders theorizing based on separation often misleading. Within this alternative framework of entangled political economy, we illuminate both the recent Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and the New Deal's National Recovery Administration (NRA).									14	0	0	0	0	14			0048-5829			WOS:000290769900003

The three-dimensional finite element models of these two arch bridges, built in the ANSYS finite element program, are used to predict bridge dynamic characteristics, such as natural frequencies and mode shapes. Following the analytical study, ambient vibration tests were conducted to experimentally obtain dynamic characteristics of these two bridges. During ambient vibration tests, accelerometers were placed at several points on the bridge to collect the vibration response due to natural and operational excitation sources. Enhanced frequency domain decomposition and stochastic subspace identification techniques were used to extract the experimental natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios. Finite element models of the two arch bridges were adjusted such that the model predictions reproduce the ambient vibration test results with increased fidelity. The behavior of the masonry arch bridges under earthquake excitation recorded during the Erzincan Earthquake in 1992 is simulated by both the initial and adjusted finite element models. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of model calibration and ambient vibration testing. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While carrying out this analysis, the hierarchical multi-scale (atoms/ions-molecular chains-fibrils-fibers-yarn) of the problem was taken into account. To construct various defects, the appropriate open-literature experimental and computational results were used while the concentration of defects was set to the values comparable with their counterparts observed under "prototypical" polymers synthesis and fiber fabrication conditions. Due to the stochastic nature of the defect distributions, their effect on the yarn-level strength and ductility are included in the form of the corresponding two-level Weibull distribution. As far as the material stiffness is concerned, it was assumed that the first-order effect of the defects is to change the mean value of the stiffness parameters and that this effect is of a deterministic character. While upgrading the yarn-level material model for Kevlar(A (R)) it was recognized that a yarn is an assembly of nearly parallel fibers (often lightly twisted, or tied with wrap-around filaments) with relatively weak lateral coupling.									16	0	0	1	1	16			0022-2461			WOS:000289903200007		
J	Kowalski, Robin M.; Fedina, Cristin								Cyber bullying in ADHD and Asperger Syndrome populations								RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS				5	3			1201	1208		10.1016/j.rasd.2011.01.007			JUL-SEP 2011	2011	Cyber bullying or electronic bullying refers to bullying that occurs through the Internet or cellular phones. With the rise of technology, researchers have shown a keen interest in the topic of cyber bullying. However, that interest has not extended to individuals with special needs. To address this gap in the literature, the current study examined the prevalence of both "traditional" bullying and cyber bullying in youth with ADHD and/or Asperger's Syndrome, and assessed the social, psychological, and health effects of bullying on participants. In addition, the study addressed the disconnect between parents' understanding of their child's online experiences and their child's actual experiences in the virtual world. Forty-two children and youth reported high rates of bullying victimization through both traditional and electronic means. Individuals not involved with bullying showed greater levels of physical and psychological health relative to those involved with bullying. Parents and children disagreed on a number of issues related to use of the Internet, indicating the need for more clear communication between parents and their children. The results are discussed in terms of theory of mind, both for self and for others. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									28	0	0	3	0	28			1750-9467			WOS:000289327200028

Propolis ethanolic extract (PEE) was separated and purified by liquid-liquid extraction and thin layer chromatography (TLC) and the most active band was subjected to HPLC-MS/MS to identify the antifungal compounds. The results showed PEE and its fractions had strong antifungal activity against P. italicum. Among the fractions of PEE partitioned by petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water, ethyl acetate fraction (E-Fr) exhibited the most effective activity against P. italicum. Further bioautographic TLC assay showed Band I, with Rf value of 0.70, had an inhibitive zone, which showed the strongest antifungal activity and completely inhibited the growth of P. italicum at 200 mg/L. Bioactive components found in Band I were further identified as pinobanksin, pinocembrine, chrysin and galangin. This study exhibited Chinese propolis and its main flavonoids was potential natural alternatives for the control of citrus blue mould caused by P. italicum.

J	Hayes, W. W.; Manson, J. R.								Scattering of Xe from Graphite								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				115	25	SI		6838	6842		10.1021/jp111153q			JUN 30 2011	2011	Recently a series of experimental measurements for the scattering of Xe atoms from graphite has been reported for both energy-resolved spectra and angular distributions. This system is of fundamental interest because the projectile Xe atoms are considerably more massive than the carbon atoms making up the graphite surface. These measurements were initially analyzed using the hard cubes model and molecular dynamics simulations, and both treatments indicated that the scattering process was a single collision in which the incoming Xe atom interacted strongly with a large number of carbon atoms in the outermost graphite layer. In this work we analyze the data using a single scattering theory that has been shown to explain a number of other experiments on molecular beam scattering from surfaces. These calculations confirm that the scattering process is a single collision with an effective surface mass that is substantially larger than that of the basic graphite ring.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1089-5639			WOS:000291895500011	21410274

The angular intensity distributions of scattered oxygen molecules were measured at incident energies from 291 to 614 meV with surface temperatures from 150 to 500 K Every observed distribution has a single peak at a larger final angle than the specular angle of 45 degrees which indicates that the normal component of the translation energy of the oxygen molecule is lost by the collision with the graphite surface. The amount of the energy loss by the collision has been roughly estimated as about 30-41% based on the assumption of the tangential momentum conservation during the collision. The distributions have also been analyzed with two theoretical models, the hard cubes model and the smooth surface model. These results indicate that the scattering dominated by a single collision event of the particle with a flat surface having a large effective mass. The derived effective mass of the graphite surface for the incoming oxygen is 9-12 times heavier than that of a single carbon atom, suggesting a large cooperative motion of the carbon atoms in the topmost graphene layer									5	0	0	0	0	5			1089-5639			WOS:000291895500042	21446680

Some degree of vanadium-induced thermopower enhancement was found to be present even at temperatures as high as 800 K. Electrical resistivity values of the vanadium-doped samples, on the other hand, exhibited only modest increases, thereby resulting in a 120% increase in the thermoelectric power factor of Hf0.75Zr0.25NiSn above room temperature. Such augmentation of the Seebeck coefficient, however, was diminished at all measured temperatures with the addition of a sufficient quantity of antimony to dope this class of compounds optimally. These observations are discussed in terms of carrier concentration, mobility, effective mass, and calculations of the effective gap size. When taken in conjunction with low temperature heat capacity measurements, these results indicate an increase in the density of states at the Fermi level that is consistent with the resonant state phenomena investigated earlier by theoretical work on semiconductors.									17	0	0	0	0	17			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000292218700002

The conformation of conjugated polymers affects their electro-optical properties and therefore is critical to their current and potential uses, though only limited theoretical knowledge is available regarding the factors that control their configuration. The present study investigates the affects of molecular parameters including molecular weight of the polymer and chemical structure of the side chains of PPEs in different solvents on the conformation of the polymers. The PPEs are modeled atomistically where the solvents are modeled both implicitly and explicitly. The study finds that PPEs assume extended configuration which is affected by the length of the polymer backbone and the nature and length of substituting side chains. While the polymer remains extended, local dynamics is retained and no long range correlations are observed within the backbone. The results are compared with scattering experiments.

An In Vitro Model of the Glomerular Capillary Wall Using Electrospun Collagen Nanofibres in a Bioartificial Composite Basement Membrane								PLOS ONE				6	6					e20802	10.1371/journal.pone.0020802			JUN 24 2011	2011	The filtering unit of the kidney, the glomerulus, contains capillaries whose walls function as a biological sieve, the glomerular filtration barrier. This comprises layers of two specialised cells, glomerular endothelial cells (GEnC) and podocytes, separated by a basement membrane. Glomerular filtration barrier function, and dysfunction in disease, remains incompletely understood, partly due to difficulties in studying the relevant cell types in vitro. We have addressed this by generation of unique conditionally immortalised human GEnC and podocytes. However, because the glomerular filtration barrier functions as a whole, it is necessary to develop three dimensional co-culture models to maximise the benefit of the availability of these cells. Here we have developed the first two tri-layer models of the glomerular capillary wall. The first is based on tissue culture inserts and provides evidence of cell-cell interaction via soluble mediators. In the second model the synthetic support of the tissue culture insert is replaced with a novel composite bioartificial membrane. This consists of a nanofibre membrane containing collagen I, electrospun directly onto a micro-photoelectroformed fine nickel supporting mesh. GEnC and podocytes grew in monolayers on either side of the insert support or the novel membrane to form a tri-layer model recapitulating the human glomerular capillary in vitro. These models will advance the study of both the physiology of normal glomerular filtration and of its disruption in glomerular disease.									12	0	0	6	0	12			1932-6203			WOS:000292036900006	21731625	
J	Dong, Liang								A vector boundary matching technique for efficient and accurate determination of photonic bandgaps in photonic bandgap fibers								OPTICS EXPRESS				19	13			12582	12593		10.1364/OE.19.012582			JUN 20 2011	2011	A vector boundary matching technique has been proposed and demonstrated for finding photonic bandgaps in photonic bandgap fibers with circular nodes. Much improved accuracy, comparing to earlier works, comes mostly from using more accurate cell boundaries for each mode at the upper and lower edges of the band of modes. It is recognized that the unit cell boundary used for finding each mode at band edges of the 2D cladding lattice is not only dependent on whether it is a mode at upper or lower band edge, but also on the azimuthal mode number and lattice arrangements. Unit cell boundaries for these modes are determined by mode symmetries which are governed by the azimuthal mode number as well as lattice arrangement due to mostly geometrical constrains. Unit cell boundaries are determined for modes at both upper and lower edges of bands of modes dominated by m = 1 and m = 2 terms in their longitudinal field Fourier-Bessel expansion series, equivalent to LP0s and LP1s modes in the approximate LP mode representations, for hexagonal lattice to illustrate the technique. The novel technique is also implemented in vector form and incorporates a transfer matrix algorithm for the consideration of nodes with arbitrary refractive index profiles. Both are desired new capabilities for further explorations of advanced new designs of photonic bandgap fibers.

The FBG fabrication system enables writing of long FBGs by a continuous translate-and-write process and allows implementation of arbitrary chirp and apodization. A key innovation is that the local Bragg wavelength is controlled by a simple movement of the phase mask by a PZT in the direction perpendicular to its surface. The focus position of the two writing beams is not changed during the Bragg wavelength change, an intrinsic feature of the design, ensuring simplicity, robustness and stability. Apodization can be achieved by vibrating the phase mask in the direction parallel to its surface by a PZT. Phase steps can also be inserted in FBGs at any desired locations by stepping the same PZT. A long uniform FBG and a linearly chirped FBG are written to demonstrate the performance of the setup.

The interplay of the two screening constants allow an exploration of the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. By using analytical, as well as numerical, renormalization group methods, we study the temperature dependence of the thermal conductance and the Lorentz number. We find that in the low-temperature limit, the Lorentz number attains its universal value, irrespective of the nature of the ground state.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1098-0121			WOS:000291798300009

The pure and RE-doped BCT23 ceramics sintered at 1450 degrees C in air for 4 h showed a dense microstructure in all ceramics. The use of RE ions as dopants introduced lattice-parameter changes that manifested in the reduction of the volume of the unit cell. RE-doped BCT23 samples exhibit a more homogenous microstructure due to the absence of a Ti-rich phase in the grain boundaries as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy imaging. The incorporation of REs led to perturbations of the local symmetry of TiO6 octahedra and the creation of a new Raman mode. The results of Raman scattering measurements indicated that the Curie temperature of the ferroelectric phase transition depends on the RE ion and ion content, with the Curie temperature shifting toward lower values as the RE content increases, with the exception of Yb3+ doping, which did not affect the ferroelectric phase transition temperature. The phase transition behavior is explained using the standard soft mode model. Electronic paramagnetic resonance measurements showed the existence of Ti vacancies in the structure of RE-doped BCT23. Defects are created via charge compensation mechanisms due to the incorporation of elements with a different valence state relative to the ions of the pure BCT23 host. It is concluded that the Ti vacancies are responsible for the activation of the Raman mode at 840 cm(-1), which is in agreement with lattice dynamics calculations.

Preparation of Polymer-Coated, Scintillating Ion-Exchange Resins for Monitoring of Tc-99 in Groundwater								ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				83	12			4759	4766		10.1021/ac103311p			JUN 15 2011	2011	The present study was oriented to prepare new scintillating anion-exchange resins for measurement of (TcO4-)-Tc-99 in natural waters. The organic fluor 2-(1-naphthyl)-5-phenyloxazole was diffused into (chloromethyl)polystyrene resin. Thereafter, a thin layer of poly[[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]-trimethylammonium chloride] was grafted from the resin surface by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization as an attempt to overcome potential problems related to the leaching of fluor molecules during usage. The residual chloromethyl groups of the polymer-coated resin were aminated by reaction with two different tertiary amines, triethylamine (TEA) and methyldioctylamine (MDOA). Off- and on-line quantification of Tc-99 was achieved with high detection efficiencies of 60.72 +/- 1.93% and 72.83 +/- 0.81% for resin with TEA and MDOA functional groups, respectively. The detection limit was determined to be less than the maximum contaminant level (33 Bq L-1) established under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The two functionalized resins were demonstrated to be selective for pertechnetate from synthetic groundwater containing up to 1000 ppm Cl-, SO42-, and HCO3- and up to 1200 ppb Cr2O72- in an acidic medium.									8	0	0	3	0	8			0003-2700			WOS:000291499800024	21609030

Comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses of the O-methyltransferase gene family in Populus								GENE				479	1-2			37	46		10.1016/j.gene.2011.02.008			JUN 15 2011	2011	S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) dependent O-methyltransferases (OMTs) proteins are involved in the methylation of various secondary metabolites. The OMT genes have been studied in various plants, but these studies focused either on a single or a small set of genes. Moreover, no comprehensive study was published yet on the OMT gene family in a tree species. To investigate the evolutionary history of this gene family and the functional diversification of its members, phylogenetic and several comparative genomics analyses were performed. Phylogeny across land plant lineages showed that OMT genes were distributed in two main classes deeply rooted in the phylogeny of land plants, suggesting that they have evolved by a gene duplication that had happen in the ancestor of land plants. COMT and COMT-like genes were clustering with few flavonoid and multifunctional OMT genes in class II. Class I included flavonoid, simple phenol, and multifunctional OMT genes. All 26 Populus OMT genes were located in segmental duplication blocks and two third of them were tandem duplicated, indicating the role of duplication processes in the expansion of this gene family. Expression profiling of OMT genes in Populus showed that only PoptrOMT25 was differentially expressed in xylem. The other genes were differentially expressed in leaves, bark, or both. Some OMT genes showed differential expression patterns under various biotic and abiotic stresses. The divergence of protein sequences, the phylogenetic distribution, and the expression of COMT and COMT-like genes suggest that they have evolved different functions or tissue specificities following duplications.

The phonon thermal conductivity of these alloys was sharply reduced relative to that of elemental Bi and Bi2Te3 for temperatures below 100 K. Our measurements suggested that defects reduce the thermal conductivity in these materials. Using the Debye-Callaway model for heat transport, we link this reduced thermal conductivity to point defects.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1098-0121			WOS:000291603500005

Optical engineering (Redondo Beach, Calif.)				50	6									2011-Jun-13	2011	The optical cryptosystem based on phase-shifting interferometry (PSI) is one of the most interesting optical cryptographic schemes in recent years. However, we find that the PSI technique provides an attractive method to record the ciphertext, but contributes little to the security level of the cryptosystem. From the cryptanalysis point of view, in a certain simplified case, an attacker is only required to crack two equivalent decryption keys instead of the original random phase keys and geometric key. Moreover, a chosen-plaintext attack method is proposed, in which an impulse function is chosen as a known plaintext. By using this attack, the attacker can effectively recover any plaintext from the corresponding ciphertext. The validity of the attack is verified by computer simulations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0091-3286			MEDLINE:23894214	23894214

The Mei5-Sae3 protein complex functions as a recombination mediator to promote nucleation of the Dmc1 recombinase onto replication protein A-coated single-stranded DNA. Here, we have expressed and purified the Mei5 protein, Sae3 protein and the Mei5-Sae3 complex for biochemical studies. We show the Mei5-Sae3 complex preferentially binds a fork-like DNA substrate to 3' overhanging DNA, single-stranded DNA or double-stranded DNA. We demonstrate that Mei5 confers DNA binding activity to the Mei5-Sae3 complex. We determined Mei5-Sae3 interacts with the Rad51 recombinase through the N-terminal domain of Mei5. Unlike Rad52, Mei5-Sae3 lacks recombination mediator activity for Rad51. Importantly, we find that the Mei5-Sae3 complex does not harbor single-strand DNA annealing activity. These properties of the Mei5-Sae3 complex distinguishes it from the Rad52 protein, which serves as the mediator of Rad51 and is involved in the single-strand DNA annealing pathway of homologous recombination.

This paper describes a software package, Polynome, offered as a web service, that helps users construct Boolean network models based on experimental data and biological input. The key feature is a discrete analog of parameter estimation for continuous models. With only experimental data as input, the software can be used as a tool for reverse-engineering of Boolean network models from experimental time course data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Two pyrene derivatives, 1-pyreneacetic acid (PyAA) and 1-docosyloxylmethylpyrene (DomP), which are hydrophilic and hydrophobic, respectively, were evaluated on their noncovalent interactions with SWNTs, as relevant to their selectivity and applicability to the postproduction separation. The results suggested that the interactions were not only dependent on molecular structures but also sensitive to solvent conditions and that a relatively lower solvent strength environment (solutions of less polar solvents) might be more favorable to the realization of the selectivity between interactions with metallic and semiconducting SWNTs. The surprising differences for the two pyrene derivatives in terms of their doping effects on the band gap transitions in semiconducting SWNTs are also reported and discussed.									14	0	0	0	0	14			1932-7447			WOS:000291079900012

The as-prepared SMAD indium nanoparticles are polydispersed with particle size ranging from 25 to 50 nm, but upon digestive ripening (heating of colloidal material at the boiling point of solvent in presence of excess surface active ligands) in methylene chloride, a remarkable reduction of particle size was achieved. In higher boiling solvent (toluene), where the indium nanoparticles at reflux temperature are probably melted, it does not allow the best result, and less monodispersity is achieved. We employed different surface active ligands (amine, phosphine, and mixed ligands) to passivate these indium nanoparticles. The temporal evolution of the surface plasmon of indium nanoparticles was monitored by in situ UV-vis spectroscopy, and particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The merits of this synthesis procedure are the use of bulk indium as starting material, tuning the particle size in low boiling point solvent, particle size adjustment with the choice of ligand, and a possible scale up.									32	0	0	0	0	32			0020-1669			WOS:000290978400040	21520906

In the discrete case sites and clients are represented by vertices of a graph, in the continuous case by points of a network. The axiomatic approach seeks to uniquely distinguish certain specific location functions among all the arbitrary functions that address this problem by using a list of intuitively pleasing axioms. The median function minimizes the sum of the distances to the client locations. This function satisfies three simple and natural axioms: anonymity, betweenness, and consistency. They suffice on tree networks (continuous case) as shown by Vohra (1996) [19], and on cube-free median graphs (discrete case) as shown by McMorris et al. (1998) [9]. In the latter paper, in the case of arbitrary median graphs, a fourth axiom was added to characterize the median function. In this note we show that the above three natural axioms still suffice for the hypercubes, a special instance of arbitrary median graphs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Stochastic models have the potential to absorb noise, account for un-certainty, and help avoid data overfitting. Within the frame work of probabilistic polynomial dynamical systems, we present an algorithm for the reverse engineering of any gene regulatory network as a discrete, probabilistic polynomial dynamical system. The resulting stochastic model is assembled from all minimal models in the model space and the probability assignment is based on partitioning the model space according to the likeliness with which a minimal model explains the observed data. We used this method to identify stochastic models for two published synthetic network models. In both cases, the generated model retains the key features of the original model and compares favorably to the resulting models from other algorithms.									1	0	0	1	0	1				1687-4153		MEDLINE:21910920	21910920

Two such systems have been proposed: (a) s-wave superconductor pair potential is proximity induced on a semiconductor and (b) pair potential naturally arises from an intrinsic s-wave pairing interaction. As it is now well known, such systems in the form of a two-dimensional (2D) film or 1D nano-wires in a wire network can be used in topological quantum computation. When the external Zeeman splitting Gamma crosses a critical value Gamma(c), the system passes from a regular superconducting phase to a non-Abelian topological superconducting phase. In both cases (a) and (b) that we consider in this paper, the pair potential Delta is strictly s-wave in both the ordinary and the topological superconducting phases, which are separated by a topological quantum critical point at Gamma(c) = root Delta(2) + mu(2), where mu (>> Delta) is the chemical potential. On the other hand, since Gamma(c) >> Delta, the Zeeman splitting required for the topological phase (Gamma > Gamma(c)) far exceeds the value (Gamma similar to Delta) above which an s-wave pair potential is expected to vanish (and the system to become non-superconducting) in the absence of SO coupling. We are thus led to the situation that the topological superconducting phase appears to set in a parameter regime at which the system is actually non-superconducting in the absence of SO coupling. In this paper, we address the question of how a pure s-wave pair potential can survive a strong Zeeman field to give rise to a topological superconducting phase. We show that the SO coupling is the crucial parameter for the quantum transition into and the robustness of the topologically non-trivial superconducting phase realized for Gamma >> Delta.									39	0	0	0	0	39			1367-2630			WOS:000292138000001

After guided observation with teachers, students implemented a regular monthly survey on their own. Publications in popular magazines, posters at professional conferences, and seminars in local schools were some follow-up activities. This experience fostered the concept of sustainable use of natural resources through contact with traders who sell endangered animals to make a living. Market surveys provide an economical and practical project-based learning experience. With minor adjustment, market surveys are a feasible learning experience for students in both developing and well-developed countries.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0021-9266	2157-6009		WOS:000300144300003

Exploring the parametric amplification phenomenon for energy harvesting								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING				225	I4	SI		456	466		10.1177/2041304110401145			JUN 2011	2011	Due to inherent system nonlinearities, many vibratory excitation sources possess a frequency spectrum which contains energy components at multiple integers of the fundamental frequency of the source. In this paper, we theoretically explore the prospect of enhancing the transduction of a vibratory energy harvester (VEH) by utilizing the parametric amplification phenomenon to channel energy from one of these superharmonics, namely the one at twice the fundamental frequency, to a purely resistive load. Towards that end, we consider a piezoelectric cantilevered-type bimorph harvester and show that by tilting the axis of the beam through a proper angle with respect to the direction of excitation, it is possible to utilize a parametric pump to enhance the output power at the fundamental frequency. Percentage improvement in the output power depends on the excitation's parameters and the mechanical damping ratio. It is observed that when the mechanical damping ratio is small, significant enhancement in the output power is attainable even when the magnitude of the superharmonic is small when compared to the fundamental frequency. Such findings reveal that, under certain conditions, parametric amplification can be utilized to enhance the output power of a VEH especially for microscale applications where the damping ratio can be easily controlled.									9	0	0	1	0	9			0959-6518			WOS:000293915700002

Biofabris, Inct/I-2418-2013				Scalable robotic biofabrication of tissue spheroids								BIOFABRICATION				3	2					025002	10.1088/1758-5082/3/2/025002			JUN 2011	2011	Development of methods for scalable biofabrication of uniformly sized tissue spheroids is essential for tissue spheroid-based bioprinting of large size tissue and organ constructs. The most recent scalable technique for tissue spheroid fabrication employs a micromolded recessed template prepared in a non-adhesive hydrogel, wherein the cells loaded into the template self-assemble into tissue spheroids due to gravitational force. In this study, we present an improved version of this technique. A new mold was designed to enable generation of 61 microrecessions in each well of a 96-well plate. The microrecessions were seeded with cells using an EpMotion 5070 automated pipetting machine. After 48 h of incubation, tissue spheroids formed at the bottom of each microrecession. To assess the quality of constructs generated using this technology, 600 tissue spheroids made by this method were compared with 600 spheroids generated by the conventional hanging drop method. These analyses showed that tissue spheroids fabricated by the micromolded method are more uniform in diameter. Thus, use of micromolded recessions in a non-adhesive hydrogel, combined with automated cell seeding, is a reliable method for scalable robotic fabrication of uniform-sized tissue spheroids.									19	0	0	9	0	19			1758-5082			WOS:000294954500004	21562365

Ago2 is required for essential cellular processes and plays a role in dictating translation of proteins. Commercial antibodies have been utilized for the detection of human and mouse Ago2 using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting; however, data describing detection in additional mammalian species are currently lacking. Therefore, we evaluated the use of a commercial polyclonal antibody in detecting Ago2 in bovine and porcine tissues. Tissue samples were collected at slaughter and either flash-frozen for western blotting or fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin for IHC. When bovine and porcine tissue extracts were analyzed by western blotting, anti-Ago2 detected a predominant protein band of similar to 108 kDa which closely corresponds to the predicted molecular weight for Ago2; however, multiple bands of lesser intensity and molecular weight were also detected. Using the same antibody, fluorescent IHC on paraffin sections resulted in positive staining for both bovine and porcine tissues including kidney, liver, pancreas, and spleen. Staining for Ago2 was localized in the cytoplasm and appeared to be cell type-specific, with higher signal intensity in endothelial cells, leukocytes, and endocrine cells.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0147-8885			WOS:000293082000004

Unlike parallel OCT techniques that also use area scan cameras, the conventional single-mode fiber-based point-scanning mechanism is retained to provide a confocal gate that rejects multiply scattered photons from the sample. When using a 1000 Hz resonant scanner as the streak scanner, 1,016,000 A-scans have been obtained in 1 s. This method's effectiveness has been demonstrated by recording in vivo OCT-image sequences of embryonic chick hearts at 1000 frames/s. In addition, 2-megahertz OCT data have been obtained with another high speed camera. (C) 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Electrochemical characterization of a bioceramic material: The shell of the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica								BIOELECTROCHEMISTRY				81	2			91	98		10.1016/j.bioelechem.2011.04.002			JUN 2011	2011	The shell of the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is composed of multiple incongruent mineralized layers. This bioceramic composite material was investigated to determine the effects of shell thickness, orientation and layer composition on its electrochemical behavior using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy. SEM-EDS analysis of the oyster shell revealed that the multilayered biocomposite material is composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). EIS measurements in 3.5 wt.% NaCl indicated that the impedance of the whole oyster shell in the low frequency region exhibited high impedance values which exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing immersion time. In terms of overall shell thickness, limiting currents measured by potentiodynamic techniques through the shell were observed to increase when the outer layers of the shell were sequentially removed by grinding, thus decreasing the shell thickness. These limiting current values remained relatively constant when the inner layers of the shell were removed. The impedance values of the oyster shell material as measured by EIS were shown to decrease with decreasing shell thickness. These findings suggest that the prismatic (outermost) shell layer in combination with the soluble organic matrix between all shell layers may influence the ionic conductivity through the oyster shell.

Specifically, we seek to answer two questions. (i) As an ion approaches the surface from far away, does the first electron that it captures originate from the exposed dielectric layer or the metal underneath it? (ii) What is the ion's distance from the metal when the first electron is captured? To answer these questions, the classical potential that an electron is subject to during the interaction is calculated. The dielectric film is treated as a continuum with simple band structure. We input the parameters from recent experiments (Co with 1.5 nm thick Al2O3 film) and found that (i) the first capture proceeds from the metal, and (ii) the dielectric film extends the distance threshold for first capture compared to a metal with no film.

The slope of the MTJ conductance sigma(c) as a function of fluence varies with different tunnel barrier thicknesses d, levels of oxidation (stoichiometry) and charge state q. Since the MTJ conductance after HCI irradiation is due to tunneling, the increased conductance can result from thinning the barrier, reducing the effective tunnel barrier height phi, or both. Measurements of the current-voltage profile provide sufficient degrees of freedom to substantially constrain d and phi provided the reduction of the barrier remains within the assumptions of the commonly used WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) tunneling formalism. For the Xe32+ ions discussed here the perturbation of the tunnel barrier is much weaker than in our previously reported measurements of Xe44+ and application of WIG is still reasonable. This analysis reveals a trend of decreasing d while phi changes little.

While a-C:D structures evolve monotonically towards impact-modified surfaces, the graphite system exhibits layer-by-layer, cyclical modification and evolves towards a steady state different from its amorphous counterpart. Longer-ranged potentials also have a noticeable effect on the interfacial structure and surface modifications under impact. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Techniques based on light scattering represent one possible monitoring method. In this study, numerical simulations were conducted to examine the errors involved in soot characterization using light scattering techniques. Specifically, this study focused on examining the error caused by the approximate fractal scattering models based on the Rayleigh-Deybe-Gans theory (the RDG-FA model). When the angular scattering properties were used to retrieve parameters of soot aggregates (the radius of gyration and the fractal dimension), the RDG-FA method was observed to cause a relative error of similar to 10% for a representative set of soot parameters. The effects of measurement uncertainties were also investigated. Our results revealed the pattern of the errors: the errors consisted of a relatively constant baseline error caused by the RDG-FA approximation and an error increasing with the measurement uncertainties. These results are expected to be useful in the analysis and interpretation of experimental data, and also in the determination of the accuracy and applicable range of scattering techniques.

When the rotating speed is increased, the trapped cell experiences an augmented viscous drag force, and eventually it escapes from the trap at the critical rotating speed: when the drag force is greater than the trapping force. With experimental verifications, the method can easily be employed to differentiate cells in terms of trapping forces due to different refractive indices. The proposed method is a simple, robust, accurate and noninvasive label-free technique for cell detection. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

The surviving E. coli O157:H7 population was analyzed by direct plating and enrichment. Optimal and suboptimal compost mixes, with carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios of 25: 1 and 16: 1, respectively, were compared in this study. In the optimal compost mix, E. coli O157:H7 survived for 72, 48, and 24 h in compost with 40% moisture and for 72, 24, and 24 h with 50% moisture at 50, 55, and 60 degrees C, respectively, following 2 days of come-up time (rate of heating up). However, in the suboptimal compost mix, the pathogen survived for 288, 72, and 48 h in compost with 40% moisture and for 240, 72, 24 h in compost with 50% moisture at the same temperatures, respectively. Pathogen survival was longer, with 5 days of come-up time compared with 2 days of come-up. Overall, E. coli O157:H7 was inactivated faster in the compost with 50% moisture than in the compost with 40% at 55 and 60 degrees C. Both moisture and come-up time were significant factors affecting Weibull model parameters. Our results suggest that slow come-up time at the beginning of composting can extend pathogen survival during composting. Additionally, both the C/N ratio and the initial moisture level in the compost mix affect the rate of pathogen inactivation as well.									14	1	0	12	0	15			0099-2240			WOS:000291341800026	21498743

To better understand the Perioperative Services processes, this study tracked staff members as they perform their activities. A challenging aspect of documenting the processes observed while tracking the Perioperative Services staff is to record the specific times and order in which the activities took place. The Perioperative Services is a fast-paced, dynamic environment where the staff members often perform multiple tasks that may also be interrupted, and each staff member may perform these tasks in their own sequence. To meet the needs of accurate data gathering, an iPhone/iPod Touch application was developed. It provides several advantages over the traditional paper/pencil method: (1) time stamps are instantaneous and consistent among the data collectors, (2) activities are entered via swipe-and- click capability, (3) multiple active tasks and interruptions can be tracked, and (4) collected data can be output to Microsoft Excel or Access for analysis. The "app" has proven to be useful in capturing data for our study. This technology can be customized and applied to similar settings at other hospitals.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1538-2931			WOS:000291927300007	21697656

The details of the preparation of the PE-modified binder and the results on variation of binder properties with blending temperature and blending time are presented. Results of various tests carried out on the different PE blends indicated enhanced binder properties like improved storage stability, resistance to aging, degradation, and temperature susceptibility. It is observed that viscosity at a given temperature increases with the addition of PE in the binder. Dynamic shear rheometer test results revealed that PE-modified binders (when subjected to the same stress) experienced lower strains than the neat asphalt; in addition, tan delta values of PE-modified binders considerably decreased as the PE content was increased. It was found that 5% PE content in modified asphalt by weight is adequate in terms of enhanced binder properties studied. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000235.

This paper used a series of restrained slab tests to illustrate the importance of specimen geometry on the restrained shrinkage cracking behavior. While restraint was provided along the base of the slab, a portion of the slab was left unbonded to the base in the center of the specimen. The length of this unbonded portion was varied to demonstrate its impact on the age of cracking and crack width that occurred. The age of cracking was measured using visual analysis, image analysis, conductive surface coating, and acoustic emission. Whereas image analysis and conductive paint detect cracks only after they appear on the surface, acoustic emission also provides information on damage development before the cracks were visible. Cracking occurred in a less stable fashion in slabs with a larger unbonded region. The larger unbonded length in a slab caused wider cracks to appear at an earlier age than in a slab with a smaller unbonded region. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000247.

Oncology nurses should be knowledgeable about the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) and its applications to clinical practice. GINA is the first federal law passed to protect U.S. citizens with inherited disorders from being treated unfairly because of their genetic makeup. Understanding the legislation known as GINA, including how it modifies existing federal laws governing health insurance coverage and employment discrimination, can assist oncology nurses in providing important education and advocating for patients and their extended families. Federal agencies that govern and enforce GINA's provisions are identified. Case situations are included to demonstrate how to apply information concerning GINA to patients with cancer and their families who are considering or have already completed genetic testing. Privacy of genetic information is a timely issue but difficult to understand; therefore, provisions of GINA should be addressed and evaluated carefully.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1092-1095			WOS:000291381000006	21624856

Metal Ion Coordinating Properties of the Highly Preorganized Tetradentate Ligand 1,10-Phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxaldehyde-2,9-dioxime								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY					17			2706	2711		10.1002/ejic.201100090			JUN 2011	2011	Use of UV/Vis spectroscopy to measure protonation and formation constants of PDOX (1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxaldehyde-2,9-dioxime) is reported. All complexes all show a protonation constant of an oxime that is quite close to pK(a1) for the free ligand, that is, for Zn-II logK for ZnPDOX + H+ reversible arrow ZnPDOXH+. This is in agreement with literature crystal structures, which show that, for small metal ions such as Zn-II, one oxime group of PDOX is left non-coordinated. Only for Pb-II is the protonation constant of the PDOX complex significantly lowered, to a value of 8.2. In order to investigate the high logK(1) value for the Pb-II/PDOX complex, and its relatively low protonation constant, the crystal structure of [Pb(PDOXH2)(DMSO)(2)Cl(ClO4)] (1) was determined.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1434-1948			WOS:000291561100008		
J	Baruth, Meghan; Wilcox, Sara; Condrasky, Margaret D.								Perceived Environmental Church Support Is Associated with Dietary Practices among African-American Adults								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION				111	6			889	893		10.1016/j.jada.2011.03.014			JUN 2011	2011	A unique strength of the African-American community is the importance of church and faith. Interventions promoting health might want to build on these strengths by developing faith-based interventions that encourage churches to create an environment that supports behavior change. The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between perceived environmental church support for healthy eating and intake of fruit and vegetables and fat- and fiber-related behaviors, and to examine whether these relationships differ by sex. The design was a cross-sectional study in which participants completed self-report dietary and perceived church support measures before initiation of an intervention. Relationships between fruit and vegetable consumption, fat- and fiber-related behaviors, and perceived church support (eg, total, written informational, spoken informational, instrumental [fruit and vegetable consumption only]), along with Support X Sex interactions were examined. Participants were 1,136 African-American church members from four geographically defined districts in South Carolina. Statistical analyses included regression models controlling for sex, age, years of education, health rating, and body mass index using SAS PROC MIXED. A separate model was conducted for each measure of perceived church support and each type of healthy eating index. Perceived total church support and perceived written and spoken informational church support were associated with considerably higher fruit and vegetable intake and more favorable fiber-related behaviors, whereas only perceived total and perceived written informational support were associated with more low-fat dietary behaviors. Perceived instrumental church support was not associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. No sex differences were found. The social and physical church environment can be an important factor influencing the dietary habits of its members. Future faith-based interventions should further explore the role of the Church environment in improving the dietary practices of its members.

Proposed electrically-pumped, III-V-metal hybrid plasmonic lasers								APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS				103	3			643	647		10.1007/s00340-010-4359-1			JUN 2011	2011	We propose an electrically-pumped hybrid plasmonic laser through the integration of a semiconductor quantum well laser with a thin metal film. Due to the coupling between the TM waveguide mode in the III-V active layer and the LRSPP mode around the metal thin film, light can be confined in both regions and optical gain can be provided by the active layer. We have shown that the quasi-odd supermode is the preferred lasing mode because of its larger confinement factor and lower modal loss compared to the quasi-even supermode. Through optimizing the gap distance between the active region and the metal film, we can obtain low threshold and a large amount of optical energy confined around the metal film for the hybrid plasmonic laser.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0946-2171			WOS:000291038700018

Effects of Starter Culture and Storage on the Flavor of Liquid Whey								JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				76	5			S354	S361		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02181.x			JUN-JUL 2011	2011	The primary off flavors in dried whey proteins have been attributed to lipid oxidation products. A deeper understanding of lipid oxidation in fluid whey is crucial to understand how to minimize off flavors in dried whey protein. The objectives of this study were to further elucidate the role of storage and starter cultures as sources of lipid oxidation in whey. Fluid Cheddar, Mozzarella, and rennet-set wheys were manufactured from skim and whole milk. Liquid wheys and milks were evaluated by descriptive sensory and volatile instrumental analysis within 2 h of manufacture and following storage for 3 d at 4 degrees C. Culture type greatly influenced the oxidative stability of liquid whey, with Cheddar and Mozzarella whey differing not only in sensory profile, but also in volatile compounds. The type of starter culture (Mozzarella compared with Cheddar) had more influence on flavor than the set type (acid compared with culture). Milks had lower relative abundances of volatile free fatty acids than their liquid whey counterparts. Volatile lipid oxidation products in wheys were higher than in their respective milks, but oxidation in both milks and wheys increased with storage time. Wheys from Cheddar starters displayed more oxidation products than wheys from Mozzarella starters. Starter media did not have an effect on the flavor or oxidative stability of liquid whey, however, culture strain influenced lipid oxidation of fluid whey.Practical ApplicationLipid oxidation products are primary contributors to whey ingredient off-flavors. Flavor plays a critical and limiting role in widespread use of dried whey ingredients, and enhanced understanding of flavor and flavor formation in fluid whey are industrially relevant. Results from this study demonstrate that oxidation occurs in milk prior to cheesemaking but that starter type and starter strain influence also oxidative stability and lipid oxidation off flavors in fluid whey.									14	0	0	14	0	14			0022-1147			WOS:000291231100022	22417452

David								Susceptibility to Infection and Inflammatory Response Following Influenza Virus (H1N1, A/PR/8/34) Challenge: Role of Macrophages								JOURNAL OF INTERFERON AND CYTOKINE RESEARCH				31	6			501	508		10.1089/jir.2010.0143			JUN 2011	2011	The precise role that macrophages play in both influenza-induced pathology and the host's cytokine-mediated response to infection remains largely unknown. We examined the effects of lung macrophage depletion on susceptibility to influenza virus (H1N1, A/PR/8/34) infection and how this relates to the inflammatory cytokine response in the lungs. ICR mice were administered 100 mu L of clodronate (CL(2)MDP) or PBS-encapsulated liposomes via an intranasal route 2 days before infection. Then, mice were intranasally inoculated with influenza virus and monitored for morbidity, mortality, and symptom severity for 21 days. Additional mice were sacrificed at 2 and 5 days postinfection, and lung tissue was analyzed for viral replication and for gene expression and protein concentration of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Macrophage depletion increased morbidity, mortality, and symptom severity (P < 0.05) and viral replication at 2 and 5 days postinfection (P < 0.05). IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha mRNA was greater at day 2 (P < 0.05) and IL-6 and TNF-alpha was greater at day 5 postinfection (P < 0.05) in macrophage depleted mice. Macrophage depletion increased protein concentration of IL-1b and IL-6 at day 2 postinfection (P< 0.05). These data suggest that macrophages play a necessary role in controlling susceptibility to influenza virus and the host's cytokine-mediated response to influenza infection.									15	1	0	14	0	15			1079-9907			WOS:000291197800006	21352081

However, water solubilization and non-specific binding are two critical issues to be addressed for the practical uses. Here, we reported a new type of QDs with combined silica and polymer coating. QDs with excellent colloidal properties were prepared via carboxylation of the amino groups on the surface of silica-coated QDs by reacting with multi-carboxyl poly (acrylic acid) (PAA). Hydrodynamic size of PAA-functionalized silica-coated QDs was around 40 nm. They were highly fluorescent (about 47.8% quantum yield). No precipitate of QDs was observed after 3 month storage at 4 A degrees C. When cancer cells (HeLa) were used, the functionalized QDs exhibited little or no non-specific cellular binding. The results from in vitro experiments indicated that PAA-functionalized silica-coated QDs-antibody bioconjugates had excellent antigen-capture ability and exhibited little or no non-specific binding to polystyrene spheres which were used to immobilize the antigen for immuoflurescence assay. The PAA-functionalized silica-coated QDs with improved colloidal properties could serve as excellent alternative fluorescent probes for biodetection.									10	1	0	2	0	10			1388-0764			WOS:000291225900016

Tamoxifen-Loaded Polylactide Beads for Breast Tissue Engineering Following Lumpectomy								TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				8	3			282	291					JUN 2011	2011	Breast cancer ranks second among cancer deaths in women. Lumpectomy as an important surgical treatment is often subsequently followed by plastic and reconstructive surgery to repair the soft tissue defects resulting from the tumor resection. Since lumpectomy cannot remove all cancer cells, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is required for most cases. The objective of this study was to engineer an injectable sized composite both for breast tissue reconstruction and for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The injectable sized polylactide (PLA) beads incorporating tamoxifen (TAM) was manufactured using an emulsion-solvent evaporation technique. The TAM loading rate of the beads was about 0.33%. The encapsulation efficiency was about 6.9%. TAM was gradually released from the TAM-loaded PLA beads. Both human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human breast cancer cells MCF-7 were cultured with various concentrations of TAM (0-20;AM) for 4 days. Cell viability results suggested that TAM was less toxic to hMSCs compared to MCF-7 cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of TAM for hMSCs and MCF-7 cells were 12.5+/-1.6 mu M and 5.3+/-0.8 mu M, respectively. After hMSCs were cultured with TAM-loaded PLA beads directly in the well for 8 days, the cell viability of hMSCs was not negatively affected both on Day 4 and on Day 8. However, when MCF-7 were cultured either directly with TAM-loaded PLA beads in the well or indirectly with beads in a transwell insert, the cells viabilities were significantly inhibited (P < 0.05). TAM alone at various concentrations (1 similar to 4 mu M) had not effect on hMSCs adipogenic differentiation. When hMSCs were co-cultured with TAM-loaded PLA beads in the transwell inserts, TAM-loaded PLA beads had no effect on hMSCs adipogenic differentiation. Our results suggest that the TAM-loaded PLA beads may be useful as cell microcarrier for injectable tissue engineered composites, while providing an anti-cancer therapeutic for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1738-2696			WOS:000291289600002

Cryopreserved allogeneic heart valves are usually stored and transported below -135 degrees C; however, such methods require expensive equipment for both storage and transportation.Methods. In this study, vitrified porcine aortic valves were stored on either side of the cryoprotectant formulation's glass transition temperature (-119 degrees C) at -80 degrees C and -135 degrees C, using a newly formulated vitrification solution (VS83) consisting of a combination of 4.65M dimethyl sulfoxide, 4.65M formamide, and 3.30M 1,2-propanediol. Three groups of valves were studied: (1) fresh; (2) VS83-preserved, stored at -80 degrees C; and (3) VS83-preserved, stored at -135 degrees C.Results. Using the VS83 cryoprotectant concentration formulation, cracking was not observed during valve storage. No ice-related events were detectable during 5 degrees C rewarming by differential scanning calorimetry. All cryopreserved tissue samples demonstrated significantly less viability than fresh samples (p < 0.01). No significant viability differences were observed between the VS83-preserved groups stored at -80 degrees C and -135 degrees C. Material testing did not reveal any significant differences among the three test groups. Multiphoton imaging of VS83-preserved heart valves stored at -80 degrees C and -135 degrees C demonstrated similar collagen and elastin structures.Conclusions. These results indicate that VS83-preserved heart valves can be stored and transported at temperatures in the vicinity of -80 degrees C with retention of extracellular matrix integrity and material properties. The VS83 preservation of heart valves at -80 degrees C without the need for liquid nitrogen should result in both decreased manufacturing costs and reduced employee safety hazards. Moreover, it is anticipated that low cell viability may result in less immunogenicity in vivo.

We observed the emission from the disc around the Herbig Be star HD 100546 with the PACS instrument in the spectroscopic mode on board the Herschel Space Telescope as part of the GAS in Protoplanetary Systems (GASPS) programme and used archival data from the DIGIT programme to search for the rotational emission of CH+. We detected in both datasets an emission line centred at 72.16 mu m that most likely corresponds to the J = 5-4 rotational emission of CH+. The J = 3-2 and 6-5 transitions are also detected albeit with lower confidence. Other CH+ rotational lines in the PACS observations are blended with water lines. A rotational diagram analysis shows that the CH+ gas is warm at 323(-151)(+2320) K with a mass of similar to 3x10(-14)-5x10(-12) M-circle dot. We modelled the CH+ chemistry with the chemo-physical code PRODIMO using a disc density structure and grain parameters that match continuum observations and near-and mid-infrared interferometric data. The model suggests that CH+ is most abundant at the location of the disc rim at 10-13 AU from the star where the gas is warm, which is consistent with previous observations of hot CO gas emission.									34	0	0	0	0	34			0004-6361			WOS:000291027400155		
J	Lavenda, Osnat								Parental involvement in school: A test of Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler's model among Jewish and Arab parents in Israel								CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW				33	6			927	935		10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.12.016			JUN 2011	2011	Parental involvement in children's schooling has been repeatedly shown to be positively and significantly correlated with a number of positive child outcomes. Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler (1995) proposed a multivariate model of parental involvement. There are indications that the model should be adjusted to include mediating effects of parental role constructions. Further, this model has not been tested in educational systems and cultural contexts outside the US. The goals of the present study were to model factors associated with parental involvement in schools in Israel, and compare model fit among two populations representing different cultures.A survey was conducted with 5999 parents of junior- and senior-high school students in Israel. Data were collected on the extent of parental involvement, parental role construction, invitation for involvement from school, homeroom teacher and the child, availability of resources such as time, energy, skills, and knowledge. parents' ethnic affiliation, and the socio-economic status of the school's local authority. Data were analyzed using SEM. Sobel test for mediation, and multivariate hierarchical regression.The findings support the original theoretical model. Findings also revealed significant but very weak mediating effect of parental role construction. The model had a similar fit for both Jewish and Arab samples. Little of the variance in parental involvement was explained by ethnic/cultural affiliation and socio-economic status. Implications for parental involvement interventions with diverse populations are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0190-7409			WOS:000290932000018

J	Goethals, Paul L.; Cho, Byung Rae								The Development of a Robust Design Methodology for Time-oriented Dynamic Quality Characteristics with a Target Profile								QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL				27	4			403	414		10.1002/qre.1122			JUN 2011	2011	Innovative engineering techniques are often sought within the manufacturing environment to improve product quality and promote more cost-effective strategies. Robust design methods are frequently used to serve this purpose, with the objective of minimizing the variability inherent within a particular process or system. A review of the literature suggests that most robust design research involves the study of static quality characteristics, given a pre-defined specification interval or region and target value. In addition to proposing a methodology for working with dynamic quality characteristics where the specifications and target value may change over time, this paper offers two other distinct contributions. First, those researchers who have examined dynamic systems traditionally consider the effects of a signal factor on a response variable on the identification of optimal factor settings. In contrast, this paper will consider the effects of a quality characteristic changing over time, thus removing the need to confine the problem to signal-response systems. Furthermore, most researchers consider the optimization of the process mean according to the costs of non-conforming to an established specification interval or region. This paper, however, utilizes a methodology involving the simultaneous optimization of the process mean and variance while expanding the problem to consider a loss in quality attributed to deviation from a target value over time.

Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study, this article disaggregates achievement into achievement prior to high school (in the eighth grade) and changes in achievement during high school. The authors find that the prestige of the colleges that students attend is largely solidified by the time students enter high school. They also find that among high socioeconomic status (SES) students, lower achievers can enhance the prestige of the colleges they will attend by moving up the achievement distribution during high school. However, even if their gains are well above average, the prestige of the colleges they are predicted to attend will not surpass students who enter high school at the top or middle of the eighth-grade achievement distribution. These findings are similar for low-SES students. In contrast, the effects of achievement for middle-SES students are largely solidified by high school.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0044-118X	1552-8499		WOS:000291031200014

We want to reliably and promptly detect behavior changes. Traditional Markov-model-based pattern detection approaches, such as hidden Markov models, use maximum likelihood techniques over the entire data stream to detect behaviors. To detect changes between behaviors, we use statistical pattern matching calculations performed on a sliding window of data samples. If the window size is very small, the system will suffer from excessive false-positive rates. If the window is very large, change-point detection is delayed. This paper finds both necessary and sufficient bounds on the window size. We present two methods of calculating window sizes based on the state and transition structures of the Markov models. Two application examples are presented to verify our results. Our first example problem uses simulations to illustrate the utility of the proposed approaches. The second example uses models extracted from a database of consumer purchases to illustrate their use in a real application.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1083-4419	1941-0492		WOS:000290734400004	20923740

Use of implantable temperature transponders for the determination of air cell temperature, eggshell water vapor conductance, and their functional relationships in embryonated broiler hatching eggs								POULTRY SCIENCE				90	6			1191	1196		10.3382/ps.2010-01191			JUN 1 2011	2011	Broiler hatching eggs obtained from a 29-wk-old Ross 308 breeder flock were weighed and set on 8 tray levels (60 eggs/level) of a single incubator. On d 10.5 of incubation, the eggs were weighed, and temperature transponders were implanted in the air cells of 4 randomly selected embryonated eggs per tray level for determination of internal egg temperature (IT). Two water-filled vials per tray level containing transponders were also placed within 5 cm of the implanted eggs for determination of external egg temperature (ET). Between 10.5 and 18.5 d of incubation, ET and IT were recorded every 12 h. Egg weights and embryo survival were determined on 10.5 and 18.5 d of incubation and were used for the calculation of average daily incubational weight loss of embryonated eggs (EWL) and average daily percentage of EWL. Approximately 75% (24 out of 32) of the embryos in the implanted eggs survived through d 18.5 of incubation. Mean ET and IT were used to calculate the water vapor pressure gradient across the eggshell, which was subsequently used with EWL to calculate eggshell water vapor conductance (G(H2O)) and specific G(H2O) (g(H2O); G(H2O) adjusted to a 100-g set egg weight basis). Mean percentage of EWL, ET, IT, G(H2O), and g(H2O) for the 10.5- to 18.5-d incubation period were 0.546 +/- 0.02%, 37.1 +/- 0.03 degrees C, 37.8 +/- 0.09 degrees C, 13.9 +/- 0.47 mg of H(2)O/d per Torr, and 24.5 +/- 0.75 mg of H(2)O/d per Torr per 100 g, respectively. It was concluded that temperature transponders may be successfully implanted in the air cells of broiler hatching eggs to determine ET, IT, G(H2O), and g(H2O) in Ross x Ross 308 broiler hatching eggs. Nevertheless, increased embryo survivability by further improving the implantation procedure may increase the practicality of temperature transponder use in commercial settings.									10	0	0	9	0	10			0032-5791			WOS:000290752600007	21597058

Many methods have been developed to separate particles in microfluidic devices. However, the majority of these separations have been limited to be size based and binary. We demonstrate herein a continuous dc electric field driven separation of carboxyl-coated and noncoated 10 mu m polystyrene beads by charge in a double-spiral microchannel. This method exploits the inherent electric field gradients formed within the channel turns to manipulate particles by dielectrophoresis and is thus termed curvature-induced dielectrophoresis. The spiral microchannel is also demonstrated to continuously sort noncoated 5 mu m beads, noncoated 10 mu m beads, and carboxyl-coated 10 mu m beads into different collecting wells by charge and size simultaneously. The observed particle separation processes in different situations are all predicted with reasonable agreements by a numerical model.

J	Elango, Vijai; Kurtz, Harry D.; Freedman, David L.								Aerobic cometabolism of trichloroethene and cis-dichloroethene with benzene and chlorinated benzenes as growth substrates								CHEMOSPHERE				84	2			247	253		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.04.007			JUN 2011	2011	Using inoculum from a microcosm study that exhibited aerobic transformation of cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) commensurate with biodegradation of monoaromatic compounds, enrichment cultures were developed by providing benzene, chlorobenzene (CB), dichlorobenzene (DCB) isomers and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as carbon and energy sources. Isolates that grow on benzene, CB, 1,2-DCB and 1,3-DCB were identified as Rhodococcus, Ralstonia, Variovorax and Ralstonia spp., respectively. Cometabolic transformation of cDCE and TCE by resting cells was demonstrated. Transformation capacities (T(c), = 0.47-1.0 mu g TCE mg(-1) biomass; 1.3-5.3 mu g cDCE mg(-1) biomass), transformation yields (T(y) = 0.18-0.27 mu g TCE mg(-1) substrate; 0.46-2.1 mu g cDCE mg(-1) substrate), and pseudo-first-order cometabolic degradation rate constants (0.00081-0.0031 L mg TCE(-1) d(-1); 0.0012-0.030 L mg cDCE(-1) d(-1)) for resting cells grown on benzene, CB, 1,2-DCB and 1,3-DCB were generally lower in comparison to phenol and toluene-grown isolates. Cometabolic transformation of cDCE and TCE also occurred while the cultures concurrently consumed their growth substrate (T'(c) = 0.15-0.33 mu g TCE mg(-1) biomass; 4.9-11 mu g cDCE mg(-1) biomass; T'(y) = 0.06-0.11 mu g TCE mg(-1) substrate; 1.7-4.6 mu g cDCE mg(-1) substrate), a condition that is more likely to be encountered in situ compared to cometabolic transformations by resting cells. This study is the first to report transformation rates, capacities, and yields for cometabolism of cDCE and TCE during aerobic growth on benzene, CB, 1,2-DCB and 1,3-DCB. This type of information is needed to predict the potential for natural attenuation when these compounds occur as co-contaminants. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

School counselors' knowledge of eating disorders								EATING AND WEIGHT DISORDERS-STUDIES ON ANOREXIA BULIMIA AND OBESITY				16	2			E131	E136					JUN 2011	2011	BACKGROUND: Twenty years ago, Price published a survey identifying knowledge deficits of school counselors regarding eating disorders. Our study surveys current school counselors to determine whether knowledge has increased and determine the availability of school-based prevention programming. METHODS: School counselors from a single metropolitan area were surveyed prior to a mandatory in-service on eating disorders. RESULTS: Of the 109 respondents, 55% felt eating disorders were a problem in their school. Very few felt "very competent" identifying (6%) or helping (2%) students with eating disorders. Today's school counselors were more likely to know a symptom of anorexia nervosa (AN) is missing at least three consecutive menstrual cycles and malnutrition is not a common cause of death for bulimia nervosa (BN). CONCLUSIONS: While knowledge of AN and BN appear to have increased, school counselors still lack some basic understanding and report very low confidence in identifying and helping students with eating disorders.

Characteristics of Head-Mounted Displays and Their Effects on Simulator Sickness								HUMAN FACTORS				53	3			308	319		10.1177/0018720811405196			JUN 2011	2011	Objective: We examined the effects of several display characteristics of head-mounted displays (HMDs) on simulator sickness (SS).Background: Technological limitations, such as display delay and reduced field of view (FOV), affect perception when using an HMD and are often thought to be related to SS. Few studies have examined the relationship between FOV and geometric FOV (image scale factor) or how HMD characteristics may interact.Method: Participants made active head movements to locate objects when viewing a live video via an HMD.Results: Compared with no added delay, an additional 200 ms of display delay did not result in increased SS, as measured by the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. Furthermore, an effect of image scale factor on SS was not revealed. However, SS was greater when peripheral vision was occluded than when it was not. Peripheral vision moderated the effects of image scale factor and delay on head movement velocity.Conclusion: Occluding peripheral vision may subject HMD users to the potential detrimental consequences of HMD characteristics more than when peripheral vision of the external environment is available, resulting in more SS. Future research should investigate to what extent peripheral vision can be occluded without increasing SS and without sacrificing realism and presence.Application: To reduce the occurrence of SS, a degree of peripheral vision of the external world should be provided. Furthermore, users and designers should be aware that head movement behavior may be affected by HMD characteristics.									18	0	0	3	0	18			0018-7208			WOS:000292115100008	21830515

Barricade (prodiamine) Persistance in Pinebark:Sand Substrate								Journal of Environmental Horticulture				29	2			71	74					JUN 2011	2011	Barricade (prodiamine) herbicide is used for preemergence weed control in container-grown plants and has been shown to injure certain landscape plants. This research investigated Barricade's (prodiamne's) persistence and movement in a pine bark:sand substrate with greenhouse grown azaleas treated with Barricade (prodiamine). A bentgrass bioassay study indicated similar Barricade (prodiamine) distribution throughout the containers through 60 days after application (DAA). Barricade (prodiamine) residues extracted from the substrate were similar within specific horizons at 30 and 60 DAA indicating a downward herbicide migration within the container. Barricade (prodiamine) may be adsorbed to fine substrate particles and move in the container with the displacement of fine particles during irrigation and substrate settling.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0738-2898			BCI:BCI201100448195

Songbird Breeding Season Use of Pine Plantations Treated Chemically for Herbaceous Vegetation Control								JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT				2	1			99	105		10.3996/092010-JFWM-035			JUN 2011	2011	Pine plantations, a common early successional habitat in the southeastern United States, have been subject in recent years to increased use of herbicides to control herbaceous vegetation immediately postestablishment. Such treatments may affect songbird use during the breeding season, but studies documenting bird response are limited. Furthermore, songbirds that breed in early successional habitats have experienced sustained population declines in recent decades. Therefore, we examined the influence of herbaceous vegetation control on songbird use during the breeding season within pine plantations on the Piedmont Plateau in Virginia. We evaluated 35 plantations characterized by one of five treatments: herbaceous vegetation control applied during the establishment year and that were 1, 2, or 3 y old when sampled, and those that had not received herbaceous vegetation control at establishment and that were 1 or 2 y old when sampled. There was no difference (P>0.05) in detections of birds between plantations with and without herbicide treatment. However, 1-y-old plantations (both treated and untreated) had fewer detections (P<0.05) than 2-y-old plantations for 3 individual species and for all 16 species combined.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-687X			WOS:000311625000012

Such grooved HFMs are finding promising medical applications for nerve repair and regeneration. For better nerve regeneration performance, the HFM groove geometry should be carefully controlled. Towards this goal, in this study the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) HFM groove number has been modeled based on the radially inward pressure-induced buckling mechanism. HFM has been modeled as a long six-layer fiber membrane, and the HFM inner skin layer has been treated as a thin-walled elastic cylindrical shell under the shrinkage-induced inward radial pressure. The groove number has been reasonably estimated based on the resulting buckling mode as compared with the experimental measurements.

HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS OF LARVAL MOSQUITOES IN ZOOS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, USA								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION				27	2			111	119		10.2987/10-6061.1			JUN 2011	2011	To investigate whether the unique assemblage of habitats in zoos could affect mosquito oviposition behavior and to provide zoos with suggestions for mosquito control, larvae were sampled and associated habitat variables were measured in 2 zoos in South Carolina, USA. Fifty-nine sites were sampled from March 2008 to January 2009. A total of 1,630 larvae representing 16 species was collected and identified. The dominant species was Aedes albopictus (46.0%), followed by Ae. triseriatus (23.6%), Culex restuans (12.4%), and Cx. pipiens complex (9.7%). Principal components and multiple logistic regression analyses showed that across both zoos the distribution of Ae. albopictus larvae was predicted by ambient and site temperature, precipitation, dissolved oxygen, and container habitats. The distribution of Ae. triseriatus larvae was predicted by natural containers and shade height <= 2 m. Overall larval mosquito presence (regardless of species) was predicted by ambient and site temperature, precipitation, dissolved oxygen, presence of natural habitats, and absence of aquatic vegetation. Additionally, C-8 values of pairwise species associations indicated significant habitat-based relationships between Ae. albopictus and Ae. triseriatus, and Cx. pipiens complex and Cx. restuans. In general, species-habitat associations conformed to previously published studies. Recommendations to zoo personnel include elimination of artificial container habitats, reduction of shade sources <= 2 m over aquatic habitats, use of approved mosquito larvicides, and training in recognizing and mitigating larval mosquito habitats.									4	0	0	4	0	5			8756-971X			WOS:000306343700004	21805842

However, we find that the PSI technique provides an attractive method to record the ciphertext, but contributes little to the security level of the cryptosystem. From the cryptanalysis point of view, in a certain simplified case, an attacker is only required to crack two equivalent decryption keys instead of the original random phase keys and geometric key. Moreover, a chosen-plaintext attack method is proposed, in which an impulse function is chosen as a known plaintext. By using this attack, the attacker can effectively recover any plaintext from the corresponding ciphertext. The validity of the attack is verified by computer simulations.

We attribute this decrease in risk taken to (1) the parent's perception that the risk of predation had increased to the extent that a continuation of defensive behaviors would not prevent the death of the juvenile, and (2) its attempt to minimize its own risk of death. It may be that there is a threshold beyond which Mourning Dove parents will forgo the risk of additional defense of offspring in favor of making another reproductive attempt.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1528-7092			WOS:000306605700017

Therapeutic delivery				2	6			815	38					2011-Jun	2011	Many nanotechnologies, which enable unique approaches to treat cancer, have been developed based upon non-toxic organic and inorganic materials to improve current cancer treatments. The use of inorganic materials to form magnetic nanoparticles for hyperthermia therapy is of great interest for localized treatment of cancers without effecting adjacent healthy tissue. Extensive clinical trials have begun using magnetic hyperthermia in animal models. The purpose of this article is to address different factors that affect targeting, heating and biodistribution to safely control the therapeutic efficacy of targeted magnetic hyperthermia. This method involves accumulation of magnetic nanoparticles at a tumor site and then manipulating the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles to heat the targeted tissues.									20	1	0	3	0	21			2041-5990			MEDLINE:22822511	22822511

The purpose of this study is to describe the implementation and assessment of an intervention to increase organizational maintenance of evidence-based physical activity programs and the factors that impede or facilitate sustainability. All organizations implemented a sustainability action plan that included identifying factors related to sustainability, examining resources available, identifying program modifications to enhance sustainability, and long-term action planning. A mixed methods approach was used. Organizational (n = 12 sites) ability to demonstrate program effectiveness, align priorities with the organizational mission, and integrate the program within the existing infrastructure were strengths related to sustainability. Sites were more optimistic about program sustainability when they had less reliance on internal financial, but more reliance on internal human resources to run the program post-funding. The study resulted in a number of tools that can help community organizations plan for sustainability of physical activity programs.									15	0	0	0	0	15			1869-6716	1613-9860		WOS:000209412000005	24073045

A brief outline of the computational modeling, in the framework of continuum electrostatics, is presented and the basic electrostatic effects occurring upon the formation of the complex are discussed. The effect of the salt concentration and pH of the water phase on protein-protein binding free energy is demonstrated which indicates that the increase of the salt concentration tends to weaken the binding, an observation that is attributed to the optimization of the charge-charge interactions across the interface. It is pointed out that the pH-optimum (pH of optimal binding affinity) varies among the protein-protein complexes, and perhaps is a result of their adaptation to particular subcellular compartments. The similarities and differences between hetero- and homo-complexes are outlined and discussed with respect to the binding mode and charge complementarity.									34	0	0	16	0	34			1478-3967	1478-3975		WOS:000290560100002	21572182

OLS estimates reveal that mixed-race slaves, slaves in the tobacco-producing Piedmont, and female slaves of female slave owners were manumitted at younger ages. Weibull proportional hazards estimates imply that the same groups were more likely to be manumitted. The results also reveal a markedly diminishing likelihood of manumission after Nat Turner's 1831 insurrection in south-central Virginia. The results are consistent with a principal-agent model in which slave owners contracted with slaves over consumption and future manumission to elicit effort and control shirking or other unproductive activities.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1863-2505			WOS:000289987800003

J	Oweis, T. Y.; Farahani, H. J.; Hachum, A. Y.								Evapotranspiration and water use of full and deficit irrigated cotton in the Mediterranean environment in northern Syria								AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT				98	8			1239	1248		10.1016/j.agwat.2011.02.009			MAY 30 2011	2011	Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is the most important industrial and summer cash crop in Syria and many other countries in the arid areas but there are concerns about future production levels, given the high water requirements and the decline in water availability. Most farmers in Syria aim to maximize yield per unit of land regardless of the quantity of water applied. Water losses can be reduced and water productivity (yield per unit of water consumed) improved by applying deficit irrigation, but this requires a better understanding of crop response to various levels of water stress. This paper presents results from a 3-year study (2004-2006) conducted in northern Syria to quantify cotton yield response to different levels of water and fertilizer. The experiment included four irrigation levels and three levels of nitrogen (N) fertilizer under drip irrigation. The overall mean cotton (lint plus seed, or lintseed) yield was 2502 kg ha(-1), ranging from 1520 kg ha(-1) under 40% irrigation to 3460 kg ha(-1) under 100% irrigation. Mean water productivity (WPET) was 0.36 kg lintseed per m(3) of crop actual evapotranspiration (ETc), ranging from 0.32 kg m(-3) under 40% irrigation to 0.39 kg m(-3) under the 100% treatment. Results suggest that deficit irrigation does not improve biological water productivity of drip-irrigated cotton. Water and fertilizer levels (especially the former) have significant effects on yield, crop growth and WPET. Water, but not N level, has a highly significant effect on crop ETc. The study provides production functions relating cotton yield to ETc as well as soil water content at planting. These functions are useful for irrigation optimization and for forecasting the impact of water rationing and drought on regional water budgets and agricultural economies. The WPET values obtained in this study compare well with those reported from the southwestern USA, Argentina and other developed cotton producing regions. Most importantly, these WPET values are double the current values in Syria, suggesting that improved irrigation water and system management can improve WPET, and thus enhance conservation and sustainability in this water-scarce region.

The importance of SMS is manifested by the fact that single missense mutations were found to cause Snyder-Robinson Syndrome (SRS). At the same time, currently there are no non-synonymous single nucleoside polymorphisms, nsSNPs (harmless mutations), found in SMS, which may imply that the SMS does not tolerate amino acid substitutions, i.e. is not mutable.Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate the mutability of the SMS, we carried out in silico analysis and in vitro experiments of the effects of amino acid substitutions at the missense mutation sites (G56, V132 and I150) that have been shown to cause SRS. Our investigation showed that the mutation sites have different degree of mutability depending on their structural micro-environment and involvement in the function and structural integrity of the SMS. It was found that the I150 site does not tolerate any mutation, while V132, despite its key position at the interface of SMS dimer, is quite mutable. The G56 site is in the middle of the spectra, but still quite sensitive to charge residue replacement.Conclusions/Significance: The performed analysis showed that mutability depends on the detail of the structural and functional factors and cannot be predicted based on conservation of wild type properties alone. Also, harmless nsSNPs can be expected to occur even at sites at which missense mutations were found to cause diseases.									31	0	0	23	0	31			1932-6203			WOS:000291052500054	21647366

Functional and architectural complexity within and between muscles: regional variation and intermuscular force transmission								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				366	1570			1477	1487		10.1098/rstb.2010.0359			MAY 27 2011	2011	Over the past 30 years, studies of single muscles have revealed complex patterns of regional variation in muscle architecture, activation, strain and force. In addition, muscles are often functionally integrated with other muscles in parallel or in series. Understanding the extent of this complexity and the interactions between muscles will profoundly influence how we think of muscles in relation to organismal function, and will allow us to address questions regarding the functional benefits (or lack thereof) and dynamics of this complexity under in vivo conditions. This paper has two main objectives. First, we present a cohesive and integrative review of regional variation in function within muscles, and discuss the functional ramifications that can stem from this variation. This involves splitting regional variation into passive and active components. Second, we assess the functional integration of muscles between different limb segments by presenting new data involving in vivo measurements of activation and strain from the medial gastrocnemius, iliotibialis cranialis and iliotibialis lateralis pars preacetabularis of the helmeted guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) during level running on a motorized treadmill. Future research directions for both of these objectives are presented.									12	0	0	10	0	12			0962-8436			WOS:000289621400003	21502119

The critical role of muscles in animal movement has captivated scientists for over 300 years. Despite this, emerging techniques and ideas are still shaping and advancing the field. For example, sonomicrometry and ultrasound techniques have enhanced our ability to quantify muscle length changes under in vivo conditions. Robotics and musculoskeletal models have benefited from improved computational tools and have enhanced our ability to understand muscle function in relation to movement by allowing one to simulate muscle-tendon dynamics under realistic conditions. The past decade, in particular, has seen a rapid advancement in technology and shifts in paradigms related to muscle function. In addition, there has been an increased focus on muscle function in relation to the complex locomotor behaviours, rather than relatively simple (and steady) behaviours. Thus, this Theme Issue will explore integrative aspects of muscle function in relation to diverse locomotor behaviours such as swimming, jumping, hopping, running, flying, moving over obstacles and transitioning between environments. Studies of walking and running have particular relevance to clinical aspects of human movement and sport. This Theme Issue includes contributions from scientists working on diverse taxa, ranging from humans to insects. In addition to contributions addressing locomotion in various taxa, several manuscripts will focus on recent advances in neuromuscular control and modulation during complex behaviours. Finally, some of the contributions address recent advances in biomechanical modelling and powered prostheses. We hope that our comprehensive and integrative Theme Issue will form the foundation for future work in the fields of neuromuscular mechanics and locomotion.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0962-8436			WOS:000289621400001	21502117	
J	Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Transduction of a bistable inductive generator driven by white and exponentially correlated Gaussian noise								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				330	11			2554	2564		10.1016/j.jsv.2010.12.005			MAY 23 2011	2011	In this theoretical study, the response of an inductive power generator with a bistable symmetric potential to stationary random environmental excitations is investigated. Both white and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type excitations are considered. In the white noise limit, the stationary Fokker-Plank-Kolmagorov equation is solved for the exact joint probability density function (PDF) of the response. The PDF is then used to obtain analytical expressions for the response statistics. It is shown that the expected value of the generator's output power is independent of the potential shape leading to the conclusion that under white noise excitations, bistabilities in the potential do not provide any enhancement over the traditional linear resonant generators which have a single-well potential. In the case of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (exponentially correlated) noise, an approximate expression for the mean power of the generator which depends on the potential shape, the generator's design parameters and the noise bandwidth and intensity is obtained. It is shown that there exists an optimal potential shape which maximizes the output power. This optimal shape guarantees an optimal escapement frequency between the potential wells which remains constant even as the noise intensity is varied. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

BMC GENOMICS				12						247	10.1186/1471-2164-12-247			MAY 19 2011	2011	Background: Although second generation sequencing (2GS) technologies allow re-sequencing of previously gold-standard-sequenced genomes, whole genome shotgun sequencing and de novo assembly of large and complex eukaryotic genomes is still difficult. Availability of a genome-wide physical map is therefore still a prerequisite for whole genome sequencing for genomes like barley. To start such an endeavor, large insert genomic libraries, i.e. Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) libraries, which are unbiased and representing deep haploid genome coverage, need to be ready in place.Result: Five new BAC libraries were constructed for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivar Morex. These libraries were constructed in different cloning sites (HindIII, EcoRI, MboI and BstXI) of the respective vectors. In order to enhance unbiased genome representation and to minimize the number of gaps between BAC contigs, which are often due to uneven distribution of restriction sites, a mechanically sheared library was also generated. The new BAC libraries were fully characterized in depth by scrutinizing the major quality parameters such as average insert size, degree of contamination (plate wide, neighboring, and chloroplast), empty wells and off-scale clones (clones with < 30 or > 250 fragments). Additionally a set of gene-based probes were hybridized to high density BAC filters and showed that genome coverage of each library is between 2.4 and 6.6 X.Conclusion: BAC libraries representing > 20 haploid genomes are available as a new resource to the barley research community. Systematic utilization of these libraries in high-throughput BAC fingerprinting should allow developing a genome-wide physical map for the barley genome, which will be instrumental for map-based gene isolation and genome sequencing.									25	0	0	25	0	25			1471-2164			WOS:000291940800002	21595870	
J	Kumar, Sunil; Xue, Liang; Arya, Dev P.								Neomycin-Neomycin Dimer: An All-Carbohydrate Scaffold with High Affinity for AT-Rich DNA Duplexes								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				133	19			7361	7375		10.1021/ja108118v			MAY 18 2011	2011	A dimeric neomycin-neomycin conjugate 3 with a flexible linker, 2,2'-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine), has been synthesized and characterized. Dimer 3 can selectively bind to AT-rich DNA duplexes with high affinity. Biophysical studies have been performed between 3 and different nucleic acids with varying base composition and conformation by using ITC (isothermal calorimetry), CD (circular dichroism), FID (fluorescent intercalator displacement), and UV (ultraviolet) thermal denaturation experiments. A few conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) FIB assay with 3 and polynucleotides demonstrates the preference of 3 toward AT-rich sequences over GC-rich sequences. (2) FID assay and UV thermal denaturation experiments show that 3 has a higher affinity for the poly(dA)center dot poly(dT) DNA duplex than for the poly(dA)center dot 2poly(dT) DNA triplex. Contrary to neomycin, 3 destabilizes poly(dA)center dot 2poly(dT) triplex but stabilizes poly(dA)center dot poly(dT) duplex, suggesting the major groove as the binding site. (3) UV thermal denaturation studies and ITC experiments show that 3 stabilizes continuous AT-tract DNA better than DNA duplexes with alternating AT bases. (4) CD and FID titration studies show a DNA binding site size of 10-12 base pairs/drug, depending upon the structure/sequence of the duplex for AT-rich DNA duplexes. (5) FID and ITC titration between 3 and an intramolecular DNA duplex [d(5'-A(12)-x-T(12)-3'), x = hexaethylene glycol linker] results in a binding stoichiometry of 1:1 with a binding constant similar to 10(8) M(-1) at 100 mM KCl. (6) FIB assay using 3 and 512 hairpin DNA sequences that vary in their AT base content and placement also show a higher binding selectivity of 3 toward continuous AT-rich than toward DNA duplexes with alternate AT base pairs. (7) Salt-dependent studies indicate the formation of three ion pairs during binding of the DNA duplex d[5'-A(12)-x-T(12)-3'] and 3. (8) ITC-derived binding constants between 3 and DNA duplexes have the following order: AT continuous, d[5'-G(3)A(5)T(5)C(3)-3'] > AT alternate, d[5'-G(3)(AT)5C3-31 > GC-rich d[5'-A(3)G(5)C(5)T(3)-3']. (9) 3 binds to the AT-tract-containing DNA duplex (B* DNA, d[5'-G(3)A(5)T(5)C(3)-3']) with 1 order of magnitude higher affinity than to a DNA duplex with alternating AT base pairs (B DNA, d[5'-G(3)(AT)(5)C(3)-3']) and with almost 3 orders of magnitude higher affinity than a GC-rich DNA (A-form, d[5'-A(3)G(5)C(5)T(3)-3']).									34	0	0	24	0	34			0002-7863			WOS:000290782200033	21524066	
J	Li, Bo; Cao, Weiguo; Zhou, Jizhong; Luo, Feng								Understanding and predicting synthetic lethal genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using domain genetic interactions								BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY				5						73	10.1186/1752-0509-5-73			MAY 17 2011	2011	Background: Synthetic lethal genetic interactions among proteins have been widely used to define functional relationships between proteins and pathways. However, the molecular mechanism of synthetic lethal genetic interactions is still unclear.Results: In this study, we demonstrated that yeast synthetic lethal genetic interactions can be explained by the genetic interactions between domains of those proteins. The domain genetic interactions rarely overlap with the domain physical interactions from iPfam database and provide a complementary view about domain relationships. Moreover, we found that domains in multidomain yeast proteins contribute to their genetic interactions differently. The domain genetic interactions help more precisely define the function related to the synthetic lethal genetic interactions, and then help understand how domains contribute to different functionalities of multidomain proteins. Using the probabilities of domain genetic interactions, we were able to predict novel yeast synthetic lethal genetic interactions. Furthermore, we had also identified novel compensatory pathways from the predicted synthetic lethal genetic interactions.Conclusion: The identification of domain genetic interactions helps the understanding of originality of functional relationship in SLGIs at domain level. Our study significantly improved the understanding of yeast mulitdomain proteins, the synthetic lethal genetic interactions and the functional relationships between proteins and pathways.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1752-0509			WOS:000291882400001	21586150

We describe three methods for preparing substrates with alkyne groups, which show versatility for "click" chemistry reactions. Two of the methods have the same root: formation of thin, covalently attached, reactive interfacial layers of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) via spin coating onto silicon wafers followed by reactive modification with either propargylamine or 5-heicynoic acid. The amine or the carboxylic acid moieties react with the epoxy groups of PGMA, creating interfacial polymer layers decorated with alkyne groups. The third method consists of using copolymers comprising glycidyl methacrylate and propargyl methacrylate (pGP). The pGP copolymers are spin coated and covalently attached on silicon wafers. For each method, we investigate the factors that control film thickness and content of alkyne groups using ellipsometry, and study the nanophase structure of the films using neutron reflectometry. Azide-terminated polymers of methacrylic acid and 2-vinyl-4, 4-dimethylazlactone synthesized via reversible addition - fragmentation chain transfer polymerization were attached to the alkyne-modified substrates using "click" chemistry, and grafting densities in the range of 0.007-0.95 chains nm(-2) were attained. The maximum density of alkyne groups attained by functionalization of PGMA with propargylamine or 5-hexynoic acid was approximately 2 allcynes nm(-3). The allcyne content obtained by the three decorating approaches was sufficiently high that it was not the limiting factor for the click reaction of azide-capped polymers.									28	0	0	4	0	28			0743-7463			WOS:000290292900031	21506527

This paper addresses the structure sensitivity of cyclopropane hydrogenolysis on Pt using K(+) addition to Pt/C and compares the results to those for CO hydrogenation, a classic structure insensitive reaction. Kinetic parameters determined for both reactions show the effect of K(+) on Pt to be limited to simple site blockage at the reaction conditions used. Determination of the site ensemble size (number of contiguous surface metal atoms) required for reaction using Martin's model suggests that cyclopropane hydrogenolysis requires a site ensemble size of ca. 7, whereas the structure insensitive CO hydrogenation reaction requires only an ensemble size of ca. 1. In addition, evidence suggests that K(+) decorates Pt non-uniformly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									9	0	0	1	0	9			0021-9517			WOS:000291523400010		
J	Shimizu, Masayuki; Arai, Yuji; Sparks, Donald L.								Multiscale Assessment of Methylarsenic Reactivity in Soil. 1. Sorption and Desorption on Soils								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				45	10			4293	4299		10.1021/es103576p			MAY 15 2011	2011	Methylated forms of arsenic (As), monomethy-larsenate (MMA), and dimethylarsenate (DMA) have historically been used as herbicides and pesticides. Because of their large application to agriculture fields and the toxicity of MMA and DMA, the persistency of these compounds in the environment is of great concern. MMA and DMA sorption and desorption were investigated in soils, varying in mineralogical and organic matter (OM) contents. Sorption studies showed that the MMA sorption capacity and rate were greater than DMA sorption. Al/Fe-oxyhydroxides were the main sorbents in the soils, and the sorption capacity was proportional to the Al/Fe concentration in the soils. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies showed that both MMA/DMA-Fe interatomic distances were around 3.3 angstrom, which were indicative of bidentate binuclear inner-sphere complex formation. Desorption studies showed that not all of the sorbed MMA or DMA was desorbed due to the strong binding between MMA/DMA and Al/Fe-oxyhydroxide surfaces via possible inner-sphere complex formation. The amount of the desorbed MMA and DMA decreased as the sorption residence time increased. For example, 77% of sorbed MMA was desorbed from the Reybold subsoil after 1 day residence time, while 66% of sorbed MMA. was desorbed from the soil after six months of residence time. The decreases in desorption were likely due to As speciation changes from MMA/DMA to inorganic arsenate, which was more strongly bound to the surface.									19	0	0	11	0	19			0013-936X			WOS:000290426900020	21488668

Distribution and Speciation in Soil								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				45	10			4300	4306		10.1021/es103577e			MAY 15 2011	2011	Methylated forms of arsenic (As), monomethylarsenate (MMA) and dimethylarsenate (DMA), have historically been used as herbicides and pesticides. Because of their large application to agriculture fields and the toxicity of MMA and DMA, the distribution, speciation, and sorption of methylated As to soils requires investigation. Monomethylarsenate and DMA were reacted with a soil up to one year under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Microsynchrotron based X-ray fluorescence (mu-SXRF) mapping studies showed that MMA and DMA were heterogeneously distributed in the soil and were mainly associated with iron oxyhydroxides, e.g., goethite, in the soil. Micro-X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra collected from As hotspots showed MMA and DMA were demethylated to arsenate over one year incubation under aerobic conditions. Monomethylarsenate was methylated to DMA, and DMA was maintained as DMA over a 3 month incubation under anaerobic conditions. Arsenic iron precipitation, such as the formation of scorodite (FeAsO(4)center dot 2H(2)O), was not observed, indicating that MMA and DMA were mainly associated with Fe-oxyhydroxides as sorption complexes.									18	0	0	13	0	18			0013-936X			WOS:000290426900021	21488669

Dengue vector control strategies in an urban setting: an economic modelling assessment								LANCET				377	9778			1673	1680		10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60246-8			MAY 14 2011	2011	Background An estimated 2.5 billion people are at risk of dengue. Incidence of dengue is especially high in resource-constrained countries, where control relies mainly on insecticides targeted at larval or adult mosquitoes. We did epidemiological and economic assessments of different vector control strategies.Methods We developed a dynamic model of dengue transmission that assesses the evolution of insecticide resistance and immunity in the human population, thus allowing for long-term evolutionary and immunological effects of decreased dengue transmission. We measured the dengue health burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost. We did a cost-effectiveness analysis of 43 insecticide-based vector control strategies, including strategies targeted at adult and larval stages, at varying efficacies (high-efficacy [90% mortality], medium-efficacy [60% mortality], and low-efficacy [30% mortality]) and yearly application frequencies (one to six applications). To assess the effect of parameter uncertainty on the results, we did a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and a threshold analysis.Findings All interventions caused the emergence of insecticide resistance, which, with the loss of herd immunity, will increase the magnitude of future dengue epidemics. In our model, one or more applications of high-efficacy larval control reduced dengue burden for up to 2 years, whereas three or more applications of adult vector control reduced dengue burden for up to 4 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the strategies for two high-efficacy adult vector control applications per year was US$615 per DALY saved and for six high-efficacy adult vector control applications per year was $1267 per DALY saved. Sensitivity analysis showed that if the cost of adult control was more than 8.2 times the cost of larval control then all strategies based on adult control became dominated.Interpretation Six high-efficacy adult vector control applications per year has a cost-effectiveness ratio that will probably meet WHO's standard for a cost-effective or very cost-effective intervention. Year-round larval control can be counterproductive, exacerbating epidemics in later years because of evolution of insecticide resistance and loss of herd immunity. We suggest the reassessment of vector control policies that are based on larval control only.									51	1	0	36	3	54			0140-6736			WOS:000290777700032	21546076

The Evolution of Catalytic Function in the HIV-1 Protease								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				408	4			792	805		10.1016/j.jmb.2011.02.031			MAY 13 2011	2011	The evolution of species is a complex phenomenon based on the optimization of a multidimensional function referred to as fitness. At the level of biomolecular evolution, the fitness function can be reduced to include physiochemical properties relevant to the biological function of a particular molecule. In this work, questions involving the physical-chemical mechanisms underlying the evolution of HIV-1 protease are addressed through molecular simulation and subsequent analysis of thermodynamic properties related to the activity of the enzyme. Specifically, the impact of 40 single amino acid mutations on the binding affinity toward the matrix/capsid (MA/CA) substrate and corresponding transition state intermediate has been characterized using a molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area approach. We demonstrate that this approach is capable of extracting statistically significant information relevant to experimentally determined catalytic activity. Further, no correlation was observed between the effect of mutations on substrate and transition state binding, suggesting independent evolutionary pathways toward optimizing substrate specificity and catalytic activity. In addition, a detailed analysis of calculated binding affinity data suggests that ground-state destabilization (reduced binding affinity for the substrate) could be a contributing factor in the evolutionary optimization of HIV-1 protease. A numerical model is developed to demonstrate that ground-state destabilization is a valid mechanism for activity optimization given the high concentrations of substrate experienced by the functional enzyme in vivo.

The p-azidophenyl-substituted butanoate led to an ethyl spirodienone carboxylate, while its homologue pentanoate gave ethyl 4-(4-aminophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate in good yield. In contrast, the m-azidophenyl-substituted esters suffered aromatic nucleophilic addition of trifluoromethanesulfonate. X-ray crystallography established unequivocally the end products structure, and density functional theory studies were performed to rationalize the cyclization outcome. Reaction intermediates and end products were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit in vitro growth of the cell lines MCF-7 (breast cancer), NCI-H460 (lung cancer), SF-268 (CNS cancer), and UACC-62 (melanoma). Growth inhibition of breast, lung, and CNS cancer cell lines was observed with the spirodienone carboxylate, the m-nitrophenylalkyl iodides, and p-phenyl-substituted elongated ethyl esters, namely, the p-nitrophenylpentanoate and p-aminophenylbutanoate, with the latter being also effective on the melanoma cell line.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0022-2623			WOS:000290126800004	21504224

The observations were obtained with the VLT/CRIRES to detect hot water and hydroxyl radical emission lines previously detected in disks around T Tauri stars. OH emission lines are detected toward four disks. The OH (2)Pi(3/2) P4.5 (1+, 1-) doublet is spectrally resolved as well as the velocity profile of each component of the doublet. Its characteristic double-peak profile demonstrates that the gas is in Keplerian rotation and points to an emitting region extending out to similar to 15-30 AU. The OH emission correlates with disk geometry as it is mostly detected toward flaring disks. None of the Herbig stars analyzed here show evidence of hot water vapor at a sensitivity similar to that of the OH lines. The non-detection of hot water vapor emission indicates that the atmospheres of disks around Herbig AeBe stars are depleted of water molecules. Assuming LTE and optically thin emission we derive a lower limit to the OH/H2O column density ratio > 1-25 in contrast to T Tauri disks for which the column density ratio is 0.3-0.4.									30	1	0	0	0	30			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000289935900046

Langmuir 2010, 26, 14263]. The alginate junction zones were mostly composed of mannuronate/guluronate (MG) dimers; no evidence was found of an alteration of this structure upon addition of the nanofiller. The orientation of the CNC was studied from the azimuthal intensity distribution of the (2,0,0) reflection. The spread of the orientation increased with higher loads until the nanoparticles within the matrix spiraled around the longitudinal axis, which resulted in a reduction in tenacity and modulus and an increase in elongation at break and toughness. This spiral orientation is also observed in native cellulose fibers and is deterministic of their mechanical properties. Increased fiber stretching during spinning retarded the appearance of a spiral assembly and increased CNC alignment. WAXD was also used as a nondestructive method to measure nanofiller concentration. This work explains unusual mechanical properties observed in CNC-alginate nanocomposite fibers and may be applicable to other nanocomposite systems.									21	0	0	6	1	21			0024-9297			WOS:000290060900034

The success of angiosperms has been attributed, in part, to innovations associated with gene or whole-genome duplications(4-6), but evidence for proposed ancient genome duplications pre-dating the divergence of monocots and eudicots remains equivocal in analyses of conserved gene order. Here we use comprehensive phylogenomic analyses of sequenced plant genomes and more than 12.6 million new expressed-sequence-tag sequences from phylogenetically pivotal lineages to elucidate two groups of ancient gene duplications-one in the common ancestor of extant seed plants and the other in the common ancestor of extant angiosperms. Gene duplication events were intensely concentrated around 319 and 192 million years ago, implicating two WGDs in ancestral lineages shortly before the diversification of extant seed plants and extant angiosperms, respectively. Significantly, these ancestral WGDs resulted in the diversification of regulatory genes important to seed and flower development, suggesting that they were involved in major innovations that ultimately contributed to the rise and eventual dominance of seed plants and angiosperms.									562	27	0	542	1	582			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000290218300038	21478875

Inter- and intra-molecular pi-pi interaction of terminal vinylic double bonds leads to cluster formation (quantitative image analysis of SEM micrographs using MATLAB tool box) and bigger cage size (on higher concentration of fullerenol) allows easy insertion of TBAH due to ionic nature and fit-in size. Antagonistic effect in fluorescence intensity in heterogeneous phase product (IB) is explained on the basis of possible TBAH intrusion inside the cage. TBAH intrusion disallows inter- and intra-molecular pi-pi interaction of terminal vinylic double bonds leading to high intensity (weak quenching) at higher amount of fullerenol loading (easy entry of TBAH) and strong quenching in absence of TBAH (entry difficult at low concentration of fullerenol loading). Stronger pi-cation interaction is also responsible for blue shift (depopulate S(1)-state electron) in heterogeneous phase product (IB). Polar solvent has similar effect but lesser in magnitude due to weaker ionic character compared to TBAH. Quenching of fluorescence intensity in the presence of TBAH/polar solvent intuitively proves intra- and inter-molecular pi-pi electron transfer among terminal vinylic double bonds and also between pi-chromophores and foreign ionic species. Preliminary results on Optical Limiting (OL) property of hemi ortho-esters are compared with fullerene and fullerenol. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Stabilized approximation to degenerate transport equations via filtering								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				217	17			7282	7294		10.1016/j.amc.2011.02.020			MAY 1 2011	2011	We analyze a stabilization technique for degenerate transport equations. Of particular interest are coupled parabolic/hyperbolic problems, when the diffusion coefficient is zero in part of the domain. The unstabilized, computed approximations of these problems are highly oscillatory, and several techniques have been proposed and analyzed to mitigate the effects of the sub-grid errors that contribute to the oscillatory behavior. In this paper, we modify a time-relaxation algorithm proposed in [1] and further studied in [10]. Our modification introduces the relaxation operator as a post-processing step. The operator is not time-dependent, so the discrete (relaxation) system need only be factored once. We provide convergence analysis for our algorithm along with numerical results for several model problems. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We find the motion of the cantilever as it rings down when the oscillating force is removed, by measuring the voltage induced by the oscillating capacitance in the microcantilever/counterelectrode system. The ringdown waveform was analyzed using an iterative numerical algorithm to calculate the oscillator motion, modeling the cantilever/electrode capacitance to calculate the electrostatic force. We find that nonlinearity in the motion of the cantilever is not necessarily a disadvantage. After calibration, we simultaneously measure viscosity and density of several gaseous mixtures, yielding viscosities within +/- 2% and densities within +/- 6% of NIST values.

These interventions are examined across multiple cases, which depict varying levels of performance outcomes. The analysis not only confirms the important role of top management found in early studies on IS implementation and information integration, but provides a more granular assessment of these executive level interventions. The study also shines light on the role of CRM system characteristics and cooperative cross-functional and interorganizational relationships in facilitating successful implementation of CRM systems. Researchers and managers need to consider these interventions in the context of information systems that not only impact multiple functional units but also external business partners. The results of the study provide managers with insights into areas where they can successfully intervene to manage the behavioral aspects of CRM system projects, make effective resource allocation decisions, and better plan for system functionality and structural issues. The propositions derived from the data will provide scholars with impetus for further research in clarifying the formula for successful CRM system implementation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0095-0033			WOS:000291841800002

GRB 080928 was a long burst detected by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. It is one of the exceptional cases where optical emission had already been detected when the GRB itself was still radiating in the gamma-ray band. For nearly 100 s simultaneous optical, X-ray and gamma-ray data provide a coverage of the spectral energy distribution of the transient source from about 1 eV to 150 keV. In particular, we show that the SED during the main prompt emission phase agrees with synchrotron radiation. We constructed the optical/near-infrared light curve and the spectral energy distribution based on Swift/UVOT, ROTSE-IIIa (Australia), and GROND (La Silla) data and compared it to the X-ray light curve retrieved from the Swift/XRT repository. We show that its bumpy shape can be modeled by multiple energy-injections into the forward shock. Furthermore, we investigate whether the temporal and spectral evolution of the tail emission of the first strong flare seen in the early X-ray light curve can be explained by large-angle emission (LAE). We find that a nonstandard LAE model is required to explain the observations. Finally, we report on the results of our search for the GRB host galaxy, for which only a deep upper limit can be provided.									25	0	0	0	0	25			1432-0746			WOS:000294240700017		
J	Horner, Jennifer E.; Castle, James W.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								A risk assessment approach to identifying constituents in oilfield produced water for treatment prior to beneficial use								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				74	4			989	999		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.01.012			MAY 2011	2011	A risk assessment approach incorporating exposure pathways and calculated risk quotients was applied to identifying constituents requiring treatment prior to beneficial use of oilfield produced water (OPW). In this study, risk quotients are ratios of constituent concentrations in soil or water to guideline concentrations for no adverse effects to receptors. The risk assessment approach is illustrated by an example of an oilfield water produced from non-marine geologic strata of a rift basin in sub-Saharan Africa. The OPW studied has the following characteristics: 704-1370 mg L(-1) total dissolved solids (TDS), 45-48 mg L(-1) chloride, and 103.8 mg L(-1) oil and grease. Exposure pathways of constituents in OPW used for irrigation include: ingestion of plant tissue, ingestion and direct contact of irrigated soil by livestock, inhalation of aerosols or volatilized constituents, and ingestion of OPW directly by livestock. Applying risk quotient methods for constituents in soil and water, constituents of concern (COCs) identified for irrigation and livestock watering using the OPW studied include: iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), and oil and grease. Approximately 165,000 barrels d(-1) (26,233 m(3) d(-1)) of OPW from the study site are available for use. Identification of COCs and consideration of water quantity allows for development of reliable treatment design criteria to ensure effective and consistent treatment is achieved to meet guideline levels required for irrigation, livestock watering, or other uses. This study illustrates the utility of risk assessment for identifying the COCs in OPW for treatment, the level of treatment required, and viable options for use of the treated water.

J	Klotz, Leidy								Cognitive biases in energy decisions during the planning, design, and construction of commercial buildings in the United States: an analytical framework and research needs								ENERGY EFFICIENCY				4	2			271	284		10.1007/s12053-010-9089-z			MAY 2011	2011	Despite a national goal for every building to achieve net-zero energy by 2050 and despite exemplary projects proving the technical and economic feasibility of much better energy performance, commercial buildings in the USA today use more energy per square foot than they ever have. Decisions made during planning, design, and construction (delivery) of commercial buildings appear systematically irrational, not maximizing utility for designers, occupants, or society. In other fields, notably economics, improved understanding of cognitive biases like "loss aversion" and "anchoring" has helped to explain seemingly irrational decision making. Related work has examined these cognitive biases for energy decisions made in an occupied building. Less clear is the role these cognitive biases play in the high-impact, long-term energy decisions made during commercial building delivery. As an initial step towards addressing this gap in understanding, this paper outlines key energy decisions in commercial building delivery and shows how cognitive biases may impact these decisions. A suggested approach to study these biases, and to design policies that address them, is provided. By high-lighting these potential cognitive biases, based on an understanding of the building delivery process, this paper aims to engage those with relevant expertise in the behavioral and social sciences to help address the decision making that is preventing progress towards improved energy performance in commercial buildings.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1570-646X			WOS:000293068200011		
J	Chamberlain, Jim F.; Miller, Shelie A.; Frederick, James R.				Miller, Shelie/B-8177-2015				Using DAYCENT to quantify on-farm GHG emissions and N dynamics of land use conversion to N-managed switchgrass in the Southern U.S.								AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT				141	3-4			332	341		10.1016/j.agee.2011.03.011			MAY 2011	2011	Use of a simulation model to predict long-term yield, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water quality impacts can be valuable for assessing land use conversion to bioenergy crops. The objective of this study is to assess the usability of DAYCENT for measuring environmental impacts due to land conversions from cotton and CRP lands (as unmanaged grasses) to switchgrass in the Southern U.S. We use published yield data to calibrate the crop growth parameters and test the calibrated model on independent data sets. We then apply the model to predict other relevant C and N parameters. In the case of cotton, the model simulates long-term mean cotton lint yield within 25% of observed yields across the South and within 4% of yields in the case study area of Darlington County, SC. DAYCENT also matches observed mature switchgrass yields within 25% of the mean in the range of expected fertilization rates across the region and within 6% in the case study area. Long-term simulations predict a decrease in GHG emissions (1.0-3.8 MtCO(2)-e/ha-yr) and a reduction of nitrate runoff (up to 95%) for conversions from cotton to switchgrass at N application rates of 0-135 kgN/ha. Conversely, conversion from unmanaged grasses to switchgrass resulted in annual increases of net GHG emissions (0.2-1.4 MtCO(2)-e/ha-yr) for switchgrass at no and low (45 kgN/ha) fertilization rates. Sequestration occurs due to increased soil organic C when higher levels of N are applied. At all levels of fertilization, a reduction of nitrate (50-70%) occurs when converting from unmanaged, unharvested grasses. The amount of nitrate leaching is only slightly sensitive to the fertilization rate applied to the perennial switchgrass. DAYCENT sufficiently models the "carbon debt" from land use conversion from CRP grasslands to managed switchgrass and highlights the importance of fertilization rate. Both C and N parameter results fall within published observed ranges. Thus, the long-term (10-15-year) accuracy of the model for both cotton and switchgrass offers promise as a tool for analyzing land use conversions in terms of N-managed yields and subsequent environmental impacts and benefits.

Energy Based Functional Decomposition in Preliminary Design								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				133	5					051011	10.1115/1.4004193			MAY 2011	2011	This paper presents an energy based approach to functional decomposition that is applicable to the top down design (system to subsystems to components) of mechanical systems. The paper shows that the main functions of convert and transmit are sufficient to focus on the "functional flow" or main energy flow resulting in the specific action sought as a result of the artifact being designed, and can be expanded upon at the lowest level when looking for specific solutions based upon the energy and mass balances and the knowledge within the design team. This approach considers function as a transformation and also fits the approach presented in TRIZ. The standard energy, material, and signal flows are seen as forms of energy flows, and it is only their transformation and transmission that is sought. This simplified approach, coupled with an aspect of control and interaction between a reference state and the artifact or between various components is sufficient to comprehensively describe the system that matches very nicely the value function approach of Miles. Furthermore, as these interactions can be considered as artifact-artifact affordances when considering the artifact for either artifact interaction or within an environment, its relation to the user and to the reference state can be addressed during the design phase, in addition to the functions.

We examine a large sample of Section 404 audit opinions and audit fees over a four-year period (2004-2007) and find that audit fees decline for companies that remediate a material weakness, but show that the corresponding fee reductions do not occur instantaneously. Further, despite these observed fee reductions for remediating companies, we find that audit fees are 19 percent higher three years after the initial remediation as compared to a sample of companies who never report an adverse 404 opinion. We also find that fee premiums are nearly double for companies reporting consecutive adverse 404 opinions. Finally, we note that companies with a more severe company-level weakness pay a premium that is more than twice that of companies with an account-level weakness.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0278-0380			WOS:000291233500008

Time, Travel Costs, and the Estimation of Baseball Season-Ticket Demand								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT FINANCE				6	2			119	137					MAY 2011	2011	Many previous attempts to estimate attendance demand for sporting events have concluded that teams with market power are nonetheless pricing tickets in the inelastic portion of the demand curve. These studies, however, have suffered from problems with price and seat quality measurement, multiproduct pricing strategies, and simultaneity in prices and quantities. Using geographically-specific sales data for Atlanta Braves season tickets and multigame ticket packages, we estimate demand for attendance by adopting the travel-cost methodology used in the non-market valuation literature. Using conservative assumptions, our Tobit specification produces point estimates of the price elasticity of demand for full-season ticket packages that are larger in magnitude than those in the early literature and do not reject the null hypothesis of pricing at unit elasticity. We also estimate the income elasticity for ticket packages as being well over 1.0 for full-season ticket packages.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1558-6235			WOS:000291074800002

Historically, the role of experiments has been as a primary tool for the design and understanding of nuclear system behavior, while M&S played the subordinate role of supporting experiments. In the new era of multiscale, multiphysics computational-based technology development, this role has been reversed. The experiments will still be needed, but they will be performed at different scales to calibrate and validate the models leading to predictive simulations for design and licensing. Minimizing the required number of validation experiments produces cost and time savings. The use of multiscale, multiphysics models introduces challenges in validating these predictive tools - traditional methodologies will have to be modified to address these challenges.This paper gives the basic aspects of a methodology that can potentially be used to address these new challenges in the design and licensing of evolving nuclear technology. The main components of the proposed methodology are verification, validation, calibration, and uncertainty quantification - steps similar to the components of the traditional US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing approach, with the exception of the calibration step. An enhanced calibration concept is introduced here, and is accomplished through data assimilation. The goal of this methodology is to enable best-estimate prediction of system behaviors in both normal and safety-related environments. This goal requires the additional steps of estimating the domain of validation, and quantification of uncertainties, allowing for the extension of results to areas of the validation domain that are not directly tested with experiments. These might include the extension of the M&S capabilities for application to full-scale systems. The new methodology suggests a formalism to quantify an adequate level of validation (predictive maturity) with respect to existing data, so that required new testing can be minimized, saving cost by demonstrating that further testing will not enhance the quality of the predictive tools.The proposed methodology is at a conceptual level. Upon maturity, and if considered favorably by the stakeholders, it could serve as a new framework for the next generation of the best estimate plus uncertainty (BEPU) licensing methodology that the NRC has developed. In order to achieve maturity, the methodology must be communicated to scientific, design, and regulatory stakeholders for discussion and debate. This paper is the first step in establishing that communication. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

The cavity resonances can be effectively suppressed by using conductive mounting posts and adding a resistance in series with the connection between one or more of these mounting posts and the PCB ground plane. This paper derives a simple closed-form expression for determining an optimal series resistance for damping these cavity resonances over a wide range of frequencies. This analysis was done for rectangular boards mounted on four posts located near the corners. A similar analysis could be done to determine the optimal resistance values for other board shapes and mounting post locations. For the four-post configuration, shorting one or more of the posts does not affect the optimum resistance value for the remaining posts.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0018-9375			WOS:000290994000025

The soft phonon occurs for the [1 1 1] transverse acoustic mode at the zone boundary. The phonon energies in this vicinity are found to continuously decrease with decreasing temperature from above room temperature. This softening stops at a temperature close to T-s, where a structural phase transition from cubic to tetragonal symmetry occurs. The overall results are consistent with previous data that reported phonon softening and a (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) type superstructure in several Ba1-xKxBiO3 systems. However, we also find weaker (0.5, 0.5, 0) type superstructure peaks that reveal an additional component to the modulation. No significant change related to the superconductivity was observed for these soft phonon energies or linewidths. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Fullerenes for Applications in Biology and Medicine								CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY				18	14			2045	2059					MAY 2011	2011	Fullerenes as a unique class of carbon allotropes have been studied extensively for their distinctive material properties and potential technological applications, including those in biology and medicine. Since a major focus in the latter has been on drug development and formulation, in this paper we highlight some representative studies related to such a focus, including the use of fullerenes for drug-like functions and for their improving the formulation of established drugs. Also discussed are some other potential medically relevant applications of fullerenes, such as their serving as potent agents in photodynamic therapy and magnetic imaging.									67	4	1	23	0	72			0929-8673			WOS:000290612000002	21517770	
J	Halloran, Sean Michael; Adelberg, Jeffrey								A macronutrient optimization platform for micropropagation and acclimatization: using turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) as a model plant								IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT				47	2			257	273		10.1007/s11627-011-9364-5			MAY 2011	2011	Tissue culture medium is often overlooked as a factor in plant biotechnology. Most work uses Murashige and Skoog (MS; Physiol Plant in 15:473-497, 1962) inorganic medium formulation, which is not likely optimal for many of the plant systems where it is used. This current study of macronutrient factors simultaneously altered media volume and amount of tissue (plants per vessel), sucrose, nitrogen (as NO (3) (-) and NH (4) (+) ions), and K(+) in a d-optimal design space with only 55 experimental units (including five true replicates). Meso- and micro-nutrient concentrations were lowered (5% of MS) to determine which elements were most critical to plantlet quality. Plantlet quality was quantified by multiplication in the laboratory and survival and growth in the greenhouse. Plantlets grown at the lowest plant density, the lowest macronutrient concentration (20 mM), and equi-molar proportions of NH (4) (+) /K(+) resulted in the best multiplication ratio and 100% greenhouse survival. Multiplication ratio in vitro and survival in the greenhouse were well correlated with one another. Laboratory dry mass, media use, sucrose use, and the uptake of the macronutrients NO (3) (-) , NH (4) (+) , and K(+) were not well correlated with plantlet quality. Plantlets with the greatest uptake of P, Ca, Mg, and Mn had the best multiplication in the laboratory and on subsequent transfer, acclimatized and grew fastest in the greenhouse. Phosphorus was shown to be most depleted in media. This work demonstrates a platform to simultaneously optimize several nutritive components of tissue culture media to produce plantlets that perform well in both laboratory and greenhouse environments. Plant quality was related with factors outside the macronutrient design, and this platform indicated where to expand the experimental space. Fixed, flat-screen presentations revealed less of the response surface than interactive profiles driven by the reader.									7	0	0	6	0	7			1054-5476			WOS:000290845700006

The crystal and molecular structure of the title compound was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The title compound consists of a 1,1'-di[3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl]-3,3'-butylenedibenzimidazole and two bromo ligands coordinated to a palladium atom in a distorted square-planar cis-system. Two benzoimidazole rings are connected to each other by a C4H8 bridge. The substituted benzimidazole ligand forms a bidentate chelate with palladium, bonding via the carbene carbon atoms. There are two independent molecules A and B in the asymmetric unit. The Pd-Br bonds are 2.4675(14) and 2.4601(13) angstrom, and the Pd-C-carbene bonds are 1.985(9) and 1.986(9) angstrom for molecule A. Each A and B molecule is stabilized with intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds and C-H center dot center dot center dot n interactions. The palladium-carbene complex was tested as a catalyst in the direct arylation of benzothiazole with arylbromides. The most suitable reaction conditions for the direct arylation of benzothiazole with arylbromides are NMP, K3PO4, Pd-NHC and 130 degrees C. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using an exploratory qualitative approach, 62 successful high-risk students from nine different colleges and universities were interviewed and asked to identify and describe someone on campus who had been most influential in their ability to persist. The 54 campus personnel who were identified by these students were interviewed twice to learn what they do to help students succeed and persist. Seven themes on how college personnel positively influence high-risk student success and persistence were identified.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0897-5264			WOS:000290777200005

Antioxidant and prooxidant effects of polyphenol compounds on copper-mediated DNA damage								JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY				105	5			745	753		10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2011.02.009			MAY 2011	2011	Inhibition of copper-mediated DNA damage has been determined for several polyphenol compounds. The 50% inhibition concentration values (IC(50)) for most of the tested polyphenols are between 8 and 480 mu M for copper-mediated DNA damage prevention. Although most tested polyphenols were antioxidants under these conditions, they generally inhibited Cu(I)-mediated DNA damage less effectively than Fe(II)-mediated damage, and some polyphenols also displayed prooxidant activity. Because semiquinone radicals and hydroxyl radical adducts were detected by EPR spectroscopy in solutions of polyphenols, Cu(I), and H(2)O(2), it is likely that weak polyphenol-Cu(I) interactions permit a redox-cycling mechanism, whereby the necessary reactants to cause DNA damage (Cu(I), H(2)O(2), and reducing agents) are regenerated. The polyphenol compounds that prevent copper-mediated DNA damage likely follow a radical scavenging pathway as determined by EPR spectroscopy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Each facility collected prevalence data during a preselected 24-hour period out of the 72-hour time frame selected by the national study.METHODS: A standardized 1-page data collection form for each subject included demographic data, use of wound care protocols and pressure redistribution surfaces, PU stage and location, risk assessment using the Braden Scale for Pressure Sore Risk, head-of-bed position, turning and repositioning, mobility, weight, incontinence, documentation of a PU within 24 hours of admission, device-related ulcers, and adequacy of documentation. Facility-specific data on a second form included Braden Scale score, bed type, use of pressure redistribution devices on the heels, hospital unit, turn schedule use, plastic brief use, presence of incontinence-associated dermatitis, and nursing documentation. Chart reviews were performed to determine hospital-versus non-hospital-acquired PU occurrence. Each PU was recorded separately and linked to its identifying stage.RESULTS: The PU incidence of adults managed in acute care inpatient units at NMCP was 6.6% and the prevalence was 10%. The most common location of facility-acquired PUs was the heels (50%). In contrast, national benchmarking data found that the highest incidence of PUs occurred in the sacral region.CONCLUSIONS: Benchmarking allows health care professionals to compare outcomes in their agencies to outcomes in comparable facilities. Identification of areas in which agency outcomes compare negatively to benchmark data should prompt implementation of quality improvement initiatives. National PU prevalence surveys provide a benchmark to evaluate an individual facility's care and treatment of patients at risk for pressure ulceration. The true benefit of participation in such surveys, however, is determined by local health care professionals' ability to use national data to improve clinical practice.									13	1	0	1	0	14			1071-5754			WOS:000290559200006	21483271

Modification and characterization of ultrafiltration membranes for treatment of produced water								JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE				373	1-2			178	188		10.1016/j.memsci.2011.03.010			MAY 1 2011	2011	This contribution describes the surface modification of low molecular weight cutoff regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membranes by grafting poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)-block-poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) (PPEGMA) nanolayers from the membrane surface using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization. The objective of the work was to change the membrane surface properties in ways that limit foulant accumulation on these membranes and provide an easy, chemical-free way to remove any attached foulants during produced water filtration. AIR-FOR spectra confirmed the successful grafting of both polymers from the membrane surface. Analysis of AFM topographical images indicated that membrane surface roughness decreased slightly from 2.6 nm for the unmodified membrane to 1.7 nm following PNIPAAm-b-PPEGMA modification. The performance of the modified membranes was tested by measuring water flux using synthetic produced water developed from an oil-in-water emulsion. Polymer grafting led to a roughly 40% decrease in the water flux, but the final flux was comparable to commercial membranes used for removal of organics with high salt passage. Furthermore, modified membranes showed slower flux decline than unmodified membranes, and, hence, the modified membranes allowed a 13.8% higher cumulative volume of water to be processed over a 40 h cross-flow filtration run. To test potential for chemical-free cleaning, filtration runs were carried out before and after a temperature-controlled water rinse. Flux recovery was better for the modified membranes after a cold water rinse. The flux recovered fully to initial values for both the PNIPAAm- and PNIPAAm-b-PPEGMA-modified membranes; while only similar to 81% of the initial flux was recovered for the unmodified membrane. All three membranes exhibited poor salt rejection, as would be expected for ultrafiltration membranes. However. TOC removal efficiencies were higher than 97% for PNIPAAm-b-PPEGMA-modified membranes. Taken together, results from this work indicate that PNIPAAm-b-PPEGMA modified ultrafiltration membranes could be used to separate emulsified oils from large volumes of produced water at high flux.

Seasonal Fluctuation of Ergovaline and Total Ergot Alkaloid Concentrations in Tall Fescue Regrowth								CROP SCIENCE				51	3			1291	1296		10.2135/cropsci2010.07.0402			MAY 2011	2011	Common cultivars of tall fescue [Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort = Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.] host a fungal endophyte that produces ergot alkaloids. These alkaloids are linked to fescue toxicosis, a serious livestock disorder in the United States. This study was conducted to determine how ergot alkaloid concentrations fluctuate throughout the growing season in tall fescue regrowth. In 2005, plots were established in pastures of endophyte-infected tall fescue growing in Missouri, Georgia, and South Carolina. Each month of the growing season, plots were clipped and forage allowed to regrow; regrowth was sampled from April through October 2006 and analyzed for ergovaline and total ergot alkaloid concentrations. At all three sites, ergovaline concentration was lowest during the spring, increasing slightly through the summer months and then sharply in the early autumn. This pattern of ergovaline fluctuation did not mimic data published from experiments in which tall fescue was grazed or was allowed to grow without defoliation. Total ergot alkaloid concentration followed a bimodal curve, with highest concentration in the spring and fall and lowest concentration in the summer. We conclude that common cultivars of endophyte-infected tall fescue should be regarded as highly toxic in the autumn and less toxic in the summer, even if pastures are clipped. We also conclude that the toxicity potential of tall fescue regrowth in the spring depends on which ergot alkaloids prove most responsible for fescue toxicosis.									7	0	0	5	0	7			0011-183X			WOS:000289713900038

For such business model pursuits, electronic intermediation possesses the ability to cultivate new marketplaces and restructure supply chains. The economic literature identifies four distinct intermediary roles, specifically: (i) information and (ii) logistics management, (iii) transaction securitization, as well as (iv) insurance/market-making and liquidity management. Research notes that electronic intermediaries, while possessing clear advantages in their ability to manage information, face greater challenges in allowing parties to benefit from the facilitation of more complex coordination activities, namely transaction securitization in addition to insurance/market-making and liquidity management. In an effort to better understand pursuit of functional intermediary roles, our analysis of data collected on 182 electronic intermediaries explores relationships between intermediation roles and profitability. Business models relying solely upon the provision of information management are likely to realize lower levels of profitability. Alternately, the intermediary roles of logistics management as well as insurance/market-making and liquidity management realize higher levels of profitability. Moreover, when comparing commodity- and service-based intermediaries, the provision of logistics management on the part of commodity-based firms sees higher levels of profitability, with insurance and liquidity provisions associated with greater profitability for both commodity- and service-based firms. Finally, when contrasting traditional firms expanding operations in digital markets with Internet pure-plays, we find transaction securitization functions increase the likelihood of realizing greater profitability for non-Internet pure-plays.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0011-7315			WOS:000289950100001

The proposed diagram builds on a theoretical regime diagram defined in the phase space of collision Weber numbers We and the drop diameter ratio p by including critical angle of impact considerations. In this study, the theoretical regime diagram is first evaluated against a comprehensive dataset for drop collision experiments representative of raindrop collisions in nature. Subsequently, the theoretical regime diagram is modified to explicitly describe the dominant regimes of raindrop interactions in (We, p) by delineating the physical conditions necessary for the occurrence of distinct types of collision-induced breakup (neck/filament, sheet, disk, and crown breakups) based on critical angle of impact consideration. Crown breakup is a subtype of disk breakup for lower collision kinetic energy that presents distinctive morphology. Finally, the experimental results are analyzed in the context of the comprehensive collision regime diagram, and conditional probabilities that can be used in the parameterization of breakup kernels in stochastic models of raindrop dynamics are provided.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0022-4928			WOS:000290360700011

In order to characterize the mineralogical source of the U and possible structural controls on its presence, a deep (214 m) well was cored adjacent to one of the enriched wells. The highest gamma-ray emissions in the recovered core occur in coarse biotite granite at a depth just below 52 m. A slickenlined fault plane at 48.6 m and narrow pegmatite layers at depths of 113, 203 and 207 m also yield high gamma-ray counts. Thin sections were made from the above materials and along several subvertical healed fractures. Uraninite and coffinite are the principal U-rich minerals in the core. Other U-bearing minerals include thorite and thorogummite, monazite, zircon and allanite. Primary uraninite occurs in the biotite granite and in pegmatite layers. Secondary coffinite is present as tiny (< 5 mu m) crystals dispersed along fractures in the granite and pegmatites. Coffinite also occurs along the slickenlined fault plane, where it is associated with calcite and calcic zeolite and also replaces allanite. Coffinite lacks radiogenic Pb, hence is considerably younger than the uraninite.Dissolution of partially oxidized Ca-rich uraninite occurring in the surficial biotite granite (or secondary coffinite in fracture zones) is likely the main source for the current high levels of U in nearby area wells. The high-U well waters have a carbonate signature, consistent with pervasive calcite vein mineralization in the core. Aqueous speciation calculations suggest U transport as an uranyl (U(6+)) hydroxyl-carbonate complex. Later reduction resulted in secondary precipitation along fractures as a U(4+) mineral (i.e., coffinite). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, our findings on the series In (x) Yb (y) Co4Sb12 [0 a parts per thousand currency sign (x, y) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.2] have further motivated an attempt to form triple-filled skutterudites Ce0.1In (x) Yb (y) Co4Sb12 with In and Yb concentrations [0 a parts per thousand currency sign (x, y) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.2] and with the Ce concentration held constant (Ce-0.1). All of these samples have been prepared via a simplified melting-annealing-sintering procedure and were first characterized by means of x-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, followed by measurements of the Hall coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivities, and Seebeck coefficient. Our aim is to further elucidate the roles of the three elements (Ce, In, and Yb) in these materials. Compared with the addition of just In or Yb, we found that simultaneous addition of both In and Yb reduced the lattice thermal conductivity without significantly degrading the power factor. Further addition of the third element (Ce), along with In and Yb, also produced a similar result. However, we noticed that some of the In and Yb were also observed in the form of secondary phases (InSb and Yb2O3), not entering entirely as filler atoms. As a result of our investigation, several compositions achieved increased sustainability and enhanced thermoelectric performance, with maximum ZT values of about 1.3 to 1.4 obtained at around 800 K.									26	1	0	0	0	27			0361-5235			WOS:000289901700043		
J	Higham, Timothy E.; Korchari, Paul G.; McBrayer, Lance D.								How muscles define maximum running performance in lizards: an analysis using swing- and stance-phase muscles								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				214	10			1685	1691		10.1242/jeb.051045			MAY 2011	2011	Maximum locomotor performance is crucial for capturing prey, escaping predators and many other behaviors. However, we know little about what defines maximum performance in vertebrates. Muscles drive the movement of the limbs during locomotion, and thus likely play a major role in defining locomotor capacity. For lizards, the iliofibularis, a swing-phase muscle, is often linked to ecology and/or performance. However, stance-phase muscles likely limit performance given that they propel the animal. Using a small semi-arboreal lizard (Sceloporus woodi), we compared how swing-and stance-phase muscles relate to maximum running speed and acceleration. We employed both a level and vertical trackway to elicit ecologically relevant locomotor performance. Six individuals were filmed at 250. frames. s(-1) in lateral view. Following performance trials, upper and lower hindlimbs were sectioned and assessed using histochemistry. Fast glycolytic, fast oxidative and slow oxidative fibers were detected and counted in the gastrocnemius (GA; stance phase) and iliofibularis (IF; swing phase) muscles. In addition, the mean fiber diameter for each fiber type in each muscle was determined, as was the fiber cross-sectional area. We found that properties of the GA, but not the IF, were positively correlated with performance. Interestingly, certain attributes of the GA were correlated with maximum vertical locomotion whereas others were correlated with maximum level locomotion. We conclude that stance phase, not swing phase, limits maximum performance in this species of lizard. In addition, we highlight the need to include properties of stance-phase muscles and a spectrum of ecologically relevant behaviors when attempting to correlate locomotor physiology with ecology and/or performance.									18	0	0	18	0	18			0022-0949			WOS:000289935400012	21525314

Following the approaches described in, e.g. [2, 10, 11, 16], we aim at constructing input currents j, which contain the most information about the difference between the unknown physical conductivity sigma* and a given approximation sigma(0). The differences can be measured by different discrepancy functionals and the optimal input currents which maximize these functionals depend on the function spaces chosen for defining j and on the norm for measuring the discrepancy. Moreover, the definition of the appropriately weighted Sobolev spaces depends on sigma and this subsequently influences the iteration for maximizing the functionals.Numerical experiments illustrate features of the optimal input currents obtained for several combinations of function spaces. The reconstructions with these optimal currents are compared with those with standard input currents (sinusoid and dipole). The differences between the optimal currents obtained by different function space settings are significant. Two newly developed optimal currents can yield qualitatively better reconstructions.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0928-0219			WOS:000290145400003

Using the extended Hamilton's principle, the system's equations of motion are derived and truncated to finite-mode state-space representation through standard vibration analysis techniques. A novel asymptotic feedback control law is then developed for the high-bandwidth tracking control of the system. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller over a wide frequency range. It is shown that the closed-loop system bandwidth can be improved by incorporating the system's higher modes in the control law. To improve the tracking performance against uncertainties and disturbances, we upgrade the controller to a robust variable structure form, and show that desirable results can be obtained in the presence of perturbations.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1077-5463	1741-2986		WOS:000289977800002

Let r and f be fixed integers with f positive. Given an elliptic curve E, defined over K, we consider the problem of counting the number of degree f prime ideals of K with trace of Frobenius equal to r. Except in the case f = 2, we show that 'on average,' the number of such prime ideals with norm less than or equal to x satisfies an asymptotic identity that is in accordance with standard heuristics. This work is related to the classical Lang-Trotter conjecture and extends the work of several authors.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0305-0041			WOS:000290108100004

Mota, Linda/E-4878-2014				Nonylphenol-mediated CYP induction is PXR-dependent: The use of humanized mice and human hepatocytes suggests that hPXR is less sensitive than mouse PXR to nonylphenol treatment								TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY				252	3			259	267		10.1016/j.taap.2011.02.017			MAY 1 2011	2011	Nonylphenol (NP), a by-product of alkylphenol ethoxylates, is a pervasive surfactant that activates the xenosensing nuclear receptor, the pregnane X-receptor (PXR) in transactivation assays in vitro. We are interested in determining if NP activates PXR in vivo, determining if hPXR and mPXR act similarly, and investigating the role of PXR in protecting individuals from NP. Wild-type (WT), PXR-null, and humanized PXR (hPXR) mice were treated with NP at 0, 50 or 75 mg/kg/day for one week, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction, liver histopathology, and serum NP concentrations were examined. WT mice treated with NP showed induction of Cyp2b, and male-specific induction of Cyp2c and Cyp3a. CYPs were not induced in PXR-null mice, demonstrating that PXR is necessary for NP-mediated CYP induction. CAR-mediated CYP induction was not observed in the PXR-null mice despite previous data demonstrating that NP is also a CAR activator. hPXR mice only showed moderate Cyp induction, suggesting that hPXR is not as sensitive to NP as mPXR in vivo. NP-mediated Cyp3a induction from three human hepatocyte donors was not significant, confirming that hPXR is not very sensitive to NP-mediated CYP induction. Lastly, mice with PXR (mPXR and hPXR) showed lower NP serum concentrations than PXR-null mice treated with NP suggesting that PXR plays a role in decreasing liver toxicity by basally regulating phase I-III detoxification enzymes that promote the metabolism and elimination of NP. In summary, PXR is required for NP-mediated CYP-induction, mPXR mediates greater CYP induction than hPXR in vivo, and the presence of PXR, especially mPXR, is associated with altered histopathology and increased clearance of NP.

Industrial Legacy Matters: Implications for the Development and Use of Indices of Regional Competitiveness								ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY				25	2			130	142		10.1177/0891242410393951			MAY 2011	2011	This article addresses the usefulness of indices of regional competitiveness in guiding economic development strategies for communities with different industrial legacies. Growth models for employment and per capita income are estimated for 151 metropolitan areas in the Southern United States. The explanatory variables for regional growth include measures of New Economy inputs (innovation, human capital, and entrepreneurial environment) and industry structure (composition, size, age, and diversity). The findings indicate that metro growth rates in per capita income are associated primarily with New Economy inputs whereas employment growth rates are related primarily to industry structure characteristics. In addition, interaction terms between the policy and structure variables indicate that policy inferences from indices of competitiveness should vary by city type. For example, increases in knowledge workers and entrepreneurial environment are more positively associated with income growth rates in the smaller, more specialized metropolitan areas. Economic history and industrial legacy matter in the application of competitiveness indices to inform economic development policy.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0891-2424	1552-3543		WOS:000289347900002

The ultracapacitor-supplied motor assists the engine during periods of high power demand. The ultracapacitor may be recharged via regeneration during braking and by the engine during periods of low power demand. A reduced-order model and a detailed simulation model of the powertrain are created for control design and evaluation of fuel economy, respectively. A heuristic rule-based controller is used for testing the impact of different component combinations on fuel economy. After a suitable combination of engine, motor, and ultracapacitor sizes has been determined, a model predictive control strategy is created for power management which achieves better fuel economy than the rule-based approach. Various component sizing and control strategies tested consistently indicate a potential for 5% to 15% improvement in fuel economy in city driving with the proposed mild hybrid powertrain. This order of improvement to fuel economy was confirmed by deterministic dynamic programming which finds the best possible fuel economy.									39	1	0	0	0	40			1063-6536			WOS:000289845000009

To achieve this goal an optimization-based control algorithm is formulated that uses short range radar and traffic signal information predictively to schedule an optimum velocity trajectory for the vehicle. The control objectives are: timely arrival at green light with minimal use of braking, maintaining safe distance between vehicles, and cruising at or near set speed. Three example simulation case studies are presented to demonstrate the potential impact on fuel economy, emission levels, and trip time.									75	6	0	1	0	81			1063-6536			WOS:000289845000023

Holstein cows were assigned randomly to receive either CS of palm (PO) or safflower (SO) oils from 30 d prepartum until 35 d postpartum (dpp) and CS of PO or fish oil (FO) from 35 to 160 dpp. Supplementation of CS of FA was at 1.5% of dietary dry matter. Cows (n = 32) were sampled three times weekly from parturition to 35 dpp for analyses of plasma concentrations of haptoglobin and fibrinogen. Cows (n = 47) were sampled for neutrophil phagocytic and oxidative burst activities toward Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and neutrophil abundances of L-selectin and beta(2)-integrin assessed by flow cytometry at 32 d prepartum, within 7 h after parturition, and 4 and 7 dpp. Profiles of FA in neutrophils and cytokine production (i.e., tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta) were assessed prepartum (n = 14), 35 (PO vs. SO; n = 26) and 85 dpp (PO vs. FO; n = 28). Plasma concentrations of haptoglobin and fibrinogen were greater for cows fed SO compared with PO. The percentage of neutrophils with phagocytic and oxidative burst activities was not affected by transition diets, but activities per neutrophil were greater in SO compared with PO diets at 4 (phagocytosis and oxidative burst) and 7 dpp (oxidative burst). Neutrophil abundance of L-selectin, but not beta(2)-integrin, was greater in SO compared with PO at 4 and 7 dpp. Neutrophil productions of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta were increased at 35 dpp in SO compared with PO diets, but production of TNF-alpha was attenuated in FO compared with PO at 85 dpp. Neutrophil ratios of n-6:n-3 FA were greater at 35 dpp in the SO diet and less at 85 dpp in FO compared with PO diets. In conclusion, cows supplemented with CS of SO had improved innate immunity (i.e., acute phase response and neutrophil function) to better cope with the bacterial challenges in the postpartum period. Conversely, CS of FO attenuated neutrophil cytokine production.									29	0	0	27	1	30			0022-0302			WOS:000289789000014	21524518

Since the calculation of efficient sets of these complex systems is challenging, it is desirable to decompose the overall system into component multiobjective programs, that are more easily solved and then construct the efficient set of the overall system. For some classes of complex systems, algebraic properties of set operations and relations are developed between the efficient set of the overall system and the efficient sets of subproblems. The properties indicate that multiple decomposition and coordination schemes, with varying assumptions regarding the system, may be applied to the same initial system.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0022-3239			WOS:000289564300009

The problems with these overruns start with the cost estimation process before projects begin. Studies have shown that early cost estimations reflect best-case scenarios rather than realistic expectations, and have attributed technical, economic, psychological, and political reasons for underestimation. The primary objectives of this research were to determine how costs have been presented and updated in environmental impact statements, to identify endemic technical problems with cost estimation during the environmental review of surface transportation projects, and to develop recommendations for improving cost estimation and disclosure. Cost estimation methods were analyzed from the documents of 100 projects, including draft environmental impact statements, final environmental impact statements, and records of decision. The study concluded that the lack of guidance on how to include cost estimation in environmental review revealed itself in the level of detail and attention given to estimating costs. Agencies omitted or included various aspects of cost estimation randomly. Professional organizations should fill the gap of the need for specific guidance to cost estimation for environmental review so it can evolve as a state of the practice.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0049-4488			WOS:000289437500008

However, there is ample room for improvement. Because most existing research considers RD and TD as separate research fields, the primary objective of this paper is to develop a sequential robust-tolerance design method to jointly determine the best factor settings and the closed-form solutions for the optimal specification limits. We then apply the proposed method to a destructive quality characteristic. Finally, a case study and sensitivity analyses are performed for verification purposes, and further studies are discussed.

As an example, images of the calibration microspheres are obtained and demonstrated with the extended DOF in a spectral domain OCT system.									9	1	0	2	0	10			2040-8978			WOS:000292185100014

Beginning with the modern era of surgical management, survival has become routine, and now the focus is on optimizing a near-normal return to function and cosmesis while, limiting the frequency and morbidity of reconstructive procedures. Here we discuss the most frequently used strategies, their principles, and most recent outcomes for the management of exstrophy worldwide. Advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed in broad terms with the understanding that one universally accepted technique for managing bladder exstrophy has yet to be developed.

Observations were performed with the Gamma-ray Burst Optical and Near-infrared Detector at the 2.2 m telescope on the La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile. We conducted five observations from 1.9 d to 227.2 d after the trigger and obtained deep images in the g'r'i'z' and JHK(s) bands.Results. Based on accurate seven-channel photometry covering the optical to near-infrared wavelength range, we derive a photometric redshift of z = 0.94(-0.10)(+0.05) for the unabsorbed host galaxy of GRB 071028B. In contrast, we show that the afterglow with an intrinsic extinction of A(V)(SB) = (0.70 +/- 0.11) mag is moderately absorbed and requires a relatively flat extinction curve. According to the reported Swift/BAT observations, the energetics yield an isotropic energy release of E-gamma,iso(rest) = (1.4(-0.7)(+2.4)) x 10(51) erg.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0004-6361			WOS:000289557200118

Internal uncertainties in the derived abundances are typically less than or similar to 0.05 dex. The stars in our sample have all been previously shown to have abundances that correlate with the condensation temperature (T-c) of the elements in the sense of increasing abundances with increasing T-c; these trends have been interpreted as evidence that the stars may have accreted H-depleted planetary material. Our newly derived abundances also correlate positively with T-c, although slopes of linear least-square fits to the [m/H]-T-c relations for all but two stars are smaller here than in previous studies. When considering the refractory elements (T-c > 900 K) only, which may be more sensitive to planet formation processes, the sample can be separated into a group with positive slopes (four stars) and a group with flat or negative slopes (six stars). The four stars with positive slopes have very close-in giant planets (three at 0.05 AU) and slopes that fall above the general Galactic chemical evolution trend. We suggest that these stars have accreted refractory-rich planet material but not to the extent that would increase significantly the overall stellar metallicity. The flat or negative slopes of the remaining six stars are consistent with recent suggestions of a planet formation signature, although we show that the trends may be the result of Galactic chemical evolution.									40	0	0	0	0	40			0004-637X			WOS:000289626500055

The goal is to further establish the SCS technique as a new route for developing new TL and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimetric materials. Undoped and doped MgO samples were synthesized by SCS and characterized using radioluminescence (RL) and TL The data obtained showed that Li doping can increase considerably the intensity of the RL and TL from Ln-doped MgO produced by SCS. In MgO:Ln,Li the introduced lanthanides are responsible for the emission during both RL and TL processes, although other emission bands are also observed (e.g., similar to 700-750 nm). The incorporation of lanthanides also introduces trapping centers as indicated by different peaks in the TL curves. The results in this study show that the SCS technique can potentially produce materials with TL intensity comparable to commercial dosimetric materials, although further optimizations are still required.

Using various microscopy techniques we investigated the structural adaptations which facilitate the production of these large egg cells in three species of shark: the Atlantic sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, dusky smoothound, Mustelus canis and the little gulper shark, Centrophorus uyato. The ovarian follicle of elasmobranchs follows the typical vertebrate pattern, with one notable exception; the zona pellucida reaches extreme widths, over 70 mu m, during early oogenesis. Contact between the follicle cells and the oocyte across the zona pellucida is necessary for oogenesis. We describe here a novel set of large, tube-like structures, which we named follicle cell processes that bridge this gap. The follicle cell processes are more robust than the microvilli associated with the follicle cells and the oocyte plasma membrane and much longer. During early oogenesis the follicle increases in size relatively quickly resulting in a wide zona pellucida. At this stage the follicle cell processes appear taut, uniform and radially oriented. As oogenesis continues the zona pellucida narrows and the follicle cell processes change their orientation, appearing to wrap around the oocyte. The presence of the contractile protein actin within the follicle cell processes and their change in orientation may well be an adaptation for maintaining the integrity of these large oocytes. The follicle cell processes also contain electron dense material, identical to material found within the follicle cells, suggesting a role in the transport of metabolites to the developing oocyte. J.

J	Daqaq, Mohammed F.; Alhazza, Khaled A.; Qaroush, Yousef								On primary resonances of weakly nonlinear delay systems with cubic nonlinearities								NONLINEAR DYNAMICS				64	3			253	277		10.1007/s11071-010-9859-3			MAY 2011	2011	We implement the method of multiple scales to investigate primary resonances of a weakly nonlinear second-order delay system with cubic nonlinearities. In contrast to previous studies where the implementation is confined to the assumption of linear delay terms with small coefficients (Hu et al. in Nonlinear Dyn. 15:311, 1998; Ji and Leung in Nonlinear Dyn. 253:985, 2002), in this effort, we propose a modified approach which alleviates that assumption and permits treating a problem with arbitrarily large gains. The modified approach lumps the delay state into unknown linear damping and stiffness terms that are functions of the gain and delay. These unknown functions are determined by enforcing the linear part of the steady-state solution acquired via the method of multiple scales to match that obtained directly by solving the forced linear problem. We examine the validity of the modified procedure by comparing its results to solutions obtained via a harmonic balance approach. Several examples are discussed demonstrating the ability of the proposed methodology to predict the amplitude, softening-hardening characteristics, and stability of the resulting steady-state responses. Analytical results also reveal that the system can exhibit responses with different nonlinear characteristics near its multiple delay frequencies.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0924-090X			WOS:000289482400004

Mathilakath Keralapurath, Madhusudhanan/0000-0002-1496-1078			Effects of in ovo injection of electrolyte solutions on the pre- and posthatch physiological characteristics of broilers								POULTRY SCIENCE				90	5			1058	1066		10.3382/ps.2010-00893			MAY 1 2011	2011	Effects of the automated in ovo injection of various concentrations and volumes of physiological electrolyte solutions and a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (CEN) on broiler embryo development and posthatch chick performance were investigated in 5 individual consecutive trials to test potential diluents for commercial injection. A 200-mu L saline solution (117 mM) injection treatment and a noninjected control were included in all trials. For the first 4 trials, solutions were injected into the amnion of embryos on d 16 of incubation, and subsequent percentage incubational egg weight loss, embryo mortality, proportional embryo BW, embryo moisture content, proportional yolk sac weight, and yolk moisture content were evaluated on d 18. In trial 5, solutions were injected into the amnion on d 18, and subsequent hatchability and posthatch performance were investigated. In trial 1, a 200-mu L injection of 5 mM tripotassium citrate (C6H5K3O7) and a 200-mu L injection of CEN at 1: 400 and 1: 8,000 concentrations had no detrimental effect on proportional embryo BW. However, embryo moisture content was increased by the injection of either solution at all concentrations. In trial 2, 200-mu L injections of saline, potassium chloride (KCl), or sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4) solution at various physiological concentrations did not affect any of the parameters examined. In trial 3, the injection of 2,000 mu L of 117 mM saline reduced 0 to 18 d percentage egg weight loss. In trial 4, percentage egg weight loss was reduced and embryo moisture was increased by a 200-mu L saline (117 mM) injection, but not by 200 mu L of solutions of CEN (1:400), C6H5K3O7 (5.0 mM), or NaH2PO4 (1.0 mM) in 5.5 mM KCl. Compared with controls in trial 5, plasma refractive index was increased by CEN-KCl (1:400-5.5 mM) and saline (117 mM) injections, but not by C6H5K3O7-KCl (5 mM-5.5 mM). The current study indicated that 5.5 mM KCl and 5 mM C6H5K3O7 have the greatest potential for use individually or in combination for the commercial injection of broiler hatching eggs.									10	1	0	10	0	11			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000289409200018	21489955
