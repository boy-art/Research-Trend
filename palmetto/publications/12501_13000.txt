The membrane produced an order of magnitude decrease in current densities and a shift to quasi reversibility due to a decrease in the D-appt of FeCO2H, from 4.51 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) to 1.42 x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1), (2.18 x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1) from release experiments). The MDEA050 (comprising 50 mu m disks) maintained its enhanced current density attributes confirming its value as an effective electrode for biosensors. Finite element modeling (FEM) simulations successfully replicated the voltammograms of the MDEAs.									11	1	0	5	0	11			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000266537700003

Equivalent circuit modeling showed an approximate three-fold increase in solution resistance. R(sol), and all order of magnitude increase in charge transfer resistance R(et,) resulting from a reduction in apparent diffusivity of FeCO(2)H Additionally, both resistive parameters decreased while the capacitance (Q) increased with decreasing microdisk diameter; consistent with an increase in effective electroactive area. The hydrogel layer did not compromise enhanced mass transport achieved by the MDEA and thus may be used to advantage in biosensors.									5	1	0	2	0	5			1040-0397			WOS:000266537700004		
J	Joshi, Hem; Toler, Joe; Moser, Bryan R.; Walker, Terry								Biodiesel from canola oil using a 1: 1 molar mixture of methanol and ethanol								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LIPID SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				111	5			464	473		10.1002/ejlt.200800071			MAY 2009	2009	Canola oil was transesterified using a 1 : 1 molar mixture of methanol and ethanol (M/E) with potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst. The effects of catalyst concentration (0.5-1.5 wt-%), molar ratio of M/E to canola oil (3 : 1 to 20 : 1) and reaction temperature (25-75 degrees C) on the percentage yield measured after 2.5 and 5.0 min were optimized using a central composite design. A maximum percentage yield of 98% was obtained for a catalyst concentration of 1.1 wt-% and an M/E to canola oil molar ratio of 20 : 1 at 25 degrees C at 2.5 min, whereas a maximum percentage yield of 99% was obtained for a catalyst concentration of 1.15 wt-% and all molar ratios of reactants at 25 degrees C at 5 min. Statistical analysis demonstrated that increasing catalyst concentration and molar ratio of reactants resulted in curvilinear and linear trends in percentage yield, both at 2.5 and 5 min. However, reaction temperature, which affected the percentage yield at 2.5 min linearly, was insignificant at 5 min. The resultant mixed methyl/ethyl canola esters exhibited enhanced low-temperature performance and lubricity properties in comparison to neat canola oil methyl esters and also satisfied ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards with respect to oxidation stability, kinematic viscosity, and acid value.									12	1	0	6	0	12			1438-7697			WOS:000266538000007

The viscosity of the MTGase-treated gelatin solution (2%w/w) increased from 86.25 +/- 1.77 (0 min) to 243 +/- 12.37 cp (80 min). SDS-PAGE results indicated that the molecular weight of fish gelatin solutions increased after treatment with microbial transglutaminase. Tensile strength decreased from 61.60 +/- 1.77 (0 min) to 56.42 +/- 2.40MPa (30 min), while E% increased from 13.94 +/- 5.09 (0 min) to 15.78 +/- 5.97% (30 min) at 2% (w/w) MTGase concentration. The oxygen permeability and water vapour permeability did not change as a function of treatment time at 2% (w1w) MTGase concentration. The incorporation of nanoclay inhibited the increase of oxygen permeability. Film colour values (L, a, and b) did not change. but haze values increased from 5.24 +/- 0.40 (0 min) to 6.44 +/- 0.94 (50 min). XRD and TEM results suggested that the nanoclay was exfoliated in fish gelatin film. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									30	5	0	15	0	35			0308-8146			WOS:000263216000026

Determination of the optimal coupling phase depends on the oscillator equivalent circuit and the location of mutual coupling between the oscillators. In this paper, the authors examine the effects of coupling phase on the mutual injection locking range. Three element coupled oscillator arrays (COAs) were mutually coupled at two different locations, with each coupling location presenting a different resonance to the coupling network, and the optimal coupling phase required to generate a linear phase shift in the range of -90 degrees to 90 degrees was determined. For each coupling location, when the coupling phase was off by 180 degrees, the arrays were shown to lock with a limited range and operate in a mode other than the in-phase mode.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-926X			WOS:000265937400012

In this paper, a full-wave finite-element method (FEM-SPICE) technique for modeling dispersive materials is proposed. A finite-element formulation employing Whitney elements capable of analyzing electromagnetic geometries with dispersive media is described, and a Norton equivalent network is developed for each element. The overall network can be analyzed using a circuit simulator based on SPICE, and is suitable for both frequency- and time-domain analysis. This approach exploits the flexibility of finite-element mesh generation and computational efficiency of modern circuit simulators. Simple test configurations are analyzed to validate the proposed formulation.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0018-9375			WOS:000266333000016

The technique divides a complex source geometry into two components. One component consists of differential-mode sources and the pieces of the structure that contribute to the differential-mode radiation. The other component consists of common-mode sources at cable attachment points and the parts of the structure that play a role in the radiation due to common-mode cable currents. The two component geometries are much easier to model than the complete structure. This modeling approach also provides the modeler with insight regarding the design parameters that most influence one type of radiation or the other.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0018-9375			WOS:000266333000029		
J	Rapp, Adam								Outsourcing the sales process: Hiring a mercenary sales force								INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT				38	4			411	418		10.1016/j.indmarman.2009.03.006			MAY 2009	2009	In today's highly competitive environment, many firms make the decision to outsource a business process on the well-established idea that it is better to contract for services that are not within the scope of a company's core set of competencies. While outsourcing was once limited to peripheral firm activities such as advertising, firms are expanding the types of functions they outsource. For instance, many firms have begun to outsource their sales force, or at a minimum, have begun to consider 'renting' a sales force rather than 'owning' their own sales force. Being a recent trend, very little is known about what prompts firms to outsource their sales forces, nor the consequences of doing so. As such, this research explores the factors associated with determining whether a firm should outsource their sales force as well as the value to be had by engaging in such a decision. Most importantly, we offer that beyond the standard cost-based analysis, there are numerous issues that deserve consideration and examination before a firm elects to outsource its sales force.

A content analysis was performed using emergent coding methods and 16 categories were determined. Reliability was acceptable (Cohen's Kappa = 0.702). Discrepancies were corrected by consensus. Frequencies of individual categories were computed.Results: Most "Tips and Tricks" are directed at dieting/restricting calories (28.6%) and distraction (14.0%). Most disturbing, 11% of comments were directed at lying and concealing symptoms.Discussion: Clinicians aware of "Tips and Tricks" might be better equipped to recognize the symptoms of anorexia early in treatment. Knowledge of "Tips and Tricks" can also facilitate better education, making it difficult for clients to conceal their illness.

The study involved in different experimental factors such as solvent, ethanol concentration (35-95, v/v), material to solvent ratio (1:25-1:100, w/v), acidic medium, extraction pressure (200-500 MPa), time (2.5-30 min) and temperature (30-90 degrees C). The extraction yield, total phenolic contents, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity and superoxide anion scavenging capability of the HPE sample were examined and then compared with those of ultrasonic extraction and conventional extraction samples. The application of HPE obtained higher extraction yield compared to other extraction methods. However, there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activities among these various extractions. Compared with some conventional extraction method, the HPE exhibited higher extraction efficiency in terms of higher extraction yield and extraction time.									25	1	0	10	1	26			0950-5423			WOS:000265034700011		
J	Gooding, Charles H.								Analysis of alternative flow sheets for the hybrid chlorine cycle								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				34	9			4168	4178		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.055			MAY 2009	2009	This paper reports the results of the most complete conceptual study conducted to date on hydrogen production using the hybrid chlorine cycle. Three alternative process flow sheets were developed, each capable of producing hydrogen at 35 degrees C (308 K) and 21 bar. The alternative approaches differ primarily in the way HCl is isolated and converted to hydrogen and chlorine gases. Aspen Plus(TM) simulation software was used to model the unit processes, supplemented where necessary by custom Excel spreadsheets. Major equipment was sized for a 200-million kg/yr plant; feasible materials of construction were identified; fixed capital investments and variable costs were estimated. Estimated net thermal efficiencies of the flow sheets range from 30% to 36%, based on the lower heating value of the hydrogen produced. With electrical power valued at $0.05/kWh, the cost of hydrogen produced by the hybrid chlorine cycle would be at least $3/kg. These results indicate that direct electrolysis of water is a more attractive way to produce hydrogen than any presently conceived version of the hybrid chlorine cycle.

Preventing suicidal behavior depends on an understanding of the developmental transitions in suicide risk and whether the likelihood of a suicide attempt can be predicted prospectively.Methods: Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used for the study. The sample is nationally representative, and includes 10,424 youth assessed over three time points spanning 7 years. MPLUS was used to analyze the data.Results: Latent class analysis showed that youth could be classified into three latent classes representing degree of suicide risk. Indicators of risk included depressive symptoms, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, having a family history of suicidal behavior, and having a friend history of suicidal behavior. Latent transition analyses showed that youth in the low-risk group remained at low risk both 1 and 7 years later. Although some youth who were classified as high-risk transitioned to a lower risk group 7 years later, a significant proportion remained at high risk. Analyses also revealed that the probability of making a suicide attempt was higher for youth in the high-risk latent class 1 and 7 years earlier.Conclusions: Findings indicate that suicide prevention efforts should be targeted primarily at youth at high risk for suicide; most youth classified as "low risk" remained at low risk as they transitioned to young adulthood.

For disparate MAPLE DW-based microfabrication applications, the droplet formation during MAPLE DW should be first carefully understood. Toward this goal, this study aims to study the effects of laser fluence and material properties of material to be transferred on the formed droplet in direct writing glycerol-water droplets using MAPLE DW. It was found that (1) at a given glycerol concentration ratio, the droplet diameter was linearly dependent on the laser fluence, and the slope of this relationship was dependent on the glycerol concentration, and (2) the droplet diameter had no systematic relationship with the glycerol concentration ratio. This study reveals important phenomena for droplet formation in MAPLE DW; further theoretical modeling is expected to further explain these observations. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

The estimates are based on empirical formulas determined through earlier comparisons between in situ and ground-based measurements. Good agreement is found in the current study when the radar measurements are sufficiently well collocated and the convection is sufficiently homogeneous for meaningful comparison. The mean and variance of the background electric field are also estimated from the coherent scatter data and used to assess the contribution of fine structure in the convection pattern to Joule heating. Fine structure in the scale size regime between similar to 2 and 200 km is found to increase the second moment of the electric field by up to 50% for intervals of a few minutes during a substorm when the flow was highly irregular. The average contribution to the net joule heating rate is generally likely to be modest, however. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1364-6826			WOS:000266648900008

Structural equation modeling revealed that. the association between low quality of community environment and increased psychological distress was accounted for by the mediating role of social support. Findings suggest the importance of social support in improving the menial health of African American women from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Because social support is affected by the environment in which women live, interventions should be community-focused.

SEMI-QUANTITATIVE METHODS FOR CRAYFISH SAMPLING: SEX, SIZE, AND HABITAT BIAS								JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY				29	2			208	216		10.1651/08-3018.1			MAY 2009	2009	We evaluated the effectiveness of four sampling methods for freshwater crayfish in five aquatic habitat types in Congaree National Park, South Carolina, USA. Electrofishing was the most successful technique in terms of the diversity of species collected, the number of individuals collected, and the widest range of sizes collected. Seine netting was the next most successful method. Baited minnow traps were biased towards form I males and larger individuals, while dip netting was biased towards smaller individuals. The relative success of techniques depended somewhat upon species. For two stream dwelling species, Procambarus acutus and P. chacei, electrofishing collected significantly more individuals than any other technique. For P. troglodytes, the most abundant species and a habitat generalist, electrofishing was superior to dip netting in some habitats, but did not significantly differ from traps or seine netting. For Fallicambarus fodiens, no significant differences among the effectiveness of any sampling methods were detected.									15	0	0	15	0	15			0278-0372			WOS:000265125100008

Locational market power arises when locational advantage allows suppliers to act non-competitively and raise prices above competitive levels. We propose a quantifiable definition of locational market power and analyze its properties over a general network. We also conduct a detailed analysis of the topological cause of the market power for a real electrical network using network analysis tools. We show that strategic alliances among small generators with geographical advantage can lead to significant amounts of market power. In the case of inelastic demand. the collusive behavior among suppliers leads to higher incidence of locational market power. This power is curtailed as demand becomes more responsive to price, supporting the view that efficient markets require active participation from the consumers. We also observe that if the supply is more elastic than demand, then supply can override some of the positive effects of elastic demand.

The results strongly imply that periodic ordering of impurities improved the overall optical and mechanical properties of the material over time. Forty years after preparation, "hot" luminescence spectra in gallium phosphide (GaP) are similar to those for nanocrystals. The aged pure and N-doped crystals exhibit stimulated emission at 300 K. The aged GaP:N:Sm at room temperature generates bright green or yellow and red tunable luminescence. These results correlate with Raman light scattering and microhardness data obtained from the same crystals.									9	0	0	1	0	9			0361-5235			WOS:000264176300003

Among them, the gravity hypothesis (GH) explains that extreme SSD has evolved in spiders because smaller males have a mating or survival advantage by climbing faster. However, few studies have supported this hypothesis thus far. Using a wide span of spider body sizes, we show that there is an optimal body size (7.4 mm) for climbing and that extreme SSD evolves only in spiders that: (1) live in high-habitat patches and (2) in which females are larger than the optimal size. We report that the evidence for the GH across studies depends on whether the body size of individuals expands beyond the optimal climbing size. We also present an ad hoc biomechanical model that shows how the higher stride frequency of small animals predicts an optimal body size for climbing.									35	0	0	34	0	35			1010-061X	1420-9101		WOS:000265252100004	19243487	
J	Kholodenko, Arkady								Veneziano amplitudes, spin chains and Abelian reduction of QCD								JOURNAL OF GEOMETRY AND PHYSICS				59	5			600	619		10.1016/j.geomphys.2009.01.006			MAY 2009	2009	Although QCD can be treated perturbatively in the high energy limit, lower energies require uses of nonperturbative methods such as ADS/CFT and/or Abelian reduction. These methods are not equivalent. While the first is restricted to supersymmetric Yang-Mills model with number of colors going to infinity, the second is not restricted by requirements of supersymmetry and is designed to work in the physically realistic limit of a finite number of colors. In this paper we provide arguments in favor of the Abelian reduction methods. This is achieved by further developing results of our recent works re-analyzing Veneziano and Veneziano-like amplitudes and the models associated with these amplitudes. It is shown, that the obtained new partition function for these amplitudes can be mapped exactly into that for the Polychronakos-Frahm (P-F) spin chain model recoverable from the Richardon-Gaudin (R-G) XXX spin chain model originally designed for treatments of the BCS-type superconductivity. Because of this, it is demonstrated that the obtained mapping is compatible with the method of Abelian reduction. The R-G model is recovered from the asymptotic (WKB-type) solutions of the rational Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (K-Z) equation. Linear independence of these solutions is controlled by determinants whose explicit form (up to a constant) coincides with Veneziano (or Veneziano-like) amplitudes. in the simplest case, the determinantal conditions coincide with those discovered by Kummer in the 19th century. Kummer's results admit physical interpretation by relating determinantal formula(s) to Veneziano-like amplitudes. Furthermore, these amplitudes can be interpreted as Poisson-Dirichlet distributions playing a central role in the stochastic theory of random coagulation-fragmentation processes. Such an interpretation is complementary to that known for the Lund model widely used for the description of coagulation-fragmentation processes in QCD. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Energy Absorption Buildup Factors and Energy Conservation								JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				46	5			479	483		10.1080/18811248.2007.9711555			MAY 2009	2009	The ANSI/ANS energy absorption buildup factors (ANSI/ANS-6.4.3-1991) were used to determine if they conserve absorbed energy from a point source of monoenergetic photons in an infinite, absorbing medium. Air, water, concrete, iron, lead, and uranium were considered for photon energies ranging from 0.015 to 15 MeV. The primary calculations were based on fitting natural cubic splines to the energy absorption buildup factors and analytical integration of the energy absorbed using the cubic spline curve fit. This method was supplemented by linear spline interpolation. For air, water, concrete, and iron, the ANSI/ANS energy absorption buildup factors were determined using the method of moments with the energy attenuation and deposition coefficients of Hubbell (NSRDS-NBS 29). The results of this Study essentially confirmed energy conservation for these four materials using the energy attenuation and deposition coefficients of Hubbell. For lead and uranium, the ANSI/ANS energy absorption buildup factors were determined using the discrete ordinates-integral transport method with PHOTX energy attenuation and deposition coefficients that are essentially the same as those in the ANSI/ANS report. The calculations in this study could not confirm energy conservation for these two materials.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0022-3131	1881-1248		WOS:000267391600010

Soil and nutrient retention in winter-flooded ricefields with implications for watershed management								JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION				64	3			173	182		10.2489/jswc.64.3.173			MAY-JUN 2009	2009	The ability of water resources to support aquatic life and human needs depends, in part, on reducing nonpoint source pollution amid contemporary agricultural practices. Winter retention of shallow water on rice and other agricultural fields is an accepted management practice for wildlife conservation; however, soil and water conservation benefits are not well documented. We evaluated the ability of four post-harvest ricefield treatment combinations (stubble-flooded, stubble-open, disked-flooded and disked-open) to abate nonpoint source exports into watersheds of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Total suspended solid exports were 1,121 kg ha(-1) (1,000 lb ac(-1)) from disked-open fields where rice stubble was disked after harvest and fields were allowed to drain, compared with 35 kg ha(-1) (31 lb ac(-1)) from stubble-flooded fields where stubble was left standing after harvest and fields captured rainfall front November 1 to March 1. Estimates of total suspended solid exports from ricefields based on Landsat imagery and USDA crop data are 0.43 and 0.40 Mg km(-2) day(-1) in the Big Sunflower and L'Anguille watersheds, respectively. Estimated reductions in total suspended solid exports front ricefields into the Big Sunflower and L'Anguille watersheds range from 26% to 64% under hypothetical scenarios in which 65% to 100% of the rice production area is managed to capture winter rainfall. Winter ricefield management reduced nonpoint source export by decreasing concentrations of solids and nutrients in, and reducing runoff volume from, ricefields in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0022-4561			WOS:000267138100005

Comparison of Interventional Outcomes According to Preoperative Indication: A Single Center Analysis of 2,240 Limb Revascularizations								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS				208	5			770	778		10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2009.01.025			MAY 2009	2009	BACKGROUND: Outcomes after lower extremity revascularization are usually reported according to the level of peripheral arterial disease (PAD, aortoiliac or infrainguinal) or the method of treatment (open or endovascular Surgery). Outcomes Stratified by indication, ie, claudication or critical limb ischemia (rest pain and tissue loss), have not been Well Studied. The purpose Of this Study Was to compare postoperative Outcomes according to the preoperative indications.STUDY DESIGN: Outcomes of 2,240 consecutive limb revascularizations in 1,732 patients from January 1998 through December 2005 were stratified and examined according to preoperative indication: claudication (n = 999 limbs), ischemic rest pain (n = 464 limbs), or tissue loss (n = 777 limbs). End points measured included primary and secondary interventional or operative patency, limb salvage, Survival, amputation-free Survival, maintenance of ambulation, maintenance of independence, and resolution of presenting symptoms.RESULTS: The proportion of medical comorbidities and the severity of disease increased significantly by cohort from claudication to rest pain to tissue loss. With a mean followup of 1,089 days (range 0 to 3,689 days), overall Outcomes performance declined consistently according to indication for all end points measured at 5 years (claudication, rest pain, tissue loss, p value): secondary reconstruction patency (93%, 80%, 66%) respectively; p < 0.001), limb salvage (99%, 81%, 68%, respectively; p < 0.001), Survival (78%, 46%, 30%, respectively; p < 0.001), amputation-free survival (78%, 42%, 25%, respectively; p < 0.001), maintenance of ambulation (96%, 78%, 68%, respectively; p < 0.001), maintenance of independence (98%, 85%, 75%, respectively; p < 0.001), and resolution of presenting symptoms (79%, 61%, 42%, respectively; p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: There is a declining spectrum of Outcomes performance from claudication to rest pain to tissue loss. These Findings question the accuracy of all Previously Published data for critical limb ischemia, for which rest pain and tissue loss are usually blended and reported as a single Outcomes Value.

Frequency domain statistics previously proposed for this purpose are reviewed. A time domain statistic is then developed and investigated. The performance of these statistics are compared. Multivariate versions of the results are constructed. The methods are applied in the analysis of temperatures and precipitations from Atlanta and Athens, Georgia. Our interest here is driven by the need to identify a good climatological reference series for a given station.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0143-9782			WOS:000265377200004

The structure and sensitivity of the eye of different life history stages of the ontogenetic migrator Gnathophausia ingens								MARINE BIOLOGY				156	6			1347	1357		10.1007/s00227-009-1176-3			MAY 2009	2009	The structure and ultrastructure of the photoreceptors of several life history stages of the ontogenetically migrating lophogastrid crustacean Gnathophausia ingens were examined. The younger instars of this species live in a much brighter light field than the older instars, and this difference is reflected in differences in their visual systems. The shallowest free living individuals (instars 3 and 4) possess a superposition eye with almost no clear zone, which minimizes the light shared between ommatidia and reduces the sensitivity of the eye. A progression to superposition optics with a large clear zone, usually associated with night-active or deep-living species, occurs as the animals move deeper in the water column. Regional differences within the eye are also evident, with a largely nonexistent clear zone in the dorsal region and a large clear zone in the ventral region in the eyes of instar 5 animals, the first instar to move to deeper depths. The deepest living instars (10-12) possess superposition optics with a large clear zone throughout the eye, and are significantly more sensitive to light than the younger, shallower instars.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000264873800023

Loci were tested on 80 specimens of S. lewini from four Eastern Pacific samples. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 6 to 31 (mean = 14). Observed and expected levels of heterozygosity per locus ranged from 0.39 to 0.91 (mean = 0.70) and from 0.54 to 0.90 (mean = 0.76), respectively. No pairs of loci were in gametic disequilibrium after Bonferroni correction of alpha. One locus showed significantly lower heterozygosity than expected under Hardy-Weinberg proportions in two populations, possibly caused by null alleles.									9	0	0	9	0	9			1755-098X			WOS:000265897200079	21564803

The backbone of the peptide was derived from the cell lytic amoebapore H-3 domain, which becomes completely inactive upon modification by two glutamate residues linked to the epsilon-amide group of the COOH-terminal lysine through gamma-linkages (H-3Glu2). This modified H-3 domain regains its lytic activity against PSMA-positive cells (LNCaP) after the gamma-linked glutamate residues are cleaved by PSMA. Our previous in vitro results demonstrate that the modified amoebapore peptide has strong cytolytic activity towards PSMA-positive cells and very little activity towards PSMA-negative cells. In the present study, the in vivo efficacy of this modified peptide was examined in human LNCaP prostate tumor xenografts in nude mice. The results showed significantly decreased tumor size and PSA levels in treated mice as compared to control mice. As well, 5/12 of the treated mice were tumor-free. Peptide distribution studies showed that peptide levels in the prostate tumors maintained a steady concentration for approximately 6 h. Single-dose toxicity Studies showed no toxic effects of the peptide when administered intraperitoneally or intravenously at a dose of 30 mg/kg.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1791-2997			WOS:000265280100008	21475841

Only a few apricot cultivars have been described as resistant, most originating from North American breeding programmes. Several PPV resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been mapped in various progenies, consistently highlighting the contribution to the resistance of the upper part of linkage group 1 (LG1). However, to date, no consensus has been reached on the precise number of QTLs linked to the resistance to PPV in apricot and P. davidiana or on their accurate position on the genetic linkage map. In the present study, the quantitative resistance of cultivar 'Harlayne' was analysed over five growth periods in a large F1 population. Four QTLs were identified, three mapping on LG1, explaining between 5% and 39% of the observed phenotypic variance. In an effort to further this analysis of PPV resistance in apricot, these results were merged in a single QTL meta-analysis with those of five other PPV resistance analyses available in the literature. Three consensus QTL regions were identified on LG1 and a putative fourth region on LG3. QTL meta-analysis also revealed the contribution of each resistant cultivar to metaQTLs, providing interesting comparative data on the resistance factors shared between the resistance sources used in the various studies. Finally, it was shown that one of the metaQTLs co-localizes with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, thus providing new hypotheses on the mechanisms of PPV resistance in apricot.									41	1	0	37	0	41			1464-6722			WOS:000265229000004	19400838

Recently, some active ingredients of Noni juice have been successfully isolated and intensively studied. Because dendritic cells (DCs) are central regulators both in priming innate and adaptive immune responses and in maintaining self tolerance, in the current study we treated DCs with fermented Noni Exudate (fNE) in order to explore their function in regulating other immune cells. It was shown that fNE-treated DCs stimulate proliferation of splenocytes, among which, B cells are the major responsive cell group. The proliferative response of B cells to fNE-treated DCs is cell contact-dependent, CD40L-independent; and the adhesion feature of DCs was enhanced to form large DC-B conjugation cluster. Moreover, it was demonstrated that fNE-treated DCs promote B cell differentiation and Ig class switching. These results lay a foundation for the further exploration of fNE as a biological response modifier in the immune system.									7	1	0	7	0	8			1021-335X			WOS:000265274500002	19360287

In addition, in a single patient we measured the electrical conductivity before and after the thermal ablation of normal and tumour tissue. The average conductivity of tumour tissue was significantly higher than normal tissue over the entire frequency range (from 4.11 versus 0.75 mS cm(-1) at 10 Hz, to 5.33 versus 2.88 mS cm(-1) at 1MHz). We found no significant correlation between tumour size and measured electrical conductivity. While before ablation tumour tissue had considerably higher conductivity than normal tissue, the two had similar conductivity throughout the frequency range after ablation. Tumour tissue conductivity changed by +25% and -7% at 10 Hz and 1 MHz after ablation (0.23-0.29 at 10 Hz, and 0.43-0.40 at 1 MHz), while normal tissue conductivity increased by +270% and +10% at 10 Hz and 1 MHz (0.09-0.32 at 10 Hz and 0.37-0.41 at 1 MHz). These data can potentially be used to differentiate tumour from normal tissue diagnostically.									36	1	0	21	0	38			0967-3334	1361-6579		WOS:000265764400003	19349647

From these libraries, 190,425 clones were partially sequenced from the 5' end and 42,619 clones were sequenced from the 3' end, and a total of 182,241 high-quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained. These coalesced into 23,442 tentative contigs and 9843 singletons, for a total of 33,825 apple unigenes. Functional annotation of this unigene set revealed an even distribution of apple sequences among the three main gene ontology categories. Of similar to 33,000 apple unigenes, 8437 (25%) had no detectable homologs (E >0.1) in the Arabidopsis genome. When the entire apple unigene set was compared with the entire citrus [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] unigene set and the poplar (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray) predicted proteome, both members of the core eudicot and rosids clade, 13,521 of apple unigenes matched one or more sequences in citrus, while 25,817 had counterparts in the poplar protein database. Apple-Arabidopsis-citrus-poplar comparisons revealed closer evolutionary relationships between apple and poplar than with the other two species. Genes involved in basic metabolic pathways appear to be largely conserved among apple, citrus, poplar, and Arabidopsis.									25	1	0	24	0	26			1940-3372			WOS:000208575800006

The Connexin43 Carboxyl-Terminal Peptide ACT1 Modulates the Biological Response to Silicone Implants								PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY				123	5			1440	1451		10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181a0741d			MAY 2009	2009	Background: The implantation of a biomedical device elicits a wound-healing response that progresses through the three phases of wound healing: inflammation, cellular proliferation, and matrix remodeling. This response culminates in a fibrous collagen encapsulation of the implant. Subsequent contraction of this "scar-like" tissue can lead to physical disfigurement, implant extrusion, or impairment of implant function, necessitating surgical revision or removal. ACT1 is a synthetic peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the cellular gap junction protein connexin43. This novel peptide has recently been shown to modulate cutaneous wound healing, reduce scarring, and promote regenerative repair of the skin following injury. In this study, the authors investigated the ability of the ACT1 peptide to modulate the wound-healing response to biomedical device implantation.Methods: Silicone disks coated with either vehicle control or ACT1 peptide were implanted submuscularly into male Sprague-Dawley rats. Capsulectomies were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 14, and 28. The implant capsules and surrounding tissue were analyzed histologically and biochemically.Results: ACT1 modulated the wound-healing response to silicone implants by attenuating neutrophil infiltration, increasing vascularity of the capsule tissue, reducing type I collagen deposition around the implant, and reducing the continued presence of contractile myofibroblasts.Conclusion: ACT1 may provide an enabling technology for modulating the wound-healing response to implants, promoting integration of implanted materials and tissue-engineered devices in the human body.

Effects of time-specific F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum inoculation overlays on prelay ts-11-strain M. gallisepticum vaccination on blood characteristics of commercial laying hens								POULTRY SCIENCE				88	5			911	916		10.3382/ps.2008-00438			MAY 1 2009	2009	Two trials were conducted to determine the effects of a prelay ts-11-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (ts-11MG) vaccination alone or in combination with subsequent time-specific F-strain M. gallisepticum (FMG) inoculations on the blood characteristics of commercial laying hens. The following 4 treatments were utilized: 1) sham vaccination at 10 wk of age, 2) vaccination of ts-11MG at 10 wk, 3) ts-11MG at 10 wk overlaid by FMG inoculation at 22 wk, and 4) ts-11MG at 10 wk overlaid by FMG at 45 wk. Parameters measured in both trials were whole blood hematocrit, plasma protein, serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, and serum calcium. No significant age x treatment interactions and no significant age or treatment main effects were observed for any of the blood parameters investigated, except for serum calcium. At wk 22, serum calcium concentrations were increased by vaccination with ts-11MG at 10 wk, and levels were further increased when the ts-11MG vaccination at 10 wk was overlaid by an FMG inoculation at 22 wk. These results suggest that ts-11MG vaccination at 10 wk of age alone or combined with F-strain inoculum overlays at either 22 or 45 wk may be used without any consequential effects on hematocrit or the lipid and protein levels in the blood of commercial layers. Because elevations in serum calcium were not associated with changes in hen performance, as reported in a previous companion article, it is further suggested that prelay ts-11MG vaccination before FMG inoculation overlays during lay may provide adequate protection against field strain M. gallisepticum infections while being innocuous to layer performance.									7	0	0	5	0	7			0032-5791			WOS:000265405900004	19359676

In each trial, the following 4 treatments were utilized: sham vaccination at 10 wk of age, ts-11MG vaccination at 10 wk of age, ts-11MG at 10 wk of age overlaid by FMG inoculation at 22 wk of age, and ts-11MG at 10 wk of age overlaid by FMG at 45 wk of age. Necropsies were performed at the end of both trials (58 wk of age), using 2 birds from each of 4 replicate units per treatment, to observe treatment effects on the following parameters: liver weight, liver lipid and moisture concentrations, incidence of fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome, ovary weight, number of mature ovarian follicles, and the total and segmental weights, lengths, and histologies of the oviduct and small intestine. Treatments affected only vaginal length as a percentage of total oviduct length. Vaginas were relatively longer in hens that had only been vaccinated with ts-11MG at 10 wk in comparison to all the other treatment groups, including controls. Except for relative vaginal length, the digestive and reproductive organs of layers were not influenced by the ts-11MG and FMG treatment regimens imposed in this study. These results confirm that when coupled with FMG inoculations during lay, prelay ts-11MG vaccinations may be a practical substitute for prelay FMG inoculations for providing continual protection against field-strain M. gallisepticum infections in layers.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0032-5791			WOS:000265405900014	19359686

Visualizing the runtime behavior of embedded network systems: A toolkit for TinyOS								SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING				74	7	SI		446	469		10.1016/j.scico.2009.02.004			MAY 1 2009	2009	TinyOS is an effective platform for developing lightweight embedded network applications. But the platform's lean programming model and power-efficient operation come at a price: TinyOS applications are notoriously difficult to construct, debug, and maintain. The development difficulties stem largely from a programming model founded on events and deferred execution. In short, the model introduces non-determinism in the execution ordering of primitive actions - an issue exacerbated by the fact that embedded network systems are inherently distributed and reactive. The resulting set of possible execution sequences for a given system is typically large and can swamp developers' unaided ability to reason about program behavior.In this paper, we present a visualization toolkit for TinyOS 2.0 to aid in program comprehension. The goal is to assist developers in reasoning about the computation forest underlying a system under test and the particular branches chosen during each run. The toolkit supports comprehension activities involving both local and distributed runtime behavior.The constituent components include (i) a full-featured static analysis and instrumentation library, (ii) a selection-based probe insertion system, (iii) a lightweight event recording service, (iv) a trace extraction and reconstruction tool, and (v) three visualization front-ends. We demonstrate the utility of the toolkit using both standard and custom system examples and present an analysis of the toolkit's resource usage and performance characteristics.

J	Goddard, Megan A.; Mikhailova, Elena A.; Post, Christopher J.; Schlautman, Mark A.; Galbraith, John M.								Continental United States Atmospheric Wet Calcium Deposition and Soil Inorganic Carbon Stocks								SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL				73	3			989	994		10.2136/sssaj2008.0004			MAY-JUN 2009	2009	Organic and inorganic soil C pools are major components of the global C budget, yet they are still poorly estimated and understood. This study ranked atmospheric wet Ca(2+) deposition from 1994 to 2003 within the continental United States by soil order using spatial analysis of Ca(2+), wet deposition data and a state soil geographic database. The total average annual atmospheric wet deposition (AAAWD) of Ca(2+) within the continental United States was 8.6 x 10(8) kg, which would be equivalent to the theoretical formation of 2.6 x 10(8) kg C as soil inorganic C (SIC), barring losses from erosion and deep leaching. The soil orders receiving the highest area-normalized total AAAWD of Ca(2+) were: (i) Alfisols (172 kg km(-2) Ca(2+)), (ii) Mollisols (170 kg km(-2) Ca(2+)), (iii) Histosols (168 kg km(-2) Ca(2+)), and (iv) Vertisols (157 kg km(-2) Ca(2+)). Barring losses from erosion and leaching, these Ca(2+) wet deposition fluxes would equate to the theoretical formation of the following amounts of area-normalized total C equivalents in the pedon: (i) Alfisols, 52 kg C km(-2); (ii) Mollisols, 51 kg C km(-2); (iii) Histosols, 50 kg C km(-2); and (iv) Vertisols, 47 kg C km(-2). The sequestration of SIC has been shown to be important in soil orders of nonarid regions, particularly in Mollisols and Alfisols.									7	2	0	6	0	7			0361-5995			WOS:000265621900032

In this paper. we analyzed the co-occurrence of tree species in a 25-ha old-growth temperate forest plot in Northeastern China. The analysis was conducted at seven scales from 5 m x 5 m up to 100 m x 100 m in order to determine the patterns of co-occurrence at different spatial scales. Our analyses were conducted for all species. species with larger abundances, species with larger sizes, and five phylogenetic-based species groups. Our results showed that at smaller scales, the co-occurrence patterns of all species, species with larger abundances. and species with larger sizes were significantly higher than expected by chance. suggesting that strong interspecies competition exists in the community. At larger scales, there was no significant difference compared to randomized matrices. The result indicated that plant assembly rules are only found at small spatial scales. However, when co-occurrence metrics were restricted to phylogenetic groups, we could not find any clear evidence of interspecific competition within these groups. In conclusion, we found that competition is an important assembly rule at small scales in governing tree communities of our temperate forest, although it is not the only process involved. The importance of other processes should also be taken into account to explain species co-occurrence patterns. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two-dimensional arrays of silver nanoparticles adsorbed on glass slides were immobilized using poly(methylmethacrylate). The method provides an efficient way for stabilization of particles on surfaces. It was concluded that increasing the dielectric function of the surrounding medium promotes plasmon coupling between silver nanoparticles. On the basis of the quasi-crystal line approximation, the optimum refractive index was calculated that yielded the strongest and highest Q extinction band due to coherent plasmon coupling.									25	0	0	0	0	25			1932-7447			WOS:000265529700031

Electrospinning is a versatile method commonly used to manufacture polymer nanofibers. Collection of electrospun nanofibers across two parallel plates is a technique useful for creating nanofiber structures because it allows for the collection of linearly oriented individual nanofiber arrays and these arrays can be easily transferred to other substrates or structures. It is of importance to have some understanding of the capabilities of this collection method, such as the maximum length of fibers that can be collected across two parallel plates. The effect of different electrospinning parameters on maximum fiber length, average fiber diameter, diameter uniformity, and fiber quality was explored. It was shown that relatively long continuous polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers with average diameters from approximately 350 nm to 1 mu m could be collected across parallel plates at lengths up to 35-50 cm. Experimental results lead to the hypothesis that even longer continuous nanofibers over 50 cm could be collected if the size of the parallel plates were increased. Extending the maximum fiber length that can be collected across parallel plates could expand the applications of electrospinning. Polymer solution concentration, plate size, and applied voltage were all shown to have varying effects on maximum fiber length, fiber diameter, and fiber uniformity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report development of active fiber-based materials for early self-detection detection of BV. The proposed approach relies on the visual detection and measurement of the enzyme sialidase, which is present in elevated concentrations in vaginal fluid of BV patients. The developed colorimetric biosensor can detect sialidase in small droplets of vaginal fluid. Our experiments show that colorimetric sialidase substrate can be readily and with high yield immobilized on polymeric fibers coated by a nanolayer of a cationic polymer. Thus prepared fibers change color from white to bright blue in the presence of sialidase. The existing tests for BV are performed either in a lab setting or in a physician's office. In the proposed method, nanofiber colorimetric sensors can be incorporated into female panty liners so to enable the patient to monitor her BV status without visiting physician's office. It is expected that the proposed approach will lead to a new generation of fiber-based biosensors incorporated into everyday use household items. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Polymer brushes, thin nanolayers constituted of densely grafted macromolecules. are promising candidates to use in many biomedical applications to control attachment of bacteria to a surface. in this work five different polymer brushes were synthesized and tested with respect to their ability to regulate Staphylococcus aureus adhesion. Namely, two mixed brushes [consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) and a positively charged polymers, poly(2-vynil pyridine) or quartenized poly(2-vynil pyridine)] are investigated along with one-component brushes of the respective polymers. Bacterial adhesion was regulated over two orders of magnitude via altering the polymer brush composition. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

PDMS thin film displacement as a result of pressure changes was transduced by a capacitive detection technique to produce quantitative measurement of absolute pressures. Oxygen measurements were obtained by transducing the current change between a Pt and an Ag/AgCl electrode on a glass substrate, with KCl soaked filter paper as the electrolytic media that is separated from the oxygen carrying fluid by a thin PDMS membrane. The best sensitivity for the pressure sensor was similar to 0.1 nA/KPa, with a noise limited resolution of -0.09 KPa. For the oxygen sensor, the best sensitivity was similar to 2.75 mu A for 1% change in oxygen content of the surrounding media, with a noise limited resolution of similar to 6.18 ppm oxygen. These experimental results agree with theoretical modeling predictions, and suggest that the semi-permeable and biocompatible PDMS can be successfully adopted as the contacting membrane in an integrated sensor design to quantify pressure and oxygen content in blood.

One problem associated with such treatment is systemic toxicity of tPA, which can act upon plasminogen both in circulation and at the clot site, generating systemic plasmin and rendering the patient highly vulnerable to hemorrhaging. Here we report the synthesis and in vitro characterization of prototype nanodevices capable of binding to fibrin clots and initiating their dissolution. The devices consist of tPA and antifibrin antibody covalently attached to a 40 nm polystyrene-latex nanoparticles. These nanoscale devices can directly deliver tPA to the clot site through fibrin-specific antibody. In vitro fibrinolysis assay showed that protein-nanoparticle conjugates were only slightly less potent than free tPA. Moreover, tPA activity in the absence of clots was more than 3-fold less than that of the free enzyme. This property can be critical for therapeutic applications because nanoparticles can be expected to dissolve clots at approximately the same rate as free tPA while simultaneously cleaving much less plasminogen in the circulation, lowering the risk of hemorrhage. This system could therefore become a promising agent for thrombolytic treatment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									12	1	0	9	0	12			0928-4931			WOS:000266520400014

Core and periphery structures in protein interaction networks								BMC BIOINFORMATICS				10						S8	10.1186/1471-2105-10-S4-S8		4	APR 29 2009	2009	Background: Characterizing the structural properties of protein interaction networks will help illuminate the organizational and functional relationships among elements in biological systems.Results: In this paper, we present a systematic exploration of the core/periphery structures in protein interaction networks (PINs). First, the concepts of cores and peripheries in PINs are defined. Then, computational methods are proposed to identify two types of cores, k-plex cores and star cores, from PINs. Application of these methods to a yeast protein interaction network has identified 110 k-plex cores and 109 star cores. We find that the k-plex cores consist of either "party" proteins, "date" proteins, or both. We also reveal that there are two classes of 1-peripheral proteins: "party" peripheries, which are more likely to be part of protein complex, and "connector" peripheries, which are more likely connected to different proteins or protein complexes. Our results also show that, besides connectivity, other variations in structural properties are related to the variation in biological properties. Furthermore, the negative correlation between evolutionary rate and connectivity are shown toysis. Moreover, the core/periphery structures help to reveal the existence of multiple levels of protein expression dynamics.Conclusion: Our results show that both the structure and connectivity can be used to characterize topological properties in protein interaction networks, illuminating the functional organization of cellular systems.

These are similar to certain classical problems but involve a novel combination of l(p)-statistics and l(q) norms. We discuss a real world application in which the case p = 2 and q = 1 arises in a natural way. We show that, even for one dimension, such problems are NP-hard, which is surprising because the same 1-dimensional problems for the 'pure' l(2)-statistic and l(2) norm are known to satisfy a 'string property' and can be solved in polynomial time. We generalize the string property for the case p = q. The string property need not hold when q <= p - 1 and we show that instances may be constructed, for which the best solution satisfying the string property does arbitrarily poorly. We state some open problems and conjectures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0166-218X			WOS:000266151200018

BMC Genomics				10	169			1	12					21 April 2009	2009	Background: Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) in animals fall into two categories: those that synthesize or metabolize endogenous molecules and those that interact with exogenous chemicals from the diet or the environment. The latter form a critical component of detoxification systems. Results: Data mining and manual curation of the Daphnia pulex genome identified 75 functional CYP genes, and three CYP pseudogenes. These CYPs belong to 4 clans, 13 families, and 19 subfamilies. The CYP 2, 3, 4, and mitochondrial clans are the same four clans found in other sequenced protostome genomes. Comparison of the CYPs from D. pulex to the CYPs from insects, vertebrates and sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) show that the CYP2 clan, and to a lesser degree, the CYP4 clan has expanded in Daphnia pulex, whereas the CYP3 clan has expanded in insects. However, the expansion of the Daphnia CYP2 clan is not as great as the expansion observed in deuterostomes and the nematode C. elegans. Mapping of CYP tandem repeat regions demonstrated the unusual expansion of the CYP370 family of the CYP2 clan. The CYP370s are similar to the CYP15s and CYP303s that occur as solo genes in insects, but the CYP370s constitute [approximately]20% of all the CYP genes in Daphnia pulex. Lastly, our phylogenetic comparisons provide new insights into the potential origins of otherwise mysterious CYPs such as CYP46 and CYP19 (aromatase). Conclusion: Overall, the cladoceran, D. pulex has a wide range of CYPs with the same clans as insects and nematodes, but with distinct changes in the size and composition of each clan.									1	0	0	1	0	1						ZOOREC:ZOOR14512077650

Necking of tungsten anodes takes place in the vicinity of the electrolyte-air interface. This results in the creation of two separate wire parts with nanosharp tips. Using image analysis, we demonstrate that the products of electrochemical reactions on the wire surface form a film with distinguishable properties. Experimental estimates of the film density and interfacial tension show that the film is approximately 32 kg/m(3) denser than the surrounding electrolyte and that its interfacial tension is approximately sigma approximate to 0.2 mN/m. Using these estimates, we show that the film now is predominantly driven by capillary forces. We hypothesize that the wire necking is caused by a bidirectional film flow originated from Plateau-Rayleigh instability and inherent to cylindrical films and jets.									18	0	0	1	0	18			0743-7463			WOS:000265281700041	19256460

The interplay of all these factors may partially explain the high inter-subject variability of motion sickness susceptibility found in many studies as well as some of the contradictory findings between studies regarding the modulating influence of single factors. We investigated the role of endogenous cortisol levels, gender and repetitive experience for motion sickness susceptibility. Motion sickness was induced in 32 healthy, but motion-sickness susceptible volunteers (16:16 males:females), by means of a vection drum. Subjects were investigated between 8:00 am (high cortisol) and 11:00 am (low cortisol), and on five consecutive days. Tolerance to rotation (RT) of the drum, motion sickness symptom ratings (SR) and salivary cortisol levels were assessed. Baseline cortisol levels correlated positively with RT in women, but not in men. RT showed a gender-specific time course across days, with higher values in males than in females on day 1. and sensitization on day 3 only in men. SR and cortisol levels following rotation did not differ between males and females, or between testing days. Gender differences in motion sickness susceptibility appear to be linked to a different role of basal cortisol levels for motion sickness tolerance. Results clearly indicate the need to control for gender, day time and cortisol levels in studies of motion sickness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we report the effects of (In,Yb) double filling on the high temperature thermoelectric properties of CoSb3. The InxYbyCo4Sb12 (0 <(x,y)< 0.2) samples have been prepared via a melting-annealing-sintering procedure and characterized by means of x-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Hall coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivities, and Seebeck coefficient measurements. As compared to the In and Yb single-filling approach, the (In,Yb) double-filling approach can effectively reduce the lattice thermal conductivity without degrading the power factor. As a result, several compositions achieve ZT values around unity, while a maximum ZT value of 1.1 is obtained in In0.2Yb0.1Co4Sb12 at 700 K. The difference in the effects of In and Yb filling on the thermoelectric properties is discussed.									35	1	0	0	0	35			0021-8979			WOS:000268064700188

Though the membrane pores are much larger than the product protein, protein fouling of the membrane often leads to a decrease in permeate flux at constant feed pressure. Normal-flow microfiltration experiments were conducted using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) base membranes, PTFE membranes coated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and Teflon AF, and PVDF and polycarbonate membranes coated with PVA and polyvinyl pyrrolidone.Feed streams consisted of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and hemoglobin (Hb). Feed pH values of 4.7 and 7.2 and pressures of 14 and 69 kPa were used. BSA concentrations of 4.0 and 0.1 g L(-1) were tested. For Hb, concentrations of 2.0 and 0.1 g L(-1) were tested. Protein fouling of the membrane was investigated by determining the variation of permeate flux with filtrate volume and by analysis of ATR-FTIR spectra and FESEM images of virgin membranes and membranes after microfiltration. Quantization of bound protein mass was done by carrying out equilibrium adsorption measurements.Results indicate that fouling by Hb is greater than BSA. Fouling is more severe at higher protein concentration and feed pressure. Increasing membrane hydrophilicity by coating with PVA decreases the amount of fouling. Our results indicate that it is the interplay among membrane properties, protein properties and operating conditions that determine whether fouling occurs and to what extent. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ravichandran, Nadarajah; Muraleetharan, Kanthasamy K.								Dynamics of unsaturated soils using various finite element formulations								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS				33	5			611	631		10.1002/nag.737			APR 10 2009	2009	Unsaturated soils are three-phase porous media consisting of a solid skeleton, pore liquid, and pore gas. The coupled mathematical equations representing the dynamics of unsaturated soils can be derived based on the theory of mixtures. Solution of these fully coupled governing equations for unsaturated soils requires tremendous computational resources because three individual phases and interactions between them have to be taken into account. The fully coupled equations governing the dynamics Of unsaturated soils are first presented and then two finite element formulations of the governing equations are presented and implemented within a finite element framework. The finite element implementation of all the terms in the governing equations results in the complete formulation and is solved for the first time in this paper. A computationally efficient reduced formulation is obtained by neglecting the relative accelerations and velocities of liquid and gas in the governing equations to investigate the effects of fluid flow in the overall behavior. These two formulations are used to simulate the behavior of an unsaturated silty soil embankment subjected to base shaking and compared with the results from another commonly used partially reduced formulation that neglects the relative accelerations, but takes into account the relative velocities. The stress-strain response of the solid skeleton is modeled as both elastic and elastoplastic in all three analyses. In the elastic analyses no permanent deformations are predicted and the displacements of the partially reduced formulation are in between those of the reduced and complete formulations. The frequency of vibration of the complete formulation in the elastic analysis is closer to the predominant frequency of the base motion and smaller than the frequencies of vibration of the other two analyses. Proper consideration of damping due to fluid flows in the complete formulation is the likely reason for this difference. Permanent deformations are predicted by all three formulations for the elastoplastic analyses. The complete formulation, however, predicts reductions in pore fluid pressures following strong shaking resulting in somewhat smaller displacements than the reduced formulation. The results from complete and reduced formulations are otherwise comparable for elastoplastic analyses. For the elastoplastic analysis, the partially reduced formulation leads to stiffer response than the other two formulations. The likely reason for this stiffer response in the elastoplastic analysis is the interpolation scheme (linear displacement and linear pore fluid pressures) used in the finite element implementation of the partially reduced formulation.

We present in situ measurements of ion flow velocity and electric and magnetic fields combined with neutral wind observations derived from ground observations of in situ chemical tracers. Measured ion drifts in the 150-198 km and 92-105 km altitude ranges are consistent with (E) over right arrow X (B) over right arrow motion to within 16 m s(-1) rms and with neutral wind velocity to within 20 m s(-1), respectively. From these measurements we have calculated the ratio kappa of the ion cyclotron and ion collision frequencies, finding kappa = 1 at an altitude of 118 +/- 0.3 km. Using direct measurements of ion current, we calculate the Joule heating rate and Pedersen and Hall conductivity profiles for this moderately active event and find height-integrated values of 390 W km(-2) and 0.59 and 2.22 S, respectively. We also find that these values would have errors of up to tens of percent without coincident neutral wind measurements, and presumably more so during more active conditions. Ion flow vectors were measured at a rate of 125 s(-1); however, no significant fluctuations were observed at spatial/temporal scales below similar to 350 m and 0.5 s. Observational limits were 5.5 m and 0.016 s.									16	0	0	1	0	16			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000265104700001

For a class of Cayley graphs from abelian groups, a good upper bound for their star diameters is given in terms of the usual diameters and the orders of elements in the generating subsets. This bound is tight for several classes of graphs including hypercubes and directed n-dimensional tori. The technique used is the so-called disjoint ordering for a system of subsets, due to Gao, Novick and Qju [S. Gao, B. Novick, K. Qiu, From Hall's matching theorem to optimal routing on hypercubes, J.

Two planting dates were used in trials in 2009. Early- and mid-season pests and associated injury were consistently absent or at low numbers. Data analyses were limited to Helicoverpa sea (Boddie) injury and infestations in corn ears. Based on the number of kernels injured per ear, event MON810 significantly (P < 0.05) reduced injury compared with the non-Bt isoline in both trials in 2008 (average of 67% control), but reduced injury only in 2009 at the Florence location (64% control). Event TC1507 significantly reduced injury relative to its non-Bt isoline in trials in 2008 by an average of 51%. Based on one year of data at two locations in 2009, event MON89034 significantly reduced injury relative to the non-Bt isoline (average of 83% control), and was more effective than MON810 in the same trials. In 2009, the plots planted at the later date had significantly (P < 0.05) less injury on ears and kernels than the first planting date in Blackville; no differences were detected in Florence. Yield was not affected by Bt traits in any of the trials. The increased effectiveness of recent hybrids with the MON89034 event in controlling H. zea in corn ears may lead to increased planting of Bt corn in the southeastern United States, as prior events were not as effective in controlling this key pest.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1523-5475			WOS:000287007000003

Specifically, the monomers of 2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl 2-methylacrylate (CE) and 4-[5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)phenyl 2-methylacrylate (tBPOP) were copolymerized in various ratios, and the inherent hole drift mobilities were assessed through time-of-flight techniques. At a held strength of 345 kV/cm, the homopolymer PCE exhibited a hole mobility of 5.9 x 10(-7) cm(2)/V . s, which was approximately twice the value of the technologically important poly(9-vinylcarbazole), which exhibited a value of 2.8 x 10(-7) cm(2)/V . s. The range of hole mobilities in the copolymers 'Varied From 2.4 x 10(-8) cm(2)/V . s for copolymers containing 50 mol % of the carbazole-containing monomer residue to 3.0 x 10(-7) cm(2)/V . s for copolymers that incorporated 88 mol % of the residue. Density functional theory (B3LYP/6-21G*) and optical absorption derived highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of CE were -5.39 and -1.94 eV, respectively, while the corresponding oxadiazole monomer (tBPOP) had a HOMO energy of -5.99 eV and a LUMO energy of -2.23 eV. The mean luminous efficiency of coumarin 6 doped single-layer devices constructed from the poly(CE-co-tBPOP) copolymers indicated a relatively Hat efficiency of ca. 0.25 cd/A over a wide carbazole mote fraction content of 0.30-0.70.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244			WOS:000267536100019	20356014

There is also an intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interaction in the crystal structure. The C-N bond lengths for the central benzimidazole ring are shorter than the average single C-N bond, thus showing varying degrees of double-bond character and indicating partial electron delocalization within the C-N-C-N-C fragment.

The surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) of a saccharide-substituted methacrylate, 2-gluconamidoethyl methacrylate (GAMA), affords dense polymer brushes that resist protein adsorption and cell adhesion. We further tailored the nature of the surfaces by covalent attachment of an adhesion peptide to afford control over cell adhesion. Whereas unmodified poly(GAMA) brushes prevent cell adhesion, brushes with a tethered GFOGER-containing peptide sequence promote the deposition of confluent well-spread cells. The presentation of adhesion proteins on a robust bioresistive background in this fashion constitutes a versatile approach to the development of new biomaterials.									31	0	0	9	0	31			1525-7797			WOS:000265098800016	19271753

The predicted particle translation is in good agreement with existing experimental observations. The effects of pressure gradient, particle size, channel geometry, and a particle's initial location on the particle transport are investigated. The pressure gradient has no effect on the ratio of the translational velocity of particles through a converging-diverging channel to that in the upstream straight channel. Particles are generally accelerated in the converging region and then decelerated in the diverging region, with the maximum translational velocity at the throat. For particles with diameters close to the width of the channel throat, the usual acceleration process is divided into three stages: Acceleration, deceleration, and reacceleration instead of a monotonic acceleration. Moreover, the maximum translational velocity occurs at the end of the first acceleration stage rather than at the throat. Along the centerline of the microchannel, particles do not rotate, and the closer a particle is located near the channel wall, the higher is its rotational velocity. Analysis of the transport of two particles demonstrates the feasibility of using a converging-diverging microchannel for passive (biological and synthetic) particle separation and ordering.

Hydrogen adsorption had a stronger correlation with specific surface area than nitrogen content at the low temperature of -196 degrees C. At the higher temperature of 35 degrees C, optimal nitrogen doping enhanced hydrogen adsorption by electronic modification of carbon in agreement with previous theoretical predictions.

The areas used by migratory land birds during temporal breaks in migration (stopover periods) have received relatively little research and conservation attention. Methodologies for identifying stopover sites across large geographic areas have been, until recently, unavailable. Advances in weather-radar technology now allow for evaluation of bird migration patterns at large spatial scales. We analyzed radar data (WSR-88D) recorded during spring migration in 2000 and 2001 at 6 sites in the Great Lakes basin (U.S.A.). Our goal was to link areas of high migrant activity with the land-cover types and landscape contexts corresponding to those areas. To characterize the landscapes surrounding stopover locations, we integrated radar and land-cover data within a geographic information system. We compared landscape metrics within 5 km of areas that consistently hosted large numbers of migrants with landscapes surrounding randomly selected areas that were used by relatively few birds during migration. Concentration areas were characterized by 1.2 times more forest cover and 9.3 times more water cover than areas with little migrant activity. We detected a strong negative relationship between activity of migratory birds and agricultural land uses. Examination of individual migration events confirmed the importance of fragments of forested habitat in highly altered landscapes and highlighted large concentrations of birds departing from near-shore terrestrial areas in the Great Lakes basin. We conclude that conservation efforts can be more effectively targeted through intensive analysis of radar imagery.									32	1	0	28	0	34			0888-8892			WOS:000264272000028	18983598

The most commonly used thymidine analogues, tritiated thymidine and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) label cells during S-phase. Both methods have significant drawbacks: low sensitivity in the case of tritiated thymidine and a denaturation step during BrdU detection that destroys most cellular epitopes, requiring careful optimization. The antibody against BrdU is also large and tissue penetration can be difficult. EdU (5'-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) is closely chemically related to BrdU, with detection achieved by a copper catalyzed reaction requiring a small fluorescently conjugated azide. Cell cultures, flow cytometry and high throughput studies using EdU-labeled cells is exceptionally fast and does not require denaturation or antibodies. We have developed a tissue-labeling technique in chick embryos using EdU. Following EdU chemistry to detect proliferating cells, the tissue can undergo immunolabeling. We demonstrate fluorescent EdU chemistry followed by Tuj1 antibody staining resulting in multiplex fluorescent tissues. Developmental Dynamics 238:944-949, 2009.

This instrumentation will allow for studying the low-latitude thermosphere/ionosphere (TI) system in great detail. Investigations to be conducted using this instrumentation while in Cape Verde include studying equatorial irregularity processes, the effects of neutral winds and gravity waves on irregularity development, the midnight temperature maximum, and ion-neutral coupling in the nighttime TI system. Initial observations from the RENOIR instrumentation during pre-deployment testing at the Urbana Atmospheric Observatory are presented, as is the deployment scenario for the project in Cape Verde.

It is therefore critical to understand the response of forests to potential climate change in an effort to mitigate adverse impacts. The purpose of this study was to explore the regional effects of different drought severities on tree growth and mortality. Specifically, we investigated changes in growth and mortality rates across the southeastern United States under various drought and stand conditions using 1991-2005 Forest Health and Monitoring (FHM) plot data from Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia. Drought effects were examined for three species groups (pines, oaks, and mesophytic species) using the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) as an indicator of drought severity. Stand variables, including total basal area, total tree density, tree species richness, slope, and stand age, were used to account for drought effects under varying stand conditions. The pines and mesophytic species exhibited significant reductions in growth rate with increasing drought severity. However, no significant difference in growth rate was observed within the oak species group. Mean mortality rates within the no-drought class were significantly lower than those within the other three drought classes, among which no significant differences were found, for both pines and mesophytic species. Mean mortality rates were not significantly different among drought classes for oaks. Total basal area, total tree density, and stand age were negatively related to growth and positively related to mortality, which suggests that older and denser stands are more susceptible to drought damage. The effect of basal area on growth increased with drought severity for the oak and mesophytic species groups. Tree species richness was negatively related to mortality for the pine and mesophytic species groups, indicating that stands with more species suffer less mortality. Slope was positively related to mortality within the mesophytic species group, and its effect increased with drought severity, indicating a higher mortality on sites of greater slope during severe-drought conditions. Our findings indicate that pines and mesophytic species are sensitive to drought, while oaks are tolerant of drought. The observed differential growth and mortality rates among species groups may alter the species composition of southeastern U. S. forests if drought episodes become more frequent and/or intense due to climate change. The significant effects of stand conditions on drought responses observed in our study also suggest that forest management may be used as a tool to mitigate drought effects.									62	5	0	53	0	67			1051-0761			WOS:000264309500018	19425432

Early-season Soybean as a Trap Crop for Stink Bugs (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) in Arkansas' Changing System of Soybean Production								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				38	2			450	458					APR 2009	2009	Early-season soybean, Glycine max L. Merrill, was evaluated in Arkansas soybean fields as a trap crop for a complex of stink bug species that included Nezara viridula L., Acrosternum hilare (Say), and Euschistus servus (Say). Early-season soybean production systems (ESPSs) are composed of indeterminate soybean cultivars planted in April. In the first year of a 2-yr study, field-scale trap crops (approximate to 0.5-1.0 ha) of maturity group (MG) III and IV soybean were planted adjacent to production fields of MG V soybean. Stink bugs were attracted first to the ESPS trap crops and were twice treated with insecticide, yet damaging populations developed later in the MG V soybean adjacent to the trap crops. General sampling and observations of low stink bug densities in commercial fields of soybean and corn across the study area suggested that stink bugs were widely distributed across the agricultural landscape. These observations and the subsequent discovery of additional ESPS fields outside the study area suggested that developing populations in the adjacent MG V soybean probably did not originate from the trap crops. However the source of the populations colonizing MG V soybean could not be determined, and we concluded that the scale of future experiments should be increased to better control stink bugs dispersing from other ESPSs outside the study area. In the second year of the study, the experiment was expanded in size to a farm- or community-scale project where entire fields of ESPSs (8-32 ha) were used as trap crops. Insecticide was applied to the trap-crop fields and other fields of ESPSs within a 0.8-km radius of targeted response fields, yet again there was no apparent effect on subsequent populations of stink bugs in the MG V response fields. With the recent expansion of ESPSs in Arkansas, it may be difficult to use ESPSs as a trap crop to lower stink bug populations across large enough areas to suppress populations in late-season soybean. Also, multiple soybean cultivars are generally planted across a 2- or 3-mo period in Arkansas, which results in staggered soybean development across the landscape and extends the time period that soybean is attractive to colonizing stink bugs. Trap crops of ESPSs are only attractive for oviposition for up to 4-5 A and cannot protect full-season soybean production systems (FSSPSs) for such an extended time period. This shift in production systems may limit the use of ESPS trap crops for management of stink bugs unless highly coordinated efforts are made to synchronize soybean maturity and control stink bugs in ESPSs across large geographic areas.									5	0	0	6	0	6			0046-225X			WOS:000264863300019	19389295

Microbial Transformation of Dissolved Leaf Litter Organic Matter and Its Effects on Selected Organic Matter Operational Descriptors								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				43	7			2315	2321		10.1021/es802773b			APR 1 2009	2009	Changes in selected spectroscopic and chromatographic characteristics of water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) extracted from leaf litter and its ability to bind pyrene were monitored throughout 14 day microbial incubation experiments. To provide additional insight into the microbial transformation of the WSOM, incubation experiments were similarly conducted with controlled-composition mixtures of glucose and dissolved humic substances (HS) that were base extracted from the same leaf litter source. Microbial transformation increased the specific ultraviolet absorbance and number-average molecular weight of residual WSOM while polydispersity values decreased. Fluorescence measurements revealed loss of protein-like fluorescence and enhancement of fulvic- and humic-like fluorescence in residual WSOM. Overall, the incubation results suggest that nonaromatic and smaller sized carbon structures were being degraded while the microbial activity produced humic-like aromatic components in solution. Together, these changes resulted in enhanced pyrene binding by the altered WSOM. Consistent findings resulted from mixtures of glucose and the leaf litter HS. Changes in measured operational descriptors were more pronounced for mixtures containing a higher percentage of glucose, suggesting that utilization of labile constituents may be necessary for formation of unknown structures associated with high pyrene binding capabilities. Simple mass balance, end member mixing models often failed to predict changes in pyrene binding brought about by microbial transformation, suggesting that microbial utilization of labile constituents is not the predominant process governing the enhanced pyrene binding.									47	2	0	43	0	49			0013-936X			WOS:000264759600030	19452880

A cathepsin L-like protease from Strongylus vulgaris: An orthologue of Caenorhabditis elegans CPL-1								EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY				121	4			293	299		10.1016/j.exppara.2008.11.002			APR 2009	2009	Cathespin L-like proteases (CPLs), characterized from a wide range of helminths, are significant in helminth biology. For example, in Caenorhabditis elegans CPL is essential for embryogenesis. Here, we report a cathepsin L-like gene from three species of strongyles that parasitize the horse, and describe the isolation of a cpl gene (Sv-cpl-1) from Strongylus vulgaris, the first such from equine strongyles. It encodes a protein of 354 amino acids with high similarity to other parasitic Strongylida (90-91%), and C. elegans CPL-1 (87%), a member of the same Clade. As S. vulgaris cpl-1 rescued the embryonic lethal phenotype of the C elegans cpl-1 mutant, these genes may be orthologues, sharing the same function in each species. Targeting Sv-CPL-1 might enable novel control strategies by decreasing parasite development and transmission. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

J	Leatherwood, W. Roland; Dole, John M.; Faust, James E.								Ethephon Residual Catalysis on Unrooted Impatiens hawkeri Cuttings and Stock Plants								HORTSCIENCE				44	2			532	535					APR 2009	2009	Ethephon [(2-chloroethyl) phosphonic acid] is used to increase stock plant cutting productivity through increased flower and flower bud abscission and branching. However, ethylene evolution resulting from ethephon application is suspected to cause leaf abscission of unrooted cuttings during shipping. It was the objective of this study to assess ethylene evolution from ethephon-treated cuttings during storage and shipping of unrooted cuttings. Impatiens hawkeri W. Bull 'Sonic Red' and 'Sonic White' stock plants were treated with 0, 250, 500, or 1000 mg.L(-1) ethephon. Cuttings were harvested from I to 21 days later and each harvest was stored at 20 degrees C in sealed jars for 24 h before ethylene measurement. Higher ethephon doses resulted in greater ethylene generation. Cuttings harvested 1 day after treatment with 0, 250, 500, or 1000 mg-L(-1) ethephon evolved 0.07, 1.3, 1.7, or 5.8 mu L.L(-1).g(-1) (fresh weight) ethylene in the first 24 h of storage at 20 degrees C, respectively. Twenty-one days after treatment, cuttings from the same plants evolved 0.05, 0.05, 0.15, or 0.14 mu L.L(-1).g(-1) (fresh weight) ethylene in the first 24 h of storage at 20 T, respectively. As cuttings were harvested from Day I to Day 21, ethylene concentrations evolved within the first 24 h of storage decreased exponentially. Rinsing cuttings, treated 24 h earlier with 500 mg.L(-1) ethephon, by gently agitating for 10 s in deionized water reduced ethylene evolution to 0.7 mu L.L(-1).g(-1) (fresh weight) as compared with 1.7 for unrinsed cuttings. Cuttings harvested 24 h after treatment with 500 mg.L(-1) ethephon stored at 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees C for 24 h evolved 0.37, 0.81, 2.03, and 3.55 mu L.L(-1).g(-1) (fresh weight) ethylene. The resulting mean temperature coefficient (Q(10),) for the 10 to 25 degrees C range from all replications was 5.15 +/- 0.85. Thus, ethylene continues to evolve from ethephon-treated Impatiens hawkeri stock plants for up to 21 days and can accumulate to high concentrations during cutting storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-5345			WOS:000265133600066		
J	Shaibu, A. B.; Cho, Byung Rae								Another view of dual response surface modeling and optimization in robust parameter design								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY				41	7-8			631	641		10.1007/s00170-008-1509-2			APR 2009	2009	Robust parameter design (RPD) based on the concept of building quality into a design has received much attention from researchers and practitioners for years, and a number of methodologies have been studied in the research community. There have been many attempts to integrate RPD principles with well-established statistical techniques, such as response surface methodology, in order to model the response directly as a function of control factors. In this paper, we reinvestigate the dual response approach based on quadratic models Vinning and Myers (J Qual Technol 22:38-45), which is often referred to in the RPD literature and demonstrate that higher-order polynomial models may be more effective in finding better RPD solutions than the commonly-used quadratic model. We also propose optimization models for each of the three classes of quality characteristics (i.e., nominal-the-best, larger-the-better, and smaller-the-better). The optimal solutions obtained using the proposed models are compared with the solutions obtained using the RPD techniques in the current literature.									25	0	0	0	0	25			0268-3768			WOS:000264136500001

Combination therapy using three novel prolactin receptor antagonist-based fusion proteins effectively inhibits tumor recurrence and metastasis in HER2/neu transgenic mice								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY				34	4			1139	1146		10.3892/ijo_00000242			APR 2009	2009	Previously, prolactin receptor antagonist (G129R)based fusion proteins were developed including G129R fusions with an angiogenesis inhibitor (endostatin), an immune system modulator (interleukin 2), and a modified truncated cytotoxin (PE38KDEL). Each fusion protein was designed to target the PRLR-positive cells via the G129R moiety and at the same time attack a hallmark common to cancer cells via the second moiety. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the three fusion proteins as a combination therapy in an aggressive but clinically relevant mouse tumor model. To test the feasibility and to optimize a treatment regimen, allografts of a mammary carcinoma cell line (McNeuA) derived from an MMTV-neu transgenic mouse were first used. Growth of the allografts was significantly retarded by regimens which combined all three fusion proteins. In addition, a significant increase in cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells was observed within the tumors of the combination treated groups. After establishing the dosing regimen, two doses of cocktail treatment (low and high doses administered twice weekly) along with individual component controls were administered to female MMTV-neu transgenic mice after surgical removal of a naturally occurring tumor. The average tumor recurrence time was significantly delayed in both low and high combination treatment groups in comparison to the no treatment control group (34, 50 and 18 days, respectively). The total number of lung metastases was also significantly decreased in both combination treatment groups. In conclusion, using G129R-based fusion proteins to target mammary carcinomas and to tackle multiple hallmarks of cancer at the same time was an effective strategy for treating HER2-postive mammary cancer in this mouse tumor model.									3	1	0	3	0	4			1019-6439	1791-2423		WOS:000264661100029	19287973	
J	Saeidpourazar, Reza; Jalili, Nader								Towards Microcantilever-based Force Sensing and Manipulation: Modeling, Control Development and Implementation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH				28	4			464	483		10.1177/0278364908097584			APR 2009	2009	This paper presents a distributed-parameters-based modeling framework for piezoresistive microcantilever (MC)-based force sensors used in a variety of cantilever-based nanomanipulation processes. Current modeling practices call for a simple lumped-parameters approach rather than modeling the piezoresistive MC itself. Owing to the widespread applications of such MCs in nanoscale force sensing or non-contact atomic force microscopy with nano-Newton to pico-Newton force measurement requirements, precise modeling of the piezoresistive MCs is essential. Instead of the previously used lumped-parameters modeling, a distributed-parameters modeling framework is proposed and developed here to arrive at the most complete model of the piezoresistive MC including tip-mass, tip-force and base movement considerations. In order to have online control and real-time sensor feedback, a closed-form model of the piezoresistive MC, which expresses the MC's piezoresistive output voltage as a function of tip force and base motion, is highly desirable. Along this line of reasoning, a closed-form model for the piezoresistive MC is presented. Following mathematical modeling, both numerical simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed distributed-parameters model when compared with the previously reported lumped-parameters modeling approach. Utilizing the developed model, a modified robust controller with perturbation estimation is adopted to target the problem of slow imaging acquisition and manipulation at the nanoscale. It is shown that the proposed controller can stabilize such nanomanipulation process in less than a second. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the stability and performance characteristics of the designed controller. Such modeling and control development could pave the way for MC-based nanomanipulation and nanopositioning.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0278-3649			WOS:000264254700005

In the initial laboratory screening experiment, 25 of the 67 extracts provided protection following UVA/UVB irradiation for 30 min. Fifteen of these 25 extracts provided good UV protection when they were subjected to a more severe UV treatment of UVB/UVB irradiation for 30 min. Four of these 15 extracts (kudzu, peppermint, skullcap, and thyme) provided excellent UV protection for SeMNPVwhen they were irradiated with an even more stringent UV regime of UVB/UVB for 300 min. These findings indicate that these plant extracts may be useful UV protectants for the SeNPV and they should be investigated further to obtain more efficacious formulations for the control of agriculturally important insect pests.									4	0	0	5	0	5			1523-5475			WOS:000287007000001

While not known to be a serious pest of agricultural crops or ornamental plants in its recorded distribution (Mexico, Florida, Georgia, and the West Indies), M. deklei has become a pest of wax myrtle, Myrica cerifera (L.) Small (Myricaceae), grown as ornamental plants in the urban landscape of coastal South Carolina. Infestations have been identified in Horry, Georgetown, and Beaufort Counties, SC. A study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam), insect growth regulators (buprofezin and pyriproxyfen), paraffinic oil, and acephate against this armored scale species in 2008 and 2009. None of the tested insecticides achieved significant reduction of scale insect density when compared to the untreated control. There was, however, a trend for plants treated with two applications of pyriproxyfen and paraffinic oil to harbor fewer scale insects. Improvements in the timing and combination of insecticides and alternative management strategies that integrate various chemical, biological, and cultural tools should be developed for the management of M. deklei.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1523-5475			WOS:000287007000002

Second instar pickleworm larvae also fed preferentially on cucumber fruits that were treated with a 1% (0.01x) solution of Invite EC compared with untreated fruit. However, 1% Invite did not stimulate feeding on artificial diet, squash leaves, or squash fruits. Concentrations of Invite as low as 0.001% were effective in increasing the efficacy of the velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, multiply-embedded nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgMNPV) against second instar pickleworms. A 1% Invite solution also increased the efficacy of the celery looper, Anagrapha falcifera (Kirby), multiply-embedded NPV (AnfaMNPV) against second instar pickleworms.									1	0	0	2	0	2			1523-5475			WOS:000287007000005		
J	Zhang, Hanqiao; Song, Chunrong; Wang, Pingshan								A new method for high-frequency characterization of patterned ferromagnetic thin films								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				105	7					07E716	10.1063/1.3076151			APR 1 2009	2009	A new high-frequency method is presented for patterned ferromagnetic thin film characterization. Parasitic effects, which often overwhelm the signal from patterned ferromagnetic structures, are significantly reduced through an on-chip interference process. As a result, measurement sensitivity is greatly improved in comparison with conventional on-chip transmission line ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) methods. Algorithms are given to extract the complex permeability and FMR linewidth of ferromagnetic materials from scattering parameters obtained with the method. An on-chip 10 GHz structure was fabricated and experimentally demonstrated similar to 20 dB parasitic effect cancellation efficiency. A patterned Permalloy (Py) array with 180 stripes is measured. Each stripe is 100 nm thick, 2 mu m wide, and 20 mu m long. The FMR frequency of the patterned Py thin films was tuned with an external static magnetic field. With a 676 G bias field, the obtained FMR frequency and linewidth are 9.68 and 1.4 GHz, respectively. These results are comparable with micromagnetic simulation results.

However, this technique's recent development creates considerable need for exploration of appropriate mechanical models for analysis of the resultant data and of the roles of various cytoskeletal components responsible for governing stress-relaxation behavior. The viscoelastic properties of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are of particular interest due to their role in the development of vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and restenosis. Various cytoskeletal agents, including cytochalasin D, jasplakinolide, paclitaxel, and nocodazole, were used to alter the cytoskeletal architecture of the VSMCs. Stress-relaxation experiments were performed on the VSMCs using AFM. The quasilinear viscoelastic (QLV) reduced-relaxation function, as well as a simple power-law model, and the standard linear solid (SLS) model, were fitted to the resultant stress-relaxation data. Actin depolymerization via cytochalasin D resulted in significant increases in both rate of relaxation and percentage of relaxation; actin stabilization via jasplakinolide did not affect stress-relaxation behavior. Microtubule depolymerization via nocodazole resulted in nonsignificant increases in rate and percentage of relaxation, while microtubule stabilization via paclitaxel caused significant decreases in both rate and percentage of relaxation. Both the QLV reduced-relaxation function and the power-law model provided excellent fits to the data (R-2=0.98), while the SLS model was less adequate (R-2=0.91). Data from the current study indicate the important role of not only actin, but also microtubules, in governing VSMC viscoelastic behavior. Excellent fits to the data show potential for future use of both the QLV reduced-relaxation function and power-law models in conjunction with AFM stress-relaxation experiments.									7	1	0	4	0	8			0148-0731	1528-8951		WOS:000264025800001	19275430

The structure was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction methods. This compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal system, Pmmn (No. 59), with a = 11.558(2) angstrom, b = 15.164(3) angstrom, c = 10.023(2) angstrom, Z = 4 and V = 1756.7(6) angstrom(3).

This new structure can be described as a composite lattice made up of mixed covalent and ionic moities. The extended framework is orchestrated by stacked [Ba(V2O7)Cl](3-) slabs that are interconnected by Ba2+ cations through Ba-O bonds to the [V2O7] units. The Ba2+ and Cl- ions form BN-type "[BaCl]'' sheets with pseudo-hexagonal windows that are centered by [V2O7](4-) pyrovanadate units.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1074-1542			WOS:000263524500013

The purpose of this study was to identify the national prevalence of witnessed parental and community violence and to examine these life stressors as independent risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive episode (MDE) among adolescents. A secondary aim was to determine which characteristics of witnessed violence were associated with mental health outcomes.Participants were 3,614 adolescents recruited from a 2005 US national household probability sample who completed structured telephone interviews assessing witnessed violence and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria for PTSD and MDE.National prevalence of witnessed parental violence and witnessed community violence was estimated to be 9% and 38%, respectively. Both forms of witnessed violence predicted PTSD and MDE beyond variance accounted for by age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and other traumatic event history.

Clustering methods have been frequently used to partition a domain of interest into distinct climatic zones. However, previous techniques have neglected the time series (autocorrelation) component and have also handled seasonal features in a suboptimal way. The distance proposed here incorporates the seasonal mean and autocorrelation structures of the series in a natural way; moreover, trends and covariate effects can be considered. As an important by-product, the methods can be used to statistically assess whether two stations can serve as reference stations for one another. The methods are illustrated by partitioning 292 weather stations within the state of Colorado into six different zones.									15	2	0	5	1	17			0894-8755			WOS:000265524900012

Intrinsic and Doped Zinc Oxide Nanowires for Transparent Electrode Fabrication via Low-Temperature Solution Synthesis								JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS				38	4			586	595		10.1007/s11664-008-0618-x			APR 2009	2009	Undoped and doped zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires were synthesized by decomposing metal salts in trioctylamine at 300A degrees C. By adding metal salts during the formation of the wires, effective incorporation of Ga and Al up to 5% was achieved, as measured by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy. No secondary phase was detected by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. The nanowires were single-crystalline with a wurtzite lattice structure. Films made with doped wires show a complex dependence of the sheet resistance on processing conditions and dopant concentration. Thermal annealing treatment reduced the sheet resistance to values of 10(3) Omega/square.					50th Electronic Materials Conference50th Electronic Materials Conference	JUN, 2008JUN, 2008		Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CAUniv Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA	22	0	0	1	0	22			0361-5235			WOS:000263897000019

Control of 3003-H18 Aluminum Ultrasonic Consolidation								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				131	2					021006	10.1115/1.3078303			APR 2009	2009	Ultrasonic consolidation of 150 mu m thick 3003-H18 aluminum foil to a 3003-H18 build plate has been investigated. The effects of the normal load, vibrational amplitude, and sonotrode velocity on consolidation quality as characterized by the total linear weld density (LWD) including both edge and edge defects were examined utilizing two sequential three-level full factorial design of experiments at a constant build plate temperature of 150 degrees C. These showed that the normal load and the vibrational amplitude have a significant influence on LWD, while the sonotrode rotational velocity has only a marginal effect. The formation of edge defects at the foil-build plate interface has been attributed to the nonuniform strain state across the foil width, while the central defects were related to sonotrode-foil contact pressure variations following the sonotrode pattern. In addition, LWD variations in +/- 10-20% were attributed to a nonuniform sonotrode-foil contact pressure distribution. Finally, representation of the total LWD as a function of the control parameters indicates that high total linear weld densities can be achieved with a control space bounded by high normal loads and intermediate to high vibrational amplitudes. Consideration of only central defects expands this control space allowing utilization of lower normal loads and vibrational amplitudes to achieve similar linear weld densities.

Improving Labor-Based Road Rehabilitation in Ghana								JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING				25	2			87	96		10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2009)25:2(87)			APR 2009	2009	In an attempt to create more employment and reduce poverty, a labor-based road rehabilitation program was introduced in Ghana in 1986 with the assistance of international organizations. Although this program has the potential to create more employment than equipment-intensive methods, it is considered less attractive than equipment-intensive methods. It is considered to be too slow, encumbered with labor organization and management problems, and reliant upon casual (nonpermanent) workers. This paper describes the family-based labor management (FBLM) concept intended to make the labor-based road program more attractive to contractors and laborers, and thereby help address the unemployment and poverty problems. It is anticipated that if at least 10% of the $174 million currently used to import construction and earthmoving equipment annually is invested in labor-based road rehabilitation program, about 23,000 jobs could be created. If 50% of the equipment expenses are invested in the program, almost 117,000 jobs could be created annually. The proposed FBLM concept is flexible enough to serve as a model to other African countries encountering similar problems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0742-597X			WOS:000264154800006

Two simulator input profiles were evaluated, including standard walking (Group W), and combined walking and stair descent (Group W + S), simulating varied activities and a more severe physiological environment. Damage regions on all inserts were quantitatively assessed. On average, inserts in all groups had internally rotated damage patterns and the greatest articular deformation in the lateral compartment. These patterns were more pronounced in Group W + S compared to Group W. Deformation rates of simulated inserts were analogous to about six years of physiologic function. However, both groups of simulated inserts generally underestimated the magnitude of damage area and extent observed on retrieved inserts, consistent with differences in the simulator's tibiofemoral contact mechanics and those known to occur in patients during functional activities. Modification of simulator inputs, such as the increased anteroposterior excursion and more severe loading conditions in Group W + S, can generate greater wear volume, larger damage areas, and increased surface deformation rates compared to standard inputs.

TAILORED ADDITIVE RELEASE RATES IN EXTRUDED PLASTIC FILMS PRODUCED WITH SMART BLENDING MACHINES								JOURNAL OF PLASTIC FILM & SHEETING				25	2			115	140		10.1177/8756087909351376			APR 2009	2009	Smart blenders controllably form multi-component polymer melts into a wide variety of fine-scale structural arrangements that can be retained in extruded plastics. The machines operate on the principle of chaotic advection, a recent subfield of fluid mechanics, and have been used to produce cast film and blown film but can also be used to extrude sheet, rod, tubing, and other products. Because and structure of a composite material influences greatly additive diffusion, and matrix dissolution, this processing method provides a means for producing packaging film, medications, and medical implants with tailored release rates of active compounds. In this article, an ability to alter release rates of tocopherol, a natural antioxidant of importance to food packaging, is specifically investigated via on-line specification of a process parameter governing blend morphology in extruded cast films. Blends of low-density polyethylene and polypropylene, and also low-density polyethylene and high-density polyethylene were used.									4	0	0	1	0	4			8756-0879			WOS:000272839200003

A novel ligand was designed that is composed of a GHR antagonist (132036) and a PRLR antagonist (G129R) fused in tandem (B2036-G129R). Because both B2036 and G129R are binding site 2 inactive antagonists, the B2036-G129R fusion protein, in theory contains only two functional binding site Is: one for GHR and one for PRLR. We examined the behavior of this chimeric ligand in cell lines known to express GHR, PRLR, or both receptors. The data presented show that B2036-G129R is inactive in IM-9 cells that express only GHR or Nb2 cells that express PRLR. In T-47D cells that coexpress PRLR and GHR, B2036-G129R activates JAK2/STAT5 signaling. These findings provide evidence that B2036-G129R is able to activate signal transduction through a heterodimer of PRLR and GHR in humans.									6	0	0	5	0	6			1079-9893			WOS:000266588400005	19519175

Our results partly Support an innovation explanation in that integration proceeded more rapidly in larger population centers. In contrast, we find only mixed and weak evidence that winning organizations proceeded first in hiring Black managers as in the case of using Black players. This difference in the hiring process of management versus labor may reflect a difference in the relative importance of endowment versus training. Our evidence also indicates that individual owner preferences matter along with changes in social pressures over time. As with player integration, it appears that a full generation is needed for the process to work itself out.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1527-0025			WOS:000264079100001

Importance of Scion Cultivar in Peach Tree Short Life								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN POMOLOGICAL SOCIETY				63	2			58	63					APR 2009	2009	In the Southeastern United States Peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] trees planted on sites previously planted with peaches often suffer front Peach Tree Short Life (PTSL) syndrome, in which ring nematode [Mesocriconema xenoplax (Raski) Loof & de Grisse], cold injury, and bacterial canker (Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae van Hall) combine to kill the scion in the spring. Rootstock plays an important role; where PTSL is present, trees on Guardian (R) 'BY520-9' rootstock survive better than those on Lovell and Much better than those on Nemaguard. Little is known about the role of scion cultivar in susceptibility to PTSL, Previous Studies looking at the role of cultivar showed ambiguous results. This study, done in both South Carolina and Georgia. suggests that environmental variability associated with the plantings makes it difficult to reliably separate most commercial cultivars into susceptibility classes. cultivar Susceptibility in the previous experiments were not well correlated with the results of this test, nor with each other, More replications are needed for reliable screening of commercial Scion cultivars.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1527-3741			WOS:000265615700004

We identified three aspects of performance (a) alliance innovation, (b) the strategic contributions to the U.S. sponsor and (c) the strategic contributions to the Japanese sponsor. We found that (a) knowledge/information based (contextual dimensions) leadership by the alliance head was associated with higher innovation and strategic contributions to the sponsors and (b) transformational leadership by sponsoring executives was dysfunctional for alliance innovation but contributed positively to the strategic contribution the alliance provided a sponsor and, (c) the linkage between leadership by the alliance head and performance was much more important for some types of alliance governance (administrative) structures than others. That is, we argue that appropriate leadership is embedded in its context. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									39	0	0	0	1	40			1048-9843			WOS:000264536300012

We show that IR femtosecond laser irradiation in this system results in near-surface photoexpansion, which based on micro-Raman spectroscopy, has been related to an increased connection of GeS4 units to form corner sharing GeS4/2 units with a concurrent formation of S-S bridges. The lower surface photo-expansion of the Ga- containing Sulfide and sulfo-selenide glasses compared to that of the Ga-free sulfide and sulfo-selenide glasses has been related to the presence of GaS4 and Se-Se isolated units in the germanate glass network which are expected to restrict the connection between GeS4 units during laser exposure. Such mechanistic understanding of material modification opens the pathway towards the laser writing of active photonic devices in the near-surface of these glasses.

Nanograined highly transparent yttria ceramics								OPTICS LETTERS				34	7			1033	1035					APR 1 2009	2009	The field of transparent ceramics is enjoying a renaissance, as refractory oxides are being developed as alternatives to single crystals in high-performance laser systems. However, a significant challenge remains regarding the reduction of the grain size to sufficiently subwavelength dimensions in order to achieve the same degree of optical transparency as the single-crystal analog. Here we report transparent yttria (Y(2)O(3)) ceramics that were synthesized by a pressure-assisted, two-step, low-temperature sintering process with an average grain size of 300 nm. These nanograined ceramics exhibit equivalent transmission to single crystalline yttria for wavelengths greater than about 1200 nm. The single-crystal-like transmittance of the nanograined yttria ceramics in the visible and IR region is an important advancement for the use of these materials in more-extreme environments, including high-energy laser systems where reduction of scattering is paramount.

Two main types of trade in live turtles occur in China: for food and traditional Chinese medicine, and for pets, including those for release by Buddhists. The food trade involves the largest quantities of turtles. In recent years, however, the international pet turtle trade has increased dramatically. Yuehe Pet Market in Guangzhou is the largest pet market in China. selling live chelonians and other animals. To understand the potential impacts of the pet trade on chelonians we conducted seven surveys in Yuehe Pet Market from August 2006 to March 2008. Over 39,000 individual chelonians of 61 species were recorded (19.1% of the global total of 319 species). Fifteen (24.6%) of these species are native to China and 46 (75.4%) are native to other countries. Two are designated as grade II key state-protected species in China. Thirty-eight (62.3%) are CITES listed species (four in CITES Appendix 1, 26 in CITES II and eight in CITES III). Four are categorized on the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered, 16 as Endangered and 19 as Vulnerable. Our surveys indicate that increasing demand and the illegal international pet trade could behaving a severe impact on chelonian conservation, and we make recommendations for law enforcement and conservation.									23	2	0	26	1	28			0030-6053	1365-3008		WOS:000266432600017

Energy- and angle-resolved spectra of the scattered flux show multiple peaks distinctly separated in energy corresponding to specific ion trajectories at the surface. Using a calculated interaction potential combined with the classical scattering simulation SAFARI we are able to model these trajectories and detail their energy-loss characteristics. At energies below approximately 24 eV we find that the ions scatter with a larger energy than one would expect from quasibinary collisions. Our trajectory analysis reveals this is a transition from the quasibinary behavior to a collective surface response more commonly associated with thermal energy atom scattering.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1098-0121			WOS:000265944200135

Our fieldwork in the Southwestern United States has demonstrated an association of three species of the cicadelline tribe Proconiini with pinyon pines (Pinus, subsection Cembroides). Cuerna curvata Oman and Beamer and C obtusa Oman and Beamer are associated, respectively, with Pinus monophylla Torr. and Frem. and P. edulis Engelm. We also have confirmed an early report of Oncometopia alpha Fowler feeding on pines, especially P. edulis. Geographic distributions of these sharpshooters correspond to the distributions of their pine hosts. These data add to the few previously known cases of host-plant specialization in sharpshooters and for the first time document an association between sharpshooters and gymnosperms. The association is particularly remarkable because Our data Suggest that all three species use different angiosperrn hosts for oviposition. A dual use of angiosperms and gymnosperms (excluding use of the latter as overwintering sites) appears unique for Cicadellidae. We argue that pinyons provide a reliable source of xylem sap in the semiarid habitats of these sharpshooters but are unsuitable for oviposition.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-8797			WOS:000266227900022

The model is an extension of the original high strain-rate compaction model for sand developed by Laine and Sandvik and an elastic-visco-plastic material model for sand recently proposed by Tong and Tuan in which these effects were neglected. The new material model was parameterized using the available experimental data for sand with different levels of saturation tested mechanically at different strain rates. The model is next used, within a non-linear-dynamics transient computational analysis, to study: (a) various phenomena associated with the explosion of shallow-buried and ground-laid mines and (b) the dynamic behaviour of a vehicle during an off-road ride. The computational results are then compared with the corresponding experimental results.

The investigated variations include the resin and the hardener mixing quality and ratio, the storage conditions prior to final curing, and the curing profile for Electro-Coat ovens. A Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) provides information about the volatile evaporation percentiles in the final curing chamber, while a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) is used to analyze the adhesive chemical groups mainly the hydroxyl and the epoxy groups. Additionally, this work validates the use of a Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) procedure to determine such variations' impact on the glass transition T(g) temperature, also on the thermo-set cure rate for different holding times. Results show that the 2K adhesive volatile content is sensitive to the curing profile (ramp-up rates) and to the holding-time variations; however the adhesive composition is insensitive to the holding-conditions. mainly the relative humidity.

The crystal and molecular structure of the title compound has been determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction data. It crystallizes in the tri-clinic space group, P-1,Z=2 with a = 10.284(2) angstrom, c = 11.305 (2)angstrom, alpha=64.92(3), beta = 89.88(3), gamma = 62.99(3) V= 983.7(3) angstrom(3) and D(calc) = 1.339 Mg/m(3). The molecular structure, vibrational frequencies and infrared intensities of PANT were calculated by the Hartree-Fock and density functional theory methods (BLYP and BRYP) using the 6-31G* basis set. The calculated geometric parameters were compared to the corresponding X-ray structure of the title compound. We obtained 22 stable conformers for the title compound: however Conformer I is approximately 9.53 kcal/mol more stable than Conformer 22. The comparison of the theoretical and experimental geometry of the title compound shows that the X-ray parameters fairly well reproduce the geometry of Conformer 17. The harmonic vibrations computed for this compound by the B3LYP/6-31G* method are in good agreement with the observed IR spectral data. Theoretical vibrational spectra of the title compound were interpreted by means of PEDS using the VEDA 4 program. A general better performance of the investigated methods was calculated by PAVF 1.0 program. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Improving the Wettability of Deep-Groove Polypropylene Fibers by Photografting								TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL				79	6			534	547		10.1177/0040517508092017			APR 2009	2009	This paper presented photografting as a surface modification method to provide permanent wettability improvement to deep-groove polypropylene (PP) fibers. We also evaluated their wettability by testing the dynamic contact angle (DCA) on single fibers and characterized the wicking performance of fiber bundles when polyacrylamide (PAAm) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) were grafted onto the fibers. In this study, the increase in monomer concentration was found more effective than longer UV exposure time in creating higher graft density on deep-groove PP fibers. Acrylic acid (AA) monomers penetrated into the fiber and polymerized inside, but acrylamide (AAm) did not. Fiber dimension changed slightly upon grafting of PAAm, and enlarged significantly after grafting with PAA. DCA results show that the advancing water contact angle on single fibers decreased from 1.00 to 55 degrees by grafting of PAAm and PAA, and spontaneous wicking of water was observed after surface modification. The wicking amount of the vertically placed fiber bundles showed a linear relationship to the square root of time at early wicking times.									3	2	0	0	0	5			0040-5175			WOS:000264570700006

We investigated the time course of changes in function and mechanical properties of diabetic and diuretic rat bladders using both in vivo and in vitro techniques.METHODS Cystometry was performed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks on female Sprague-Dawley rats that had received either a single injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or 5% Sucrose in drinking water for the duration of the experiments. At each point, the biaxial mechanical properties of 10 x 10-mm tissue specimens obtained from the posterior part of bladder wall were quantified. The changes in overall tissue compliance and mechanical anisotropy as a function of time were examined.RESULTS Both diabetic and diuretic conditions led to increases in bladder weight, bladder capacity, and in vivo compliance compared with the controls at all points tested. Under biaxial loading, all bladder wall tissues exhibited a nonlinear stress-strain relationship and mechanical anisotropy, with greater tissue compliance in the circumferential direction than in the longitudinal direction. Although the compliance Of the bladder wall increased progressively and synchronously in both diabetic and diuretic bladders for :54 weeks, only the diabetic bladders continued to increase the compliance for <= 8 weeks (diabetic 0.64 +/- 0.04 vs diuretic 0.48 +/- 0.05, P = .03).CONCLUSIONS The results Of Our study have shown that diuresis mainly contributes to the "early" changes of mechanical properties of the bladder, with diabetes inducing additional "late" changes of mechanical properties of the rat bladders after 4 weeks.

J	O'Keefe, Joy M.; Loeb, Susan C.; Lanham, J. Drew; Hill, Hoke S., Jr.								Macrohabitat factors affect day roost selection by eastern red bats and eastern pipistrelles in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				257	8			1757	1763		10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.037			MAR 31 2009	2009	Although roost sites are critically important to bats, we have few data on macrohabitat factors that affect roost selection by foliage-roosting bats. Such data are needed so that forest managers can make informed decisions regarding conservation of bat roosts. Our objective was to examine roost selection by nonreproductive eastern pipistrelles (Penimyotis subflavus) and red bats (Lasiurus borealis) in a dense deciduous forest undergoing low-intensity timber management in the southern Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, USA. During May to August 2004-2006, we radiotracked eight red bats and seven pipistrelles to roosts for 1-14 days (red bats, (x) over bar = 4.11 days, n = 19 roosts; pipistrelles, (x) over bar = 7 days, n = 15 roosts). We compared roost and random trees or points using paired-sample t-tests for tree and microhabitat characters and logistic regression models of one to three variables for macrohabitat characters. Neither red bats nor pipistrelles selected roosts based on tree or microhabitat characteristics. Red bats used a wide range of stand ages and conditions and, based on our most plausible models for macrohabitat variables, roosted closer than expected ((x) over bar = 70.6 m) to linear openings such as gated roads. Pipistrelles only used stands >= 72 years in age and roosted closer than expected ((x) over bar = 185.6 m) to nonlinear openings and at elevations lower than expected ((x) over bar = 882 m). Combined evidence of multiple variables indicated that pipistrelles preferred to roost close to streams. Our results indicate that land managers in the southern Appalachians should maintain a diversity of age classes to provide roosting habitat for both species, and that pipistrelles in particular may benefit from retention of mature stands or buffer zones near perennial streams. Furthermore, non-reproductive red bats and pipistrelles may prefer to roost near openings to minimize commuting costs when openings comprise a small proportion of a densely forested landscape.

J	Sherali, Hanif D.; Adams, Warren P.								A Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) for semi-infinite and convex programs under mixed 0-1 and general discrete restrictions								DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS				157	6			1319	1333		10.1016/j.dam.2008.03.041			MAR 28 2009	2009	The Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) provides a hierarchy of relaxations spanning the spectrum from the continuous relaxation to the convex hull representation for linear 0-1 mixed-integer and general mixed-discrete programs. We show in this paper that this result holds identically for semi-infinite programs of this type. As a consequence, we extend the RLT methodology to describe a construct for generating a hierarchy of relaxations leading to the convex hull representation for bounded 0-1 mixed-integer and general mixed-discrete convex programs, using an equivalent semi-infinite linearized representation for such problems as an intermediate stepping stone in the analysis. For particular use in practice, we provide specialized forms of the resulting first-level RLT formulation for such mixed 0-1 and discrete convex programs, and illustrate these forms through two examples.

However, knowledge is incomplete about other biological pathways that respond to changes in iron concentration, as well as details of the responses. In this work, we integrate physiological, transcriptomics and genetic approaches to delineate the iron response of S. oneidensis.Results: We show that the iron response in S. oneidensis is a rapid process. Temporal gene expression profiles were examined for iron depletion and repletion, and a gene co-expression network was reconstructed. Modules of iron acquisition systems, anaerobic energy metabolism and protein degradation were the most noteworthy in the gene network. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that genes in each of the modules might be regulated by DNA-binding proteins Fur, CRP and RpoH, respectively. Closer inspection of these modules revealed a transcriptional regulator (SO2426) involved in iron acquisition and ten transcriptional factors involved in anaerobic energy metabolism. Selected genes in the network were analyzed by genetic studies. Disruption of genes encoding a putative alcaligin biosynthesis protein (SO3032) and a gene previously implicated in protein degradation (SO2017) led to severe growth deficiency under iron depletion conditions. Disruption of a novel transcriptional factor (SO1415) caused deficiency in both anaerobic iron reduction and growth with thiosulfate or TMAO as an electronic acceptor, suggesting that SO1415 is required for specific branches of anaerobic energy metabolism pathways.Conclusion: Using a reconstructed gene network, we identified major biological pathways that were differentially expressed during iron depletion and repletion. Genetic studies not only demonstrated the importance of iron acquisition and protein degradation for iron depletion, but also characterized a novel transcriptional factor (SO1415) with a role in anaerobic energy metabolism.									19	2	0	19	0	21			1471-2164			WOS:000265792700002	19321007

The myVocs framework enables virtual organization (VO) self-management across unrelated security domains for multiple, unrelated VOs. By leveraging the emerging distributed identity management infrastructure. myVocs provides an accessible, secure collaborative environment using standards for federated identity management and open-source software developed through the National Science Foundation Middleware Initiative. The Shibboleth software, an early implementation of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards Security Assertion Markup Language standard for browser single sign-on, provides the middleware needed to assert identity and attributes across domains so that access control decisions can be determined at each resource bused on local policy. The eduPerson object class for lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) provides standardized naming, format, and semantics for a global identifier. We have found that a Shibboleth deployment supporting VOs requires the addition of a new VO service component allowing VOs to manage their own membership and control access to their distributed resources. The myVocs system can be integrated with Grid authentication and authorization using GridShib. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1532-0626			WOS:000264226400004

In the previous paper by Juang and his coworkers, the LPI was re-calibrated for a piezocone penetration test (CM) model, and a simplified model based on LPI was created for computing the conditional probability of surface manifestation of liquefaction (P(G)). In this paper, the model for this conditional probability Pc is extended into a complete framework for assessing the probability of surface manifestation of liquefaction in a given exposure time at a given site subjected to all possible ground motions at all seismic hazard levels. This new framework is formulated and demonstrated with an example site in 10 different seismic regions in the United States. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The basis of the study is a large database of 955 slope records from four highways in the Alishan area. Artificial neural network (ANN) is utilized to "learn" from this database. The developed ANN model is then used to study the effect of the Chi-Chi earthquake on the slope failure characteristics in the Alishan area. Significant changes in the degrees of influence of several factors (variables) are found and possible reasons for such changes are discussed. The novelty of this paper lies in the fact that the developed ANN models are used as a tool to investigate the slope failure characteristics before and after the Chi-Chi earthquake.

A leading hypothesis on the physiological basis of gigantism posits that, in polar water, high oxygen availability coupled to low metabolic rates relieves constraints on oxygen transport and allows the evolution of large body size. Here, we test the oxygen hypothesis using Antarctic pycnogonids, which have been evolving in very cold conditions (-1.8-0 degrees C) for several million years and contain spectacular examples of gigantism. Pycnogonids from 12 species, spanning three orders of magnitude in body mass, were collected from McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Individual sea spiders were forced into activity and their performance was measured at different experimental levels of dissolved oxygen (DO). The oxygen hypothesis predicts that, all else being equal, large pycnogonids should perform disproportionately poorly in hypoxia, an outcome that would appear as a statistically significant interaction between body size and oxygen level. In fact, although we found large effects of DO on performance, and substantial interspecific variability in oxygen sensitivity, there was no evidence for size! DO interactions. These data do not support the oxygen hypothesis of Antarctic pycnogonid gigantism and suggest that explanations must be sought in other ecological or evolutionary processes.									16	0	0	17	0	17			0962-8452			WOS:000263148000012	19129117	
J	Higham, Timothy E.; Biewener, Andrew A.								Fatigue alters in vivo function within and between limb muscles during locomotion								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				276	1659			1193	1197		10.1098/rspb.2008.1734			MAR 22 2009	2009	Muscle fatigue, a reduction in force as a consequence of exercise, is an important factor for any animal that moves, and can result from both peripheral and/or central mechanisms. Although much is known about whole-limb force generation and activation patterns in fatigued muscles under sustained isometric contractions, little is known about the in vivo dynamics of limb muscle function in relation to whole-body fatigue. Here we show that limb kinematics and contractile function in the lateral (LG) and medial (MG) gastrocnemius of helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) are significantly altered following fatiguing exercise at 2 m s(-1) on an inclined treadmill. The two most significant findings were that the variation in muscle force generation, measured directly from the muscles' tendons, increased significantly with fatigue, and fascicle shortening in the proximal MG, but not the distal MG, decreased significantly with fatigue. We suggest that the former is a potential mechanism for decreased stability associated with fatigue. The region-specific alteration of fascicle behaviour within the MG as a result of fatigue suggests a complex response to fatigue that probably depends on muscle-aponeurosis and tendon architecture not previously explored. These findings highlight the importance of studying the integrative in vivo dynamics of muscle function in response to fatigue.									7	0	0	4	0	7			0962-8452			WOS:000263148000027	19129096	
J	Srivastava, Nilabh; Haque, Imtiaz								Nonlinear dynamics of a friction-limited drive: Application to a chain continuously variable transmission (CVT) system								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				321	1-2			319	341		10.1016/j.jsv.2008.09.045			MAR 20 2009	2009	Over the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted on developing vehicle transmissions that meet the goals of reduced exhaust emissions and increased vehicle efficiency. A continuously variable transmission is an emerging automotive transmission technology that offers a continuum of gear ratios between desired limits. A chain CVT is a friction-limited drive whose dynamic performance and torque capacity rely significantly on the friction characteristic of the contact patch between the chain and the pulley. Although a CVT helps to maximize the vehicle fuel economy, its complete potential has not been accomplished in a mass-production vehicle. The present research focuses on developing models to analyze friction-induced nonlinear dynamics of a chain CVT drive and identify possible mechanisms that cause degradation of the overall dynamic performance by inducing chaos and self-sustained vibrations in the system. Two different mathematical models of friction, which characterize different operating or loading conditions, are embedded into a detailed planar multibody model of chain CVT in order to capture the various friction-induced effects in the system. Tools such as stick-slip oscillator dynamics, Lyapunov exponents, phase-space reconstruction, and recurrence plotting are incorporated to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of such a friction-limited system. The mathematical models, the computational scheme, and the results corresponding to different loading scenarios are discussed. The results discuss the influence of friction characteristics on the nonlinear dynamics and torque transmitting capacity of a chain CVT drive. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Supplemental control of lepidopterous pests on Bt transgenic sweet corn with biologically-based spray treatments								JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE				9						8				MAR 19 2009	2009	Biologically-based spray treatments, including nucleopolyhedroviruses, neem, and spinosad, were evaluated as supplemental controls for the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), and corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), on transgenic sweet corn, Zea mays (L.) (Poales: Poaceae), expressing a Cry1Ab toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) (Bt). Overall, transgenic corn supported lower densities of both pests than did nontransgenic corn. Control of the fall armyworm was improved in both whorl-stage and tassel-stage corn by the use of either a nucleopolyhedrovirus or neem, but the greatest improvement was seen with spinosad. Only spinosad consistently reduced damage to ears, which was caused by both pest species. In general, efficacy of the spray materials did not differ greatly between transgenic and nontransgenic corn.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1536-2442			WOS:000264348100001	19611255

Simulations confirm that a Helmholtz-like interfacial counterion layer exists when the electrode charge density is negative or strongly positive, but the counterion layer is not well-defined when the electrode charge density is weakly positive. The thickness of the EDL, as inferred from how deep the charge separation and orientational ordering of the ions penetrate into the bulk ILs, is about 1.1 nm. The liquid nature of the IL and the short-range ion-electrode and ion-ion interactions are found to significantly affect the structure of the EDL, particularly at low electrode charge densities. Charge delocalization of the ions is found to affect the mean force experienced by the ions and, thus, can play an important role in shaping the EDL structure. The differential capacitance of the EDLs is found to be nearly constant under negative electrode polarization but increases dramatically with the potential under positive electrode polarization. We show that the differential capacitance is a quantitative measure of the response of the EDL structure to a change in electrode charge density. It is found that the [NO3](-) ion dominates the response of EDL structure to the change in electrode charge under both positive and negative electrode polarization, which is qualitatively different from that in aqueous electrolytes. Detailed analysis shows that the cation-anion correlations and the strong adsorption of [BMIM](+) ions on the electrode are responsible for the capacitance-potential correlation observed here.									110	1	0	3	0	110			1932-7447			WOS:000264111300049

The nsSNPs were mapped on the proteins' structures and their effect on the binding energy was investigated with CHARMM force field and continuum electrostatic calculations. Two sets of nsSNPs were studied: disease annotated Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and nonannotated (non-OMIM). It was demonstrated that OMIM nsSNPs tend to destabilize the electrostatic component of the binding energy, in contrast with the effect of non-OMIM nsSNPs. In addition, it was shown that the change of the binding energy upon amino acid substitutions is not related to the conservation of the net charge, hydrophobicity, or hydrogen bond network at the interface. The results indicate that, generally, the effect of nsSNPs on protein-protein interactions cannot be predicted from amino acids' physico-chemical properties alone, since in many cases a substitution of a particular residue with another amino acid having completely different polarity or hydrophobicity had little effect on the binding energy. Analysis of sequence conservation showed that nsSNP at highly conserved positions resulted in a large variance of the binding energy changes. In contrast, amino acid substitutions corresponding to nsSNPs at nonconserved positions, on average, were not found to have a large effect on binding affinity. pKa calculations were performed and showed that amino acid substitutions could change the wild-type proton uptake/release and thus resulting in different pH-dependence of the binding energy.									52	0	0	45	0	53			0006-3495			WOS:000266376700014	19289044

To efficiently utilize these low-cost feedstocks for biodiesel synthesis, a preliminary acid-catalyzed esterification pretreatment is necessary to reduce their FFA contents. In this study, the use of a three-phase reaction has been investigated for the simultaneous esterification of FFAs and transesterification of triglycerides (TGs) using model mixtures of TGs and FFAs [0-25 wt % lauric acid (HLa) in tricaprylin (TCp)] to simulate waste grease and to permit easy distinction between the reactions. Trans/esterification with methanol was carried out using a commercial tungstated zirconia (WZ) solid catalyst in a well-stirred semibatch reactor at 130 degrees C operating at atmospheric pressure. Methanol was continuously charged to the reactor. Unreacted methanol and water produced during the reaction were continuously removed by vaporization, thereby favoring esterification. Esterification occurred 4 times faster than transesterification. Under our reaction conditions and in the presence of the catalyst, byproduct water was produced not only from HLa esterification but also from methanol dehydration. Because of the presence of this water, TGs were converted into the ester product by two routes: direct TG transesterification and TG hydrolysis followed by esterification. The catalyst, WZ, underwent 37% deactivation after three 2-h reaction cycles but completely recovered its original activity after a simple recalcination in flowing air. The feasibility of a continuous multiphase process for reducing FFAs in low-cost biodiesel feedstocks has been successfully demonstrated.									75	4	0	8	1	77			0888-5885			WOS:000264221600009

The microcantilever's top layer is covered with a piezoelectric material (here, ZnO) through which it can be excited. The nonlinear frequency response of the microcantilever is studied and the resulting shift in natural frequency due to nonlinearity is examined. By observing the subharmonics of the fundamental frequencies at second and third order, it is experimentally shown that there exist Cubic and quadratic nonlinearities in the microcantilever. Mathematical models based on these experimental tests are then proposed and verified. The out-of-plane measurements provide the experimental ability to observe both transversal and torsional modes. In addition, the modes in which the microcantilever acts like a plate are observed and discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Biological error, processing error, and random variability can reduce the quality of an experiment, and thus hinder the identification of protein interaction pairs. Appraising affinity isolation assay quality is essential to inferring protein associations. An important step of the assay is the mass spectrometric identification of proteins. To evaluate this step, a known mixture of proteins is processed through a mass spectrometer as a quality control mixture. If the mass spectrometer yields unexpected results, the process is currently qualitatively evaluated, tuned, and reset. Statistical quality control (SQC) procedures, including the use of cumulative sum, the individual measurement, and moving range charts are implemented to analyze the stability of the mass spectrometric analysis. The SQC measures presented can assist in establishing preliminary control limits to identify an out-of-control process and investigate assignable causes for shifts in the process mean in real time.

Toughness decrease of PLA-PHBHHx blend films upon surface-confined photopolymerization								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				88A	4			1079	1086		10.1002/jbm.a.32009			MAR 15 2009	2009	The present research investigates the effect of photoinduced grafting reaction on the bulk properties of melt processed poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA)-poly[(3-hydroxybutyrate)-co-(3-hydroxyhexanoate)] (PHBHHx) blend films. PLA-PHBHHx blend films, comprising 10 wt % PHBHHx showed a remarkable toughness improvement. From dynamic mechanical analysis of melt processed PLA-PHBHHx blend films, the blend appears to be noncompatible. Unfortunately, PLA-PHBHHx blend films underwent rapid physical aging as characterized using differential scanning calorimetry, resulting in a significant toughness loss. Physically aged films regained the original toughness on annealing at 60 C for 30 min. Annealed PLA-PHBHHx blend films also underwent physical aging leading to a significant toughness loss. Hydrophilic monomers like acrylic acid and acrylamide were successfully photopolymerized from the film surface using a sequential, two-step photo-grafting approach. The resultant films were characterized using water contact angle goniometry, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, and mechanical testing. PLA-PHBHHx blend films lost their toughness significantly on surface modification and this was assigned to UV-assisted solvent induced crystallization as characterized using wide-angle X-ray diffraction analyses.

All samples were characterized for phase composition, surface area, lattice hydroxyl contamination, and particle morphology by X-ray diffraction, N(2) physisorption, FT-IR, solid state Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) (1)H NMR and scanning electron microscopy. The results were compared to a commercial titania, Degussa P25. Evaluation of methyl orange degradation under UV irradiation results showed that the lower lattice hydroxyl content in SACS titania nanoparticles enhances photocatalytic activity.

Spectroscopy obtained at the ESO-VLT revealed a continuum extending down to lambda = 9400 angstrom, and zero flux for 7500 angstrom< lambda < 9400 angstrom, which we interpret as the onset of a Gunn-Peterson trough at z = 6.695 +/- 0.025 (95.5% confidence level), making GRB 080913 the highest-redshift gamma-ray burst (GRB) to date, and more distant than the highest-redshift QSO. We note that many redshift indicators that are based on promptly available burst or afterglow properties have failed for GRB 080913. We report on our follow-up campaign and compare the properties of GRB 080913 with bursts at lower redshift. In particular, since the afterglow of this burst is fainter than typical for GRBs, we show that 2 m class telescopes can identify most high-redshift GRBs.									143	4	0	0	0	144			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000264095100051

We analyze the relationship between the footpoint motions and topological spine lines and find that the examined footpoint sources move along spine lines. We present a three-dimensional topological model in which this movement can be understood. As reconnection proceeds, flux is transferred between the reconnecting domains, causing the separator to move. The movement of the separator's chromospheric ends, identified with the HXR footpoints, is along those spine lines on which the separator ends.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X			WOS:000264095100053

Undersaturated vapor condenses inside nanotubes and forms nanometer-thick water films. Simultaneously, nanotubes deform and decrease their apparent diameter. When the vapor pressure in the chamber approaches the saturation pressure, we observe the formation of menisci and spontaneous buckling of the nanotubes. We derive a criterion of the buckling instability caused by capillary condensation. Remarkably, the buckling criterion appears to be independent of the meniscus shape. Using our experiments and models, we estimated the circumferential Young's modulus of large-diameter carbon nanotubes with disordered wall structure produced by the chemical vapor deposition method (CVD) to be E-theta theta approximate to 13-18 MPa. It appears to be at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than the longitudinal modulus of nanotubes produced by arc discharge or catalytic CVD methods. The reported experiments and proposed theory suggest possible applications of "soft" nanotubes as sensors to probe minute concentrations of absorbable gases and vapors.									29	1	0	0	0	29			0743-7463			WOS:000263770800041	19437757

These methods were then applied to investigate how surface chemistry and solution concentration influence both the amount of adsorbed proteins and their secondary structure. Human fibrinogen and albumin were adsorbed onto alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold with CH(3), OCH(2)-CF(3), NH(2), COOH, and OH terminal groups from both dilute (0.1 mg/mL) and moderately concentrated (1.0 mg/mL) solutions. An increase in surface hydrophobicity was found to cause an increase in both the amount of the protein adsorbed and the degree of structural change that was caused by the adsorption process, while an increase in solution concentration caused an increase in the amount of protein adsorbed but a decrease in the degree of conformational change, with these effects being more pronounced on the more hydrophobic surfaces. The combined use of these two parameters (i.e., surface chemistry and solution concentration) thus provides a means of independently varying the degree of structural change following adsorption from the amount of adsorbed protein. Further studies are underway to examine which of these factors most strongly influences platelet response, with the overall goal of developing a better understanding of the fundamental factors governing the hemocompatibility of biomaterial surfaces.									71	2	0	25	0	73			0743-7463			WOS:000263770800076	19437712	
J	Harrington, James M.; Jones, S. Bart; VanDerveer, Donald J.; Bartolotti, Libero J.; Hancock, Robert D.								Structural, molecular mechanics, and DFT study of cadmium(II) in its crown ether complexes with axially coordinated ligands, and of the binding of thiocyanate to cadmium(II)								INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA				362	4			1122	1128		10.1016/j.ica.2008.05.031			MAR 2 2009	2009	The role of relativistic effects (RE) in the structures of Cd(II) complexes with crown ethers, and the reason the 'soft' Cd(II) strongly prefers to bind to SCN through N, are considered. The synthesis and structures of [Cd(18-crown-6)(thiourea)(2)] (ClO(4))(2). 18-crown-6 (1) and [Cd(Cy(2)-18-crown-6)(NCS)(2)] (2) are reported. (18-crown-6 = 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane; Cy(2)-18-crown-6 = cis-anti-cis-2,5,8,15,18,21-hexaoxatricylo[20.4.0.0(9,14)]hexacosane). In 1 Cd is coordinated in the plane of the crown which has close to D(3d) symmetry, with long Cd-O bonds averaging 2.688 angstrom. The two thiourea molecules form relatively short Cd-S bonds that average 2.468 angstrom, with an S-Cd-S angle of 164.30 degrees. This structure conforms with the idea that Cd(II) can adopt a near-linear structure involving two covalently-bound donor atoms (the S-donors) with short Cd-S bonds, which resembles gas-phase structures for species such as CdCl(2). The structure of 2 is similar, with the two SCN ligands N-bonded to Cd, with short Cd-N bonds of 2.106 angstrom, and N-Cd-N angle of 180 degrees. The crown in 2 forms long Cd-O bonds that average 2.698 angstrom. Molecular mechanics calculations suggest that a main reason Cd(II) prefers to bind to SCN through N is that when bound through S, the small Cd-S-C angle, which is typically close to 100 degrees, brings the ligand into close contact with other ligands present, and causes steric destabilization. In contrast, the Cd-N-C angles for SCN coordinated through N are much larger, being 171.4 degrees in 2, which keeps the SCN groups well clear of the crown ether. DFT (density functional theory) calculations are used to generate the structures of [Cd(18-crown-6)(H(2)O)(2)](2+) (3) and [Cd(18-crown-6)Cl(2)] (4). In 3, the Cd(II) is bound to only three O-donors of the macrocycle, with Cd-O bonds averaging 2.465 angstrom. The coordinated waters form an O-Cd-O angle of 139.47 degrees, with Cd-O bonds of 2.295 angstrom. In contrast, for 4, the Cd is placed centrally in the cavity of the D(3d) symmetry crown, with long Cd-O bonds averaging 2.906 angstrom. The Cl groups form a Cl-Cd-Cl angle of 180 degrees, with short Cd-Cl bonds of 2.412 angstrom. With ionically bound groups on the axial sites of[Cd(18-crown-6)X(2)] complexes, such as with X = H(2)O in 3, the Cd(II) does not adopt linear geometry involving the two X groups, with long Cd-O bonds to the O-donors of the macrocycle. With covalently-bound X = Cl in 4, short Cd-Cl bonds and a linear [Cl-Cd-Cl] unit results, with long Cd-O bonds to the crown ether. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

Specifically, the strength of the adhesive bond (or practical adhesion) was probed in a tearing contact mode, when the particle was removed by applying a tangential force parallel to the substrate surface. The effect of the polymer molecular weight and layer thickness on the particle (practical) adhesion was investigated. It was found that the particles were removed by destroying the cohesive contact zone and that the PVP layer thickness had a pronounced effect on the force needed to destroy the adhesive joint. In particular, the greater the layer thickness, the larger was the required break force. However, the strength of the adhesive joint was estimated to be higher for a thinner layer. it is suggested that mechanical properties of the system as well as molecular characteristics of the PVP layer are responsible for the trend observed. The molecular weight OF the polymer did not significantly affect the strength of the adhesive bond,									8	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244			WOS:000267535900009	20355978

Dimethylethylamine alane was more reactive, capable of yielding well-defined and dispersed aluminum nanoparticles. 1-Methylpyrrolidine alane was less reactive and more complex in the catalytic decomposition reaction, for which various experimental parameters and conditions were used and evaluated. The results suggested that the passivation agent played dual roles of trapping aluminum particles to keep them nanoscale during the alane decomposition and protecting the aluminum nanoparticles postproduction from surface oxidation and that an appropriate balance between the rate of alane decomposition (depending more sensitively on the reaction temperature) and the timing in the introduction of the passivation agent into the reaction mixture was critical to the desired product mixes and/or morphologies. Some fundamental and technical issues on the alane decomposition and the protection of the resulting aluminum nanoparticles are discussed.									45	0	0	3	0	45			1944-8244			WOS:000267535900024	20355993

Two Ru-Cl bonds and one Ru-carbene bond complete the distorted octahedron. The carbene portion of the ligand is a benzimidazole ring. This ring is connected to the C6H2(CH3)(3) arene group by a CH2 bridge. This leads to a system with very little apparent strain. A dichloromethane solvent molecule completes the crystal structure. Further stabilization is accomplished via C-center dot center dot center dot N and C-H center dot center dot center dot Cl interactions.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1600-5368			WOS:000264796100008	21582038

Utilizing South Carolina microdata, we look for correlation between an individual's advancement to a judgeship and his/her name's masculinity, which we construct from the joint empirical distribution of names and gender in the state's entire population of registered voters. We find robust evidence that nominally masculine females are favored over other females. Hence, our results support the Portia Hypothesis.									5	1	0	1	0	6			1465-7252			WOS:000273732900005

However, its role in regulating diverse, mixed natural tree communities is less certain.In this study we investigated density-dependent effects in a large-scale (25 ha) old-growth temperate forest in northeastern China. Spatial patterns of neighborhood distribution in the plot were analyzed using various methods for inferring competition, including (1) pair correlation function to determine spatial patterns of pre-mortality and post-mortality and (2) neighborhood analysis of individuals to examine the extent to which tree survival is correlated with other covariates.Results showed that, for common species, 3 of 5 canopy species and 3 of 8 midstory and understory species were random in mortality. Negative density-dependent mortality was not found when trees reach 1 cm in DBH. There was no significant correlation for canopy species between tree survival and conspecific abundance, but largely positive correlations for midstory and understory species. In contrast, tree survival was found to negatively correlate with conspecific basal area for most species, indicating strong intraspecific competition. No strong interspecific density dependence was found in the forest.									12	3	0	12	0	14			1286-4560			WOS:000263776500004

In the present study, the feasibility of proteomic techniques to examine the mechanotransduction of bladder smooth muscle cells (SMC) was tested for the first time. Specifically, two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and image analyses were employed to separate and identify protein profiles in control and in cells exposed to cyclic pressure (0.1 Hz, 40 cmH(2)O) for 1 h. The results provide evidence that 20 (out of 155) spots exhibited changes (up- or down-regulation) in intensity between control and cyclic pressure groups. The mass spectrometry analysis provided sequences for 118 tryptic peptides from these 20 spots, and peptide mapping provided a positive match of peptide sequences to 24 distinct proteins. Moreover, the results of Western analysis independently confirmed up- regulation of nuclear matrix protein, lamin A/C in SMC exposed to cyclic pressure. Since the protein samples were predominantly of the cytosolic fraction, we concluded that the observed up- regulation was due to the translocation of either membrane-bound or nuclear localized proteins into the cytosol. Based on these observations, the present study demonstrated that the proteomic approach can be a powerful analytical tool for mechanobiology research that allows analysis of a large number of variables, thereby supporting development of new hypotheses to guide future investigation.									4	0	0	2	0	4			1865-5025			WOS:000269822400016

To determine the limits of positive ion infiltration, a method based on milli X-ray fluorescence (mXRF) has been developed. This method combines traditional energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) with stage movement X-ray mapping to analyze comparatively large areas of concrete. The result is the ability to determine the depth of ion infiltration over a distance of tens of millimeters. The technique also requires minimal preparation of the sample, and due to the nature of the X-ray beam, concrete samples do not have to be coated to reduce charging. This paper describes in detail the method of mXRF with X-ray spectrum imaging (XSI) for concrete applications and shows two examples where potassium ion infiltration was measured with mXRF-XSI as part of broader studies in pavement durability.

It is theoretically shown that through applying external electrical field, the quality of adhesion between nanotube and the matrix at nanoscale can be imparted to result in novel engineered composites at macroscale with tunable mechanical properties ranging from stiffer structure to better damper, the attributes that are essential for structural vibration control. Along this line, two classes of nanotubes; namely, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), are investigated. It is demonstrated that BNNTs possess better tunability compared to CNTs due to their outstanding molecular crystalline structure. More specifically, it is shown that mechanical properties of BNNT-based structures are more sensitive to the variation of separation distance in the interphase zone, and the stick-slip mechanism, which is responsible for damping change, can easily occur in BNNT-reinforced piezoelectric polymers.

The primary focus of the database is to support environmental research focused on tidal creek watershed systems. Specifically, the current data holdings include physical water quality parameters, nutrients, pathogens, chemical contaminants, benthic and nekton species abundances and human dimensions data from Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina dating to 1994. These data are not from a single long-term research project but are derived from several state and federal research programs and integrated into a common database model to support current research being conducted under the OHHI program at HML. The Tidal Creek database was developed with the intent to support a well documented and open system, thus metadata elements from common metadata standards including the Dublin Core ISO 15836: 2003 and Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC-STD-001-1998) are components of the database model. The result is a semantic database frame-work with descriptive ancillary data at the record level including methods, investigator names, date, locations and other descriptive elements. The primary users of the database are project personnel to meet analytical needs. The database is also available through a number of web-based applications that are designed to give users the necessary information to evaluate and access data. In addition, data can be accessed with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, and species records and abundances are being made available to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). Overall, the Tidal Creek database summarizes the response of tidal creeks and watersheds to coastal development, and serves as a repository for environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic data in the Southeast.					8th Symposium of the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program8th Symposium of the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program	APR 10-11, 2007APR 10-11, 2007		Washington, DCWashington, DC	3	0	0	2	0	3			0167-6369			WOS:000263159900027	18418722

To determine the cellular targets of feverfew extracts, we have utilized oligo microarrays to study the gene expression profiles elicited by feverfew extracts in human monocytic THP-1 cells. We have identified 400 genes that are consistently regulated by feverfew extracts. Most of the genes are involved in cellular metabolism. However, the genes undergoing the highest degree of change by feverfew treatment are involved in other pathways including chemokine function, water homeostasis and heme-mediated signaling. Our results also suggest that feverfew extracts effectively reduce Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-mediated TNF- and CCL2 (MCP-1) releases by THP-1 cells. We hypothesize that feverfew components mediate metabolism, cell migration and cytokine production in human monocytes/macrophages.									14	0	0	8	0	14			1741-427X			WOS:000263603800013	18955216

EFFECTS OF BEETLE DENSITY AND TIME OF DAY ON THE DISPERSAL OF GRATIANA BOLIVIANA (COLEOPTERA: CHRYSOMELIDAE)								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				92	1			99	106		10.1653/024.092.0116			MAR 2009	2009	The leaf beetle, Gratiana boliviana Spaeth, is a biological control agent of tropical soda apple (Solanum viarum Dunal), a noxious weed invading the rangeland and agricultural fields of Florida and other southeastern states. In caged experiments, we examined the influence of beetle density and the time of day on the dispersal of the leaf beetle. Increasing beetle density from 2 to 100 beetles per plant did not increase G. boliviana dispersal, as long as the host plants were not severely defoliated. An increase in beetle density from 10 to 100 beetles per plant significantly reduced the per capita fecundity from 0.3 to 0.02 eggs over a 24-h period. Thus, a mass rearing method for G. boliviana should consider the potential detrimental effect of increasing density on the fecundity of the leaf beetle. When the dispersal activity of the leaf beetle was observed between 8:00 and 18:00 h, the proportion of beetles dispersing from a given plant increased throughout the morning hours and peaked at noon. A monitoring or sampling program of G. boliviana should be conducted in the early morning or late afternoon when the beetles' tendency to disperse is the lowest in order to more accurately sample for the population density in a certain area. Beetle density and the time of day interacted to influence the proportion of G. boliviana dispersing from a given plant. The proportions of beetles that dispersed were not different among the different time periods at densities of less than 40 beetles per plant. At or above 40 beetles per plant, the proportion of beetles that dispersed peaked at noon. This study suggests that a myriad of factors, including density, feeding damage, photoperiod and host plant quality, interact to determine the dispersal pattern of G. boliviana.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0015-4040			WOS:000264161900016		
J	Verderber, Stephen								Preventing Chronic Disease Among the Aged: A Call for Evidence-Based Design Research								HERD-HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH & DESIGN JOURNAL				2	3			71	83					SPR 2009	2009	The quality of the built environment and the public health and well-being of its inhabitants are profoundly interwoven. Among all age groups, the aged are particularly susceptible to disengagement or avoidance of the built environment and the physical exercise options it affords; this can have a deleterious influence on personal health. In this discussion, concepts drawn from the fields of architecture, landscape research, urban and regional planning, and environmental gerontology are drawn together in the context of a hybrid conceptual and operative model. This model is put forth to assist in the acquisition of knowledge in the field to further understanding of how chronic diseases among the aged can be reduced through the provision and utilization of sufficiently supportive outdoor physical activity options in the everyday environment. This hybrid model, the Prospect-Refuge Competency Index (PRCI), combines key elements of prospect-refuge theory and environmental press-competency theory. It can be applied to diverse settings and user constituencies, The discussion concludes with the presentation of a set of hypotheses for the neighborhood/community level and the residential/exterior environs level of inquiry.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1937-5867			WOS:000273357700006	21165837	
J	Gosnell, J. Stephen; Rivera, Gabriel; Blob, Richard W.								A PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF SEXUAL SIZE DIMORPHISM IN TURTLES								HERPETOLOGICA				65	1			70	81					MAR 2009	2009	Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is widespread in a variety of vertebrate taxa, and its presence has been associated with a range of evolutionary and ecological factors. Turtles, as a lineage, have been shown to include species that exhibit both forms of SSD-male-biased (male larger) and female-biased (female larger)-as well as species that do not exhibit SSD (male size congruent to female size). Previous work has suggested that factors affecting the direction and magnitude of SSD in turtles may include habitat preference and fecundity; these correlations, however, have not been tested in a phylogenetic context. To provide a framework for evaluating potential correlates with the magnitude and direction of SSD in turtles, we examined the phylogenetic distribution of SSD in this clade. Published sources were surveyed for data on the direction and magnitude of SSD, carapace length, clutch size, egg size, and preferred habitat (terrestrial vs. nonterrestrial). Phylogenies were compiled from multiple published sources to develop a phylogeny for all taxa (n = 82) for which SSD data were assembled. The phylogenetic distribution of SSD was then evaluated using parsimony-based methods. These analyses indicated that the ancestral condition for extant turtles was female-biased SSD. Phylogenetic analyses conducted on subsets of the data (concentrated-changes tests, independent contrasts) indicated that changes in SSD state were not correlated with changes in habitat preference. Both male and female carapace length were found to be correlated with traits related to fecundity, (egg size, clutch size), but the degree of dimorphism was not found to be correlated with these traits. A significant negative correlation between egg size and clutch size was also evident in turtles, as predicted by life-history theory.									13	2	0	12	0	16			0018-0831			WOS:000266320900006		
J	Friebel, Brad A.; Jodice, Patrick G. R.								Home range and habitat use of feral hogs in Congaree National Park, South Carolina								Human-Wildlife Conflicts				3	1			49	63					SPR 2009	2009	Feral hogs (Sus scrofa) are a widespread exotic species that currently occur in most states within the United States and are common throughout the southeastern United States. We radio-collared and tracked feral hogs from April 2005 to November 2006 in Congaree National Park (CNP), South Carolina, USA. The CNP is one of the largest and most intact tracts of old-growth, bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the United States. We measured home range size and determined habitat use for male and female hogs. The mean (+/- SE) home range sizes for male hogs (n = 7) and female hogs (n = 9) were 218 43 ha and 191 +/- 31 ha, respectively. These home range estimates are relatively small compared to estimates from other studies of feral hogs. Habitat use models indicated that high use areas for hogs included habitat types best characterized as bottomland hardwoods and that hog locations were distributed in a relatively uniform manner throughout the study area within CNP. The small home ranges and habitat use patterns we observed suggest that habitat quality in CNP is good for feral hogs. Radio-collared hogs also moved readily between park and private lands. Thirteen of 23 collared hogs were found on private lands adjacent to CNP at least once. At least eight of the 23 collared hogs were shot and killed by hunters and one of these was taken on CNP land. If control of hogs in CNP were a goal of resource managers, then it would likely succeed or fail based in large part on the incorporation of adjacent private lands into the program.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1934-4392			BCI:BCI200900213237

The protocols can be employed with a wide range of codes and decoding algorithms. No channel measurements are needed, and no external side information is supplied to the receiver. Performance results are provided for packet transmissions that employ turbo product codes. The protocol performance results are compared with capacity limits and with the performance for hypothetical ideal protocols that use perfect channel-state information to select the codes that maximize the expected throughput.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0090-6778			WOS:000263967900029

The methods presume that the radio configuration already has a gate array and a mixer juxtaposed with one another. Programming is added in the gate array to affect preconditioning of the signals presented to in-phase and quadrature channels of a hybrid mixer so as to correct and enhance the analog RF performance of the mixer. The first of the methods comprises a realization with off-the-shelf components of feedback of the RF output of the mixer. Spectrum analysis in the gate array allows separation and cancellation of the unwanted difference-frequency sideband in the mixer's output. The second tool is a feedforward correction of imperfect performance of a hybrid mixer. The correction parameters are determined through sideband reduction via the feedback scheme in the first method. It is shown that the correction scheme performs well even for very large deviations from the ideal in the mixer parameters. As a consequence, the scheme may be used to extend the operating band of the gate-array/mixer combination to extreme bandwidths-approaching 200%.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0018-9480			WOS:000264295200008		
J	Bassily, Hany; Lund, Robert; Wagner, John								Fault Detection in Multivariate Signals With Applications to Gas Turbines								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING				57	3			835	842		10.1109/TSP.2008.2009272			MAR 2009	2009	This paper proposes a fault detection method for multivariate signals. The method assesses whether or not the multivariate autocovariance functions of two independently sampled system signals coincide. If the first signal is known to be sampled from a well-functioning system, then rejection of signal equality is tantamount to concluding that the second signal is sampled from a faulty system. The proposed method is based on the asymptotic properties of the periodogram of multivariate stationary time series and is nonparametric in nature; in particular, there is no need to model the signals under study, an often arduous task. Several natural and synthetic faults were introduced in a Solar Turbines Mercury 50 4.5 MW gas turbine and the resulting compressor delivery pressure and generated electrical power were analyzed. The proposed method capably detected all faults.									7	0	0	1	0	7			1053-587X			WOS:000263431900002

A simple ballistic material model for soda-lime glass								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING				36	3			386	401		10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2008.08.001			MAR 2009	2009	Various open-literature experimental findings pertaining to the ballistic behavior of glass are used to construct a simple, physically based, high strain-rate, high-pressure, large-strain constitutive model for this material. The basic components of the model are constructed in such a way that the model is suitable for direct incorporation into standard commercial transient non-linear dynamics finite-element based software packages like ANSYS/Autodyn [ANSYS/Autodyn version 11.0, User documentation, Century Dynamics Inc. a subsidiary of ANSYS Inc.; 2007.] or ABAQUS/Explicit [ABAQUS version 6.7, User documentation, Dessault systems, 2007.]. To validate the material model, a set of finite element analyses of the Edge-on-Impact (EOI) tests is carried out and the results compared with their experimental counterparts obtained in the recent work of Strassburger et al. [Strassburger E, Patel P, McCauley JW, Kovalchick C, Ramesh KT Templeton DW. High-speed transmission shadowgraphic and dynamic photoelasticity study of stress wave and impact damage propagation in transparent materials and laminates using the edge-on impact method. In: Proceedings of the twenty-third international symposium on ballistics. Spain: April 2007, and Strassburger E, Patel P, McCauley W, Templeton DW. Visualization of wave propagation and impact damage in a polycrystalline transparent ceramic-AION. In: Proceedings of the twenty-second international symposium on ballistics. Vancouver, Canada: November 2005.]. Overall, a good agreement is found between the computational and the experimental results pertaining to: (a) the front-shapes and propagation velocities of the longitudinal and transverse waves generated in the target during impact; (b) the front-shapes and propagation velocities of the "coherent-damage" zone (a zone surrounding the projectile/target contact surface which consists of numerous micron- and submicron-size cracks); and (c) the formation of "crack centers", i.e. isolated cracks nucleated ahead of the advancing coherent-damage zone front. Relatively minor discrepancies between the computational and the experimental results are attributed to the effects of damage-promoting target-fixturing induced stresses and cutting/grinding-induced flaws located along the narrow faces of the target and the surrounding regions.

J	Foy, Kevin; Wei, Zhi; Matsumura, Takashi; Huang, Yong								Effect of tilt angle on cutting regime transition in glass micromilling								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE				49	3-4			315	324		10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2008.10.007			MAR 2009	2009	Recent development in mechanical micromachining technology has increased the realization of micromachining as a feasible manufacturing process of micro-scale components including glass-based devices. It has been found that glass can be machined in a ductile regime under certain controlled cutting configurations. However, favorable ductile regime machining instead of brittle regime machining in micromilling of brittle glass is still not fully understood as a function of cutting configuration. In this study, the effect of tilt angle along the feed direction on cutting regime transition has been studied in micromilling crown glass with a micro-ball end mill. Straight glass grooves were machined in water bath by varying the tool tilt angle and the feed rate, and the resulting surface was characterized using the scanning electron microscope and the profilometer to investigate the glass cutting regime transition. In characterizing the cutting regimes in glass micromilling, rubbing, ductile machining, and brittle machining regimes are hypothesized according to the undeformed chip thickness. It is found that a crack-free glass surface can be better machined in the ductile mode using a 45 degrees tilt angle and feed rates up to 0.32 mm/min. During each milling pass, surface roughness was found to decrease from the entry zone to the groove bottom and then increase to the exit zone regardless of the cutting regime. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine three approaches that purport to explain escalation namely extension, interaction, and transformation and emphasize the fact that each theory by itself lacks full explanatory power. Synthesis that focuses on factors from state and society, which shape the decision to become Involved in ethnic strife is essential. Examination of the preceding factors reveals that institutional configurations and ethnic composition indeed do limit future options available to states and influence the distribution of capabilities among leaders of groups. The main conclusion of this essay is that ethnic diversity in a society and high constraint on state action are optimal conditions for overcoming insecurity.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1521-9488			WOS:000281576700004

J	Duckett, S. K.; Pratt, S. L.; Pavan, E.								Corn oil or corn grain supplementation to steers grazing endophyte-free tall fescue. II. Effects on subcutaneous fatty acid content and lipogenic gene expression								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				87	3			1120	1128		10.2527/jas.2008-1420			MAR 2009	2009	Twenty-eight Angus steers (289 kg) were finished on a high-concentrate diet (85% concentrate: 15% roughage; CONC), or endophyte-free tall fescue pastures with corn grain supplement (0.52% of BW; PC), corn oil plus soybean hull supplement (0.10% of BW corn oil plus 0.45% of BW soybean hulls; PO), or no supplement (pasture only; PA). Subcutaneous adipose tissues were processed for total cellular RNA extraction and fatty acid composition by GLC. Relative expression of genes involved in lipogenesis [fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, lipoprotein lipase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)] and activators of transcription [(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma),C/EBP alpha, sterol regulatory binding protein-1, signal transducer and activator of transcription-5, and Spot-14] was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Housekeeping gene (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and beta-actin) expression was used in analysis to normalize expression data. Total fatty acid content was greatest (P < 0.001) for CONC and least (P < 0.001) for PA. Supplementation of grazing cattle increased (P < 0.001) total fatty acid content compared with PA, but concentrations were less (P < 0.001) than for CONC. Myristic and palmitic acid contents were greater ( P < 0.001) for CONC than for PO and PC, which were greater (P < 0.001) than for PA. Stearic acid content was greater (P < 0.01) for PO than for CONC, PC, and PA. Finishing on CONC increased (P < 0.001) total MUFA content by 68% compared with PA. Corn grain supplementation increased (P < 0.001) MUFA content compared with PA; in contrast, MUFA content did not differ (P > 0.05) between PO and PA. Corn oil supplementation increased (P < 0.001) trans-11 vaccenic acid content in subcutaneous fat by 1.2-, 1.7- and 5.6-fold relative to PA, PC, and CONC, respectively. Concentrations of the cis-9, trans-11 CLA isomer were 54, 58, and 208% greater (P < 0.01) for PO than for PA, PC, and CONC, respectively. Corn grain supplementation to grazing steers did not alter (P > 0.05) the cis-9, trans-11 CLA isomer compared with PA. Oil supplementation increased (P < 0.001) linoleic acid (C18:2) content by 56, 98 and 262% compared with CONC, PC, and PA, respectively. Relative mRNA expression of SCD was upregulated (P < 0.001) by 46-, 18- and 7-fold, respectively, for CONC, PC, and PO compared with PA. Relative FASN mRNA expression was also upregulated (P = 0.004) by 9- and 5-fold, respectively, for CONC and PC compared with PA. Grain feeding, either on CONC or supplemented on pasture, upregulated FASN and SCD mRNA to increase MUFA and de novo fatty acids in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Upregulation of SCD with grain feeding and reduced tissue CLA concentrations suggest that the decreased CLA concentrations were the result of limited substrate (trans-11 vaccenic acid) availability.									39	2	0	36	0	41			0021-8812			WOS:000263558600032	19028850

Presented here is an in-depth analysis of the physical, compositional, and selected optical properties of silica-clad erbium-doped yttrium aluminosilicate glass optical fibers derived from undoped, 0.25, and 50 wt % Er(3+)-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) crystals. The YAG-derived fibers were found to be noncrystalline as evidenced by x-ray diffraction and corroborated by spectroscopic measurements. Elemental analysis across the core/clad interface strongly suggests that diffusion plays a large role in this amorphization. Despite the noncrystalline nature of the fibers, they do exhibit acceptable low losses (similar to 0.15-0.2 dB/m) for many applications, broad-band emissions in the near-infrared, and enhanced thermal conductivity along their length while maintaining equivalent mechanical strength with respect to conventional silica optical fibers. Further, considerably higher rare-earth doping levels are realized than can be achieved by conventional solution or vapor-phase doping schemes. A discussion of opportunities for such approaches to nontraditional fiber materials is presented.									43	0	0	0	0	43			0021-8979			WOS:000264156300011

Various p-type samples of NiyMo3Sb7-xTex were prepared with y <= 0.1 and 1.5 <= x <= 1.7 via high temperature reactions at 993 K. Adding transition metal atoms into the empty cube formed by Sb atoms significantly alters the band structure and thus the thermoelectric properties. Electronic band structure calculations indicate that adding Ni slightly increases the charge carrier concentration, while higher Te content causes a decrease. Thermoelectric properties were determined on pellets densified via hot pressing at 993 K. Seebeck as well as electrical and thermal conductivity measurements were performed up to 1023 K. The highest ZT value thus far was obtained from a sample of nominal composition Ni0.06Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6, which amounts to 0.93 at 1023 K.									25	1	0	1	0	26			0021-8979			WOS:000264156300044

ON SIMULATING THE GENERATION OF MOSAICISM DURING MAMMALIAN CEREBRAL CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS				17	1			27	62					MAR 2009	2009	Renewed calls for a systems biology reflect the hope hat enduring biological questions at single-cell and cell-population scales will be resolved as modern molecular biology, with its reductionist program, approaches a nearly-complete characterization of the molecular mechanisms of specific cellular processes. Due to the confounding complexity of biological organization across these scales, computational science is sought to complement the intuition of experimentalists. However, with respect to the molecular basis of cellular processes during development and disease, a gulf between feasible simulations and realistic biology persists. Formidable are the mathematical and computational challenges to conducting and validating cell population-scale simulations, drawn from single-cell level and molecular level details. Nonetheless, in some biological contexts, a focus on core processes crafted by evolution can yield coarse-grained mathematical models that retain explanatory potential despite drastic simplification of known biochemical kinetics.In this article, we bring this modeling philosophy to bear on the nature of neural progenitor cell decision making during mammalian cerebral cortical development. Specifically, we present the computational component to a research program addressing developmental links between (i) the cellular response to endogenous DNA damage, (ii) primary mechanisms of neuronal genetic heterogeneity, or mosaicism, and (iii) the cell fate decision making that defines the population kinetics of neurogenesis.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0218-3390			WOS:000262980200002

Specifically, at a Weissenberg number larger than a critical value, the iterative nonlinear solver fails to converge, a phenomenon known as the high Weissenberg number problem. In this work we describe the application and implementation of continuation methods to the nonlinear Johnson-Segalman model for steady-state viscoelastic flows. Simple, natural, and pseudo-arclength continuation approaches in Weissenberg number are investigated for a discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the equations. Computations are performed for a benchmark contraction flow and, several aspects of the performance of the continuation methods including high Weissenberg number limits, are discussed.

Performance of Mycorrhizal Products Marketed for Woody Landscape Plants								Journal of Environmental Horticulture				27	1			41	50					MAR 2009	2009	Commercial products containing propagules of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widely marketed to improve woody plant performance in the landscape. However, the infectivity of these products has rarely been subjected to independent testing. We evaluated commercial AMF inoculants in a series of greenhouse experiments using corn (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), trident maple (Acer buergerianum), and sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) as host plants. In corn and sorghum, colonization rarely exceeded 5% when plants were treated with commercial inoculants. In contrast, viable lab-cultured inoculant of similar species composition yielded mean colonization percentages of 38 to 61%. Despite the near absence of colonization, commercial inoculants generally improved shoot growth and increased soil nutrient concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Commercial inoculants had no effect on mycorrhizal colonization or shoot growth of trident maple or sweetbay magnolia liners. Product-treated magnolias grown from seed also developed little or no mycorrhizal colonization, whereas plants treated with a lab-cultured inoculant were 74% colonized. If commercial AMF inoculants are to receive broad acceptance as landscape soil amendments, manufacturers must demonstrate that their products can promote mycorrhizal colonization under the conditions of their intended distribution and use.									5	0	0	6	0	6			0738-2898			BCI:BCI200900246036

To that end, we consider a lumped-parameter non-linear model that describes the first-mode dynamics of a parametrically excited cantilever-type harvester. The model accounts for the beam's geometric and inertia non-linearities as well as non-linearities representing air drag. Using the method of multiple scales, we obtain approximate analytical expressions describing the beam response, voltage drop across a purely resistive load, and output power in the vicinity of the first principle parametric resonance. Using these expressions, we study the effect of the electromechanical coupling and load resistance on the output power. We show that these parameters play an imperative role in determining the magnitude of the output power and characterizing the broad-band properties of the harvester. Specifically, we show that the region of parametric instability wherein energy can be harvested shrinks as the coupling coefficient increases. Furthermore, we show that there exists a coupling coefficient beyond which the peak power decreases. We also demonstrate that there is a critical excitation level below which no energy can be harvested. The amplitude of this critical excitation increases with the coupling coefficient and is maximized for a given load resistance. Theoretical findings that were compared to experimental results show good agreement and reflect the general trends.									59	1	0	0	0	60			1045-389X			WOS:000263867700005

Within the PMH technologies, sheet-metal stamped/formed and thermoplastic injection molding subcomponents are integrated into a singular component/module. Due to attending synergetic effects, the performance of the PMH component typically exceeds that attainable by an alternative single-material technologies. In the present work, a total life cycle (TLC) approach to the selection of metallic and thermoplastic materials (as well as the selection of structural adhesives, where appropriate) is considered. The TLC material selection approach considers the consequences and ramifications of material selection at each major stage of the vehicle manufacturing process chain (press shop, injection molding shop, body shop, paint shop, and assembly), as well as relation to the vehicle performance, durability and the end-of-the-life-of-the-vehicle considerations. The approach is next applied to the case of injection overmolding technology to identify the optimal grade of short glass-fiber reinforced nylon when used in a prototypical PMH load-bearing automotive body-in-white component.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1059-9495			WOS:000263063600001

Deconvolution Of thin film's elastic properties from the substrate is achieved by statistical estimation, where a simple function relating the elastic moduli of the thin film and substrate to the film-substrate composite modulus IS used to fit the experimental data plotted against the logarithmic indentation depth normalized by film thickness. Experimental data from a wide range of soft and hard films on Substrate were used to demonstrate the deconvolution and validate the method. The estimated elastic moduli of thin films and Substrates agree well with their corresponding standard values or values obtained by other methods. The advantages of this method are discussed, and recommendations are made on how to design experiments to obtain reliable data for this method.									11	2	0	1	0	13			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000267208100023

Feeding Kinematics and Performance of Hawaiian Stream Gobies, Awaous guamensis and Lentipes concolor: Linkage of Functional Morphology and Ecology								JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY				270	3			344	356		10.1002/jmor.10695			MAR 2009	2009	Distributions of Hawaiian stream fishes are typically interrupted by waterfalls that divide streams into multiple segments. Larvae batch upstream, are flushed into the ocean, and must climb these waterfalls to reach adult habitats when returning back to freshwater as part of an amphidromous life cycle. Stream surveys and studies of climbing performance show that Lentipes concolor Gill can reach fast-flowing upper stream segments but that Awaous guamensis Valenciennes reaches only slower, lower stream segments. Gut content analyses for these two species indicate considerable overlap in diet, suggesting that feeding kinematics and performance of these two species might be comparable. Alternatively, feeding kinematics and performance of these species might be expected to differ in relation to the different flow regimes in their habitat (feeding in faster stream currents for L. concolor versus in slower currents for A. guamensis). To test these alternative hypotheses, we compared food capturing kinematics and performance during suction feeding behaviors of A. guamensis and L. concolor using morphological data and high-speed video. Lentipes concolor showed both a significantly larger gape angle and faster jaw opening than A. guamensis. Geometric models calculated that despite the inverse relationship of gape size and suction pressure generation, the fast jaw motions of L. concolor allow it to achieve higher pressure differentials than A. guamensis. Such elevated suction pressure would enhance the ability of L. concolor to successfully capture food in the fast stream reaches it typically inhabits. Differences in jaw morphology may contribute to these differences in performance, as the lever ratio for jaw opening is about 10% lower in L. concolor compared with A. guamensis, suiting the jaws of L. concolor better for fast opening.

The development of eggs front single-cell stage to eclosion of second-stage juvenile was monitored at 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C. All populations completed embryogenesis in 7 days at 25 degrees C. The greatest differences among populations in time to completion of embryogenesis were observed at 20 and 35 degrees C. Results at the intermediate temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C) were similar for the three populations. The optimal temperature for embryogenesis was calculated to be 31.4 degrees C for the Population from Alabama, 28.4 degrees C for the one from Mississippi, and 37.5 degrees C for the one front South Carolina.									2	1	0	2	0	3			0022-300X			WOS:000273508900006	22661774

Health Care Choices in the United States and the Constrained Consumer: A Marketing Systems Perspective on Access and Assortment in Health Care								JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING				28	1	SI		95	101					SPR 2009	2009	One of the great American success stories of the twentieth century was the victory of medicine over disease. Its success relied on the emergence of a marketing system that delivered and managed health care. Yet, for all the success of the U.S. health care marketing system, there persists a consumption constraint of access-namely, access for whom and access to what. The purpose of this essay is to explore the effects of marketing systems on provisioning and constraining consumption and to understand the role of public policy in overcoming the constraints in marketing systems.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0743-9156			WOS:000274349500009

Consequently. considerable research efforts have been invested to develop models to predict the scattering properties of aggregates. A comprehensive understanding of the accuracy of these models is highly desirable for the users. Therefore, this study assessed two commonly-used fractal scattering models, in terms of their accuracy for predicting both the integrative scattering properties (e.g., the scattering cross section) and the angular scattering properties (e.g., the elements of the Mueller scattering matrix). The results were organized as contour plots with respect to scattering angle and aggregate size to facilitate the estimation of error introduced by these models in practical applications. Meanwhile, a direct comparison and evaluation of these models was also performed, which can potentially enable a hybrid model for better accuracy. This study was conducted under the context of scattering by soot aggregates; hence, the results are expected to be directly applicable for soot characterization by laser scattering.

The particles precipitated from titanium tetrachloride solution followed by lattice dehydroxylation using hot N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) yielded a mixed crystal phase of brookite titania with anatase as the minor phase. The mixed phase titania exhibited superior photocatalytic activities for an organic dye and hydrogen evolution from an aqueous solution under 14 W VL as compared with several other available reference titanias. The superior VL photocatalytic activity may be explained as the effective charge separation by the intercrystalline electron transport from brookite to anatase grains complemented by the strong VL absorption by the nitrogen species in NMP. The probable electron transport mechanism is illustrated. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics. [DOI: 10.1063/1.3096606]									6	0	0	1	0	6			1941-7012			WOS:000276676300002		
J	Xie, De; Biggers, Sherrill B., Jr.								Delamination Growth and Residual Strength of Compressively Loaded Sandwich Panels with Stiffness Tailored Face Sheets								JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES & MATERIALS				11	2-3			133	150		10.1177/1099636208103358			MAR-MAY 2009	2009	This study shows that a simple approach to stiffness tailoring of composite face sheets can improve the performance of sandwich panels under compressive loading when delaminations are present. The simple stiffness tailoring concept used here is to reposition of all 0 degrees material (aligned with the loading direction) into regions of certain width near the edges of the sandwich panel. This concept has been shown to improve the buckling and postbuckling performance of solid plates and to offer control of delamination growth. To evaluate this tailoring design concept in sandwich panels, numerical simulations of onset and propagation of the delamination growth were conducted with uniform face sheets and tailored face sheets. The delamination front tracing method previously developed by the authors was used to perform the delamination growth analysis. The interfacial elements, which allow the growth of the delamination front to be traced, are placed at the interface between the top face sheet and the core in the undelaminated region. They enable calculation of the strain energy release rates and application of a fracture mechanics delamination growth criterion. Gap elements were used to avoid interfacial overlap. Based on the numerical study, the improvement in the ultimate load provided by the simple stiffness tailoring concept ranges from 80% to 100%, depending on the extent of tailoring. Substantial improvements in the residual strength and stiffness, after significant delamination growth, can also be observed. Therefore, this article provides a potential design concept that can improve the damage tolerance of sandwich panels without adding weight.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1099-6362			WOS:000265219400003

There are in fact a number of good reasons for which they should be considered. Presented here are a number of applications of polymer fiber stationary phases for chemical separations. Fibers placed in columns are employed in three basic formats: staple, whole fabrics, and aligned fibers. Natural and synthetic fibers have found use in a variety of chromatographic modes including RP, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and IEC. Consistent among these examples are the ability to employ high mobile phase flow rates with minimal back pressures. The most promising applications are in the separation of macromolecules, where the mass transfer characteristics of the phases result in the ability to run at high linear velocities without penalty. This bodes well in particular for process applications.									16	1	0	10	0	17			1615-9306			WOS:000264805900002	19194974

Such structures have suffered significant damage in recent earthquakes, and wood-frame construction practices in the western United States (WUS) have improved considerably in the last 2 decades. On the other hand, little is understood about the expected performance of wood-frame structures located in the central and eastern United States (CEUS), where the seismicity is moderate compared to the WUS and construction practices seldom provide earthquake resistance. This paper examines the seismic performance of typical one- and two-story wood-frame structures in the CEUS. Six structures with two foundation types were considered, for which conditional limit state probabilities (fragilities) were evaluated considering three possible failure mechanisms: excessive interstory drift, wall uplift, and sill plate splitting. This examination shows that seismic damage to wood-frame structures in the CEUS under earthquakes of moderate intensity is unlikely to lead to loss of life, but may result in significant financial losses. An evaluation of two possible retrofit strategies illustrates how the expected seismic performance of the CEUS structures can be improved by adding more anchor bolts and perimeter sheathing nails to the shear walls.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0733-9445			WOS:000263402400006		
J	Xiao, Feipeng; Amirkhanian, Serji N.								Effects of Binders on Resilient Modulus of Rubberized Mixtures Containing RAP Using Artificial Neural Network Approach								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				37	2			129	138					MAR 2009	2009	The prediction of the resilient modulus values of rubberized mixtures containing reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) materials involves a number of interacting factors or engineering parameters (variables) and is a very complex issue. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are useful tools in place of conventional physical models for analyzing complex relationships involving multiple variables and have been successfully used in many civil engineering applications. The objective of this study was to develop a series of ANN models to simulate the resilient modulus of rubberized mixtures (ambient and cryogenic rubbers) at 5, 25, and 40 degrees C using seven input variables including material components such as rubber and RAP percentages as well as the rheological properties of modified binders (i.e., viscosity, G*sin delta, stiffness, and m-values). The sensitivity analysis and important index of each variable were performed in this study. The results indicated that ANN-based models are more effective than the regression models and can easily be implemented in a spreadsheet, thus making it easy to apply. In addition, the validation analysis of the models showed that ANN-based models might be used for other types of mixtures. Moreover, the results of the sensitivity analysis and important index of input variables in ANN models also indicated that the rheological properties of asphalt binders can be employed to predict the resilient modulus values effectively at various testing temperatures. The validation of the model also illustrates that the developed ANN can be used to predict the resilient modulus values from other research projects.									13	1	0	1	0	13			0090-3973			WOS:000263984600006

A streaming memory system is designed to enable high-throughput computation and efficient use of memory resources. Several scheduling algorithms were examined to efficiently assign network nodes to the PEs. Multiple parallel FPGA-accelerated implementations were evaluated on a Cray XD1. Networks of varying complexity were tested and indicate that hardware acceleration can provide an average throughput gain of 184 times over equivalent parallel software implementations.

A Linear-Time Algorithm for Broadcast Domination in a Tree								NETWORKS				53	2			160	169		10.1002/net.20275			MAR 2009	2009	The broadcast domination problem is a variant of the classical minimum dominating set problem in which a transmitter of power p at vertex v is capable of dominating (broadcasting to) all vertices within distance p from v. Our goal is to assign a broadcast power f(v) to every vertex v in a graph such that Sigma(v is an element of v) f(v) is minimized, and such that every vertex u with f(u) = 0 Is within distance f(v) of some vertex v with f(v) > 0. The problem is solvable in polynomial time on a general graph (Heggernes and Lokshtanov, Disc Math (2006), 3267-3280) and Blair et al. (Congr. Num. (2004), 55-77.) gave an O(n(2)) algorithm for trees. In this article, we provide an O(n) algorithm for trees. Our algorithm is notable due to the fact that it makes decisions for each vertex v based on "nonlocal" information from vertices far away from v, whereas almost all other linear-time algorithms for trees only make use of local information.

Real world beam images suffer from intensity fluctuation or other distortions, making algorithms susceptible to higher position measurement variability. Using matched filtering to identify beam positions results in greater stability of position measurement compared to centroiding techniques. However, this gain is achieved at the expense of extra processing time. This work explores the use of FPGAs to accelerate these computations. Results indicate a performance improvement of 20 times for an FPGA over a 3 GHz Pentium 4 processor. Published by Elsevier Ltd.									11	3	0	0	0	14			0030-3992			WOS:000259940800013

Effects of 6/85-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum vaccination alone at ten weeks of age or in conjunction with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum inoculation overlays at twenty-two or forty-five weeks of age on the reproductive and digestive organs of commercial egg-laying hens								POULTRY SCIENCE				88	3			567	570		10.3382/ps.2008-00394			MAR 2009	2009	Two trials were conducted to determine the effects of a prelay 6/85-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (6/85MG) vaccination alone or in conjunction with time-specific F-strain M. gallisepticum (FMG) inoculation overlays on the gross reproductive and digestive organ characteristics of commercial egg-laying hens. In each trial, the following 4 treatments were applied: 1) sham vaccination at 10 wk of age; 2) vaccination of 6/85MG at 10 wk; 3) 6/85MG at 10 wk overlaid by FMG inoculation at 22 wk; and 4) 6/85MG at 10 wk overlaid by FMG at 45 wk. Two birds per isolation pen (experimental replicate unit) were necropsied at the end of both trials to observe the effects of treatment on liver weight, liver lipid and moisture concentrations, incidence of fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome, ovary weight, mature ovarian follicle numbers, and the total and segmental weights, lengths, and histologies of the oviduct and small intestine. The applied treatments affected only liver moisture. Liver moisture content was greater in birds vaccinated with 6/85MG at 10 wk alone or in conjunction with FMG at 45 wk in comparison with sham vaccinated controls and birds that received a 6/85MG vaccination at 10 wk overlaid by an FMG inoculation at 22 wk. Prelay 6/85MG vaccinations may be a suitable substitute for prelay FMG inoculations, and FMG overlays during lay on prelay 6/85MG vaccinations may also provide continual protection against field-strain MG infections without eliciting any subsequent suppressive effects on performance, as noted in an earlier study.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0032-5791			WOS:000263563200015	19211526

Computational investigation of blast survivability and off-road performance of an up-armoured high-mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING				223	D3			301	325		10.1243/09544070JAUTO1063			MAR 2009	2009	Since ballistic and blast survivability and off-road handling and stability of military vehicles, such as the high-mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV), are two critical vehicle performance aspects, they both (including the delicate balance between them) have to be considered when a new vehicle is being designed or an existing vehicle retrofitted (e.g. up-armoured). Finite-element-based transient non-linear dynamics and multi-body longitudinal dynamics computational analyses were employed, relatively, in the present work to address the following two specific aspects of the performance of an HMMWV: first, the ability of the vehicle to survive detonation of a landmine shallow buried into sand underneath the right wheel of the vehicle and, second, the ability of the vehicle to withstand a simple straight-line brake manoeuvre during off-road travel without compromising its stability and safety of its occupants. Within the first analysis, the kinematic and structural responses (including large-scale rotation and deformation, buckling, plastic yielding, failure initiation, fracture, and fragmentation) of the HMMWV to the detonation of a landmine were analysed computationally using the general-purpose transient non-linear dynamics analysis software ABAQUS/Explicit. The second analysis was carried out using Simpack, a general-purpose multi-body dynamics program, and the main purpose of this analysis was to address the vehicle stability during the off-road travel. The same sand model was used in both types of analysis. Finally, the computational results obtained are compared with general field-test observations and data in order to judge the physical soundness and fidelity of the present approach.									15	1	0	1	0	16			0954-4070			WOS:000264414600003		
J	Shaibu, A. -B.; Cho, Byung Rae; Kovach, Jami								Development of a Censored Robust Design Model for Time-Oriented Quality Characteristics								QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL				25	2			181	197		10.1002/qre.961			MAR 2009	2009	Robust design (RD) techniques, which are based on the concept of building quality into products or processes, are increasingly popular in industry primarily because of their practicality. Traditional RD principles have often been applied to situations in which the quality characteristics of interest are time-insensitive. However, when time-oriented quality characteristics are studied, censored data often occur. As a result, current RD models reported in the literature may not be effective in finding solutions based on such data. To address such practical needs, this paper develops a censored RD model. We also propose an estimation method that is closely related to the expectation-maximization algorithm and compare it with the method of maximum likelihood estimation via a numerical example. Model validation is conducted, and comparative studies are discussed for model verification.

J	Maier, Jonathan R. A.; Fadel, Georges M.								Affordance based design: a relational theory for design								RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN				20	1			13	27		10.1007/s00163-008-0060-3			MAR 2009	2009	After reviewing current approaches to design theory, which are based on the transformative concept of function, we argue that this basis in function limits the scope of design problems and explanatory power of current design theories. As an alternative with greater potential for explanatory power and a framework for solving a wider array of design problems, we propose that a relational theory of design is needed. Such a relational theory should mirror those currently developed in mathematics, physics, computer science, and even philosophy. We develop a relational theory for design based on the concept of affordances from perceptual psychology. Affordances help to explain the entanglement between designers, users, and artifacts-relationships that are not currently handled by function based approaches to design. Affordance based design, as developed in this paper, does not offer a radical new approach to doing design, but rather a shift in design thinking. Our focus in this paper is therefore on the explanatory power and potential innovation fostered by this change in design thinking, as illustrated through several examples, and not on specific methods.									66	3	0	0	1	70			0934-9839	1435-6066		WOS:000263781400002

Preadolescent Female Development Through Sport and Physical Activity: A Case Study of an Urban After-School Program								RESEARCH QUARTERLY FOR EXERCISE AND SPORT				80	1			87	101					MAR 2009	2009	Youth development research has found that children become more engaged and benefit more from being incorporated as decision makers. Thus participation helps promote development and encourages engagement. Based in theories of engagement and five choice learning, the current research focused on a program combining sport/physical activity, life, skills, and mentoring while promoting healthy life choices for preadolescent girls of color The co-investigators, all women, conducted two 2-hr visits per week for two 12-week. periods with a group of 8 girls at a community recreation center in Hartford, Connecticut, including lessons in nutrition and life skills and participation in a sport/physical activity. Five of the girls completed every stage of data collection, including participant journals and four individual interviews with each participant and her parents, over the course of the 24 weeks. The co-investigators also kept journals throughout the program. The results reflected the following themes: self-esteem/self-worth, accountability/responsibility for self, connections to community and a sense of belonging, knowledge and acquisition of health/life skills, application of those skills, and planning and recognizing one's own influence on self and others.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0270-1367			WOS:000264775600010	19408471

"But This Story of Mine Is Not Unique": A Review of Research on African American Children's Literature								REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH				79	1			125	162		10.3102/0034654308324653			MAR 2009	2009	This article provides a review of research on African American children's literature by synthesizing the growing body of textual and reader response research conducted across the post several decades. The literature presented in this article cuts across the disciplines of education as well as English and library science. Using the selective tradition as a theoretical underpinning, the authors review extant literature through a three-pronged thematic heuristic developed as a result of their analysis. These themes present research findings related to African American children's literature as (1) contested terrain, (2) cultural artifact, and (3) literary art. The three themes generated to delineate the findings derived from a four-stage iterative process of analysis. AB, considering collective findings, a more careful and continued institutionalization of this literature can take place in schools, libraries, bookstores, popular media, and within families. The authors also address future implications for educational practice and research related to African American children's literature.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0034-6543			WOS:000263690800005

First, the formation of these SAMs on the nanopillar modified electrodes was characterized by the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques, and then the detection sensitivity of these functionalized electrodes to glucose was evaluated by the amperometry technique. Results showed that the SAM of alkanethiols with a longer chain length resulted in a higher degree of surface coverage with less defect and a higher electron transfer resistance, whereas the SAM of alkanethiols with a shorter chain length gave rise to a higher detection sensitivity to glucose. This study sheds some new insight into how to enhance the sensing performance of nanopillar modified electrodes.									20	0	0	7	0	20			1424-8220			WOS:000264572700001	22573954

We develop and test the following hypotheses: (1) those who divorce or separate experience declines in psychological well-being compared to those who remain married; (2) among those unhappy with their marriage, those who divorce or separate see improvements in psychological well-being, especially if they remarry, compared to those who remain married to the same person; (3) psychological well-being declines in the first year or two following the end of the marriage and then improves to previous levels: (4) women experience greater improvements in psychological well-being from leaving an unhappy marriage than do men. We find strong and consistent support only for the first of these. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									43	1	0	7	0	45			0049-089X			WOS:000262835300015

Rebuilding Organic Carbon Contents in Coastal Plain Soils Using Conservation Tillage Systems								SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL				73	2			622	629		10.2136/sssaj2008.0193			MAR-APR 2009	2009	Long-term disk tillage (DT) for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production in the southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain has resulted in soil organic C (SOC) content reductions. Conservation tillage (CT) management in some studies can rebuild SOC levels. A field study, with two adjacent 3.5-ha fields, both containing soil series formed in upland and depressional areas, was conducted using a 6-yr rotation of corn (Zea mays L.) and cotton to determine the CT and DT effects on SOC contents and residue characteristics returned to the soil. Annual soil samples were collected from 50 locations per field at 0- to 3- and 3- to 15-cm. After 6 yr under CT, residue accumulation promoted a significant SOC increase in the 0- to 3-cm depth in the upland soil series (about 0.7 Mg SOC ha(-1)). The lack of residue mixing in the 3- to 15-cm depth in upland Soils under CT however, resulted in a significant SOC content decline at this depth (1.25-2.51 Mg SOC ha(-1)). There was no significant SOC content change in soils under CT formed in depressional areas or in all soils under DT During 6 yr, 14.8 Mg ha(-1) of organic C from both corn and cotton residues was returned to Soils under CT but <4% was incorporated into the SOC pool. Levels of SOC in sandy upland soils can be increased at the surface after 6 yr of CT under a corn and cotton rotation, with the increase coming at the expense of an SOC decline at a deeper topsoil depth.									24	4	0	19	0	28			0361-5995			WOS:000264089300033

In this study, we examined diet of barn owls at Cold Button Lagoon in northern Belize. Pellets and prey remains were collected at roosting sites during 1997-1998. Diet was composed primarily of small mammals. Sigmodon hispidus was the most common prey in terms of frequency of occurrence and biomass, with lesser numbers of other rodents, being consumed. Similar to other reports for the Neotropics, barn owls in our study consumed relatively larger prey than conspecifics inhabiting temperate regions. Birds and amphibians were a minor component of diet.									3	0	0	5	0	5			0038-4909			WOS:000264431700017

Wireless data transmission performance in such engineering systems was known to depend greatly on sensor positions and possible relative motions with respect to the environment. Pronounced performance deterioration can occur under certain sensing conditions such as that of a rotating engineering structure monitoring system. Various studies have applied wireless sensors on rotating mechanical structures for condition monitoring, but a systematic study of their data transmission performance is still missing. This study is devoted to characterizing such performance of wireless sensors on a rotating lathe spindle and further examining the efficacy of a commonly adopted automatic repeat request (ARQ)-based reliable transmission method. The experimental measurements have shown that the transmission error rates were proportional to rotation speeds at certain receiver locations, while a minor change in the receiver location could significantly alter such dependency. It was found that the ARQ approach effectively assured a reliable data transmission during rotation with little retransmission overheads, and the reliable transmission throughput varied with different packet sizes and packet generation intervals.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1475-9217			WOS:000264157800002

Previous tissue engineering approaches to regenerate elastin in situ or within tissue engineering constructs are curtailed by innate poor elastin synthesis potential by adult vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Currently, we seek to develop cellular cues to enhance tropoelastin synthesis and improve elastin matrix yield, stability, and ultrastructure. Our earlier studies attest to the elastogenic utility of hyaluronan (HA)-based cellular cues, though their effects are fragment size dependent and dose dependent, with HA oligomers deemed most elastogenic. We presently show transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and HA oligomers, when provided concurrently, to synergistically and dramatically improve elastin matrix regeneration by adult vascular SMCs. Together, these cues suppress SMC proliferation, enhance synthesis of tropoelastin (8-fold) and matrix elastin protein (5.5-fold), and also improve matrix elastin yield (45% of total elastin vs. 10% for nonadditive controls), possibly by more efficient recruitment of tropoelastin for crosslinking. The density of desmosine crosslinks within the elastin matrix was itself attenuated, although the cues together modestly increased production and activity of the elastin crosslinking enzyme, lysyl oxidase. TGF-beta 1 and HA oligomers together induced much greater assembly of mature elastin fibers than they did separately, and did not induce matrix calcification. The present outcomes might be great utility to therapeutic regeneration of elastin matrix networks in situ within elastin-compromised vessels, and within tissue-engineered vascular graft replacements.									25	2	0	19	0	28			1937-3341			WOS:000263913900006	18847364

Here, we report the in vivo biodistribution and long-term effects of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in developing zebrafish. The fluorescent-labeled MWCNTs were introduced into zebrafish embryos at 1-cell stage and at 72 h post fertilization through microinjection. After single injection, both acute and long-term interactions between zebrafish and functionalized MWCNTs were studied. The injected FITC-BSA-MWCNTs (at 1-cell stage) were allocated to all blastoderm cells of the embryos through proliferation, and were distinctively excluded from the yolk cell. When introduced into the circulation system, FITC-BSA-MWCNTs moved easily in the compartments and finally were cleaned Out by the body at 96 h after the loading. At early stages, the treated zebrafish embryos generated immune response by accumulating circulating white blood cells at the trunk region. Under transmission electron microscope, many lysosome-like vesicles were observed in the blastoderm cells of the treated embryos. The zebrafish loaded with MWCNTs had normal primordial germ cells at early stage and produced second generation later on. However, the larvae of the second generation had obviously lower survival rates as compared to the untreated groups, suggesting a negative effect on the reproduction potential. These results suggest that extensive purification and functionalization processes can help improve the biocompatibility of CNTs. This study also indicates that purified CNTs may have long-term toxicity effects when they were delivered into the body. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The elliptocytosis was asymptomatic and was detected during the evaluation of lameness. When subjected to shear stress in an ektacytometer, the dog's erythrocytes had reduced cellular deformability and erythrocyte membranes had decreased mechanical stability. Analysis of erythrocyte membrane spectrin by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis revealed an increased amount of spectrin dimers, indicating a defect in spectrin self-association. DNA analysis detected a beta-spectrin mutation in codon 2110 in which threonine was replaced by methionine. This mutation likely altered the molecular structure of the erythrocyte membrane, leading to impaired spectrin self-association and elliptocyte formation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0275-6382			WOS:000263760100009	19228356

In this paper, we evaluate five known velocity control techniques using the same experimental settings. We compare the techniques based on the assumption that a good travel technique should be easy to learn and easy to use, should cause the user to have few collisions with the VE, should allow the user to complete tasks faster, and should promote better recollection of the environment afterwards. In our experiments, we ask twenty users to use each velocity control technique to navigate through virtual corridors while performing information-gathering tasks. In all cases, the users use pointing to indicate the direction of travel. We then measure the users' ability to recollect the information they see in the VE, as well as how much time they spend in the VE and how often they collide with the virtual walls. After each test, we use questionnaires to evaluate the ease of learning and ease of use of the velocity control technique, and the users' sense of presence in the environment. Each of the travel techniques is then evaluated based on the users' performances in the VE and the results of their questionnaires.									2	1	0	0	0	3			1359-4338			WOS:000208104100006

Recent hurricane strikes along the Gulf Coast of the United States have impacted wetland integrity in some areas and hastened the need to understand how and to what degree coastal forested wetlands confer protection by reducing the height of peak water level. In recent years. U.S. Geological Survey Gulf Coast research projects in Florida have instrumented mangrove sites with continuous water level recorders. Our ad hoc network of water level recorders documented The rise, peak, and fall of water levels (+/- 0.5 hr) from two hurricane events in 2004 and 2005. Reduction of peak water level heights from relatively in-line gages associated with one storm surge event indicated that mangrove wetlands can reduce water level height by as much as as 9.4 cm/km inland over intact. relatively unchannelized expanses. During the other event, reductions were slightly less for mangroves along a river corridor. Estimates of water level attenuation were within the range reported in the literature but erred on the conservative side. These synoptic data from single storm events indicate that intact mangroves may support a protective role in reducing maximum water level height associated with surge.									29	0	0	17	0	30			0277-5212			WOS:000265294500015

A novel distributed MCDS approximation algorithm for wireless sensor networks								WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING				9	3	SI		427	437		10.1002/wcm.547			MAR 2009	2009	Since finding the minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) in an arbitrary graph is a NP-hard problem, many algorithms have been proposed to construct an approximation of the MCDS for efficient routing in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To address the weaknesses of these existing algorithms, we propose a novel distributed MCDS approximation algorithm, CDS-HG, to construct the connected dominating set (CDS) for WSNs. This algorithm models a WSN as a hierarchical graph and uses a competition-based strategy to select nodes Lit a certain hierarchical level to route messages for nodes in the next level of the hierarchical graph. Formal analysis and simulation studies show that our CDS-HG algorithm generates smaller CDS sizes while requiring less communication overhead compared with the existing distributed MCDS approximation algorithms.

SACS samples were calcined in either air or nitrogen atmosphere under various conditions. Nitrogen incorporation of SACS titania was investigated by CHN analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All samples were also characterized by X-ray diffraction, N(2) physisorption, UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, and TEM and compared to a commercial titania powder, Degussa P25.

J	Ryu, Soung-Ryoul; Concilio, Amy; Chen, Jiquan; North, Malcolm; Ma, Siyan				Chen, Jiquan/D-1955-2009				Prescribed burning and mechanical thinning effects on belowground conditions and soil respiration in a mixed-conifer forest, California								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				257	4			1324	1332		10.1016/j.foreco.2008.11.033			FEB 20 2009	2009	Soil respiration (R-S) is a major carbon pathway from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere and is sensitive to environmental changes. Although commonly used mechanical thinning and prescribed burning can significantly alter the soil environment, the effect of these practices on R-S and on the interactions between R-S and belowground characteristics in managed forests is not sufficiently understood. We: (1) examined the effects of burning and thinning treatments on soil conditions, (2) identified any changes in the effects of soil chemical and physical properties on R-S under burning and thinning treatments, and (3) indirectly estimated the changes in the autotrophic soil respiration (RA) and heterotrophic soil respiration (RH) contribution to R-S under burning and thinning treatments. We conducted our study in the Teakettle Experimental Forest where a full factorial design was implemented with three levels of thinning, none (N), understory thinning (U), and overstory thinning (0; September to October 2000 for thin burn combination and June and July 2001 for thin only treatments) and two levels of burning, none (U) and prescribed burning (B; fall of 2001). R-S, soil temperature, soil moisture, litter depth, soil total nitrogen and carbon content, soil pH, root biomass, and root nitrogen (N) concentration were measured between June 15 and July 15, 2002 at each plot. During this period, soil respiration was measured three times at each point and averaged by point. When we assumed the uniform and even contribution of R-A and R-H to R-S in the studied ecosystem without disturbances and a linear relationship of root N content and RA, we calculated the contributions of R-A to R-S as 22,45, 53,48, and 45% in UU, UO, BN, BU, and BO, respectively. The results suggested that after thinning, Rs was controlled more by RH while after burning Rs was more influenced by RA. The least amount of Rs variation was explained by studied factors under the most severe treatment (130 treatment). Overall, root biomass, root N concentration, and root N content were significantly (p < 0.01) correlated with soil respiration with correlation coefficients of 0.37, -0.28, and 0.29, respectively. This study contributes to our understanding of how common forestry management practices might affect soil carbon sequestration, as soil respiration is a major component of ecosystem respiration.

Within the direct adhesion PMH technology, load transfer between stamped sheet-metal and injection-molded riblike plastic subcomponents is accomplished through a variety of nanometer-to-micron scale chemical and mechanical phenomena which enable direct adhesion between the two materials. The resultant adhesion strength in a 5-10 MPa range has been assessed. in the present work it has been investigated if such level of adhesion strength is sufficient to restore the component's stiffness in the cases when stiffness has been compromised by substituting a twin-shell large-thickness drawing-quality-steel design of a prototypical BIW component with a single-shell lower-thickness high-strength-steel and polymer-hybridized design of the same component. The results obtained suggest that meeting the bending stiffness requirements is the most challenging task and if such requirements do not control the overall component design, weight savings in a 2.0-2.5% range can be obtained.

In this study, steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) was utilized to estimate the average surface residence times leading to CO(2) and various hydrocarbon products in order to investigate chain growth and termination for hydrocarbon products formed on unpromoted and K- and Mn-promoted FeCuSiO(2) catalysts. The addition of K and Mn to the Fe catalyst promoted significantly the catalytic activity of Fe but did not have a significant impact on the chain growth or chain termination steps. Instead, an increase in the concentration of active Surface intermediates leading to hydrocarbon products was the primary cause for the improved catalyst activity. Chain termination was found to be relatively fast compared to chain growth for the Fe FTS catalysts with and without K and Mn promotion, as the average surface residence times of methane, ethane, ethylene, propane and propylene showed.

Estimating probabilities under the three-parameter gamma distribution using composite sampling								COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS				53	4			1099	1109		10.1016/j.csda.2008.10.005			FEB 15 2009	2009	Composite sampling may be used in industrial or environmental settings for the purpose of quality monitoring and regulation, particularly if the cost of testing samples is high relative to the cost of collecting samples. In such settings, it is often of interest to estimate the proportion of individual sampling units in the population that are above or below a given threshold value, C. We consider estimation of a proportion of the form p = P(X > C) from composite sample data, assuming that X follows a three-parameter gamma distribution. The gamma distribution is useful for modeling skewed data, which arise in many applications, and adding a shift parameter to the usual two-parameter gamma distribution also allows the analyst to model a minimum or baseline level of the response. We propose an estimator of p that is based on maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters alpha, beta, and gamma, and an associated variance estimator based on the observed information matrix. Theoretical properties of the estimator are briefly discussed, and simulation results are given to assess the performance of the estimator. We illustrate the proposed estimator using an example of composite sample data from the meat products industry. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Non-promoted and La and/or V oxide promoted Rh/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by sequential or co-impregnation methods and characterized by TEM, CO chemisorption and FT-IR. Their catalytic properties for CO hydrogenation were investigated using a differential fixed bed reactor at 230 degrees C and 1.8 atm. It was found that, compared to non-promoted Rh/SiO2, the singly promoted catalysts, Rh-La/SiO2 and Rh-V/SiO2, showed improved reactivity (3x) and better ethanol selectivities. However, the doubly promoted Rh-La-V/SiO2 catalysts exhibited even higher activity (9x) and selectivity for ethanol and other C2+ oxygenates, with the selectivity of total C2+ oxygenates >30% at these low pressure reaction conditions. The better performance of the Rh-La-V/SiO2 catalysts appears to be due to a synergistic promoting effect of the combined lanthana and vanadia additions through intimate contact with Rh. Use of just more of each promoter by itself was not able to produce the enhanced catalytic performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Comparisons are made with recent experimental data for xenon scattering from molten gallium and indium, systems for which the rare gas is heavier than the surface atoms. The good agreement with the data obtained for both time-of-flight energy-resolved spectra and for total scattered angular distributions yields an estimate of the physisorption well depths for the two systems.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0021-9606			WOS:000263408800031	19222286

With the availability of genome sequence for fellow rosid I members Populus and Medicago, we analyzed the synteny between Prunus and the three model genomes. Eight Prunus BAC sequences and map-anchored Prunus sequences were used in the comparison.Results: We found a well conserved synteny across the Prunus species - peach, plum, and apricot - and Populus using a set of homologous Prunus BACs. Conversely, we could not detect any synteny with Arabidopsis in this region. Other peach BACs also showed extensive synteny with Populus. The syntenic regions detected were up to 477 kb in Populus. Two syntenic regions between Arabidopsis and these BACs were much shorter, around 10 kb. We also found syntenic regions that are conserved between the Prunus BACs and Medicago. The array of synteny corresponded with the proposed whole genome duplication events in Populus and Medicago. Using map-anchored Prunus sequences, we detected many syntenic blocks with several gene pairs between Prunus and Populus or Arabidopsis. We observed a more complex network of synteny between Prunus-Arabidopsis, indicative of multiple genome duplication and subsequence gene loss in Arabidopsis.Conclusion: Our result shows the striking microsynteny between the Prunus BACs and the genome of Populus and Medicago. In macrosynteny analysis, more distinct Prunus regions were syntenic to Populus than to Arabidopsis.									30	0	0	29	1	31			1471-2164			WOS:000264124000001	19208249

This work developed an efficient probabilistic approach to hepatic RF ablation in order to statistically evaluate the effect of four thermal-electrical properties of liver tissue on the uncertainty of the ablation zone dimensions: thermal conductivity, specific heat, blood perfusion and electrical conductivity. A deterministic thermal-electrical finite element model of a monopolar electrode inserted in the liver was coupled with the unscented transform method in order to obtain coagulation zone confidence intervals, probability and cumulative density functions. The coagulation zone volume, diameter and length were 10.96 cm(3), 2.17 cm and 4.08 cm, respectively (P < 0.01). Furthermore, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that perfusion and thermal conductivity account for >95% of the variability in coagulation zone volume, diameter and length.									19	0	0	12	0	20			0031-9155			WOS:000262359000010	19124948

On the optimal energy harvesting from a vibration source								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				320	1-2			386	405		10.1016/j.jsv.2008.07.029			FEB 6 2009	2009	The optimization of power acquired from a piezoelectric vibration-based energy harvester which utilizes a harvesting circuit employing an inductor and a resistive load is described. The optimization problem is formulated as a nonlinear program wherein the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are stated and the resulting cases are treated. In the first part of the manuscript, the case of a purely resistive circuit is analyzed. While this configuration has received considerable attention in the literature, previous efforts have neglected the effect of clamping on the optimal parameters. Here, we explore the impact of damping on power optimality and illustrate its quantitative and qualitative effects. Further, we analyze the effect of electromechanical coupling demonstrating that the harvested power decreases beyond all optimal coupling coefficient. This result challenges previous literature suggesting that higher coupling coefficients always Culminate in more efficient energy harvesters. In the second part of this work. the effect of adding an inductor to the circuit is examined. It is demonstrated that the addition of the inductor provides substantial improvement to the performance of the energy harvesting device. It is also shown that within realistic values of the coupling coefficient, the optimal harvested power is independent of the coupling coefficient; a result that supports previous findings for the purely resistive circuit.

However, the role of CAR as a basal regulator of CYP expression nor its role in sexually dimorphic responses have been thoroughly studied. We investigated basal regulation and sexually dimorphic regulation and induction by the potent CAR activator TCPOBOP and the moderate CAR activator Nonylphenol (NP). NP is an environmental estrogen and one of the most commonly found environmental toxicants in Europe and the United States. Previous studies have demonstrated that NP induces several CYPs in a sexually dimorphic manner, however the role of CAR in regulating NP-mediated sexually dimorphic P450 expression and induction has not been elucidated. Therefore, wild-type and CAR-null mate and female mice were treated with honey as a carrier, NP, or TCPOBOP and CYP expression monitored by QPCR and Western blotting. CAR basally regulates the expression of Cyp2c29, Cyp2b13, and potentially Cyp2b10 as demonstrated by QPCR. Furthermore, we observed a shift in the testosterone 6 alpha/15 alpha-hydroxylase ratio in untreated CAR-null female mice to the male pattern, which indicates an alteration in androgen status and suggests a role for androgens as CAR inverse agonists. Xenobiotic-treatments with NP and TCPOBOP induced Cyp2b10, Cyp2c29, and Cyp3a11 in a CAR-mediated fashion; however NP only induced these CYPs in females and TCPOBOP induced these CYPs in both males and females. Interestingly, Cyp2a4, was only induced in wild-type male mice by TCPOBOP suggesting Cyp2a4 induction is not sensitive to CAR-mediated induction in females. Overall, TCPOBOP and NP show similar CYP induction profiles in females, but widely different profiles in males potentially related to lower sensitivity of males to either indirect or moderate CAR activators such as NP. In summary, CAR regulates the basal and chemically inducible expression of several sexually dimorphic xenobiotic metabolizing P450s in a manner that varies depending on the ligand.

On Spatiochromatic Visual Sensitivity and Peripheral Color LOD Management								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED PERCEPTION				6	2					9	10.1145/1498700.1498703			FEB 2009	2009	Empirical findings from a gaze-contingent color degradation study report the effects of artificial reduction of the human visual system's sensitivity to peripheral chromaticity on visual search performance. To our knowledge, this is the first such investigation of peripheral color reduction. For unimpeded performance, results suggest that, unlike spatiotemporal content, peripheral chromaticity cannot be reduced within the central 20 degrees visual angle. Somewhat analogous to dark adaptation, reduction of peripheral color tends to simulate scotopic viewing conditions. This holds significant implications for chromatic Level Of Detail management. Specifically, while peripheral spatiotemporal detail can be attenuated without affecting visual search, often dramatically (e. g., spatial detail can be so reduced up to 50% at about 5 degrees), peripheral chromatic reduction is likely to be noticed much sooner. Therefore, color LOD reduction (e. g., via compression), should be maintained isotropically across the central 20 degrees visual field.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1544-3558			WOS:000266438000003		
J	Kothapalli, Chandrasekhar R.; Ramamurthi, Anand								Copper nanoparticle cues for biomimetic cellular assembly of crosslinked elastin fibers								ACTA BIOMATERIALIA				5	2			541	553		10.1016/j.actbio.2008.09.004			FEB 2009	2009	Elastin, a structural protein distributed in the extracellular matrix of vascular tissues, is critical to maintaining the elastic stability and mechanical properties of blood vessels, as well as regulating cell-signaling pathways involved in vascular injury response and morphogenesis. Pathological degradation of vascular elastin or its malformation within native vessels and the poor ability to tissue-engineer elastin-rich vascular replacements due to innately poor elastin synthesis by adult vascular cells can compromise vascular homeostasis, and must thus be addressed. Our recent studies attest to the utility of hyaluronan (HA) oligomers for elastin synthesis and organization by adult vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), though the elastin matrix yields in these cases were quite low relative to total elastin produced. Thus, in this study, we investigated the utility of copper (Cu(2+)) ions to enhance cellular elastin deposition, crosslinking and maturation into structural fibers. Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs; 80-100 nm) in the dose range of 1-100 ng ml(-1) were tested for Cu(2+) ion release, and based on mathematical modeling of their release profiles, CuNPs (1, 10, and 400 ng ml(-1)) were chosen for supplementation to adult SMC cultures. The 400 ng ml(-1) dose of CuNPs cumulatively delivered Cu(2+) doses in the range of 0.1 M, over the 21 day culture period. It was observed that while exogenous CuNP supplements do not up-regulate tropoelastin production by vascular SMCs, they promoted formation of crosslinked elastin matrices. The deposition of crosslinked matrix elastin was further improved by the additional presence of HA oligomers in these cultures. Immunofluorescence imaging and structural analysis of the isolated elastin matrices indicate that amorphous elastin clumps were formed within non-additive control cultures, while aggregating elastin fibrils were observed within SMC cultures treated with CuNPs (1-10 ng ml(-1)) alone or together with HA oligomers. The presence of 400 ng ml(-1) of CuNPs concurrent with HA oligomers furthered aggregation of these elastin fibrils into mature fibers with diameters ranging from 200 to 500 nm. Ultrastructural analysis of elastin matrix within cultures treated with HA oligomers and 400 ng ml(-1) of CuNPs suggest that elastin matrix deposition as stimulated by Cu(2+) ions proceeds via a fibrillin-mediated assembly process, with enhanced crosslinking occurring via stimulation of lysyl oxidase. Overall, the data suggest that CuNPs and HA oligomers are highly useful for regenerating crosslinked, fibrillar elastin matrices by adult vascular SMCs. These results have immense utility in tissue-engineering vascular replacements. (c) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Exercised mares were worked daily for 30 min under average ambient conditions of >30 degrees C and >50% humidity. Mares were inseminated during estrus and subjected to uterine flush for embryo recovery on d 7 after ovulation for two consecutive cycles. After this, mares were allocated to the opposite group and allowed an estrous cycle without reproductive manipulation; then insemination and uterine flushing were conducted on two more consecutive cycles. Prostaglandin F(2 alpha) was administered on the day of uterine flush. Mare rectal temperature increased during exercise from a mean of 38 degrees C to a mean of 39.9 degrees C. Mares had ovulations from smaller follicles when exercised than they did under control conditions (39.8 +/- 0.5 compared with 41.5 +/- 0.5 mm diameter; P<0.05), and had an increased time from PGF(2 alpha) administration to subsequent ovulation (8.47 +/- 0.337 compared with 9.27 +/- 0.294 d; P < 0.05). Embryo recovery from control mares was 22 of 35 (63%). Fewer embryos were recovered from exercised mares (11 of 32, 34%; P < 0.05). The proportion of embryos classified as Grade I tended to be less in exercised than in non-exercised mares (4 of 11, 36% compared with 16 of 22, 73%; P=0.051). These data indicate that exercising mares in a hot and humid environment are associated with changes in ovarian follicle development and ovulation, and a reduction in embryo recovery.

To develop this SRM T, we have conducted an international round-robin measurement survey of two candidate materials-undoped Bi(2)Te(3) and constantan (55% Cu and 45% Ni alloy). Measurements were performed in two rounds by twelve laboratories involved in active thermoelectric research using a number of commercial and custom-built measurement systems and techniques. We report the results of these measurements and the statistical analysis performed. Based on this extensive study, we have selected Bi(2)Te(3) as the prototype standard material.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0947-8396			WOS:000261257100003

A novel flow visualization technique based on photodissociation spectroscopy (PDS) is described, demonstrated, and assessed in this paper. This technique is centered around the creative use of photodissociation (PD). A PD precursor is seeded in the flow of interest, either passive or reactive. A laser pulse is then generated to completely and rapidly photodissociate both the precursor and the products formed from the precursor (if it reacts) into photofragments. A target photofragment is then imaged to obtain multidimensional information about the flow. An analytical methodology was developed to assess the feasibility of the PDS-based technique. This analytical method was applied to the case where molecular iodine was used as an example PD precursor, and the results were validated by experimental data. Both the analytical and experimental findings provided a promising outlook for this new technique as a practical (low visualization technique. With a properly chosen PD precursor, the PDS-based technique provides an attractive alternative for imaging several critical flow properties, including the mixture fraction and temperature field. This technique shares some key advantages with established techniques, e.g., a high spatial and temporal resolution comparable to the planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique. Meanwhile, this technique offers several unique advantages to overcome the limitations of existing techniques, including enhancing the signal level and simplifying the interpretation of the signal.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0003-7028			WOS:000263491100009	19215650

Two important design considerations in the development of such devices for in vivo diagnostics are discussed; the utility of micro-disc electrode arrays (MDEAs) for electrochemical biosensing and the application of biomimetic, bioactive poly(HEMA)-based hydrogel composites for implant biocompatibility. A poly(HEMA)-based hydrogel membrane containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) was UV cross-linked with tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate following application to MDEAs (50 mu m discs) and to 250 mu m diameter gold electrodes within 8-well culture ware. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the MDEAs revealed a reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient of ferrocenemonocarboxylic acid (FcCO(2)H), from 6.68 x 10(-5) to 6.74 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s for the uncoated and 6 mu m thick hydrogel coated devices, respectively. Single frequency (4 kHz) temporal impedance measurements of the hydrogels in the 8-well culture ware showed a reversible 5% change in the absolute impedance of the hydrogels when exposed to a pH change between 6.1 to 7.2 and a 20% drop between pH 6.1 and 8.8.									32	1	0	9	0	32			1387-2176			WOS:000263114000011	18679800	
J	Hutson, Kevin R.; Shier, Douglas R.								Extended dominance and a stochastic shortest path problem								COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH				36	2			584	596		10.1016/j.cor.2007.10.016			FEB 2009	2009	In the context of stochastic networks, we study the problem of finding a path P that combines in a reasonable way the mean m(P) and variance upsilon(P) of its length. Specifically we study a separable objective function that combines these two path measures: namely, z(P)= f(m(P))+g(upsilon(P)), where f is an increasing convex function and g is an increasing concave function. A new type of dominance (e-dominance), stronger than the standard form of dominance, is then introduced, and it is shown to satisfy a certain form of Bellman's optimality principle. This means that it is possible to modify existing label-setting and label-correcting methods by using e-dominance, and without sacrificing optimality. Computational experience with these enhanced labeling algorithms has been promising. Test results for a variety of sample problems show that the e-dominance criterion can often significantly reduce the number of nondominated path vectors, compared to the standard dominance criterion. We observe a consequent reduction in both computation time and storage requirements. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Relation of mechanical properties of recycled aged CRM mixtures with binder molecular size distribution								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				23	2			997	1004		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.05.016			FEB 2009	2009	This paper presents an experimental analysis of the relationship between molecular sizes of mixed rubberized binders (aged rubberized binders + virgin rubberized binders) and the engineering properties of recycled aged rubberized mixtures. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was utilized to characterize the molecular size change of rubberized binders depending on three aging levels and four long-term aged (LTA) binder percentages. Rubberized mixtures were artificially long-term aged in the laboratory, and the aged rubberized mixtures were recycled at 0%, 15%, 25%, and 35% (by weight of total mixture) using typical recycling guildelines. Samples of laboratory-prepared recycled aged rubberized mixtures were tested for indirect tensile strength (ITS) in dry and wet states, rutting resistance, resilient modulus, and ITS after long-term aging in the laboratory. In general, the results indicated that the compositional changes of mixed rubberized binders have good correlations with the engineering properties of recycled aged rubberized mixtures, except for the resilient modulus.

The objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate the engineering properties of crumb rubber size and type influences on reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) mixtures. The experimental design for this study included the use of three rubber sizes and two rubber types (ambient or cryogenic) in the mixture containing 25% RAP mixtures. In this study, the results of the experiments indicated that the addition of crumb rubber was helpful in increasing the voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) in Superpave mix design and improving rutting resistance of mixture regardless of rubber size and type. On the other indirect tensile strength (ITS) values show no significant difference for mixtures made with three hand, type rubber sizes. However, the increase of rubber size, regardless of rubber type, reduced the resilient modulus values but extended the fatigue life of the modified mixtures. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We used laboratory-based experiments to investigate whether fungal genotype influences an herbivore and its parasitoid. We tested whether variation in novel isolates, plus a control lacking fungal infection, affected preference by fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae: Amphipyrini), and growth and survival of Euplectrus comstockii Howard (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae: Euplectrini), a parasitoid of fall armyworm. Caterpillars preferred leaf blades in choice experiments from uninfected tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh., cultivar Jesup (Poaceae)] and tended to avoid blades from plants containing fungal isolates AR502, AR542, or the most common strain from pastures in Georgia, USA, in tall fescue. However, caterpillars fed as much on leaf blades from plants containing isolate AR502 as from those lacking infection. Parasitoid pupal mass was not influenced by fungal isolate, yet fungal isolate did influence parasitoid survival. Survival was higher than expected for parasitoids reared from hosts fed plants lacking fungal infection, but was lower than expected for those reared from hosts fed plants infected with the common strain or AR542 isolates. In contrast, parasitoids reared from hosts fed plants infected with isolate AR502 did not experience higher mortality than expected by chance. Our results show that N. coenophialum can modify bottom-up trophic cascades through direct effects on herbivores, as well as indirect effects on a natural enemy of the herbivores and that the fungus may influence the tritrophic interaction in ways that counterbalance herbivore protection provided by the symbiont. Our work also shows that these effects are influenced by fungal genotype. As attempts are made to produce forage cultivars with strains of fungal endophyte that lack negative influences on livestock, it will be prudent for investigators to assess the multi-trophic effects of these novel associations within agroecosystems.									11	2	0	12	0	13			0013-8703			WOS:000262314600006

Motivated by these shortfalls, a Lyapunov-based control strategy is proposed in this article for simultaneous multiple-axis tracking control of piezo-flexural stages. A double-axis stage is considered for system analysis and controller validation. Hysteresis and coupling nonlinearities are studied through a number of experiments, and it is demonstrated that the widely used proportional-integral (PI) controller lacks accuracy in high-frequency tracking. Adopting the variable structure control method, a robust adaptive controller is then derived with its stability guaranteed through the Lyapunov criterion. It is shown that a parallelogram-type zone of attraction can be explicitly formed for the closed-loop system to which the error phase trajectory converges. Practical implementation of the controller demonstrates effective double-axis tracking control of the stage in the presence of hysteresis and coupling nonlinearities and despite parametric uncertainties for low-and highfrequency trajectories. Moreover, good agreements are achieved between the experiments and theoretical developments.									91	2	1	0	0	94			1083-4435			WOS:000263534400002

The properties and performance of the high-rate IEEE CCK 802.11b) modulation formats are investigated and compared with the properties and performance of alternative modulation formats that are based on biorthogonal signals. Several complementary properties are derived for the full-rate (11 Mb/s) CCK signal set, the half-rate (5.5 Mb/s) CCK signal set, a full-rate signal set obtained from biorthogonal signals, and a half-rate biorthogonal signal set. Each signal set is a complementary set, but each also has stronger complementary properties. We evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.11b standard CCK modulation, CCK with certain modifications that depart from the IEEE standard, and modulation that is derived from biorthogonal signals. Performance comparisons are presented for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and for channels with specular multipath. In particular, for AWGN channels, we provide an accurate analytical approximation for the frame error probability for full-rate CCK modulation.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0090-6778	1558-0857		WOS:000263298200022

Rotating machinery laboratories assist with the visualization of the three-dimensional and rotating equipment. Contemporary use of rotating machines in industry often includes adjustable speed drives and digital controllers. Additionally, instrumentation is used to feedback electrical and mechanical variables to the drives and controls. Using an equipment grant from an industrial automation manufacturer, cost-effective laboratory workstations have been developed. Industrial-grade equipment is not designed for student experimentation but was adapted for this use. The workstations described in this paper incorporate modern power electronic-based drives and motors, electrical and mechanical sensors, and a computer-based control system with data acquisition. The advantages of these workstations include cost-effectiveness and the use of actual industrial devices that students might encounter in industry. Additionally, the workstations can be accessed by remote users, enabling off-campus students to also perform experiments on the workstations. The paper includes details of the workstation and its components, the data acquisition and control system, and sample experimental results.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0885-8950			WOS:000262817200001

The ability to tune the steering system's dynamic behavior can potentially enhance the driver's overall performance and increase the vehicle's safety. A nonlinear tracking controller is designed to ensure that the directional control steering assembly follows the operator's commanded maneuvers at the driver interface. In addition, the controller provides the driver with tunable force feedback proportional to the reaction forces at the tire-road interface. Two control techniques are provided to guarantee that the corresponding tracking errors are asymptotically forced to zero. The first compensates for parametric uncertainty, whereas the second eliminates the need for torque measurements through the use of observers. Representative numerical and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the controller's performance for various driving scenarios.									24	0	0	1	0	24			0018-9545	1939-9359		WOS:000263639300004

As part of the ongoing development of genomic resources for this model organism, we have constructed a publicly available bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from males of a field-derived colony. We have shown that this library has a high coverage, which allows any particular sequence to be retrieved from at least one clone with a probability of 99.7%. We have further demonstrated the library's usefulness by successfully screening it with probes derived both from previously described B. terrestris genes and candidate genes from another bumblebee species and the honeybee. This library will facilitate genomic studies in B. terrestris and will allow for novel comparative studies in the social Hymenoptera.									7	2	0	8	0	9			0020-1812			WOS:000263300700008

Rassf3 is responsible in part for resistance to mammary tumor development in neu transgenic mice								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY				34	2			517	528		10.3892/ijo_00000177			FEB 2009	2009	MMTV/neu transgenic mouse line is a well-documented model for studying HER2/neu-related breast cancer. Approximately 80% of these mice develop mammary tumors by 11 months of age, whereas a small percentage appears to have naturally acquired resistance to HER2/neu tumorigenesis. To identify factors responsible for tumor resistance in these transgenic mice, comparative genetic profiling was used to screen alterations in gene expression in the mammary gland. A novel gone, the RAS association domain (Ra1GDS/A-F-6) family 3 (Rassf3), which belongs to a family of RAS effectors and tumor suppressor genes, was identified. Data indicated 1) that Rassf3 is overexpressed in mammary gland of tumor-resistant MMTV/neu mice compared to tumor-susceptible MMTV/neu littermates or non-transgenic mice, and 2) Rassf3 is significantly up-regulated in neu-specific mouse mammary tumors compared to adjacent normal tissues. In vitro overexpression of RASSF3 inhibited cell proliferation in HER2/neu positive human and mouse breast cancer cell lines, possibly through induction of apoptosis. A novel MMTV/Rassf3-neu bi-transgenic mouse line, overexpressing Rassf3 and neu genes in mammary glands, was established. Mammary tumor incidence in bi-transgenic mice was delayed compared to their MMTV/neu(+/-) littermates. These data suggest that Rassf3 may influence mammary tumor incidence in MMTV/neu transgenic mice.									13	0	0	12	0	14			1019-6439			WOS:000262619500027	19148488

In experiment 1, eight subjects dipped crackers either three or six times into sterilized water either without biting or biting before each dip. The dipping solutions had higher (P <= 0.05) bacterial populations when crackers were bitten before dipping compared with when no double-dipping occurred. The second experiment utilized sterile water dipping solutions with pHs of 4, 5 and 6, and tested the solutions at 0 and 2 h after dipping. There was again significant (P <= 0.05) bacterial transfer due to biting then dipping; however, the pH 4 dipping solution had initially lower bacterial populations than the higher pH solutions and even lower populations after 2 h. In the third experiment, three dipping solutions (salsa, chocolate sauce and cheese) were tested, and higher initial populations (P <= 0.05) were transferred to the salsa compared with chocolate and cheese; however, the salsa had lower levels of bacteria after 2 h of hold time at room temperature. Three experiments determined that the bacterial population of food dips increased due to the practice of "double-dipping," and that dip type can influence the dip's bacterial population.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0149-6085			WOS:000262670800004

Our nonparametric cross-section estimates of ex post long-run treatment effects are much more stable across years and have more economically plausible values than corresponding OLS cross-section estimates from typical gravity equations. We provide plausible estimates of the long-run effects of membership in the original European Economic Community (EEC) and the Central American Common Market (CACM) between 1960 and 2000 and the estimates confirm anecdotal reports of these agreements' effectiveness.

Using the conventional actuation methods such as base excitation, the ratio of stiffness over the layer mass per unit length affects the resonant frequencies of the system as a single parameter. However, due to the tip/sample elastic contact in PFM, these two parameters can be separately identified using the frequency shifts before and after attaching the layer. The concept is theoretically proven here using the modal analysis of the system. For practical verification, three gold-coated AFM microcantilevers, well suited for PFM application, were primarily tested for their initial resonant frequencies using a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) piezoelectric sample. The focused ion beam (FIB) technique was then employed to deposit thin layers of Pt-based material in different configurations on the cantilevers' surfaces. The microcantilevers were then reexamined for their new resonances, and the properties of the deposits were identified using a robust system identification procedure. Results indicate acceptable estimation of the cantilevers' added mass and stiffness, making the technique suitable for detection of elastically distributed biological species. The framework proposed here can serve as an alternative approach for precise characterization of the solutions containing biomolecules (e. g., unknown DNA), their assemblies or small organisms.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0960-1317			WOS:000262786300017

Molecular orientation evolution during low-density polyethylene blown film extrusion using real-ime Raman spectroscopy								JOURNAL OF RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY				40	2			212	217		10.1002/jrs.2112			FEB 2009	2009	Real-time polarized Raman spectroscopy was used in this study to measure the molecular orientation evolution during blown film extrusion of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Spectra were obtained at different locations along the blown film line, starting from the molten state near the die and extending up to the solidified state near the nip rolls. The trans C-C symmetrical stretching vibration of polyethylene (PE) at 1132 cm(-1) was analyzed for films possessing uniaxial symmetry. For the given peak, the principal axis of the Raman tensor is coincident with the c-axis of the orthorhombic crystal, and was used to solve a set of intensity ratio equations to obtain second (< P(2)(cos theta)>) and fourth (< P(4)(cos theta)>) moments of the orientation distribution function. The orientation parameters (P(2), P(4)) were found to increase along the axial distance in the film line even past the frost-line height (FLH). The P(2) values also showed an increasing trend with crystalline evolution during extrusion, consistent with past observations that molecular orientation takes place even after the blown film diameter is locked into place. it was also found that the integral ratio (I(1132)/I(1064)) obtained from a single, ZZ-back-scattered mode can provide a reasonable estimate of molecular orientation. These results indicate the potential of real-time Raman spectroscopy as a rapid microstructure monitoring tool for better process control during blown film extrusion.

A national sample of 1,753 young adults completed structured telephone interviews measuring violence exposure, mental health diagnoses, and loss of a family member or close friend to a drunk driving accident (vehicular homicide) or murder (criminal homicide). The prevalence of homicide survivorship was 15%. African Americans were more highly represented among criminal homicide survivors. Logistic regression analyses found that homicide survivors were at risk for past year posttraumatic stress disorder (OR = 1.88), major depressive episode (OR= 1.64), and drug abuse/dependence (OR= 1.77). These findings highlight the significant mental health needs of homicide survivors.									22	0	0	3	0	22			0894-9867			WOS:000263888500004	19230006

We solved the crystal structures of Thermotoga maritima EndoV in complex with a hypoxanthine lesion substrate and with product DNA. The PYIP wedge motif acts as a minor groove-damage sensor for helical distortions and base mismatches and separates DNA strands at the lesion. EndoV incises DNA with an unusual offset nick 1 nucleotide 3' of the lesion, as the deaminated adenine is rotated similar to 90 degrees into a recognition pocket similar to 8 angstrom from the catalytic site. Tight binding by the lesion-recognition pocket in addition to Mg(2+) and hydrogen-bonding interactions to the DNA ends stabilize the product complex, suggesting an orderly recruitment of downstream proteins in this base-repair pathway.									48	0	0	40	0	49			1545-9985			WOS:000263286600009	19136958

Sound production in Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus and its role in escape during predatory attack by Octopus briareus								NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH				43	1			3	13					FEB 2009	2009	The production of sound (commonly called stridulation) in spiny lobsters when disturbed by humans is well documented but its function during encounters with natural predators remains largely undocumented. Caribbean spiny lobsters Panulirus argus stridulate during tailflip escape attempts in response to grasping of the carapace or antennae by human divers. We hypothesised that stridulating may be effective against predators like octopus which grasp the carapace and antennae during attacks in a way similar to human divers. In this study, we examined defensive sound production during,nighttime encounters with Caribbean reef octopus Octopus briareus to determine how P. argus use stridulation and whether it improves survival. In staged nighttime encounters with octopus, lobsters stridulated both during grasping attacks by octopus and after being captured and restrained. Stridulating lobsters escaped from attacking octopuses more frequently and remained uncaptured longer during encounters than experimentally muted individuals. We discuss ecological and evolutionary implications for these data in lobster species that produce sounds when grasped.					8th International Conference and Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management8th International Conference and Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management	SEP, 2007SEP, 2007		Charlottetown, CANADACharlottetown, CANADA	20	0	0	19	0	20			0028-8330			WOS:000265720000002

NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH				43	1			313	325					FEB 2009	2009	Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, are highly social and can detect and respond to the odour cues of conspecifics. We used a laboratory and a field experiment to test the hypothesis that lobster postlarvae can detect conspecific cues and use this information during settlement. First, using a Y-maze choice test, we found that more postlarvae oriented towards than away from conspecifics but these results were not statistically significant. Second, we manipulated the density of large benthic juvenile lobsters at eight locations in Florida Bay to test if the settlement of postlarvae or post-settlement survival was influenced by conspecific density. Microwire-tagged juveniles (controlled settlement) were added to all sites in equal density to estimate growth and rates of natural settlement. In subsequent months, density of these tagged juveniles did not vary between treatment and control sites; however, the density of untagged juveniles (natural settlement) was higher at treatment sites. Finally, multiple regression models of postlarval supply, macroalgal cover, shelter density, predator density, and large juvenile density on settlement cohorts found that the density of large juveniles at the time of settlement predicted the density of early juveniles 4 months later. Taken together, our laboratory and field results suggest that postlarval settlement may be influenced by the density of conspecifics.					8th International Conference and Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management8th International Conference and Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management	SEP, 2007SEP, 2007		Charlottetown, CANADACharlottetown, CANADA	4	0	0	4	0	4			0028-8330			WOS:000265720000028		
J	Macauley, Matthew; Mortveit, Henning S.								Cycle equivalence of graph dynamical systems								NONLINEARITY				22	2			421	436		10.1088/0951-7715/22/2/010			FEB 2009	2009	Graph dynamical systems (GDSs) generalize concepts such as cellular automata and Boolean networks and can describe a wide range of distributed, nonlinear phenomena. Two GDSs are cycle equivalent if their periodic orbits are isomorphic as directed graphs, which captures the notion of having comparable long-term dynamics. In this paper, we study cycle equivalence of GDSs in which the vertex functions are applied sequentially through an update sequence. The main result is a general characterization of cycle equivalence based on the underlying graph Y and the update sequences. We construct and analyse two graphs C(Y) and D(Y) whose connected components contain update sequences that induce cycle equivalent dynamical system maps. The number of components in these graphs, denoted kappa(Y) and delta( Y), bound the number of possible long-term behaviour that can be generated by varying the update sequence. We give a recursion relation for kappa(Y) which in turn allows us to enumerate delta(Y). The components of C(Y) and D(Y) characterize dynamical neutrality, their sizes represent structural stability of periodic orbits and the number of components can be viewed as a system complexity measure. We conclude with a computational result demonstrating the impact on complexity that results when passing from radius-1 to radius-2 rules in asynchronous cellular automata.									9	0	0	1	0	9			0951-7715			WOS:000262584500010

For the K(+) ions, incident energies of 25 eV to I keV were used to obtain energy-resolved spectra of scattered ions at 0(i) = 0(f) = 45 degrees. These results are compared to the classical trajectory simulation SAFARI and show features indicative of light atom-surface scattering where sequential binary collisions can describe the observed energy loss spectra. Energy-resolved spectra obtained for Cs(+) ions at incident energies of 75 eV and 200 eV also show features consistent with binary collisions. However, for this heavy atom-surface scattering system, the dominant trajectory type involves at least two surface atoms, as large angular deflections are not classically allowed for any single scattering event. In addition, a significant deviation from the classical double-collision prediction is observed for incident energies around 100 eV, and molecular dynamics studies are proposed to investigate the role of collective lattice effects. Data are also presented for the scattering of K(+) ions from a Schottky diode structure, which is a prototype device for the development of active targets to probe energy loss at a surface.

Alkali metal (Na, K) hydrothermal treatments were performed on micro-sized Pb0.75Sn0.25Te particles. After treatment numerous nanorods with diameters of similar to 20 nm and lengths of up to 200 nm were found uniformly embedded onto the surface of bulk particles. These nanorods contained surface that were subsequently transformed into nanosized fractal granular grain boundaries upon hot pressing of the treated Pb0.75Sn0.25Te bulk particles. The presence of this nanoscaled grain boundary results in an improvement of the ratio of the electrical conductivity to the thermal conductivity, via significantly reducing the lattice thermal conductivity while without appreciably affecting the Seebeck coefficient or the electrical resistivity. As as result, a thermoelectric figure of merit Z similar to 1.1 x 10(-3) K-1 (similar to 0.8 x 10(-3) K-1) is obtained in Na (K) processed samples at similar to 425 K (475 K), which is notably improved from Z similar to 0.7 x 10(-3) K-1 at similar to 490 K in a bulk reference sample. The present work provides a new and novel avenue by which the lattice thermal conductivity of a polycrystalline system can be essentially decoupled' from the electronic properties and thus independently 'tuned' via controlling the micro-morphology of the inter-grain boundary.

When dehydration occurs, the cytoplasm condenses and intracellular components become more crowded, providing an environment amenable to numerous undesirable interactions that can lead to protein aggregation, denaturation and organellecell membrane fusion. Acquisition of desiccation tolerance, or the ability to withstand these very low water potentials and consequent molecular crowding, has been correlated with the accumulation of various protective compounds including proteins and sugars. Among these are the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, a diverse class of highly abundant, heat-stable proteins that accumulate late in embryo maturation coincident with the acquisition of desiccation tolerance. Previous work led us to hypothesize that the protein ATEM6, one of the two Arabidopsis thaliana group 1 LEA proteins, is involved in regulating the rate at which water is lost from the maturing embryo; homozygous atem6-1 mutants display premature dehydration of seeds at the distal end of the silique. Here we demonstrate that rehydrated, mature seeds from atem6-1 mutant plants lose more water during subsequent air drying than wild-type seeds, consistent with a role for ATEM6 protein in water bindingloss during embryo maturation. In addition, and possibly as a result of premature dehydration, mutant seeds along the entire length of the silique acquire desiccation tolerance earlier than their wild-type counterparts. We further demonstrate precocious, and perhaps elevated, expression of the other A. thaliana group 1 LEA protein, ATEM1, that may compensate for loss or ATEM6 expression. However, this observation could also be consistent with acceleration of the entire normal maturation program in atem6-1 mutant embryos. Interestingly, ATEM6 protein does not appear to be required in mature seeds for viability or efficient germination.									28	2	0	29	3	33			0032-0781			WOS:000263424300006	19073649

A review of different perspectives on uncertainty and risk and an alternative modeling paradigm								RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY				94	2			558	567		10.1016/j.ress.2008.06.004			FEB 2009	2009	The literature in economics, finance, operations research, engineering and in general mathematics is first reviewed on the subject of defining uncertainty and risk. The review goes back to 1901. Different perspectives on uncertainty and risk are examined and a new paradigm to model uncertainty and risk is proposed using relevant ideas from this study. This new paradigm is used to represent, aggregate and propagate uncertainty and interpret the resulting variability in a challenge problem developed by Oberkampf et al. [2004, Challenge problems: uncertainty in system response given uncertain parameters. Reliab Eng Syst Safety 2004; 85(l): 11-9]. The challenge problem is further extended into a decision problem that is treated within a multicriteria decision making framework to illustrate how the new paradigm yields optimal decisions under uncertainty. The accompanying risk is defined as the probability of an unsatisfactory system response quantified by a random function of the uncertainty. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Potency is team members' collective belief that the team can be effective. In a field study of 39 work teams in six organizations, the authors find a positive relationship between organizational support and potency that is mediated by effective team processes. The authors also find a positive relationship between team processes and managers' ratings of team performance that is mediated by potency. Understanding how organizational support affects potency is important because research has consistently found that potency is strongly associated with team performance, yet little is known about how organizational context affects potency. Therefore, this research has practical as well as theoretical implications.									18	0	0	0	3	20			1046-4964			WOS:000262083800004

SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH				90	3			339	349		10.1007/s11205-008-9267-y			FEB 2009	2009	Recent attention to children's well being has generated research showing that safety and home-school relations are two of the most important indicators of children's well being. Recent studies have also demonstrated the consistent differences in perspectives between children and teachers and between parents and teachers in regard to home-school relations and between children and parents in regard to children safety. This paper reports findings from an exploratory study, conducted as part of the "Strong Communities" initiative in South Carolina, comparing between the three perspectives of children, parents, and teachers in regard to children both home-school relations and safety. The findings show significant differences regarding almost all items between the three groups. For example, teachers felt school and the way to and back from school were safer for children than how the children themselves felt. However, other patterns were found with regard to home-school relations. The article concludes with a discussion of the apparent weight given to each of these perspectives, possible explanations for the gaps found and its practical implications for social indicators usage.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0303-8300			WOS:000261037400001

Page-by-page progression through the survey is modeled as a survival process with early termination seen as failure. While images had no apparent effect on the termination process, respondent interest in the survey topic was linked to early termination. These results highlight the importance of placing interest-related questions early in the survey to better control for the effects of interest-driven attrition. Moreover, these findings suggest that an interactional information system approach, one that not only collects data but also pushes relevant information to respondents, may serve to generate or maintain interest and in the process reduce survey attrition.									12	0	0	0	1	13			0049-1241			WOS:000263482500004

Here, the Youd et al. (2001) method, a deterministic model for liquefaction triggering evaluation, is examined for its model uncertainty. The procedure for evaluating this model uncertainty involves two steps: 1) deriving a Bayesian mapping function based on a database of case histories, and 2) using the calibrated Bayesian mapping function as a reference to back-figure the uncertainty of the model. Details of the developed procedure within the framework of the first-order reliability method (FORM) are presented. Using FORM with the calibrated model uncertainty, the probability of liquefaction can be readily determined, and thus, the results presented in this paper extend the use of the Youd et al. (2001) method.									6	0	0	2	0	7			0038-0806			WOS:000265325700010

Influence and Effectiveness of Financial Incentive Programs in Promoting Sustainable Forestry in the South								SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY				33	1			35	41					FEB 2009	2009	State forestry officials responsible for forestry incentive programs in each of the 13 southern states were surveyed concerning their opinions on financial incentive programs available to nonindustrial private forest owners. The forestry officials were asked to name and describe the public and private programs available in their state, to assess forest owners' awareness of each program, its appeal among the owners aware of it, its effectiveness in encouraging sustainable forestry and enabling owners to meet their objectives, and the percent of program practices that remain in place and enrolled acres that remain in forest over time. They also were asked to suggest ways to improve the programs. The Forest Stewardship, Forest Land Enhancement, and Forest Legacy Programs were among the top rated federal programs. Programs sponsored by states and private organizations tended to be more narrowly targeted than federal programs and scored well for specific attributes. The forestry officials' suggestions for program improvement centered largely on improving program visibility and availability, increasing and ensuring long-term consistency in program funding, and simplifying the application and approval process.									6	0	0	4	0	7			0148-4419			WOS:000264144800007

Therefore, there is a need to quantitatively understand the complex hydrogeology of wetlands. The main objective of this study was to improve understanding of saturated groundwater flow in a forested riparian wetland located on a golf course in the Lower Pee Dee River Basin in South Carolina, USA. Field observations that characterize subsurface wetland flow critical to solute transport originating from storm-generated runoff are presented. Monitoring wells were installed, and slug tests were performed to measure permeabilities of the wetland soil. A field-scale bromide tracer experiment was conducted to mimic the periodic loading of nutrients caused by storm runoff. This experiment provided spatial and temporal data on solute transport that were analyzed to determine travel times in the wetland. Furthermore, a 3-D numerical, steady-state flow model (MODFLOW) was developed to simulate subsurface flow in the wetland. A particle tracking model was subsequently used to calculate solute travel times from the wetland inlet to the outlet based on flow modeling results. It was evident that observed tracer breakthrough times were not typical of these measured wetland soil matrix conductivity values. Based on surface water sampling results at the wetland outlet, tracer arrival time was about 9 h after the injection of the tracer. These results implied an apparent mean K value of 2,050 m/day, which is 152 times larger than the mean of the measured values using slug tests (13.4 m/day). Modeling efforts clearly demonstrated this implied preferential flow behavior; particle travel times resulting from the calibrated flow model were in the order of hundreds of days, while actual travel times in the wetland were in the order of hours to a few days. This significant difference in travel times was attributed to the presence of macropores in the form of dead root channels and cavities forming a pipe-flow network. The analyses presented in this study resulted in an estimate of the ratio of matrix permeability to matrix plus macropore permeability of approximately 1/150. Eventually, the tracer test and resulting travel times between various points in the wetland were critical to understanding the true wetland flow dynamics. The final conceptual model of the hydraulic properties of the wetland soils comprised a low permeability matrix containing a web of high K macropores. Simulation of tracer transport in this system was possible using a flow model with significantly elevated K values.									11	0	0	6	0	11			0049-6979			WOS:000262551000014

Since the 1950s constructed wetlands (CWs), as a simple, low-technology method, have been shown to effectively treat agricultural, industrial, and municipal wastewater. We investigated the N and P attenuating potential of three floating hydrophytes planted in a laboratory-scale subsurface flow (SSF) CW system. Over an 8-week period plants were supplied with N and P (0.39 to 36.81 mg center dot L(-1) N and 0.07 to 6.77 mg center dot L(-1) P) that spanned the rates detected in nursery runoff between the discharge and inflow locations of a commercial nursery currently employing CWs. Whole plant dry weight was positively correlated with N and P supplied. Highest N recovery rates were exhibited by water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes [Mart.] Solms.) and water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L.). P recovery rates were similar for water hyacinth, water lettuce, and dwarf redstemmed parrotfeather (Myriophyllum aquaticum [Vell.] Verdc.). These floating hydrophytes can be cultivated in a SSF CW to remediate runoff losses of N and P. The possibility exists for integrating them into a polycultural remediation system that includes emergent aquatic macrophytes for processing and polishing nursery/greenhouse wastewater.									24	19	0	25	2	44			0049-6979			WOS:000262551000020

Band-by-band comparisons, relative to the established standard chromosome map for the subgenus Simulium, revealed 17 cytogenetically distinct taxa in Thailand, plus an 18th in China. Six of these taxa correspond to morphologically described species (S. doipuiense, S. rufibasis, S. setsukoae, S. tani, S. yuphae and S. weji). Recognition of the 18 taxa is based largely on unique inversions, either fixed or sex linked, primarily in the long arm of chromosome III. The greatest cytological diversity was discovered in the S. tani lineage, with ten cytoforms. This marked chromosomal diversification within S. tani is based largely on two inversions that have assumed different roles over evolutionary time, variously functioning in different combinations as fixed inversions, sex-linked inversions and autosomal polymorphisms. Shared unique chromosomal features, relative to the subgeneric standard chromosome map, allowed evolutionary relationships among the cytotaxa to be inferred. Fluctuations in climate during the Pleistocene might have promoted differentiation of the Southeast Asian S. tuberosum group in isolated refugia such as mountains.

We present an initial analysis of the similar to 730- megabase Sorghumbicolor ( L.) Moench genome, placing, 98% of genes in their chromosomal context using whole- genome shotgun sequence validated by genetic, physical and syntenic information. Genetic recombination is largely confined to about one- third of the sorghum genome with gene order and density similar to those of rice. Retrotransposon accumulation in recombinationally recalcitrant heterochromatin explains the similar to 75% larger genome size of sorghum compared with rice. Although gene and repetitive DNA distributions have been preserved since palaeopolyploidization similar to 70 million years ago, most duplicated gene sets lost one member before the sorghum - rice divergence. Concerted evolution makes one duplicated chromosomal segment appear to be only a few million years old. About 24% of genes are grass- specific and 7% are sorghum- specific. Recent gene and microRNA duplications may contribute to sorghum's drought tolerance.									1127	96	1	1082	2	1332			0028-0836			WOS:000262852200034	19189423

For k = 3, it is shown that a graph G can be partitioned into three independent dominating sets if and only if the cartesian product G square K(2) can be partitioned into three independent dominating sets. The graph K(2) can be replaced by any graph H such that there is a mapping f : Q(n) -> H, where f is a type-if graph homomorphism.The cartesian product of two trees is considered, as well as the complexity of partitioning a bipartite graph into three independent dominating sets, which is shown to be NP-complete. For other values of k, iterated cartesian products are considered, leading to a result that shows for what values of k the hypercubes can be partitioned into k independent dominating sets.

J	Cousins, Matthew M.; Gresham, Charles A.; Riley, Melissa B.; Whitwell, Ted								Beach Dune Sand Hydrophobicity Due to the Presence of Beach Vitex (Vitex rotundifolia L. f.)								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY				57	2			409	415		10.1021/jf8025259			JAN 28 2009	2009	Conservation and preservation concerns have led to efforts to understand mechanisms of invasiveness and the effects these mechanisms have on the environment. Vitex rotundifolia L. f. [beach vitex (BV)] was introduced as a salt-tolerant woody ground cover, but it has since become invasive on primary and secondary dunes in coastal areas of the southeastern United States. Much of its invasive potential may be the result of intense substrate hydrophobicity underneath established stands, which is believed to prohibit seedling establishment by other plants including native plant species. This research was conducted to better understand BV-induced sand hydrophobicity by carrying out dune surveys of BV-infested areas of the South Carolina coast, identifying the compounds responsible for this activity via chemical analysis, and quantifying hydrophobicity persistence by resampling sites following removal of above-ground BV. The findings indicated that sand under BV cover was significantly hydrophobic, that cuticular alkanes from leaves and fruits were responsible for this hydrophobicity, and that extreme substrate hydrophobicity persisted for >3 years following BV removal.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0021-8561			WOS:000262665000014	19090757

First-principles super-cell investigation of the rattling effect in Li-doped KCl								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER				21	4					045401	10.1088/0953-8984/21/4/045401			JAN 28 2009	2009	We have studied by the first-principles total energy method the off-center instability of a substitutional Li impurity in KCl. We report here the results of super-cell calculations of the energy associated with displacing the Li along < 100 >, < 110 > and < 111 > directions relative to the K vacancy. To understand the influence of relaxations, we performed three levels of relaxations-only first nearest neighbors of the vacancy, first and second nearest neighbors, and full relaxation. Our calculations show that the relaxation significantly affects the energy surface and that the relaxation of the nearest neighbors to the vacancy accounts for most of the trend. The position of minimum energy for the Li was found to be along the < 111 > direction. The calculated well along < 111 > is 102 meV deep relative to the on-center energy and lies about 0.86 angstrom off-center. Minima along adjacent < 111 > directions are separated by a saddle-point barrier of 44 meV along the < 110 > direction. Our calculated results are in agreement with prior model calculations and we believe our calculated potential surfaces are the best theoretical result so far.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0953-8984			WOS:000262354700009	21715802

J	Mi, Rongjuan; Dong, Liang; Kaulgud, Trupta; Hackett, Kevin W.; Dominy, Brian N.; Cao, Weiguo				Mi, Rongjuan/O-2564-2013				Insights from Xanthine and Uracil DNA Glycosylase Activities of Bacterial and Human SMUG1: Switching SMUG1 to UDG								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				385	3			761	778		10.1016/j.jmb.2008.09.038			JAN 23 2009	2009	Single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase (SMUG1) belongs to Family 3 of the uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) superfamily. Here, we report that a bacterial SMUG1 ortholog in Geobacter metallireducens (Gme) and the human SMUG1 enzyme are not only UDGs but also xanthine DNA glycosylases (XDGs). In addition, mutational analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Gme SMUG1 identify important structural determinants in conserved motifs 1 and 2 for XDG and UDG activities. Mutations at M57 (M57L) and H210 (H210G, H210M, and H210N), both of which are involved in interactions with the C2 carbonyl oxygen in uracil or xanthine, cause substantial reductions in XDG and UDG activities. Increased selectivity is achieved in the A214R mutant of Gme SMUG1, which corresponds to a position involved in base flipping. This mutation results in an activity profile resembling a human SMUG1-like enzyme as exemplified by the retention of UDG activity on mismatched base pairs and weak XDG activity. MD simulations indicate that M57L increases the flexibility of the motif 2 loop region and specifically A214, which may account for the reduced catalytic activity. G60Y completely abolishes XDG and UDG activity, which is consistent with a modeled structure in which G60Y blocks the entry of either xanthine or uracil to the base binding pocket. Most interestingly, a proline substitution at the G63 position switches the Gme SMUG1 enzyme to an exclusive UDG as demonstrated by the uniform excision of uracil in both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA and the complete loss of XDG activity. MD simulations indicate that a combination of a reduced free volume and altered flexibility in the active-site loops may underlie the dramatic effects of the G63P mutation on the activity profile of SMUG1. This study offers insights on the important role that modulation of conformational flexibility may play in defining specificity and catalytic efficiency. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

On utilizing delayed feedback for active-multimode vibration control of cantilever beams								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				319	3-5			735	752		10.1016/j.jsv.2008.06.052			JAN 23 2009	2009	We present a single-input single-output multimode delayed-feedback control methodology to mitigate the free vibrations of a flexible cantilever beam. For the purpose or controller design and stability analysis, we consider a reduced-order model consisting of the first n vibration modes. The temporal variation of these modes is represented by a set of nonlinearly coupled ordinary-differential equations that capture the evolving dynamics of the beam. Considering a linearized version of these equations., we derive a set of analytical conditions that are solved numerically to assess the stability of the closed-loop system. To verify these conditions, we characterize the stability boundaries Using the first two vibration modes and compare them to damping contours obtained by long-time integration of the full nonlinear equations of motion. Simulations show excellent agreement between both approaches. We analyze the effect of the size and location of the piezoelectric patch and the location of the sensor oil the stability of die response. We show that the stability boundaries are highly dependent oil these parameters. Finally, we implement the controller oil a cantilever beam for different controller gain-delay combinations and assess the performance using time histories of the beam response. Numerical simulations clearly demonstrate the controller ability to mitigate vibrations emanating from multiple modes simultaneously. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we discovered that vaccination with irradiated mouse sarcoma S180 tumor cells stimulated robust antitumor immunity to autologous tumor cells in both syngenic and allogenic mice. The antitumor activity requires both T and B cells, but not NK cells. When a mouse lung carcinoma (TC-1) whole tumor cell vaccine was combined with the S180 vaccine, the antitumor immunity against live TC-1 tumor cells is significantly enhanced compared to a TC-1 whole cell vaccine alone. This antitumor immunity not only prevents live tumor challenge but also eradicates existing tumor cells. A similar phenomenon was also observed when S180 vaccine was combined with LL-2 Lewis lung carcinoma tumor cells. Therefore, S180 vaccine may serve as an adjuvant for other whole tumor cell vaccines.

The grain has (29)Si/(28)Si = 1.63 x solar, (30)Si/(28)Si = 0.82 x solar, (12)C/(13)C = 265 (= 3 x solar), and evidence for the presence of radiogenic (44)Ca from the decay of (44)Ti. A comparison of these isotopic signatures with stellar models suggests an origin in a 15 M(circle dot) Type II supernova. It is possible to achieve a very good match between the (30)Si/(28)Si, (12)C/(13)C, and inferred (44)Ti/(48)Ti ratios in KJB2-11-17-1 and the model predictions if matter from different supernova zones is mixed in appropriate proportions. The (29)Si/(28)Si ratio, however, cannot be reproduced and is clearly higher than predicted. It was suggested previously by Travaglio et al. that supernova models underestimate the (29)Si yield in the C- and Ne-burning regions by about a factor of 2. Because of its very high (29)Si/(30)Si of two times the solar ratio, grain KJB2-11-17-1 provides the opportunity to make a stringent test of this hypothesis. With a twofold enhanced (29)Si yield in the C- and Ne-burning zones, we find a perfect match for (29)Si/(28)Si between the model predictions and the grain. Nuclear network calculations show that a twofold increase in the (29)Si yield in the C- and Ne-burning regions requires roughly a threefold higher (26)Mg(alpha, n)(29)Si reaction rate, the most important reaction for the production of (29)Si, in the temperature range 1-3 x 10(9) K than currently used in supernova models. This increase is qualitatively within current uncertainties of this reaction rate.									12	0	0	1	0	12						WOS:000263148600005

X-ray powder diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements. The low temperature specific heat measurements identified some localized low-frequency oscillation modes (Einstein modes) in conjunction with a Debye-like behavior. It Was found that with increasing Se concentration the characteristic Debye temperature did not change whereas the Einstein temperature slightly decreased. The lattice thermal conductivity of all Ge20Te80-xSex, samples exhibited typical amorphous| heat conduction behavior, which has been discussed in connection with the phonon mean free path and in the context of a phenomenological model of heat conduction for highly disordered system.

Two DMT parameters, horizontal stress index (K(D)) and dilatometer modulus (E(D)), are used as an index for assessing liquefaction resistance of soils. Specifically, CRR-K(D) and CRR-E(D) boundary curves are established based on the existing boundary curves that have already been developed based on standard penetration test (SPT) and cone penetration test (CPT). One key element in the development of CRR-K(D) and CRR-E(D) boundary curves is the correlations between K(D) (or E(D)) and the blow count (N) in the Slyr or cone tip resistance (q(c)) from the CPT. In this study, these correlations are established through regression analysis of the test results of SPT, CPT, and DMT conducted side-by-side at each of five sites selected. The validity of the developed CRR-K(D) and CRR-E(D) curves for evaluating liquefaction resistance is examined with published liquefaction case histories. The results of the study show that the developed DMT-based models are quite promising as a tool for evaluating liquefaction resistance of soils. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Also discussed is the development of a procedure for the nonsite specific attachment of a biomolecule to a modified silicon wafer, including scaffolds modified via drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet printing. VDMA-based polymers were used because of their hydrolytic stability and ability of the pendant azlactone rings to form stable covalent bonds with primary amines without byproducts via nucleophilic addition. This reaction proceeds without a catalyst and at room temperature, yielding a stable amide linkage, which adds to the ease of construction expected when using VDMA-based polymers. DOD inkjet printing was explored as an interesting method for creating surfaces with one or more patterns of biomolecules because of the flexibility and ease of pattern design.									21	0	0	3	0	21			0743-7463			WOS:000262176600048	19115868	
J	Grant, Gregory J.; Benefield, Desiree A.; VanDerveer, Donald G.								Thiacrown Pt-II complexes with group 15 donor ligands: pentacoordination in Pt(II) complexes								DALTON TRANSACTIONS					40			8605	8615		10.1039/b909875e			2009	2009	We report the synthesis and full characterization for a series of thiacrown complexes of Pt(II) incorporating the fluxional trithiacrown ligand 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane ([9]aneS(3)) and several group 15 donors ligands. Reaction of [Pt([9]aneS(3))Cl-2] with a full stoichiometric equivalent of the group 15 donor (L = 2 x AsPh3, SbPh3 or 1,2-bis(diphenylarsenio) ethane (dpae) followed by metathesis with NH4PF6 yields [Pt([9]aneS(3))L](PF6)(2). We also report the analogous Pd(II) complex with dpae. Similar reactions of the starting Pt complex with one equivalent of XPh3 (X = As or Sb) result in complexes of the formula [Pt([9]aneS(3))(XPh3)(Cl)](PF6). All six new complexes have been fully characterized by multinuclear NMR, IR, and UV-Vis spectroscopies in addition to elemental analysis and single crystal structural determinations. The X-ray structures of each complex indicate an axial M-S interaction formed by the endodentate conformation of the [9]aneS(3) ligand. The axial M-S distance is highly dependent upon the ancillary donor set. The axial M-S distance shortens with the identity of the group 15 donor ligand according to the trend, Sb < As < P, due to their increasingly poorer donor qualities. The two bis pnictogen complexes, [Pt([9]aneS(3))(AsPh3)(2)](PF6)(2) and [Pt([(9)]aneS(3))(SbPh3)(2)](PF6)(2) form unusual five-coordinate distorted trigonal bipyramids in contrast to the pseudo-five coordinate, elongated square pyramidal structures typically observed in Pt(II) complexes of [9]aneS(3). The distortion arises from intramolecular pi-pi interactions between the phenyl rings on the two different triphenyl ligands. Chemical shifts in the Pt-195 NMR also show similar periodic relationships which trend progressively upfield as the donor atom becomes larger. As expected, the coordinated [9]aneS(3) ligand shows fluxional behavior in its NMR spectra, resulting in a single C-13 NMR resonance, despite the asymmetric coordination environment found in both chloro complexes. The line width for the carbon NMR resonance as well as for the Pt-195 NMR peak is highly sensitive to the nature of the group 15 donor, with poorer donors such as SbPh3 showing significant line broadening. Measurements from the electronic spectra support that the ligand field strength of the pnictogen donor decreases with its increasing size.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1477-9226			WOS:000270593400021	19809737

J	Denham, Bryan E.								Association Between Narcotic Use and Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use Among American Adolescents								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				44	14			2043	2061		10.3109/10826080902848749			2009	2009	Drawing on the data gathered in the 2006 Monitoring the Future study of American youth, the present research examines associations between use of narcotics and use of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AASs) among high-school seniors (n = 2,489). With independent measures and controls including sex, race, media exposure, socializing with friends, participation in recreational and school-sponsored sports, perceptions of drug use among professional athletes, and perceptions of steroid use among close friends, binary logistic regression analyses revealed significant associations between AAS use and the use of alcohol, crack cocaine, Vicodin, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Ketamine, and Rohypnol. While use of both AASs and the narcotic drugs generally did not eclipse 5% of the sample, the numbers extend to many thousands in larger populations. Implications for health practitioners and recommendations for future research are offered. The study's limitations are noted.									9	0	0	3	0	9			1082-6084			WOS:000273748500006	20001694
