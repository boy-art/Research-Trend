J	Schutt, David J.; Haemmerich, Dieter								Sequential activation of a segmented ground pad reduces skin heating during radiofrequency tumor ablation: Optimization via computational models								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING				55	7			1881	1889		10.1109/TBME.2008.919740			JUL 2008	2008	Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has become an accepted treatment modality for unresectable tumors. The need for larger ablation zones has resulted in increased RF generator power. Skin burns due to ground pad heating are increasingly limiting further increases in generator power, and thus, ablation zone size. We investigated a method for reducing ground pad heating in which a commercial ground pad is segmented into multiple ground electrodes, with sequential activation of ground electrode subsets. We created finite-element method computer models of a commercial ground pad (14 x 23 cm) and compared normal operation of a standard pad to sequential activation of a segmented pad (two to five separate ground electrode segments). A constant current of I A was applied for 12 min in all simulations. Time periods during sequential activation simulations were adjusted to keep the leading edge temperatures at each ground electrode equal. The maximum temperature using standard activation of the commercial pad was 41.7 degrees C. For sequential activation of a segmented pad, the maximum temperature ranged from 39.3 degrees C (five segments) to 40.9 degrees C (two segments). Sequential activation of a segmented ground pad resulted in lower tissue temperatures. This method may reduce the incidence of ground pad burns and enable the use of higher power generators during RF tumor ablation.									5	0	0	2	0	6			0018-9294	1558-2531		WOS:000257138800012	18595807

The unifying concept that underlies this emerging discipline is its focus on the planetary boundary layer, or aerosphere, and the myriad of organisms that, in large part, depend upon this environment for their existence. The aerosphere influences both daily and seasonal movements of organisms, and its effects have both short- and long-term consequences for species that use this environment. The biotic interactions and physical conditions in the aerosphere represent important selection pressures that influence traits such as size and shape of organisms, which in turn facilitate both passive and active displacements. The aerosphere also influences the evolution of behavioral, sensory, metabolic, and respiratory functions of organisms in a myriad of ways. In contrast to organisms that depend strictly on terrestrial or aquatic existence, those that routinely use the aerosphere are almost immediately influenced by changing atmospheric conditions (e.g., winds, air density, precipitation, air temperature), sunlight, polarized light, moon light, and geomagnetic and gravitational forces. The aerosphere has direct and indirect effects on organisms, which often are more strongly influenced than those that spend significant amounts of time on land or in water. Future advances in aeroecology will be made when research conducted by biologists is more fully integrated across temporal and spatial scales in concert with advances made by atmospheric scientists and mathematical modelers. Ultimately, understanding how organisms such as arthropods, birds, and bats aloft are influenced by a dynamic aerosphere will be of importance for assessing, and maintaining ecosystem health, human health, and biodiversity.

Detection and discrimination of fauna in the aerosphere using Doppler weather surveillance radar								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				48	1			12	23		10.1093/icb/icn021			JUL 2008	2008	Organisms in the aerosphere have been detected by radar since its development in the 1940s. The national network of Doppler weather radars ( WSR-88D) in the United States can readily detect birds, bats, and insects aloft. Level-II data from the radar contain information on the reflectivity and radial velocity of targets and on width of the spectrum (SD of radial velocities in a radar pulse volume). Information on reflectivity can be used to quantify density of organisms aloft and radial velocity can be used to discriminate different types of targets based on their air speeds. Spectral width can also provide some useful information when organisms with very different air speeds are aloft. Recent work with dual-polarization radar suggests that it may be useful for discriminating birds from insects in the aerosphere, but more development and biological validation are required.

J	Kovach, Jami; Cho, Byung Rae								Constrained robust design experiments and optimization with the consideration of uncontrollable factors								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY				38	1-2			7	18		10.1007/s00170-007-1082-0			JUL 2008	2008	Robust design (RD) is an effective quality improvement methodology in which the goal is to determine the settings of design parameters that minimize the effect of uncontrollable variation on the response of interest, thereby creating a "robust" system. Although a number of approaches to RD have been proposed in the literature, little attention has been given to the use of RD in situations involving the consideration of uncontrollable factors in constrained experiments. As an alternative approach, we propose a new RD model by incorporating the concept of D-optimality to overcome the limitations of standard experimental approaches, while simultaneously considering controllable and uncontrollable factors. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate our proposed approach, and the results determined from our proposed model are compared to that of the traditional RD approach.									4	1	0	0	0	5			0268-3768			WOS:000257394100002

The present study examined the relationship between cardiovascular fitness and executive control in young adults using event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants completed a two-part experiment. In part one, a graded exercise test (GXT) was administered using a cycle ergometer to obtain VO(2)max, a measure of maximal oxygen uptake. High-fit participants had VO(2)max measures at or above the 70th percentile based on age and sex, and low-fit participants had VO(2)max measures at or below the 30th percentile. In part two, a task-switching paradigm was used to investigate executive control. Task-switching trials produced slower response times and greater amplitude for both the P3a and P3b components of the ERP relative to a non-switch trial block. No ERP components varied as a function of fitness group. These findings, combined with results from previous research, suggest that the relationship between greater cardiovascular fitness and better cognitive function emerges after early adulthood.

J	Ulbrich, Carlton W.; Atlas, David								Radar measurement of rainfall with and without polarimetry								JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY				47	7			1929	1939		10.1175/2007JAMC1804.1			JUL 2008	2008	Raindrop size distributions (DSDs) for tropical convective storms are used to examine the relationships between the parameters of a gamma DSD, with special emphasis on their variation with the stage of the storm. Such a distinction has rarely been made before. Several storms from a variety of tropical locations are divided into storm stages according to the temporal dependence of their reflectivity factor Z, rainfall rate R, and median volume diameter D-0. In most cases it is found that the DSD parameter D-0 is approximately constant in time during the convective, or C, stage, which leads to a Z-R relation of the form Z = AR, that is, a linear relationship between Z and R. This finding implies the existence of equilibrium DSDs during the C stage. The convective stage is sometimes marked by pulsations in draft strength so that D-0, R, and Z and associated values of the shape parameter mu decrease in a quasi-transition stage before increasing once more. Theoretical relations between the differential reflectivity Z(DR) and the ratio Z/R as functions of the DSD parameter mu are derived by assuming a gamma DSD and an accurate raindrop fall speed law. It is found that data derived from disdrometer observations lie along a mu = 5 isopleth for tropical continental C stages (Puerto Rico and Brazil) and along a mu = 12 isopleth for tropical maritime C stages [Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE)]. Small values of mu that occur in the weak updraft intervals do not impact the rainfall measurements because they correspond to relatively small R. The latter features imply that the measurement of rainfall for the convective stages can be performed with standard polarimetry involving only two measurables rather than three, provided knowledge of mu is available a priori. A new rain parameter diagram is presented in which isopleths of the generalized number concentration and D-0 are superimposed on the Z-R plot. It is proposed that it is possible to estimate D-0 from climatological and observable storm structural features, which, with Z, provide estimates of R. Such an approach is necessary for use with conventional radars until polarimetric radars are more widely available.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1558-8424			WOS:000257718300005

B./E-4458-2010				Improved thermoelectric performance in the Zintl phase compounds YbZn(2-x)Mn(x)Sb(2) via isoelectronic substitution in the anionic framework								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				104	1					013705	10.1063/1.2939372			JUL 1 2008	2008	It has been shown previously that the thermoelectric properties of the Zintl phase compound, YbZn(2)Sb(2) can be finely tuned via substitution at the cationic Yb-site. Here we report the results of the investigation of isoelectronic substitution of Zn by Mn in the anionic (Zn(2)Sb(2))(2-) framework. The p-type YbZn(2-x)Mn(x)Sb(2) (0.0 <= x <= 0.4) samples have been synthesized via a solid-state reaction followed by suitable cooling, annealing, grounding, and hot-pressing densification processes. In samples with x=0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity measurements have been performed as a function of temperature from 300 to 750 K. It is found that the Mn substitution effectively lowers the thermal conductivity for all samples, while it significantly increases the power factor for x <= 0.15. As a result, a dimensionless figure of merit ZT of similar to 0.61-0.65 has been attained at 726 K for x=0.05-0.15 as compared to the ZT of similar to 0.48 in the unsubstituted YbZn(2)Sb(2).

This research was conducted to determine the responses of select non-target species to exposures of two commonly used copper-based algaecides (Algimycin (R) PWF and copper sulfate pentahydrate). Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), scud (Hyalella azteca), and two water fleas (Ceriodaphnia dubia and Daphnia magna) were exposed to a series of concentrations of chelated copper as Algimycin (R) PWF and copper sulfate pentahydrate in 96-hour toxicity experiments. For exposures of both copper algaecides, D. magna was the most sensitive species, followed by C dubia, P promelas, H. azteca, and L. macrochirus. Daphnia magna, C. dubia, P promelas, and H. azteca responded similarly to both Algimycin (R) PWF and copper sulfate pentahydrate. However, copper sulfate pentahydrate was 29 times more toxic than Algimycin (R) PWF to L. macrochirus. These results indicate a great difference in sensitivities to algaecide exposures within and among animal species. For these aqueous exposures to copper algaecides, the microcrustaceans C dubia and D. magna, were clearly more sensitive than the fish species L. macrochirus and P promelas. These laboratory data provide conservative estimates of field exposures and must be translated to field situations due to copper speciation. To minimize risks in practical situations, water resource managers should consider timing of algaecide applications in terms of partial treatments, extent of target species infestation, duration of exposures, availability of refugia, spawning seasons, as well as fecundity of the non-target species in the aquatic system.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0146-6623			WOS:000260314600009

This classification procedure automatically extracts attributes from three imaging parameters obtained by an NIR imaging system. These parameters include tissue absorption and reduced scattering coefficients, as well as a tissue refractive index obtained by a phase-contrast-based reconstruction approach. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is utilized to distinguish the malignant from the benign lesions using the automatically extracted attributes. The classification results of in vivo tomographic images from 35 breast masses using absorption, scattering, and refractive index attributes demonstrate high sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 81.8%, 91.7%, and 88.6% respectively, while the classification sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy are 63.6%, 83.3%, and 77.1%, respectively, when only the absorption and scattering attributes are used. Furthermore, the automated classification procedure provides significantly improved specificity and overall accuracy for breast cancer detection compared to those by an experienced technician through visual examination.

In this study, we used steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) of methanation to investigate the activity of these catalysts at the site level, providing insight into how this promotion enhances catalyst activity. We found that the activity of the base Fe catalyst was enhanced by promotion with Cr, Mn, and Zr in varying degrees, depending on the type and concentration of metal added. The addition of these third metals promoted the dispersion of Fe but did not significantly affect either the BET surface area or reducibility. The activities of the reaction sites (estimated by 1 /tau(CH4) = TOFITK) were found to be similar regardless of the type of third metal added, suggesting that the active sites for Fe catalysts with or without thirdmetal promotion were essentially identical. The higher catalyst activities observed for the Cr-, Mn-, and Zr-promoted Fe catalysts were found to be due primarily to an increased number of active surface intermediates leading to hydrocarbon products.

Moreover, the above defined k-linked graph G is modulo (m(1), m(2),..., m(k))-linked if, in addition, for any k-tuple (d(1), d(2),..., d(k)) of natural numbers, the paths P-1, P-2,..., P-k can be chosen such that P-i has length d(i) modulo m(i) for i = 1, 2,..., k. Thomassen showed that, for each k-tuple (m(1), m(2),....., m(k)) of odd positive integers, there exists a natural number f(m(1), m(2),..., m(k)) such that every f (m(1), m(2),..., m(k))-connected graph is modulo (m(1), m(2),.....,m(k))-linked. For m(1) = m(2) =...= m(k) = 2, he showed in another article that there exists a natural number g(2, k) such that every g(2, k)-connected graph G is modulo (2, 2,..., 2)-linked or there is X subset of V(G) such that vertical bar X vertical bar <= 4k - 3 and G - X is a bipartite graph, where (2, 2,..., 2) is a k-tuple.We showed that f (m(1), m(2),..., m(k)) <= max{14(m(1) + m(2) +...+ m(k)) - 4k, 6(m(1) + m(2) +...+ m(k)) 4k + 36) for every k-tuple of odd positive integers. We then extend the result to allow some m(i) be even integers. Let (m(1), m(2),..., m(k)) be a k-tuple of natural numbers and l <= k such that m(i) is odd for each i with l + 1 <= i <= k. If G is 45(m(1) + m(2) +...+ m(k))-connected, then either G has a vertex set X of order at most 2k + 2l - 3 + delta(m(1),..., m(l)) such that G - X is bipartite or G is modulo (2m(1),..., 2m(l), m(l+1),..., m(k))-linked, where[GRAPHICS]Our results generalize several known results on parity-linked graphs.

Nonparametric efficiency analysis: a multivariate conditional quantile approach. journal of Econometrics 140, 375-400] to develop an unconditional, hyperbolic, alpha-quantile estimator of efficiency. Our new estimator is fully non-parametric and robust with respect to outliers; when used to estimate distance to quantiles lying close to the full frontier, it is strongly consistent and converges at rate root-n, thus avoiding the curse of dimensionality that plagues data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimators. Our methods could be used by policymakers to compare inefficiency levels across offices or by managers of individual offices to identify peer offices. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Diagnostic and prognostic strategies monitor a system's transient and steady-state operations, detecting deviations from normal operating scenarios and warning operators of potential system anomalies. System diagnostics detect, identify, and isolate a system fault while prognostics offer strategies to predict system behavior at a future operating time to define the useful period before failure criterion is reached. This paper presents the development and the experimental application of two methods to predict the system behavior based on trends in performance. Statistical regression concepts have been used to analyze dynamic plant signals, and based on these results, future plant operation was estimated. Wavelet transforms were used to condition the signal, and the denoised signals were subsequently forecast. The case study presented here applies the two methodologies to the operational data from a simple cycle 85 MW General Electric gas turbine. Those operating data were used to train and validate the algorithms. A comparison of the two methodologies reveals that the wavelet forecast is better than the statistical strategy with lower forecasting error. The developed approaches may be used in parallel with a diagnostic algorithm to monitor gas turbine system behavior.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0742-4795			WOS:000256153400004		
J	Young, S. Y.; Greene, J. K.; Lorenz, G. M.								Damage to soybean by Acrosternum hilare (Say) (Heteroptera : Pentatomidae)								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				43	3			257	267					JUL 2008	2008	A series of field-cage experiments were conducted in 2002 and 2003 in southeast Arkansas to measure the impact of feeding by green stink bug, Acrostemum hilare (Say), on soybean yield and seed damage. Stink bugs were collected from local soybean fields and released in 1.8 x 1.8 x 1.8 m walk-in screen cages at densities of 0, 3, 9, and 18 bugs per row-m on maturity group (MG) V and MG V soybean at different stages of crop phenological development. Damaged seed at harvest was significantly related to caged density of A. hilare in most of the cage experiments. Yield loss was associated with density of caged bugs in 7 of 11 different experiments and ranged from 13.4-60.5 kg/ha (0.2-0.9 bu/a) lost per bug per row-m. MG IV and MG V soybean were similarly impacted by density of A. hilare when exposed at the same stage of crop development. Feeding by small and large nymphs at early (R2-R3) and mid (R5-R6) reproductive stages resulted in significant yield loss. Feeding damage was apparent on late reproductive stage soybean (R7-R8), but no measurable impact on yield was observed. This suggested that thresholds could be raised or control efforts could be terminated for stink bugs infesting R7-R8 stage soybean. Damage due to feeding by stink bugs is related to various factors, but crop phenology, density of bugs, and length of infestation time are consistent and predictable influences that are interrelated, and all should be considered in determining the need to control field populations.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0749-8004			WOS:000257684000001		
J	Brown, Joseph C.; Jang, Xiuping								Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in herbal products								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				71	7			1486	1490					JUL 2008	2008	The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in various herbal products. Twenty-nine herbal supplements (18 traditional and 11 organic products) were purchased from stores and analyzed microbiologically. Total bacterial counts were determined by pour plate and surface spreading on tryptic soy agar (TSA). Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were enumerated on TSA supplemented with ceftriaxone (64 mu g/ml) or tetracycline (16 mu g/ml). Total bacterial counts ranged from < 5 to 2.9 X 10(5) CFU/g. Ceftriaxone- and tetracycline-resistant bacteria were detected in ground garlic samples at 1.1 X 10(2) CFU/g and 3.0 X 10(2) CFU/g, respectively. Traditional and organic onion powder samples contained tetracycline-resistant bacteria at 17 and 28 CFU/g and ceftriaxone-resistant bacteria at 35 and 2.0 X 10(3) CFU/g, respectively. Other products such as ginger, rosemary, mustard, and goldenseal contained low levels of resistant bacteria. Fifty-two isolates were further evaluated against nine antibiotics, and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance was in the following order: ampicillin, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, ceftriaxone, and streptomycin. Resistant bacteria were identified as Bacillus spp., Erwinia spp., and Ewingella americana. Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia also were isolated. The presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and pathogens in these herbal products suggests that production and use of these products may need further evaluation.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0362-028X			WOS:000257404300025	18680952	
J	Ram, Meghashyam Panyam Mohan; Kurfess, Thomas R.; Tucker, Thomas M.								Least-squares fitting of analytic primitives on a GPU								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS				27	3			130	135		10.1016/j.jmsy.2008.07.004			JUL 2008	2008	Metrology systems take coordinate information directly from the surface of a manufactured part and generate millions of (x, y, z) data points. The inspection process often involves fitting analytic primitives such as sphere, cone, torus, cylinder, and plane to these points, which represent an object with the corresponding shape. Typically, a least-squares fit of the parameters of the shape to the point set is performed. The least-squares fit attempts to minimize the sum of the squares of the distances between the points and the primitive. The objective function, however, cannot be solved in the closed form, and numerical minimization techniques are required to obtain the solution. These techniques as applied to primitive fitting entail iteratively solving large systems of linear equations generally involving arithmetic-intensive operations. The current problem faced in in-process metrology is the large computational time for the analysis of these millions of streaming data points. This paper presents a framework to address the bottleneck using a graphical processing unit (GPU) to optimize operations and obtain significant gain in computation time.

The algorithm is based on a breadth-first traversal of the network and allows multiple simultaneous transmissions by the nodes. The idea of this broadcast algorithm is then extended to develop a mobility resilient deterministic gossiping algorithm having O(Dn log n) worst-case run time (D is the diameter of the network graph), which is an improvement over the existing algorithms. Simulation results show that on an average, the time for completing the broadcast or gossiping is significantly lower than the theoretical worst-case time requirement. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Evaluation of statistical control charts for on-line radiation monitoring								JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY				277	1			227	234		10.1007/s10967-008-0735-2			JUL 2008	2008	Statistical control charts are presented for the evaluation of time series radiation counter data from flow cells used for monitoring of low levels of (TcO4-)-Tc-99 in environmental solutions. Control chart methods consisted of the 3-sigma (3 sigma) chart, the cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart, and the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart. Each method involves a control limit based on the detector background which constitutes the detection limit. Both the CUSUM and EWMA charts are suitable to detect and estimate sample concentration requiring less solution volume than when using a 3s control chart. Data presented here indicate that the overall accuracy and precision of the CUSUM method is the best.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0236-5731			WOS:000257318800035

Base on a Type II doubly censored sample, we construct a class of interval estimators of the scale parameter which are better than the shortest length affine equivariant interval both in coverage probability and in length. The procedure can be repeated to make further improvement. The extension of the method leads to a smoothly improved confidence interval which improves the interval length with probability one. All improved intervals belong to the class of scale equivariant intervals. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									6	2	0	0	0	8			0378-3758			WOS:000255448100011		
J	Pomper, Kirk W.; Crabtree, Sheri B.; Layne, Desmond R.; Peterson, R. Neal								Flowering and fruiting characteristics of eight pawpaw [Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal] selections in Kentucky								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN POMOLOGICAL SOCIETY				62	3			89	97					JUL 2008	2008	The North American pawpaw [Asimina triloba (L.) Dural] is in the initial stages of commercialization; however, little information has been published concerning flowering and ripening periods of commercially available cultivars. Cultivars with late flowering or extended bloom period could be useful to growers for avoiding crop losses to late spring frosts. The objectives of this study were to determine if mature trees of commercially available pawpaw cultivars display: 1) concentrated bloom periods, 2) late flowering characteristics, 3) high fruit set, and 4) concentrated fruit ripening characteristics that were related to concentrated bloom periods. An orchard was planted in the spring of 1998 in a randomized block experimental design with 8 replicates. In 2004 to 2006, the cultivars 'Middletown', 'Overleese', 'PA-Golden', 'Sunflower','Wells', 'Wilson', 'NC-1'and the advanced selection 2-54 were evaluated for flower number per tree, density, peak, and duration, as well as trunk cross-sectional area, fruit set, days between flower and harvest peak, duration of harvest, fruit weight, yield, and number of fruit per cluster. An extended flowering period or larger flower number did not improve fruit set. Mature trees of commercially available pawpaw cultivars did not display concentrated bloom periods or ripening periods; however, 'Wells' and 'Middletown' did have late flowering peaks (maximum number of flowers) that could allow a partial crop if early spring frosts destroy flowers around or at the flowering peak. However, the average fruit size of 'Wells' and 'Middletown' is small and undesirable for commercial production.									6	0	0	7	0	7			1527-3741			WOS:000258163300001		
J	Wei, Yang; Latour, Robert A.								Determination of the adsorption free energy for peptide-surface interactions by SPR spectroscopy								LANGMUIR				24	13			6721	6729		10.1021/la8005772			JUL 1 2008	2008	To understand and predict protein adsorption behavior, we must first understand the fundamental interactions between the functional groups presented by the amino acid residues making up a protein and the functional groups presented by the surface. Limited quantitative information is available, however, on these types of submolecular interactions. The objective of this study was therefore to develop a reliable method to determine the standard state adsorption free energy (Delta G(ads)(o)) of amino acid residue-surface interactions using surface plasma resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. Two problems are commonly encountered when using SPR for peptide adsorption studies: the need to account for "bulk-shift" effects and the influence of peptide-peptide interactions at the surface. Bulk-shift effects represent the contribution of the bulk solute concentration to the SPR response that occurs in addition to the response due to adsorption. Peptide-peptide interactions, which are assumed to be zero for Langmuir adsorption, can greatly skew the isotherm shape and result in erroneous calculated values of Delta G(ads)(o). To address these issues, we have developed a new approach for the determination of Delta G(ads)(o) using SPR that is based on the chemical potential. In this article, we present the development of this new approach and its application for the calculation of Delta G(ads)(o) for a set of peptide-surface systems where the peptide has a host-guest amino acid sequence of TGTG-X-GTGT (where G and T are glycine and threonine residues and X represents a variable residue) and the surface consists of alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with methyl (CH3) and hydroxyl (OH) functionality. This new approach enables bulk-shift effects to be directly determined from the raw SPR versus peptide concentration data plots and the influence of peptide-peptide interaction effects to be minimized, thus providing a very straightforward and accurate method for the determination of Delta G(ads)(o) for peptide adsorption. Further studies are underway to characterize Delta G(ads)(o) for a large library of peptide-SAM combinations.									41	1	0	11	0	42			0743-7463			WOS:000257101100047	18507411

In particular, it is shown how solutions that are found using this decomposition approach relate to solutions found by traditional scalarization techniques. For the selection of a final solution, two interactive coordination methods are proposed that allow to find any solution for the original problem by merely solving the smaller-sized subproblems, while integrating both preferences of the decision maker and trade-off information obtained from a sensitivity analysis. A theoretical foundation for the procedures is established, and their application is illustrated for portfolio optimization and a design selection problem.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0025-1909	1526-5501		WOS:000257473200011

The electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity have been measured as a function of temperature from 300 K to 820 K. A power factor similar to 2.28 x 10(-3) Wm(-1)K(-2) at 574 K for y = 0.01, and a dimensionless figure of merit ZT similar to 0.68 at 724 K for y = 0.005 are attained. Given the potential of these materials for utilization in thermoelectric devices in a medium temperature range, the thermoelectric compatibility of Mg2Si0.6-ySbySn0.4 samples has been also addressed.									24	2	0	0	0	24			1862-6300	1862-6319		WOS:000257828100024

Time-of-flight data of scattered He-atoms have been recorded at varying temperature and as a function of parallel momentum transfer. A dominant elastic peak and two broad features at approximate to 4 meV, one each on the phonon annihilation and creation side, are observed in all spectra. The thermal measurements between 127.0 and 368.5 K unveil clear Debye-Waller attenuation behavior of the elastic peak and indicate that scattering occurs in the single-phonon regime below 200 K. The root-mean-square vibration amplitude at room temperature is estimated to be 0.014 nm with a corresponding surface Debye temperature of 340 +/- 20 K and an effective mass of 18 a.u. The obtained values agree well with bulk values under the assumption of force constants at the surface reduced by one-half. The wave-vector dependence of the Debye-Waller exponent indicates a well depth of the atom-surface interaction potential of 10 +/- 2 meV. The broad inelastic features on the phonon creation and annihilation sides are identified as the surface manifestation of the boson peak phenomenon in amorphous materials. An unusual shifting of the boson peak modes to higher energies with increasing temperature is observed. Measurements at different parallel momentum transfers unveil a nondispersive behavior of the boson peak mode.									5	1	0	1	0	5			1098-0121			WOS:000258190400107		
J	Luo, Chao-Xi; Cox, Kerik D.; Amiri, Achour; Schnabel, Guido								Occurrence and detection of the DMI resistance-associated genetic element 'Mona' in Monilinia fructicola								PLANT DISEASE				92	7			1099	1103		10.1094/PDIS-92-7-1099			JUL 2008	2008	Sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide resistance in isolates of Monilinia fructicola from Georgia has been linked to overexpression of the MfCYP51 gene and a corresponding 65-bp genetic element 'Mona' inserted in the upstream region of MfCYP51. In this study, a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was developed to detect the Mona element. Fourteen DMI fungicide-resistant (DMI-R) and six DMI fungicide-sensitive (DMI-S) isolates from Georgia, six DMI-R and 11 DMI-S isolates from South Carolina, seven DMI-R and nine DMI-S isolates from New York, and two DMI-R and three DMI-S isolates from Ohio were used in this study. The isolates from the southeastern United States and Ohio were collected from peach, whereas isolates from New York were collected from cherry. A 376-bp fragment containing the Mona element was consistently amplified with primer pair INS65-F and INS65-R from DMI-R isolates, and either a 311-bp or 1,815-bp fragment was amplified from DMI-S isolates. The primer pair did not amplify DNA fragments of similar sizes from isolates of five other common fruit rot pathogens of peach, including Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum acutatum, Gilbertella persicaria, Penicillium expansum, and Rhizopus stolonifer. Gel electrophoresis of the PCR amplicon can distinguish between DMI-R and DMI-S isolates based on the 65-bp size difference of the amplicon; however, the restriction digestion assay can verify questionable results, especially in the absence of a positive control. Only the 376-bp fragment containing the Mona element was digestable with endonuclease BsrBI, resulting in two restriction fragments of 236 and 140 bp in size. In this study, a protocol for Mona detection from aerial fungal structures was developed that can yield results within a few hours of sampling. This study confirms that the Mona element is strongly linked to the DMI-resistance phenotype and reveals that overexpression of the MfCYP51 gene is a common DMI fungicide resistance mechanism in M. fructicola, not only in Georgia but throughout the eastern United States.									26	3	0	22	0	29			0191-2917			WOS:000256873800016

Members of this family provide high-value nutritional foods and contribute desirable aesthetic and industrial products. Most rosaceous crops have been enhanced by human intervention through sexual hybridization, asexual propagation, and genetic improvement since ancient times, 4,000 to 5,000 B. C. Modern breeding programs have contributed to the selection and release of numerous cultivars having significant economic impact on the U. S. and world markets. In recent years, the Rosaceae community, both in the United States and internationally, has benefited from newfound organization and collaboration that have hastened progress in developing genetic and genomic resources for representative crops such as apple (Malus spp.), peach (Prunus spp.), and strawberry (Fragaria spp.). These resources, including expressed sequence tags, bacterial artificial chromosome libraries, physical and genetic maps, and molecular markers, combined with genetic transformation protocols and bioinformatics tools, have rendered various rosaceous crops highly amenable to comparative and functional genomics studies. This report serves as a synopsis of the resources and initiatives of the Rosaceae community, recent developments in Rosaceae genomics, and plans to apply newly accumulated knowledge and resources toward breeding and crop improvement.									136	7	0	126	2	148			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000257454000008	18487361

Effects of prelay ts11-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum inoculation and time-specific F-strain M-gallisepticum inoculation overlays on internal egg and eggshell characteristics of commercial laying hens								POULTRY SCIENCE				87	7			1358	1363		10.3382/ps.2008-00099			JUL 2008	2008	Mycoplasma infections are pandemic in multiage layer chicken flocks, with Mycoplasma gallisepticum being the species of greatest concern to commercial egg producers. Live M. gallisepticum vaccines are presently being used to help control M. gallisepticum outbreaks. However, vaccination of layers with F-strain M. gallisepticum may adversely affect egg production. In the present study, 2 trials were conducted to compare the effects of 2 currently available live Mycoplasma vaccines (the ts11- and F-strains), used in conjunction, on internal egg and eggshell characteristics. The following 4 inoculation treatments were used: 1) sham at 10 wk of age (control), 2) ts11 at 10 wk, 3) ts11 at 10 wk overlaid by F at 22 wk, and 4) ts11 at 10 wk overlaid by F at 45 wk. In each trial at various ages between 23 and 57 wk of age, percentage of yolk weight, percentage of yolk moisture, percentage of yolk lipid, percentage of albumen weight, Haugh unit scores, and percentage of shell weight of eggs were assessed. At wk 32, percentage of yolk lipid was increased in eggs belonging to the ts11 at 10 wk and ts11 at 10 wk overlaid by F at 22 wk treatment groups in comparison with controls. There was also a significant decrease in percentage of albumen weight in eggs in the treatment with ts11 at 10 wk overlaid by F at 22 wk, as well as a decrease in Haugh unit scores in the ts11 at 10 wk treatment in comparison with controls during post-peak lay. Percentage of yolk moisture, percentage of egg yolk weight, and percentage of eggshell weight in layers were not significantly affected by a 10-wk ts11 inoculation alone or in conjunction with subsequent overlay inoculations of F during lay. It is suggested that a 10-wk inoculation of commercial layers with ts11-strain M. gallisepticum may reduce the negative impacts of a prelay F-strain M. gallisepticum inoculation on performance while providing protection against subsequent field strain M. gallisepticum infections.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0032-5791			WOS:000257388500016	18577616

Broiler carcasses and chiller water were obtained from a commercial processing facility which had recently installed a TOMCO Pathogen Management System to recycle water in sections 2 and 3 of two 3-compartment chillers. In this system, reused water is blended with fresh water to maintain the chiller volume. Carcasses were sampled prechill and postchill (final exit), and chiller water was sampled from the beginning and end of each of the 3 sections. Carcasses were subjected to a whole carcass rinse (WCR) in 0.1% peptone. Numbers of Escherichia coli (EC), coliforms (CF), and Campylobacter (CPY) were determined from the WCR and chiller water samples. Prevalence of Salmonella (SAL) was also determined on the WCR and chiller water sam-ples. On average, prechill levels of bacteria recovered from rinses were 2.6, 2.9, and 2.6 log(10) cfu/mL for EC, CF, and CPY, respectively. Ten out of 40 (25%) prechill carcasses were positive for SAL. After chilling, numbers of EC, CF, and CPY recovered from carcass rinses decreased by 1.5, 1.5, and 2.0 log(10) cfu/mL, respectively. However, 9 out of 40 (22%) postchill carcasses were positive for SAL. When the chiller water samples were tested, counts of EC, CF, and CPY were found only in water collected from the first section of the chiller (inlet and outlet). Two of 4 water samples collected from the inlet of the first section tested positive for SAL. This study shows that fresh and reused water can be used to cool poultry in chiller systems to achieve a reduction in numbers of bacteria (EC, CF, and CPY) or equivalent prevalence (SAL) of bacteria recovered from broiler carcasses.									16	0	0	16	1	16			0032-5791			WOS:000257388500030	18577630

Among the more significant phenomena that occur during the development of these lesions is the phenotypic switching of VSMCs from a contractile to a synthetic state. A better understanding of the concurrent changes to VSMC mechanical properties that occur with phenotypic shifts can help to elucidate the role of VSMC mechanics in the development of vascular diseases. In the Current study, the mechanical properties of adherent cultured rat aortic VSMCs were assessed by atomic force microscopy. Serum starvation was used to induce a phenotypic shift in vitro. It was concluded that serum starvation led to a statistically significant increase in apparent elastic modulus after 5 days, as well as a statistically significant decrease in hysteresis after culture for 3 days. If this trend of VSMC mechanical properties changing concurrently with phenotypic shifts were to hold true in Vivo, Such changes Could affect the processes of mechanotransduction and/or arterial mechanical properties, thereby contributing to the progression of vascular disease.									7	0	0	4	0	7			0954-4119			WOS:000258638300017	18756693

PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING				25	7	SI		655	674		10.1002/mar.20230			JUL 2008	2008	The worldwide growth and acceptance of e-commerce provides consumers with the opportunity to shop in computer-mediated interactive environments that simulate direct product experience. However, the phenomenal growth in advertising on the Internet and marketers' ability to rapidly change the content of online ads also create concerns about consumers being exposed to a plethora of potentially misleading advertisements on the Internet. Relatively little research to date has focused on how consumer beliefs are shaped by online advertising claims or are affected by media richness.

The specific design requirements for this modified instrument were chosen to enable the exposure of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) device to monoenergtic, well-collimated beams of alkali ions while monitoring both the scattered beam flux and the device characteristics. Our goal is to explore the role that hot electrons injected toward the MOS device surface play in the neutralization of scattered ions. To illustrate the functionality of our system, we present energy-resolved spectra for Na(+), K(+), and Cs(+) ions scattered from the surface of a Ag(001) single crystal for a range of incident energies. In addition, we show MOS device current-voltage characteristics measured in situ in a new rapid-turnaround load lock and sample translation stage.

J	Sikora, F. J.; Moore, K. P.								The Moore-Sikora buffer for lime requirement determinations								SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL				72	4			1163	1173		10.2136/sssaj2007.0268			JUL-AUG 2008	2008	Paranitrophenol in the Adams-Evans (AE) buffer used for determining lime requirement (LR) is considered a hazardous chemical due to its toxicity. The Moore-Sikora (MS) buffer, which mimics AE soil-buffer pH, was developed without hazardous chemicals and is currently used for routine soil testing at Clemson University. The MS buffer was designed by considering probable chemicals with pK(a) values in the desired pH range, potential reaction of the components with soil, and longevity of the buffer during storage. Boric acid, 3-(N morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid hydrate (MES) were considered for the new buffer. Once chemicals were identified, a technique of finding appropriate concentrations was utilized by using an equation that could predict the acid titration of a buffer and refining pK(a) and concentration values until a match was found with measured pH titrations of the AE buffer. The MS buffer contains 212, 131, and 34.8 mmol L-1 of B(OH)(3), MOPS, and MES, respectively. The buffer also contains 200 mmol L-1 KOH and 1 mol L-1 KCI. The MS buffer was compared with the AE buffer for determining soil-buffer pH values on 222 South Carolina soils and 41 North American Proficiency Testing Program soils. The MS soil-buffer pH was strongly related to AE soil-buffer pH (r(2) > 0.98). Soil-buffer pH was slightly less with MS buffer than AE buffer, with a mean difference of 0.03 pH units. The lower soil-buffer pH with MS buffer caused a slightly higher LR than the AE buffer, with a mean difference of 0.34 Mg ha(-1) on South Carolina soils. Forty-four percent of the samples indicating a need for lime did not have a difference in LR between the two buffers. The slightly higher LR with the MS buffer on some of the samples is not expected to raise soil pH too high above target pH values.									8	0	0	7	1	8			0361-5995	1435-0661		WOS:000257569500032

Origin of resistance to plum pox virus in Apricot: what new AFLP and targeted SSR data analyses tell								TREE GENETICS & GENOMES				4	3			403	417		10.1007/s11295-007-0119-8			JUL 2008	2008	Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and targeted simple sequence repeats (SSR) were employed to assess genetic similarity of North American apricots having natural resistance to plum pox virus (PPV) within diversified germplasm including six nondomesticated apricot species. On a dendrogram constructed from 231 AFLP loci, the position of the North American cultivars reflects relatedness to the European apricots and introgression of non-European germplasm as well. The occurrence of diagnostic AFLP markers supports an introgression of Chinese germplasm into the North American PPV resistant assortment and supports a different breeding history for 'Stark Early Orange' (SEO) and Goldrich-Harlayne lineages. Five SSR loci linked to the PPV resistance region on G1 provided evidence that the investigated lineages (SEO and 'Harlayne'-'Goldrich') have the same or related source of resistance introduced presumably from Northern China. Possible introgression of genetic material from nondomesticated apricots P. mandshurica sp, P. sibirica var. davidiana and P. mume sp. was detected and discussed.									23	0	0	22	0	26			1614-2942			WOS:000256011500004

Of these species, certain apricot cultivars ('Stark Early Orange', 'Goldrich', 'Harlayne') display significant levels of resistance to the disease and are the genetic substrate for studies of several xlaboratories working cooperatively to genetically characterize and mark the resistance locus or loci for marker-assisted breeding. The goals of the work presented in this communication are the characterization of the genetics of PPV resistance in 'Stark Early Orange' and the development of co-dominant molecular markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in PPV resistance breeding. We present the first genetic linkage map for an apricot backcross population of 'Stark Early Orange' and the susceptible cultivar 'Vestar' that segregates for resistance to PPV. This map is comprised of 357 loci (330 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), 26 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and 1 morphological marker for PPV resistance) assigned to eight linkage groups. Twenty-two of the mapped SSRs are shared in common with genetic reference map for Prunus (T x E; Joobeur et al. 1998) and anchor our apricot map to the general Prunus map. A PPV resistance locus was mapped in linkage group 1 and four AFLP markers segregating with the PPV resistance trait, identified through bulk segregant analysis, facilitated the development of SSRs in this region.									41	3	0	35	0	46			1614-2942			WOS:000256011500010

The evergrowing (evg) mutant of peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] does not form terminal vegetative buds in response to dormancy-inducing conditions such as short days and low temperatures, and the terminal meristems maintain constant growth (leaf addition and internode elongation). We genetically mapped the evg trait and identified the corresponding genomic region in a wild-type genome. We sequenced and annotated the 132-kb region. Nineteen genes were predicted to be in the sequenced region. Ten of the predicted genes were demonstrated to be expressed in the wild-type germplasm but six of these were not expressed in mutant tissues. These six genes are a cluster of MIKC-type MADS-box transcription factors similar to genes from Ipomoea batatas and Solanum tuberosum MADS-box, which also regulate meristem growth in vegetative tissues. A 41,746-bp deletion is present in this region of the mutant genome which results in the loss of all or part of four of the six MADS-box genes. The six MADS-box genes that are not expressed in the mutant are candidates for the regulation of growth cessation and terminal bud formation in peach in response to dormancy-inducing conditions and have been named dormancy-associated MADS-box (DAM) genes.									105	4	0	102	0	112			1614-2942			WOS:000256011500011

Cover crop treatments included wild radish, rye, and no cover crop, alone and in conjunction with half and full rates of atrazine (0.84 and 1.68 kg ai ha(-1)) plus S-metolachlor (0.44 and 0.87 kg ai ha(-1)) applied before sweet corn emergence. Florida pusley, large crabgrass, spreading dayflower, ivyleaf morningglory, and wild radish infested the test sites. Wild radish and rye cover crops without herbicides reduced total weed density by 35 and 50%, respectively, at 4 wk after planting (WAP). Wild radish in conjunction with the full rate of atrazine plus S-metolachlor controlled Florida pusley, large crabgrass, and ivyleaf morningglory better than rye or no cover crop treated with a full herbicide rate in 2004 at Blackville. In 2005, at Blackville, weed control in sweet corn following wild radish cover crop plots alone was not different from that following rye. Wild radish or rye in conjunction with a half or full rate of atrazine and S-metolachlor controlled > 95% Florida pusley, wild radish, and large crabgrass in sweet corn at Tifton during both years. Ten glucosinolates, potential allelopathic compounds, were identified in wild radish, including glucoiberin, progoitrin, glucoraphanin, glucoraphenin, glucosinalbin, gluconapin, glucotropaeolin, glucoerucin, glucobrassicin, and gluconasturtin. Sweet corn yields at Blackville and Tifton following wild radish or rye cover crops were similar between the half and full rates of atrazine plus S-metolachlor. Sweet corn in wild radish or rye cover crop plots without herbicides produced less-marketable ears than herbicide-treated plots, indicating that a combination of cover crops and herbicides are required to optimize yields and to obtain desirable weed control.									15	1	0	13	0	16			0043-1745			WOS:000257452600017		
J	Bangarwa, Sanjeev K.; Norsworthy, Jason K.; Jha, Prashant; Malik, Mayank								Purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus) management in an organic production system								WEED SCIENCE				56	4			606	613		10.1614/WS-07-187.1			JUL-AUG 2008	2008	Research was initiated in March 2005 to test various integrated purple nutsedge management strategies over two growing seasons in an organic production system in which bell pepper was grown as a fall crop. Main plots consisted of integrated purple nutsedge management strategies from mid-March through July 2005 and 2006. The main-plot factors were (1) green polyethylene film, (2) clear polyethylene film (3) turnip followed by (fb) green polyethylene film, (4) turnip fb clear polyethylene film, (5) tillage every 3 wk, and (6) fallow. Subplots consisted of hand-weeding, mulching with wheat straw, and no weeding following bell pepper transplanting in early August. Purple nutsedge tuber density was determined in March, August, and November each year. Viable tubers were categorized into three sizes: small (0.1 to 0.25 g), medium (0.26 to 0.50 g), and large (> 0.50 g). The initial tuber density averaged 500 small, 300 medium, and 110 large tubers m(-2) in mid-March 2005 (910 total tubers m(-2)). Total tuber density increased to > 5,400 tubers m 2 in fallow, nonweeded plots by November 2006. Yearly tuber density remained relatively constant over the 2 yr when the fallow period was fb hand-weeding in the bell pepper crop. Density of large and medium tubers in the season-long management systems remained stable, whereas small tubers were prone to depletion over time. Frequent tillage or use of a polyethylene film with or without turnip resulted in a lower density of large tubers in November 2006 relative to fallow treatments, regardless of management intensity in bell pepper. The density of large tubers after 2 yr was similar among treatments involving frequent tillage or use of a polyethylene film with or without turnip, regardless of subplot treatment; this was also observed for medium tubers, but not for small tubers. All hand-weeded plots had comparable densities of small tubers, ranging from 25 to 194 viable tubers m(-2). Intensive management involving frequent tillage or use of a translucent polyethylene film with or without turnip fb hand-weeding was not effective in eradicating purple nutsedge over two growing seasons. Purple nutsedge management costs calculated for each main-plot treatment revealed that use of a translucent polyethylene film alone was at least 4.5-fold more costly than frequent tillage. This research demonstrates that season-long management is essential to prevent purple nutsedge proliferation over time.									13	0	0	12	0	13			0043-1745			WOS:000257452600019

Together with gossypol, these natural products were investigated for a wide range of bioactivities. Antioxidant effects, the potential to prevent DNA damage, anticancer activity, and antitrypanosomal effects were studied. The 6-methoxygossypol generally exhibited equal bioactivities to the 6,6'-dimethoxygossypol, but gossypol showed greater activities than both methylated derivatives in scavenging free radicals, reducing ferric ions, and preventing UV-induced DNA damage. All three compounds inhibited the growth of cervical (SiHa), breast (MCF-7), and colon (Caco-2) cancer cells. At >= 5 ppm of test concentrations, 6,6'-dimethoxygossypol showed a stronger ability than gossypol to inhibit the growth of Trypanosoma brucei cells.									19	0	0	16	0	19			0021-8561			WOS:000256893200017	18517219

Glenn, Travis/A-2390-2008				Expressed sequence tags from Peromyscus testis and placenta tissue: Analysis, annotation, and utility for mapping								BMC GENOMICS				9						300	10.1186/1471-2164-9-300			JUN 24 2008	2008	Background: Mice of the genus Peromyscus are found in nearly every habitat from Alaska to Central America and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They provide an evolutionary outgroup to the Mus/Rattus lineage and serve as an intermediary between that lineage and humans. Although Peromyscus has been studied extensively under both field and laboratory conditions, research has been limited by the lack of molecular resources. Genes associated with reproduction typically evolve rapidly and thus are excellent sources of evolutionary information. In this study we describe the generation of two cDNA libraries, one from placenta and one from testis, characterize the resulting ESTs, and describe their utility for mapping the Peromyscus genome.Results: The 5' ends of 1,510 placenta and 4,798 testis clones were sequenced. Low quality sequences were removed and after clustering and contig assembly, 904 unique placenta and 2,002 unique testis sequences remained. Average lengths of placenta and testis ESTs were 711 bp and 826 bp, respectively. Approximately 82% of all ESTs were identified using the BLASTX algorithm to Mus and Rattus, and 34 - 54% of all ESTs could be assigned to a biological process gene ontology category in either Mus or Rattus. Because the Peromyscus genome organization resembles the Rattus genome more closely than Mus we examined the distribution of the Peromyscus ESTs across the rat genome finding markers on all rat chromosomes except the Y. Approximately 40% of all ESTs were specific to only one location in the Mus genome and spanned introns of an appropriate size for sequencing and SNP detection. Of the primers that were tried 54% provided useful assays for genotyping on interspecific backcross and whole-genome radiation hybrid cell panels.Conclusion: The 2,906 Peromyscus placenta and testis ESTs described here significantly expands the molecular resources available for the genus. These ESTs allow for specific PCR amplification and broad coverage across the genome, creating an excellent genetic marker resource for the generation of a medium-density genomic map. Thus, this resource will significantly aid research of a genus that is uniquely well-suited to both laboratory and field research.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1471-2164			WOS:000257360600001	18577228

However, it may induce malignancies in a number of tissues when constitutively activated, and it may also have a role in other forms of normal and maladaptive growth. Cyclopamine, a naturally occurring steroidal alkaloid, specifically inhibits the Hedgehog pathway by binding directly to Smoothened, an important Hedgehog response element. To use cyclopamine as a tool to explore and/or inhibit the Hedgehog pathway in vivo, a substantial quantity is required, and as a practical matter cyclopamine has been effectively unavailable for usage in animals larger than mice.Results: In this paper, we report a rapid and efficient isolation and purification of large quantities of cyclopamine from the roots and rhizomes of Veratrum californicum Dur. (the Corn Lily or Western false hellebore). We also provide unambiguous assignments of the carbon and proton resonances by using the multinuclear spectra and the spin coupling networks.Conclusion: This method could meet a very real need within diverse scientific communities by allowing cyclopamine to become more readily available.									12	1	0	6	0	12			1752-153X			WOS:000259067200001	18577213

A blackberry (Rubus L.) expressed sequence tag library for the development of simple sequence repeat markers								BMC PLANT BIOLOGY				8						69	10.1186/1471-2229-8-69			JUN 20 2008	2008	Background: The recent development of novel repeat-fruiting types of blackberry (Rubus L.) cultivars, combined with a long history of morphological marker-assisted selection for thornlessness by blackberry breeders, has given rise to increased interest in using molecular markers to facilitate blackberry breeding. Yet no genetic maps, molecular markers, or even sequences exist specifically for cultivated blackberry. The purpose of this study is to begin development of these tools by generating and annotating the first blackberry expressed sequence tag (EST) library, designing primers from the ESTs to amplify regions containing simple sequence repeats (SSR), and testing the usefulness of a subset of the EST-SSRs with two blackberry cultivars.Results: A cDNA library of 18,432 clones was generated from expanding leaf tissue of the cultivar Merton Thornless, a progenitor of many thornless commercial cultivars. Among the most abundantly expressed of the 3,000 genes annotated were those involved with energy, cell structure, and defense. From individual sequences containing SSRs, 673 primer pairs were designed. Of a randomly chosen set of 33 primer pairs tested with two blackberry cultivars, 10 detected an average of 1.9 polymorphic PCR products.Conclusion: This rate predicts that this library may yield as many as 940 SSR primer pairs detecting 1,786 polymorphisms. This may be sufficient to generate a genetic map that can be used to associate molecular markers with phenotypic traits, making possible molecular marker-assisted breeding to compliment existing morphological marker-assisted breeding in blackberry.									23	4	0	22	1	29			1471-2229			WOS:000258376900002	18570660	
J	Pansare, Sourabh S.; Goodwin, James G., Jr.								Ammonia decomposition on tungsten-based catalysts in the absence and presence of syngas								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				47	12			4063	4070		10.1021/ie800077p			JUN 18 2008	2008	Synthesis gas produced from biomass gasification can serve as a starting point for producing electricity, low-to-medium energy fuels, and even hydrogen for fuel cells. The major barrier in commercialization of biomass gasification is the presence of impurities such as NH3, tars, and H2S in the gas products that are detrimental to downstream processes. This paper reports the results of a study of NH3 decomposition to N-2 and H-2 on tungsten-based catalysts, tungsten carbide (WC) and tungstated zirconia (WZ), for a gasification gas cleanup strategy that involves removal of tars first followed by NH3 decomposition. The effects of the presence of H2 and CO on the behavior of these catalysts are also reported. At the NH3 decomposition reaction conditions used in the present study (1 atm, 465-650 degrees C, 4000 ppm), both WC and WZ showed an induction period. The main reason for this induction period is hypothesized to be a restructuring of the catalyst surface by NH3 so that the surface is more favorable for reaction. Both WC and WZ displayed superior activity compared to a commercial Fe-based NH3 synthesis catalyst (Amomax-10). At 600 degrees C and in the presence of syngas, no conversion was observed on WC while ca. 20% and 10% conversions were observed on WZ and Amomax-10, respectively, at steady state for the reaction conditions used. This corresponds to intrinsic rates of 1.2 mu mol/g cat./s and 0.53 mu mol/g cat./s (0.021 mu mol/m(2) cat./s and 3.1 mu mol/m(2) cat./s), respectively, for WZ and Amomax-10.									11	0	0	1	0	11			0888-5885			WOS:000256656900006

This paper reports the results of an investigation into the use of W-based catalysts [tungsten carbide (WC), tungstated zirconia (WZ), and platinum supported on tungstated zirconia (PtWZ)] for catalytic tar removal. In this study, toluene was used as a model compound for tars. In the case of WZ, the effect of calcination temperature on the activity of toluene decomposition was also investigated. The toluene decomposition reaction was conducted at 1 atm, in the temperature range of 300-800 degrees C, and in the presence of 10% H-2. CH4 and benzene were the only detectable products of toluene decomposition on all the catalysts. Incorporation of 5 wt% Pt with WZ was found to give the most effective catalyst considering initial rates of product formation. WC, WZ, and PtWZ each showed an initial partial deactivation for both CH4 and benzene formation due to coke deposition on active sites. Pt incorporation had a significant effect on the steady-state activity of WZ for toluene decomposition at temperatures below 600 degrees C; however, at temperatures above 700 degrees C, the effect was nullified. All W-based catalysts showed comparable performance to that of a commercial cracking catalyst (ultra-stable Y zeolite) above 700 degrees C.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0888-5885			WOS:000256656900008

At 720 K the dimensionless figure of merit ZT reaches the state-of-the-art value of 1.53 for TAGS-75 and 1.50 for TAGS-80 and TAGS-85 samples, respectively. But the ZT value of the TAGS-90 sample is only 0.50 at 720 K due to the high carrier concentration. Utilizing high-resolution transmission electron microscope and selected area electron diffraction techniques, we identify a considerable number of nanoscale domains with typical size similar to 10 nm in the samples that show high ZT values. It is suggested that the presence of nanoscale domains, like the situation in PbTe-AgSbTe(2) compounds, should make a slight contribution to the low lattice thermal conductivity of TAGS compounds due to the enhanced mid-frequency phonon scattering.									105	5	0	1	0	105			0957-4484			WOS:000256455700029	21825832

Following preparation in a Kratschmer-Huffman electric-arc generator, the Tm3N@C-80 isomers were obtained by a chemical separation process followed by a one-stage isomer selective chromatographic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation (pyrenyl, 5PYE column). The HPLC chromatographic retention behavior on a pentabromobenzyl (5PBB) column suggests a charge transfer of similar to 6 electrons; [M3N](6+)@C-80(6-) and the chromatographic retention mechanisms of the I-h and the D-5h isomers of Tm3N@C-80 on both 5PBB and 5PYE columns are discussed. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data demonstrate that the Tm3N cluster has a planar structure but represents a tight fit for trapping the Tm3N cluster inside the I-h- and the D-5h-C-80 cages. Specifically, the Tm atoms punch out the cage carbon atoms adjacent to them, The "punched out" effect can be demonstrated by cage radii and pyramidal angles at cage carbon atoms near the Tm atoms. The magnetic susceptibility (chi T) for Tm3N@ I-h-C-80 was found to exhibit Curie-Weiss behavior with C = 23.4 emu center dot K/mol, which is consistent with the calculated value for three uncoupled Tm3+ ions by considering the spin and orbital contributions with no quenching of the orbital angular momentum (L = 5, S = 1, and J = 6; C-calcd = 23.3 emu center dot K/mol). The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that both the I-h and the D-5h isomers of Tm3N@C-80 have a large electrochemical gap.									42	4	0	5	0	44			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000256591400030	18447327	
J	Satishkumar, Rohan; Vertegel, Alexey								Charge-directed targeting of antimicrobial protein-nanoparticle conjugates								BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING				100	3			403	412		10.1002/bit.21782			JUN 15 2008	2008	Use of antimicrobial enzymes covalently attached to nanoparticles is of great interest as an antibiotic-free approach to treat microbial infections. Intrinsic properties of nanoparticles can also be used to add functionality to their conjugates with biomolecules. Here, we show in a model system that nanoparticle charge can be used to enhance delivery and increase bactericidal activity of an antimicrobial enzyme, lysozyme. Hen egg lysozyme was covalently attached to two types of polystyrene latex nanoparticles: positively charged, containing aliphatic amine surface groups, and negatively charged, containing sulfate and chloromethyl surface groups. In the case of bacterial lysis assay with a Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus lysodeikticus, activity of lysozyme conjugated to positively charged nanoparticles was approximately twice as large as that of free lysozyme, while lysozyme conjugated to negatively charged nanoparticles showed little detectable activity. At the same time, when assayed using a low-molecular weight oligosaccharide substrate, lysozyme attached to both positively and negatively charged nanoparticles showed slightly lower activity than free enzyme. A possible explanation of these results is that lysozyme attached to negatively charged nanoparticles cannot be effectively targeted to the bacteria because of the electrostatic Coulombic repulsion from the negatively charged bacterial cell walls, whereas lysozyme conjugated to positively charged nanoparticles was targeted better than free enzyme due to stronger electrostatic attraction to bacteria. Zeta potential measurements confirmed the validity of this hypothesis. Thus, nanoparticle charge is an important factor that can be used to control targeting and activity of protein-nanoparticle conjugates.									21	0	0	10	0	22			0006-3592			WOS:000255883600001	18183633	
J	Darlington, Ramona; Lehmicke, Leo; Andrachek, Richard G.; Freedman, David L.								Biotic and abiotic anaerobic transformations of trichloroethene and cis-1,2-dichloroethene in fractured sandstone								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				42	12			4323	4330		10.1021/es702196a			JUN 15 2008	2008	A fractured sandstone aquifer at an industrial site in southern California is contaminated with trichloroethene (TCE) and cis-1,2-dichloroethene(cis-DCE) to depths in excess of 244 m. Field monitoring data suggest that TCE is undergoing reduction to cis-DCE and that additional attenuation is occurring. However, vinyl chloride (VC) and ethene have not been detected in significant amounts, so that if transformation is occurring, a process other than reductive dechlorination must be responsible. The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of biotic and abiotic transformation processes at this site for TCE, cis-DCE, and VC. Anaerobic microcosms were constructed with site groundwater and sandstone core samples. C-14-labeled compounds were used to detect transformation products (e.g., CO2 and soluble products) that are not readily identifiable by headspace analysis. The microcosms confirmed the occurrence of biotic reduction of TCE to cis-DCE, driven by electron donor in the groundwater and/or sandstone. VC and ethene were not detected. Following incubation periods up to 22 months, the distribution of C-14-indicated statistically significant transformation of [C-14]TCE and [C-14] cis-DCE in live microcosms, to as high as 10% (CO2)-C-14 from TCE and 20% (CO2)-C-14 from cis-DCE. In autoclaved microcosms, significant transformation of [C-14]TCE and [C-14] cis-DCE also occurred; although some (CO2)-C-14 accumulated, the predominant C-14 product was soluble and could not be stripped by N-2 from an acidic solution (referred to as nonstrippable residue, or NSR). Characterization of the NSR by high-performance liquid and ion chromatography identified glycolate, acetate, and formate as significant components. These results suggest that a combination of abiotic and biotic transformation processes is responsible for attenuation of TCE and cis-DCE in the fractured sandstone aquifer. Tracking the distribution of C-14 during the microcosm study was essential for observing these phenomena.									16	0	0	12	0	16			0013-936X			WOS:000256705600017	18605550

Relating the survival and growth of planted longleaf pine seedlings to microsite conditions altered by site preparation treatments								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				255	11			3768	3777		10.1016/j.foreco.2008.03.013			JUN 15 2008	2008	Pine plantations in the southeastern United States are often created using site preparation treatments to alleviate site conditions that may limit survival or growth of planted seedlings. However, little is understood about how site preparations affect longleaf pine (Pinus palustris P. Miller) seedlings planted on wet sites. In a 2-year study (2004 and 2005) on poorly drained, sandy soils of Onslow County, North Carolina, we examined the effects of common site preparation treatments on microsite conditions and quantified relationships between microsite conditions and longleaf pine seedling survival and growth. Treatments used in the study included site preparations designed to control competing vegetation (chopping and herbicide) combined with those that alter soil conditions (mounding and bedding). During both years, mounding and bedding treatments reduced the amount of moisture within the top 6 cm of soil and increased soil temperatures when compared to flat planting (p < 0.001). Soil moisture was inversely related to seedling mortality in 2004 (r(2) = 0.405) and inversely related to root collar diameter in 2005 (r(2) = 0.334), while light was positively related to root collar diameter in 2005 (r(2) = 0.262). Light availability at the seedling level was highest on treatments that effectively reduced surrounding vegetation. Herbicides were more effective than chopping at controlling vegetation in 2004 (p < 0.001) and 2005 (p = 0.036). Controlling competing vegetation, especially shrubs, was critical for increasing early longleaf pine seedling growth. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

By making nanotubes uniformly magnetized, one eliminates the attraction caused by periodicity of nanoparticles in magnetic chains. The discreteness of individual nanoparticles in the nanoneedles is not observed and these nanoneedles interact by their magnetic poles. Since the attraction/repulsion events are predictable, the suspensions of magnetic nanotubes are attractive candidates for active elements in changeable diffraction gratings, filters, and polarizers.

The chemical composition and the conformation of the molecules at the interface are identified and correlated with the interfacial energies. A modified form of the Optimized Parameter for Liquid Simulation All-Atom (OPLS-AA) force field of Jorgensen and co-workers [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106, 6638 (1984); 118, 11225 (1996); J. Phys. Chem. A 105, 4118 (2001)], which includes specific dihedral terms for H-F blocks-and corrections to the H-F nonbonded interaction, is used together with a new version of the exp-6 force field developed in this work. Both force fields yield good agreement with the available experimental liquid density and surface tension data as well as each other over significant temperature ranges and for a variety of chain lengths and compositions. The interfacial regions of semifluorinated alkanes are found to be rich in fluorinated groups compared to hydrogenated groups, an effect that decreases with increasing temperature but is independent of the fractional length of the fluorinated segments. The proliferation of fluorine at the surface substantially lowers the surface tension of the diblock copolymers, yielding values near those of perfluorinated alkanes and distinct from those of protonated alkanes of the same chain length. With decreasing temperatures within the liquid state, chains are found to preferentially align perpendicular to the interface, as previously seen.

A classical strategy is to replace each quadratic term with a continuous variable and to enforce, for each such product, four linear inequalities that ensure the continuous variable equals the associated product. By employing a transformation of variables, we show how such inequalities give rise to a network structure, so that the continuous relaxations can be readily solved.

The pore structure was interpreted by applying chi-theory, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methodology, t-plots, adsorption potential distribution (APD), and nonlocal density functional theory (NL-DFT) to experimental N-2 adsorption isotherms. Pore size and pore volume calculations from chi-theory are in agreement with those from APD and NL-DFT, respectively, whereas, those from the BET, BJH, and t-plot methods are not. However, chi-theory underestimates the total surface area. The validated porosity and surface area results, pore size distribution, and APD were then studied as a function of burnoff value. The pore structure evolution analysis of both types of ACFs showed that the addition of palladium acetylacetonate to the pitch, prior to fiber formation, causes (i) the formation of macropores, (ii) a small increase in microporosity during the early stages of activation, and (iii) increased mesoporosity at burnoff values of > 60%. The presented data and analysis provide a new understanding of the porous structure of novel pitch-based activated carbon adsorbents and potential hydrogen storage materials.									7	1	0	1	0	8			0888-5885			WOS:000256290100014

Recently, we observed an excess density of states in the vibrational spectrum of the vitreous silica surface using inelastic He atom scattering. A surface phonon spectral density was readily extracted from the recorded data and the excess density of states was attributed to the surface manifestation of the boson peak phenomenon of disordered structures. Here we present further data analysis and show that the intensity of the surface boson peak at constant energy, i.e.,rho(zz)( Delta E = const, Delta(K) under bar)/rho(Debye), strongly depends upon the parallel momentum transfer with a maximum in the neighborhood of approximate to 1 nm(-1). In contrast, the position of the maximum intensity of the surface boson peak shows negligible Delta(K) under bar dependence and is seen as a dispersionless mode at 3.7 +/- 0.4 meV. Measurements of the width of the surface boson peak are also presented.					12th International Conference on Vibrations at Surfaces12th International Conference on Vibrations at Surfaces	JUL 20-26, 2007JUL 20-26, 2007		Erice, ITALYErice, ITALY	2	0	0	0	0	2			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000256145700006

An aqueous suspension of PFO nanoparticles prepared by a reprecipitation method was observed to exhibit spectroscopic characteristics consistent with the glassy phase of the polymer. We demonstrate that controlled addition of organic solvent leads to partial transformation of the disordered polymer chains into the planarized conformation (beta-phase), with the fractions of each component phase dependent on the amount of solvent added. Fluorescence spectroscopy of the PFO nanoparticles containing beta-phase indicates efficient energy transfer from the glassy-phase regions of the nanoparticles to the beta-phase regions. Salient features of the nanoparticles containing beta-phase include narrow, red-shifted fluorescence and increased fluorescence quantum yield as compared to the glassy-phase nanoparticles. Fluorescence lifetime measurements indicate that the increased quantum yield of the beta-phase PFO originates from a decrease in the nonradiative decay rate, with little change in the radiative rate. This decrease is likely due to exciton trapping by the beta-phase, which leads to a reduction in the energy transfer efficiency to quencher species present within the nanoparticle.									75	2	0	9	0	76			0743-7463			WOS:000256232900033	18459748

We studied the dependence of pattern morphology on the polymer's molecular weight and thickness of the polymer layer, and observed the formation of three distinctive structures. The structure formed by large drops of polymer is characteristic of a polymer with low molecular weight and the thinnest polymer layer, whereas other samples form holes or a weblike pattern upon dewetting. These experiments have demonstrated for the first time the reversibility of the dewetting process in a liquid environment. The polymer layer has revealed reversible behavior toward flat film when exposed to a pH 4 buffer solution. More complex structures can be obtained by consecutive treatments with acidic (pH 4) and basic (pH 10) solutions. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study both the morphology and elastic properties of polymers in media with different acidity, in order to determine the mechanism behind the dewetting process.									15	0	0	2	0	15			0743-7463			WOS:000256232900040	18465886

The usual self-stabilizing model only allows for nodes to make decisions based on the states of their immediate neighbors. We provide a general transformation for constructing self-stabilizing algorithms which utilize distance-k knowledge. Our transformation has both a slowdown and space overhead in n(O(logk)) and might be thought of as a distance-k resource allocation algorithm. Our main application is a polynomial-time self-stabilizing algorithm for finding maximal irredundant sets, a problem which seems to require distance-4 information. These results can be generalized to efficiently find maximal P-sets, for properties P which we call local monotonic.

Reducing airborne ectomycorrhizal fungi and growing non-mycorrhizal loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings in a greenhouse								MYCORRHIZA				18	5			269	275		10.1007/s00572-008-0176-3			JUN 2008	2008	Atmospheric spores of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are a potential source of contamination when mycorrhizal studies are performed in the greenhouse, and techniques for minimizing such contamination have rarely been tested. We grew loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) from seed in a greenhouse and inside a high-efficiency particulate air-filtered chamber (HFC) constructed within the same greenhouse. Seedlings were germinated in seven different sand- or soil-based and artificially based growth media. Seedlings grown in the HFC had fewer mycorrhizal short roots than those grown in the open greenhouse atmosphere. Furthermore, the proportion of seedlings from the HFC that were completely non-mycorrhizal was higher than that of seedlings from the greenhouse atmosphere. Seedlings grown in sterilized, artificially based growth media (> 50% peat moss, vermiculite, and/or perlite by volume) had fewer mycorrhizal short roots than those grown in sand- or soil-based media. The HFC described here can minimize undesirable ECM colonization of host seedlings in greenhouse bioassays. In addition, the number of non-mycorrhizal seedlings can be maximized when the HFC is used in combination with artificially based growth media.									6	0	0	4	2	7			0940-6360			WOS:000256912900006	18481117

The title catalyst has higher acid site density, better esterification activity of both small and large free fatty acids (acetic acid and palmitic acid), and better reusability than the previously reported carbon-based catalyst prepared by sulfonating pyrolyzed sugar. This catalyst also exhibited higher esterification activity than tungstated zirconia (WZ) and Silica-Supported Nafion (Nafion(R)SAC-13). The higher activity of the sulfonated carbon composite solid acid catalyst was clearly due to the presence of a much higher acid site density than any of the other catalysts.									102	14	0	15	0	109			1011-372X			WOS:000256081700001

Frequently, research has involved comparing completely conventional and organic farming systems over many years. This study was conducted to test whether the use of organic fertilizers versus synthetic fertilizers improved soil fertility and sweet corn (Zea mays L. var rugosa Bonaf.) vigor, yield, size, and nutrient content and minimized nitrate (NO3) leaching and runoff after a single growing season. Sweet corn vigor, yield, and nutrient content were superior for synthetically fertilized sweet corn compared to organically fertilized corn. Runoff NO3 levels were similar regardless of fertilizer type. The use of organic fertilizers neither improved crop yield and quality nor reduced NO3 loss after a single season. These findings are consistent with previous research that reports that more than a single season of organic management is needed to improve soil properties and increase yields.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0010-3624			WOS:000256968400017

As an approach to raise thermal conductivity (TC) of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (Elvax (TM) 260), it was compounded with carbon based nanofillers: multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), vapor grown carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and expanded graphite (EG) as well as metallized CNFs, nickel nanostrands, boron nitride, and powdered aluminum. Ribbons and tubing of the nanocomposites, in which the nanofillers were aligned in the direction of flow, were extruded. Compression molding was used to fabricate nanocomposites in which the nanofillers were randomly oriented. TC of the samples was measured in the direction of, and perpendicular to, the alignment direction and significant improvement in TC (up to 24-fold) was observed when measurements were made in the direction of alignment.

In this study, a laboratory investigation was carried out on the volumetric properties of CRM mixtures fabricated using the Superpave gyratory compactor (SGC) and the Marshall compactor as a function of compaction temperature. Two CRM binders were incorporated into HMA mixtures. Two other mixtures were produced with the control binder (PG 64-22) and SBS-modified binder (PG 76-22) and used for comparison purposes. The CRM binders were produced using one base binder (PG 64-22) with 10% or 15% ambient CRM (-40 mesh) by weight of the binder. For this research, the Superpave and the Marshall mix designs for four different asphalt binders were conducted to determine the optimum asphalt contents (OAC). A total of 128 specimens were manufactured using the SGC and the Marshall compactor at various compaction temperatures (116, 135, 154, and 173 degrees C). The volumetric properties were obtained and analyzed using the statistical methods. The results from this study indicated that (1) the compaction temperatures used in this study significantly affected the volumetric properties of the CRM mixtures, regardless of the compaction methods (the SGC and the Marshall compactor); (2) the CRM mixtures in both the SGC and the Marshall compactor showed the higher VMA values than the control and SBS-modified mixtures; (3) a general trend of the volumetric properties as a function of compaction temperature and compaction method was found for the CRM mixtures used in this study.

J	Doh, Young S.; Amirkhanian, Serji N.; Kim, Kwang W.								Analysis of unbalanced binder oxidation level in recycled asphalt mixture using GPC								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				22	6			1253	1260		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.01.026			JUN 2008	2008	In a conventional hot-mix asphalt recycling process, the reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), generally, is mixed with the virgin binder and aggregates and, sometimes, recycling agent. During this process, all materials are mixed for a short time period, the aged binder in the RAP is expected to be melting off from the old aggregate and rejuvenated by virgin binder. To evaluate whether or not the RAP binder is well rejuvenated, gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) test was performed for the binders located oil virgin and RAP aggregate particles separately in a recycled mixture. Large molecular size (LMS) of each binder was evaluated and absolute viscosity of the binder was estimated based on the LMS data. It was found that there was a significant difference between LMS levels of the binders coating RAP and virgin aggregates in the same recycled mixture. This discrepancy is a shortcoming of the conventional recycling method, which should be corrected by some technique for producing better quality recycled materials. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We collected scales to determine age and growth of four species of the catostomid assemblage (northern hogsucker Hypentelium nigricans, spotted sucker Minytrema melanops, notchlip redhorse Moxostoma collapsum and robust redhorse Moxostoma robustum) of the Savannah River, Georgia-South Carolina in spring 2004 and 2005. Robust redhorse was the largest species; reaching sexual maturity at an older age and growing faster as a juvenile than the other species. Spotted sucker did not achieve the same size as robust redhorse, but reached sexual maturity at younger ages. Notchlip redhorse was intermediate between the abovementioned two species in age at maturity and size. Northern hogsucker was the smallest species of the assemblage and reached the sexual maturity at the age of three. Both robust redhorse and spotted sucker were sexually dimorphic in size-at-age. The range of life history strategies employed by Savannah River catostomids encompasses the range of life history strategies exhibited within the family as a whole.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0906-6691			WOS:000255552200012

NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF TURBULENT JETS								ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID MECHANICS				2	2			234	243					JUN 2008	2008	In this study, plane and circular turbulent non-buoyant jets are simulated numerically using a three-dimensional computational model. The aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of turbulent closure schemes employed in three-dimensional models. In particular, standard k-epsilon and renormalized group k-epsilon schemes with standard coefficients are evaluated. The modeled jets are deeply submerged, that is the impact of free surface and solid boundaries on jets are eliminated. The accuracy of the turbulent schemes is assessed by analyzing the decay of centerline velocity, jet growth rates, similarity of longitudinal and vertical velocity profiles, and turbulent kinetic energy profiles. The results from the two turbulent closure schemes are compared with accepted experimental and theoretical studies to determine their accuracy. It is found that the k-epsilon scheme with standard coefficient performs equally well and in some cases better than the renormalized group k-epsilon scheme. Finally, the model is applied to analyze flow pattern in the Sampit River, South Caroline, USA, resulting from stormwater discharge in a recreational area. Various inlet designs are investigated and box inlet is found to provide a practical means of localizing high surface currents.									19	2	0	0	0	19			1994-2060			WOS:000207527000009

Klaine, Stephen/C-5352-2011				Influence of copper exposure on whole-body sodium levels in larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas)								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				27	6			1442	1449		10.1897/07-467.1			JUN 2008	2008	Because metals such as Cu inhibit ionoregulation, the increased energy requirement to counter passive diffusive losses in soft water may translate into increased sensitivity to metal exposure. We developed a method to determine whole-body Na concentrations of larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as a physiological indicator of health. This method was used to characterize net rates of Na flux from fish exposed to Cu in the presence of varying levels of hardness and alkalinity. In extremely soft waters (hardness, <= 10 mg/L as CaCO(3)), larval fish experienced rates of net whole-body Na loss greater than what has been observed in juvenile and adult fish when exposed to Cu at concentrations near the median lethal concentration. Elevating hardness (>10 mg/L as CaCO(3)), however, decreased the apparent kinetics of Na loss caused by Cu exposure, which suggests the process was related to uncompetitive inhibition of Cu by hardness cations. Although the percentage of Na loss associated with mortality in larval fish was similar to that in juvenile and adult fish (30% loss of exchangeable Na pool), larvae reached this level within 12 h of exposure, and it was not representative of the onset of mortality. These results suggested that ionoregulatory measures by themselves are not a conclusive metric for Cu regulation using larval fish. To account for increased sensitivity in low-hardness waters in the development of biotic ligand models, the critical amount of Cu associated with the gill to cause mortality (i.e., the median lethal accumulation value) should be characterized more appropriately as a function of hardness below 20 mg/L as CaCO(3).									5	0	0	5	0	5			0730-7268			WOS:000255906100026	18229972

Internet presents an attractive medium for the researcher to collect large amounts of data with relatively little effort. The questionnaires can be available to respondents all over the world, 24 h a day, with very little labor involved. The questionnaires can be electronically scored immediately upon completion. Results can then be stored in an analyzable form or be used instantly to redirect the respondent to follow-up questionnaires. Nonetheless, good questionnaire design and psychometric principles still apply. This is true even when porting a valid paper and pencil test to the Internet. In addition, technical and logistical issues in web-based testing can affect the reliability and validity of the questionnaires. Researchers are cautioned to follow good questionnaire development practices and consider the unique problems of Internet-based instruments.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0954-691X			WOS:000258020500006	18467908

There are few studies of training program impact on food safety behaviors within food production and processing settings. Our research objectives were to develop, implement and evaluate a pilot food safety educational program for Hispanic workers in the mushroom industry using the results of a needs assessment and elements from the knowledge and motivational systems of the Health Action Model (HAM). The impact of three independent variables was tested in the pilot test: (1) The food safety educational lessons (knowledge system); (2) the supervisors acting as role models and food safety rules encouragers (motivational system - expectancy & instrumentality); and (3) a monetary incentive (motivational system - valence). The dependent variables (behaviors), included three different handwashing opportunities plus jewelry and hairnet usage. The educational lessons alone produced a significant increase in knowledge and handwashing after using the restroom. With supervisor post lesson enforcement, handwashing before work and after breaks also increased significantly. No effect of the monetary incentive was observed. Thus, training must be followed by supervisory personnel enforcement of behavioral rules. Management support of the supervisory role will increase the success in any food safety program within the industry. Based on these findings the HAM model can serve as a guide to develop customized food safety educational materials at a variety of different settings and target audiences in food production facilities.

The resulting runoff can escape from production areas and negatively impact surface and ground water. Constructed wetlands (CWs) have been shown to be a simple, low-technology method for treating agricultural, industrial, and municipal wastewater. We investigated the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal potential by a vegetated, laboratory-scale subsurface flow (SSF) CW system. Over an 8-week period, five commercially available aquatic garden plants received a range of N and P (0.39 to 36.81 mg.L(-1) N and 0.07 to 6.77 mg.L(-1) P) that spanned the rates detected in nursery runoff. Whole plant dry weight was positively correlated with N and P supplied. Highest N and P recovery rates were exhibited by Thalia geniculata f. rheumoides Shuey and Oenenathe javanica (Blume) DC. 'Flamingo', Phyla lanceolata (Michx.) Greene also had high P recovery rates. The potential exists for using SSF CWs to concomitantly produce aquatic garden plants and attenuate nutrients in a sustainable nursery enterprise.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0018-5345			WOS:000256245900223

Winter foot and equipment traffic impacts on a 'L93' creeping bentgrass putting green								HORTSCIENCE				43	3			922	926					JUN 2008	2008	Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera var. palustris Huds.) is desirable as a putting green turfgrass in the transition zone as a result of year-round green color, ball roll, and playability. However, management challenges exist for bentgrass greens, including winter temperature fluctuations. Frosts often cause cancellations or delays of tee time resulting in lost revenue. In response to this winter golf course management issue, a research project was initiated at Clemson University from 1 Dec. 2005 and 2006 to 1 Aug. 2006 and 2007 on a 'L93' creeping bentgrass putting green to determine the impacts of foot traffic or mower traffic and time of traffic application on bentgrass winter performance. Treatments consisted of no traffic (control), foot traffic, and walk-behind mower traffic (rolling) at 0700 and 0900 HR when canopy temperatures were at or below 0 T. Foot traffic included approximate to 75 steps within each plot using size 10 SP-4 Saddle Nike golf shoes (soft-spiked sole) administered by a researcher weighing approximate to 75 kg. A Toro Greens-master 800 walk-behind greens mower weighing 92 kg with a 45.77-cm roller was used for rolling traffic. Data collected included canopy and soil temperatures (7.6 cm depth), visual turfgrass quality (TQ), clipping yield (g.m(-2)), shoot chlorophyll concentration (mg.g(-1)) root total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) (mg.g(-1)), soil bulk density (g.cm(-3)), and water infiltration rates (cm.h(-1)). Time and type of traffic significantly influenced bentgrass winter performance. On all TQ rating dates, 0700 HR rolling traffic decreased TQ by approximate to 1.1 units compared with foot traffic at 0700 HR. In December, regardless of traffic application time, rolling traffic reduced bentgrass shoot growth approximate to 17%. However, in February, chlorophyll, soil bulk density, and water infiltration differences were not detected. By the end of March, all treatments had acceptable TQ. Root TNC was unaffected in May, whereas shoot chlorophyll concentrations were unaffected in May and August. This study indicates bentgrass damage resulting from winter traffic is limited to winter and early spring months and full recovery should be expected by summer.									5	1	0	5	0	6			0018-5345			WOS:000256245900233		
J	Pundlik, Shrinivas J.; Birchfield, Stanley T.								Real-time motion segmentation of sparse feature points at any speed								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS				38	3			731	742		10.1109/TSMCB.2008.919229			JUN 2008	2008	We present a real-time incremental approach to motion segmentation operating on sparse feature points. In contrast to previous work, the algorithm allows for a variable number of image frames to affect the segmentation process, thus enabling an arbitrary number of objects traveling at different relative speeds to be detected. Feature points are detected and tracked throughout an image sequence, and the features are grouped using a spatially constrained expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that models the interactions between neighboring features using the Markov assumption. The primary parameter used by the algorithm is the amount of evidence that must accumulate before features are grouped. A statistical goodness-of-fit test monitors the change in the motion parameters of a group over time in order to automatically update the reference frame. Experimental results on a number of challenging image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the technique.									15	1	0	1	0	16			1083-4419	1941-0492		WOS:000258763600013	18558538

Electrophysiological and immunocytochemical characterization of DRG neurons on an organosilane surface in serum-free medium								IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-ANIMAL				44	5-6			162	168		10.1007/s11626-008-9097-x			JUN 2008	2008	We are attempting to recreate a stretch reflex circuit on a patterned Bio-MEMS (bio-microelectromechanical systems) chip with deflecting micro-cantilevers. The first steps to recreate this system is to be able to grow individual components of the circuit (sensory neuron, motoneuron, skeletal muscle, and muscle spindle) on a patternable, synthetic substrate coating the MEMS device. Sensory neurons represent the afferent portion of the stretch reflex arc and also play a significant role in transmitting the signal from the muscle spindle to the spinal cord motoneurons. We have utilized a synthetic silane substrate N-1[3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl) diethylenetriamine (DETA) on which to grow and pattern the cells. DETA forms a self-assembled monolayer on a variety of silicon substrates, including glass, and can be patterned using photolithography. In this paper, we have evaluated the growth of sensory neurons on this synthetic silane substrate. We have investigated the immunocytochemical and electrophysiological properties of the sensory neurons on DETA and compared the resultant properties with a biological control substrate (ornithine/laminin). Immunocytochemical studies revealed the survival and growth of all three subtypes of sensory neurons: trkA, trkB, and trkC on both surfaces. Furthermore, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used to study the electrophysiological properties of the sensory neurons on the two surfaces. There were no significant differences in the electrical properties of the neurons grown on either surface. This is the first study analyzing the immunocytochemical and electrophysiological properties of sensory neurons grown long-term in a completely defined environment and on a nonbiological substrate.									8	0	0	7	0	8			1071-2690			WOS:000256082000006	18478304

The nanoparticles have a typical size of 30-40 nm while the nano-layer can be up to several hundreds of nanometer thick. The nanoparticle layer, which resides at the grain boundary after hotpressing, provides an extra scattering channel for phonons, in addition to the "rattler" atoms (La), grain boundary scattering, and mass fluctuation mechanisms found within the bulk matrix grain. The electrical resistivity, thermopower, thermal conductivity, and Hall coefficient have been investigated as a function of temperature and the weight percentage (%) of nanoparticles. Largely due to the reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a ZT value of similar to 0.5 is attained at 725 K on the sample with 5 wt % of nanoparticles showing a 15% improvement of the ZT from that of the sample without nanoparticles and comparable to the best value reported at this temperature.

JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE				32	6			1120	1132		10.1016/j.jbankfin.2007.09.021			JUN 2008	2008	Analyst coverage has been cited increasingly as an important attribute in the selection of, an underwriter for a firm about to go public. However, it has also been alleged that affiliated analysts provide biased research. In this study, we examine these interrelated issues by examining the long-run performance of IPOs with coverage from their managing underwriters in a 1993-2003 sample. We find that (1) analysts' research coverage from their managing syndicate is not related to long-run performance; (2) long-run performance is not different for firms that receive all-star analyst coverage; and (3) investors are not systematically worse off for following lead underwriter recommendations.

This product is produced in facilities across the United States and often marketed based on region of manufacture, implying that regional differences in flavor character of the cheese exist. This study was conducted to determine if regional differences in flavor exist In the aged U.S. Cheddar cheeses. Three times per year for 2 y, triplicate 18-kg blocks of Cheddar cheese (< 60 d old) were obtained from 19 manufacturing facilities located in 4 major cheese- producing regions/states. California, Northwest, Midwest, and Northeast. A trained sensory panel documented the flavor characteristics of cheeses after 6-, 9-, 12-, 18-, and 24-mo ripening at 7 degrees C. Regional differences were observed for specific flavors for cheese ufactured in the Northwest, Midwest, and Northeast across ripening (P < 0.05), but the specific flavors responsible for these effects were not consistent across ripening. Similarly, cheese make procedure effects were also ob for specific flavors across ripening (P < 0.05), but these differences were also not consistent across ripening impact of region and cheese make procedure on flavor of the aged Cheddar cheeses was small in comparison to consistently documented, facility-specific flavor differences (P < 0.0001). Flavor profiles of aged Cheddar cheeses were most strongly influenced by practices specific to manufacturing facility rather than region of manufacture.									11	0	0	9	0	12			0022-1147			WOS:000256971200036	18577011

Segregation patterns of avirulence and virulence in the progeny suggested that avirulence on cv. K60 was controlled by a single gene derived from 84R-62B and tentatively named AvrK60. In the F(1) population, AvrK60 cosegregated with avirulence gene AvrPik on a small 1.6-Mb chromosome of 84R-62B and with the 1.6-Mb chromosome itself. Therefore, we suggest that, along with AvrPik, AvrK60 is also located on the 1.6-Mb chromosome of 84R-62B.									1	1	0	1	0	2			1345-2630			WOS:000256258800009

Liquefaction potential map of Charleston, South Carolina based on the 1886 earthquake								JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING				134	6			815	828		10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2008)134:6(815)			JUN 2008	2008	A liquefaction potential map of the peninsula of Charleston, S.C., is presented in this paper. Liquefaction potential is expressed in terms of the liquefaction potential index developed by Iwasaki and calculated using 44 cone penetration test profiles. The cone profiles are supplemented with information from the 1:24,000 scale geologic map by Weems and Lemon, several first-hand accounts of liquefaction and ground deformation that occurred during the 1886 Charleston earthquake, and liquefaction probabilities determined by Elton and Hadj-Hamou based on standard penetration tests. Nearly all of the cases of liquefaction and ground deformation occurred in the Holocene to late Pleistocene beach deposits that flank the higher-ground sediments of the Wando Formation. To match the observed field behavior, a deposit resistance correction factor of 1.8 is applied to cyclic resistance ratios calculated for the 100,000-year-old Wando Formation. No corrections are needed for the younger deposits. In additional to 1886 field behavior, the deposit resistance corrections are supported by ratios of measured to predicted shear-wave velocity.									18	0	0	0	0	18			1090-0241			WOS:000255969800004		
J	Kilbourne, William E.; Carlson, Les								The Dominant Social Paradigm, Consumption, and Environmental Attitudes: Can Macromarketing Education Help?								JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING				28	2			106	121		10.1177/0276146708314586			JUN 2008	2008	It has been argued that the dominant social paradigm (DSP) of Western industrial societies is complicit in environmental decline. In the present research, the DSP and its elements and their relation to consumption behavior are first addressed in classes on social responsibility that are taught in a business school. Two quasi-experiments are then conducted using an after-only with control group design (Study 1) and a before-after with control group design (Study 2). In both studies, attitudes of students in the social responsibility classes are compared to control groups of marketing students to determine the effects of instruction on the DSP and environmental attitudes. Findings suggest that lower scores on the DSP for the experimental group result in increased measures of environmental attitudes and perception of change necessary to ameliorate environmental degradation. However, in neither experiment does willingness to change one's own behavior materialize.									23	0	0	0	0	23			0276-1467			WOS:000207651800001

JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING				28	2			189	191		10.1177/0276146708316563			JUN 2008	2008	Because macromarketing is macro, its domain is necessarily broad. The question of how broad it is has not been adequately answered. This article proposes an institutional approach to the teaching of macromarketing. Although markets are, themselves, institutions, what is proposed here is examining the antecedent institutions for the development of markets. The set of antecedents proposed here includes economic, political, and technological institutions. The role of each in the development of market societies and the sustainability of such societies is critically examined. In each of the texts used in the course, it is argued that sustainability is tied directly to the economic, political, and technological institutions that underlie the market institutions that evolve. This approach expands the domain of macromarketing from agorology, the study of the market as an institution, to thesmology, the study of institutions.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0276-1467			WOS:000207651800009

It is known that if p is a prime, thenSigma(vertical bar r vertical bar < 2 root p) H(4p - r(2)) = 2p.In this paper, we investigate the behavior of this sum with the additional condition r equivalent to c (mod m). Three different methods will be explored for determining the values of such sums. First, we will count isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over finite fields. Second, we will express the sums as coefficients of modular forms. Third, we will manipulate the Eichler-Selberg trace formula for Hecke operators to obtain Hurwitz class number relations. The cases m = 2, 3 and 4 are treated in full. Partial results, as well as several conjectures, are given for m = 5 and 7. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

There are in fact a number of good reasons for which they should be considered. To this point though, they have not produced sufficiently good performance to garner much commercial interest. Presented here are the physical and chemical rationale by which they should show enhanced performance relative to conventional stationary phases. Most notably, the mass transport and hydrodynamic characteristics suggest applications in areas of macromolecule and prep-scale separations. Additionally, there exists an incredible wealth of polymer surface chemistries and potential derivatization pathways that greatly exceed what is practical on conventional silica supports. The potential for important impact suggests further research into polymer fiber phases.									26	2	0	13	0	27			1615-9306			WOS:000257467800005	18615816

Celebrity misbehavior in the NBA								JOURNAL OF SPORTS ECONOMICS				9	3			231	249		10.1477/1527002507301526			JUN 2008	2008	I compare and contrast theories of why NBA players misbehave on the court, then test them empirically. I find evidence that earnings are positively correlated with misbehavior and that both absolute and relative salary matter. For instance, a player who is highest paid on his team misbehaves roughly 7% more than one who is second-highest paid, even at the same salary level. This relative effect I interpret as due to lack of good substitutes for top players. I also find some evidence that personal preferences may be important in understanding misbehavior, but no evidence that immaturity or peer effects are important determinants of misbehavior in the NBA.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1527-0025			WOS:000255602800001

In particular there is a notable paucity of information on nesting and reproductive ecology. We studied the nesting ecology of Morelet's crocodile in northern Belize from 1992 through 1995. Nesting occurs at the onset of the wet season in mid-June and continues through mid-July (mean oviposition date =1 July +/- 10 days). Eggs hatch from mid-August through mid- to late September. Nesting effort at our primary study site remained relatively constant during 1992, 1993 and 1995, but nearly doubled in 1994; this appeared to reflect a regional trend. Natural and man-made islands are heavily used as nesting sites. Nesting success in 1993 and 1994 was consistently higher on natural islands when compared with man-made islands or shoreline sites. Nest losses were primarily due to flooding and raccoon Procyon lotor predation. Losses from predation were greatest in 1994 when unseasonably low water levels facilitated predator access to nests. Females probably reach sexual maturity in 7-8 years after attaining a total length of 150 cm. Mean clutch size (25.0 +/- 7.6; range = 9-42; n = 73) did not differ among years. Mean clutch size, egg width (EW), egg length, egg mass (EM) and clutch mass were positively correlated with female snout-vent length (SVL). Mean EW was the best predictor of female SVL. A partial correlation analysis of egg and clutch attributes found that independent of female SVL, EM increases with increasing clutch size.									37	0	0	40	4	40			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000256349000011

Towards a stable low-voltage torsional microscanner								MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS				14	6			725	737		10.1007/s00542-007-0500-4			JUN 2008	2008	Torsional micromirrors emerged recently as an effective means of light manipulation. Their fast response, low wavelength sensitivity, and easy mass production have made them an attractive technology to implement optical switching and scanning applications. In this work, we developed a rigorous model of an electrically-actuated torsional micromirror. We verified the model against experimental data and conducted a convergence analysis to determine the minimum size of a reduced-order model (ROM) capable of representing the microscanner response accurately. We used the optimal ROM to study the dynamics of a microscanner. We found that the microscanner response exhibits a softening-type nonlinearity whose magnitude increases as the magnitude of the bias voltage increases. This nonlinearity results in multiple stable solutions at excitation frequencies close to but less than the natural frequency of the first mode. Operating the mirror in this region can cause abrupt jumps in the mirror response, thereby degrading the scanner performance. Furthermore, for a certain voltage range, we observed a two-to-one internal resonance between the first two modes. Due to this internal resonance, the mirror exhibits complex dynamic behavior, which degrades the microscanner's performance. We formulated a simple design rule to avoid this problem.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0946-7076			WOS:000256026600004

We report observations of simultaneous occurrence of both these effects in a nickel sulfide nanoparticle (average diameter similar to 5 nm) solution and a simultaneous quantitative measurement of both. Intensity-dependent nonlinear transmission studies carried out using a 7 ns Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm by the Z-scan method, revealed efficient optical limiting in nickel sulfide nanoparticle suspensions. Induced nonlinear optical scattering was identified to be the mechanism of optical limiting, and absorption at 532 nm was found to saturate. A modi. cation of the conventional Z-scan implementation led to the retrieval of the saturation intensity, which is otherwise overshadowed by very strong nonlinear scattering.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1793-2920			WOS:000262138100005

This paper addresses both the meaning and measurement of secondary damages in the context Of a recent U.S. Supreme Court case where one state successfully sought secondary damages resulting from failure to deliver water under an interstate water compact.

After adjustment for tag loss, emigration, and mortality, the population size was estimated as 25,935 (95% confidence interval, 17,715-39,535) in 2005, 2,767 (838-5,031) in 2006, and 8,511 (5,211-14,674) in 2007. The cumulative catch rate from boat electrofishing averaged 20.47 Alabama shad per hour in 2005, 6.10 per hour in 2006, and 13.17 per hour in 2007. The relationship between population size (N) and electrofishing catch per unit effort (CPUE) was modeled by the equation N = -9008.2 + (electrofishing CPUE x 1616.4). Additionally, in 2007 the hook-and-line catch rate averaged 1.94 Alabama shad per rod hour, A predictive model relating the population size and hook-and-line CPUE of spawning American shad A. sapidissima was applied to Alabama shad hook-and-line CPUE and produced satisfactory results. Recent spawning populations of Alabama shad in the Apalachicola River are low relative to American shad populations in other southeastern U.S. rivers.									7	0	0	8	0	8			0275-5947			WOS:000257780100021

We have demonstrated in this paper that low-loss 3 pm and 4 gm wide channel waveguides can be fabricated using CHF3 and SF6 plasma etching, and lift-off, respectively. Additionally, lift-off does not change the structure of the waveguide during the fabrication whereas the structure of the plasma etched waveguide differs slightly from that of the films. Finally, channel waveguides fabricated using lift-off leads to a low RMS roughness of 10 +/- 2 nm, compared to those fabricated by a plasma etching process which lead to a higher RMS roughness of 1720 nm. As-fabricated waveguides have been found to exhibit optical propagation losses of 3-5 dB/cm at 1550 nm. These high losses are attributed to scattering by sidewall roughness and defects arising from the fabrication process. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We find a vanishing density of states at the Fermi level, which is consistent with the semiconducting behavior of AgSbTe(2). Various optical properties, including the dielectric function, absorption coefficient, and refractive index, as functions of the photon energy are also calculated with the sx-LDA and are found to be in good agreement with experiments. Phonon spectra obtained by the cumulant force constant method show that the optic modes of AgSbTe(2) are very low in frequency and should scatter strongly with acoustic modes during heat transport. The calculated specific-heat curve is in general agreement with experiment. Ag/Sb disorder is expected to have a small effect on the electrical transport but may introduce strong phonon scattering due to the large force constant disorder. The scattering of acoustic phonons by optic modes and the possible Ag/Sb disorder may explain the extremely low lattice thermal conductivity of AgSbTe(2).									39	7	0	0	0	40			1098-0121			WOS:000257289700049

QTL analysis for resistance to preharvest sprouting in rice (Oryza sativa)								PLANT BREEDING				127	3			268	273		10.1111/j.1439-0523.2007.01450.x			JUN 2008	2008	Preharvest sprouting (PHS) is caused by early breaking of seed dormancy. In Sichuan, a major hybrid rice seed production area of China, PHS in hybrid seeds originated from 'G46A' parent may lead to severe yield loss, causing serious damage to agricultural production. To detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) governing PHS, we developed an F(2) population of 164 plants derived from 'G46B' and 'K81', a near-isogenic introgression line of G46B, with high level of resistance to PHS. PHS was evaluated under controlled field and laboratory conditions. Using simple sequence repeat markers, we constructed a linkage map from this population and identified three QTLs for PHS, namely qPSR2, qPSR5 and qPSR8, which were located on chromosomes 2, 5 and 8, respectively. Among these QTLs, qPSR8, residing in the interval between RM447 and RM3754 on chromosome 8, was the major QTL controlling PHS, for it had a relative high logarithm of the odds (LOD) score and explained 43.04% of the phenotypic variation. These results were correspondent to those identified in extreme low germination rate plants (ELGP) using linkage and linkage disequilibrium. At all loci, 'K81' was responsible for enhancing the resistance to PHS.									17	8	0	17	0	23			0179-9541			WOS:000255287500009

Microrhizome development was observed in the presence of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) (0, 5 and 16 mu M) and benzyladenine (BA) (0, 0.32 and 1 mu M). Leaf, root, rhizome growth, and sugar use were measured weekly for 6 weeks in small vessels (180 ml) and four times in 23 weeks in larger vessels (2.5 l). MeJa reduced leaf, root, and rhizome biomass. BA had a positive effect on biomass accumulation. Microrhizome mass increased at a linear rate during 6 weeks of culture while roots and leaves accumulated biomass at an exponential rate. Sugar use correlated nearly directly to whole plant dry weight (DW) in the short and long-term experiments. Microrhizomes became a larger fraction of whole plant DW as plantlets aged. After 6 weeks, about 1.8 g of microrhizome DW per liter of media had been produced (in both time courses), and after 23 weeks, about 26 g of microrhizome DW per liter of media had been produced. Secondary rhizomes were first observed at 14 weeks, and most plants had them by 23 weeks. A method for rhizome production in a long-term culture system was described. The linear relationship between DW and sugar use will be useful in the eventual development of a model for sugar use to biomass to secondary metabolite production.									12	0	0	9	3	16			0167-6857			WOS:000255987000005

Using data from the 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004 American National Election Studies, we demonstrate that operationalizing religion as a rudimentary Protestant-Catholic affiliation dichotomy masks its influence on presidential approval. We find that religious affiliation, even when measured more precisely than with a Protestant-Catholic dichotomy, contributes less to models of presidential approval than do measures of religious commitment and (especially) orthodoxy of religious belief.									23	0	0	0	0	23			1065-9129	1938-274X		WOS:000256006400003

Effects of a prelay 6/85-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum inoculation alone or in conjunction with subsequent F-Strain M-gallisepticum inoculations during lay on the internal egg characteristics of commercial egg-laying hens								POULTRY SCIENCE				87	6			1120	1124		10.3382/ps.2008-00009			JUN 2008	2008	The effects of a prelay 6/85-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (6/85MG) inoculation alone or in conjunction with subsequent F-strain M. gallisepticum (FMG) inoculations during lay on the internal egg characteristics of commercial egg-laying hens were investigated. In the first 2 treatment groups, birds were sham inoculated or were inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk of age. In a third treatment group, birds were inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk in conjunction with a subsequent inoculation of FMG at 22 wk, and in a fourth treatment group, birds were inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk in conjunction with a subsequent inoculation of FMG at 45 wk. Percentage yolk weight, albumen weight, yolk moisture, and yolk lipid were determined at 24, 32, 43, 47, and 58 wk of hen age. The data from wk 24, 32, and 43 were analyzed separately from those at wk 47 and 58. Furthermore, yolk fatty acid profiles were determined at wk 58. The applied treatments affected yolk moisture and fatty acid profiles. Across wk 24, 32, and 43, yolk moisture content was higher in birds inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk and FMG at 22 wk when compared with control birds and those inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk alone. In addition, at wk 58, yolk palmitic, oleic, and linolenic acid concentrations were affected differently by treatment. A 22-wk FMG inoculation in birds previously inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk may increase yolk moisture content, and alterations in yolk palmitic, oleic, and linolenic acid levels with treatment may be manifested by disturbances in fatty acid synthesis.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0032-5791			WOS:000256437400016	18493000

Investigation of equal and opposing flow junctions								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT				161	3			127	134		10.1680/wama.2008.161.3.127			JUN 2008	2008	This paper presents an experimental study of a 90 degrees channel junction with equal and opposing flow in the upstream main channel. The aim of the study is to predict the size of the recirculation zones in the downstream branch channel that are formed as the flow makes a 90 degrees turn after colliding and the associated energy loss. Detailed three-dimensional velocity profiles are measured with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter in the upstream main channel and downstream branch channel for different width ratios of the main and branch channels and inlet Froude numbers. The velocity profiles are depth-averaged to determine the maximum width of the recirculation zones in the branch channel. The velocity and flow depth distributions in the main and branch channels near and within junctions are dependent on inlet Froude number and channel width ratio. An analytical model based on mass, momentum and energy principles is developed and used to predict the maximum width of the recirculation zones. The maximum relative error in the predicted maximum width of the separation zone is less than 6.5%.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1741-7589			WOS:000255768800003

While the deleterious effects of unloading on bone are well established, fewer studies have focused on the effects of radiation. We previously demonstrated that 2 Gy of ionizing radiation has deleterious effects on trabecular bone in mice 4 months after exposure. The present study investigated the skeletal response after total doses of proton radiation that astronauts may be exposed to during a solar particle event. We exposed mice to 0.5, 1 or 2 Gy of whole-body proton radiation and killed them humanely 117 days later. Tibiae and femora were analyzed using microcomputed tomography, mechanical testing, mineral composition and quantitative histomorphometry. Relative to control mice, mice exposed to 2 Gy had significant differences in trabecular bone volume fraction (-20%), trabecular separation (+11%), and trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (-19%). Exposure to 1 Gy radiation induced a nonsignificant trend in trabecular bone volume fraction (-13%), while exposure to 0.5 Gy resulted in no differences. No response was detected in cortical bone. Further analysis of the 1-Gy mice using synchrotron microCT revealed a significantly lower trabecular bone volume fraction (-13%) than in control mice. Trabecular bone loss 4 months after exposure to 1 Gy highlights the importance of further examination of how space radiation affects bone.

We focus on thirty mainline Protestant congregations (in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church [U.S.A.], and the United Methodist Church) in the northeastern United States that have formally considered the issue of homosexuality recently. Based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with these congregations' clergy, we assess how homosexuality became a public issue in each church and how each denomination influenced the process by which congregations responded. Building on previous research on the relationship between congregations and denominations, we find that denominational resources about homosexuality, primarily in the form of structured educational materials, narrow the range of social processes congregations adopt in response. The more educational resources and structured guidance denominations provided, the narrower the range of processes congregations took in response.									19	0	0	0	0	19			1069-4404			WOS:000257451100004		
J	Krishna, M. V. Balarama; Marcus, R. K.								Role of cathode identity in liquid chromatography particle beam glow discharge mass spectrometry								SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY				63	6			673	684		10.1016/j.sab.2008.04.007			JUN 2008	2008	A detailed evaluation of the role of cathode identity on the analytical and spectral characteristics of various organic, organometallic and metal analytes using liquid chromatography-particle beam/glow discharge mass spectrometry (LC-PB/GDMS) has been carried out. A cl.c. discharge, operating with argon as the support gas, was used throughout this work. In this study, Cu which has a relatively high sputtering rate, Ni which has moderate sputtering rate and Ta which has very low sputtering rate, are taken as cathode materials to study the ionization, fragmentation, and analytical characteristics of organic (caffeine, epigallocatechin gallate, pepticle as representative compounds), organometallic (selenomethionine, triethyl lead chloride as representative compounds) and metal (Fe, La, Cs and Pb) species. A range of discharge gas pressures (26.6-106.4 Pa) and currents (0.2-1.5 mA) were investigated with the test cathodes to determine their influence on the spectral composition and overall analytical response for the various test species. Calibration plots were obtained for all of the species for each of the three cathodes to determine the respective limits of detection. Relative detection limits in the range of 0.02 to 15 ng mL(-1) (0.002-1.5 ng, absolute) for the test species were found to be in the order ofCu > Ni > Ta: which follows the order of the sputtering characteristics of the respective cathodes. These studies rendered information about the respective discharge parameters' role in choosing the most appropriate cathode identity in PB-GDMS for application in the areas of organic, organometallic and inorganic species analysis.

The four waves involved in the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS) are described and the main theoretical models emerging from this study are presented and Summarized in graphic form. After considering the critical approaches to these theories, we present the most recent findings from this longitudinal research: (i) in the area of quantitative models, anticipating a downward assimilation at the beginning of adulthood; and (ii) in the area of qualitative interviews, identifying ways in which children of immigrants in a Situation of social disadvantage manage to escape this condition. The quantitative results provide strong Support for the effects of exogenous variables anticipated by the theory of segmented assimilation, and highlight the factors intervening during adolescence that mediate the influence of these variables during adult life. Qualitative evidence accumulated during the study's final phase point to three factors that may lead to exceptional educational performance among socially disadvantaged Young people.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0103-2070			WOS:000258973100002		
J	Gray, Margaret A.; Wang, Chung-Cheng; Sacks, Michael S.; Yoshimura, Naoki; Chancellor, Michael B.; Nagatomi, Jiro								Time-dependent alterations of select genes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat bladder								UROLOGY				71	6			1214	1219		10.1016/j.urology.2007.11.054			JUN 2008	2008	OBJECTIVES To investigate time-course changes in the expression of select genes and extracellular matrix proteins in the bladder of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, so as to examine the mechanisms underlying changes in mechanical properties of the bladder due to diabetic cystopathy.METHODS Female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin (65 mg/kg). Rats that were fed with 5% sucrose in drinking water served as diuretic controls, in addition to normal control rats. At the end of 2, 4, and 8 weeks, total ribonucleic acid (RNA) isolated from the detrusor layer of the bladders was reverse transcribed, and then complementary deoxyribonucleic acid was amplified with polymerase chain reaction primer sets for type I Collagen, type III Collagen, tropoelastin, and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta-1). Collagen and elastin contents of the bladders were quantified with commercially available assays.RESULTS Both diabetic and diuretic rat bladders exhibited significantly (P <0.05) lower expression of type I Collagen and TGF-beta-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) compared with normal controls at all time points tested. In contrast, downregulation of type III Collagen mRNA expression in both diabetic and diuretic groups was seen at 4 and 8 weeks. Furthermore, tropoelastin mRNA expression in the diabetic rat bladders was, compared with normal and diuretic rats, significantly (P <0.05) greater at 2 weeks. Both diabetic and diuretic rat bladders exhibited significantly (P <0.05) decreased Collagen and increased elastin protein content at 2 and 8 weeks.CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study suggest that increases in compliance of the bladders in diabetic cystopathy result not only from diuresis-driven reduction of Collagen synthesis but also from increased elastin synthesis.									8	1	0	6	0	9			0090-4295			WOS:000256653900059	18279932

Chemical, physical, and risk characterization of natural gas storage produced waters								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				191	1-4			33	54		10.1007/s11270-007-9605-8			JUN 2008	2008	Natural gas storage produced waters (NGSPWs) are brought to the surface when natural gas is reclaimed from underground storage. These waters may have a variety of constituents of concern that need to be treated before the water can be reused or discharged to receiving aquatic systems. The objective of this study was to characterize NGSPWs to discern potential constituents of concern that may limit surface discharge or beneficial reuse of these waters. We conducted a strategic review of literature, analyses of produced water composition records, and analyses of produced water samples provided by natural gas storage companies. Although NGSPWs varied widely in composition, primary constituents of concern included: chlorides (salinity), metals, metalloids, and organic compounds (e.g. oil and grease). Chlorides are the predominant constituent of concern in most NGSPWs. Strategies for risk mitigation of NGSPWs will need to be both robust and site specific to deal with the diverse composition of these waters.									14	0	0	6	0	14			0049-6979			WOS:000256011700004

Hexokinase (HK), the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to form glucose 6-phosphate. T. brucei harbors two HKs that are 98% identical at the amino acid level, T. brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1) and TbHK2. Recombinant TbHK1 (rTbHK1) has HK activity, whereas rTbHK2 does not. Unlike other eukaryotic HKs, TbHK1 is not subject to inhibition by ADP and glucose 6-phosphate. However, TbHK1 is inhibited by myristate, a critical fatty acid in T. brucei biology. We report here that rTbHKs, similar to authentic TbHK, form oligomers. Myristate dissociated these assemblies when incubated with either ATP or glucose. Furthermore, oligomer disruption was reversible by removal of myristate. Mixing of rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 monomers followed by reassembly yielded enzyme with an similar to 3-fold increase in specific activity compared with similarly treated rTbHK1 alone. Surprisingly, reassembly of rTbHK2 with an inactive rTbHK1 variant yielded an active HK, revealing for the first time that rTbHK2 is competent for HK activity. Finally, pyrophosphate inhibits active reassembled rTbHK2 oligomers but not oligomeric rTbHK1, suggesting that the two enzymes have distinct regulatory mechanisms.									19	0	0	18	0	19			0021-9258			WOS:000256232000008	18387941

The chromophores are readily soluble in common organic solvents and exhibit high thermal decomposition temperatures (highest T-d was 358 degrees C). Molecular hyperpolarizabilities (beta) of the chromophores were measured by hyper-Raleigh scattering at 1604 nm (highest beta was 20 000 x 10(-30) esu). The electrochemical behavior of the chromophores was studied by cyclic voltammetry and agreed well with the observed intrinsic nonlinearities. In addition, preliminary results of conjugated polyene chromophores containing aryl trifluorovinyl ether monomers were synthesized and copolymerized via thermal cyclodimerization, affording perfluorocyclobutyl aryl ether polymers with high glass transitions (highest T-g was 224 degrees C) and a good thermal stability (typical T-d was >350 degrees C). These chromophores can be used to develop electro-optic materials due to their large optical nonlinearities, good absorption characteristics, high thermal stability, and excellent solubility with organic solvents and polymeric materials.									31	2	0	1	0	32			1932-7447			WOS:000256099900044

After the exposure to UV-B, at a dose of 25 kJ/m(2) the concentration of vitamin D2 was increased to 36.7 +/- 1.4, 68.6 +/- 4.9, and 106.4 +/- 14.7 mu g/g (dry weight) for pileus, middle, and gill parts of shiitake mushroom, respectively. The gill side of whole shiitake mushrooms exposed to 0, 25, 50, and 75 kJ/m(2) increased to 2.8 +/- 0.2, 13.8 +/- 1.9, 40.7 +/- 4.4, and 61.9 +/- 10.6 mu g/g (dry weight) at 25 degrees C, respectively. Irradiating slices of white button mushroom was a more efficient way of increasing the vitamin D(2) content than irradiating the gill or pileus of whole mushrooms, due to the larger exposure area. As the irradiation doses increased, the vitamin D(2) concentration also increased for both types of mushrooms. In conclusion, exposure to ultraviolet light offers an effective way of increasing the concentration of vitamin D(2) in mushrooms.									35	3	0	29	0	40			0021-8561			WOS:000256034800033	18442245

Guided by the optical force from a weakly focused laser beam, a cell will move along the laser axis. Cells with different properties experience different optical forces and thus guidance speeds. The guidance speeds of the TC-1 cell and its genetically modified counterpart with only one gene change, L-10 cell, were studied under the same conditions. The results demonstrated that this laser guidance-based speed-measurement method can precisely distinguish cells that differ by only one gene.

Historically, supernovae were discovered mainly through their 'delayed' optical light (some days after the burst of neutrinos that marks the actual event), preventing observations in the first moments following the explosion. As a result, the progenitors of some supernovae and the events leading up to their violent demise remain intensely debated. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of a supernova at the time of the explosion, marked by an extremely luminous X-ray outburst. We attribute the outburst to the 'break-out' of the supernova shock wave from the progenitor star, and show that the inferred rate of such events agrees with that of all core-collapse supernovae. We predict that future wide-field X-ray surveys will catch each year hundreds of supernovae in the act of exploding.									264	7	1	5	0	268			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000256023700032	18497815	
J	Wu, Yonnie; Henry, David C.; Heim, Kyle; Tomkins, Jeffrey P.; Kuan, Cheng-Yi								Straw blood cell count, growth, inhibition and comparison to apoptotic bodies								BMC CELL BIOLOGY				9						26	10.1186/1471-2121-9-26			MAY 20 2008	2008	Background: Mammalian cells transform into individual tubular straw cells naturally in tissues and in response to desiccation related stress in vitro. The transformation event is characterized by a dramatic cellular deformation process which includes: condensation of certain cellular materials into a much smaller tubular structure, synthesis of a tubular wall and growth of filamentous extensions. This study continues the characterization of straw cells in blood, as well as the mechanisms of tubular transformation in response to stress; with specific emphasis placed on investigating whether tubular transformation shares the same signaling pathway as apoptosis.Results: There are approximately 100 billion, unconventional, tubular straw cells in human blood at any given time. The straw blood cell count (SBC) is 45 million/ml, which accounts for 6.9% of the bloods dry weight. Straw cells originating from the lungs, liver and lymphocytes have varying nodules, hairiness and dimensions. Lipid profiling reveals severe disruption of the plasma membrane in CACO cells during transformation. The growth rates for the elongation of filaments and enlargement of rabbit straw cells is 0.6 similar to 1.1 (mu m/hr) and 3.8 (mu m(3)/hr), respectively. Studies using apoptosis inhibitors and a tubular transformation inhibitor in CACO2 cells and in mice suggested apoptosis produced apoptotic bodies are mediated differently than tubular transformation produced straw cells. A single dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day of p38 MAPK inhibitor in wild type mice results in a 30% reduction in the SBC. In 9 domestic animals SBC appears to correlate inversely with an animal's average lifespan (R(2) = 0.7).Conclusion: Straw cells are observed residing in the mammalian blood with large quantities. Production of SBC appears to be constant for a given animal and may involve a stress-inducible protein kinase (P38 MAPK). Tubular transformation is a programmed cell survival process that diverges from apoptosis. SBCs may be an important indicator of intrinsic aging-related stress.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1471-2121			WOS:000256487400002	18492269	
J	Loeb, Susan C.; Waldrop, Thomas A.								Bat activity in relation to fire and fire surrogate treatments in southern pine stands								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				255	8-9			3185	3192		10.1016/j.foreco.2007.10.060			MAY 15 2008	2008	Forest managers often use thinning and prescribed burning to reduce the risk of wildfire and insect outbreaks. Because thinning and burning alter the structure of forest stands and may affect insect prey abundance, they may change the suitability of stands for bats. Our objective was to test the effects of thinning and burning on bat foraging and commuting activity in pine stands in the Clemson Experimental Forest in the Piedmont of South Carolina. We also tested whether vertical use of stands varied with treatment and whether activity of three common species varied among treatments. Twelve stands in the Clemson Experimental Forest dominated by loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (P. echinata) pine and at least 14 ha in size were selected and three replicates of four treatments were installed. The treatments were : (1) prescribed burning (Burn), (2) thinning to 18 m(2)/ha (Thin), (3) thinning to 18 m(2)/ha followed by prescribed burning (Thin&Burn) and (4) no treatment (Control). Bat activity was sampled with AnabatII bat detectors May-August 2001 and 2002. Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), and eastern pipistrelles (Perimyotis subflavus) were the most frequently recorded species and activity was significantly greater in 2001 than in 2002. In 2001, overall activity was significantly greater in the Thin stands than in the Control stands; activity in the Burn and Thin&Burn stands was intermediate. Activity was also greater in treated stands than in the Control stands in 2,002, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). In both years we recorded significantly more calls at 9 m than at 0.5 m above ground but the treatments did not affect vertical use of the stands. Activity of big brown bats and red bats was significantly higher in Thin stands than in Control or Burn stands, whereas activity of pipistrelles did not vary among treatments. Our results suggest that treatments that reduce clutter, particularly thinning, increase the suitability of pine stands for bats' foraging and commuting activity in the Piedmont region. Thus, use of these practices may help to preserve the biodiversity of managed pine forests in the South. Published by Elsevier B.V.									27	0	0	25	1	28			0378-1127			WOS:000256288800010

Visualization of shell matrix proteins in hemocytes and tissues of the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION				310B	3			227	239		10.1002/jez.b.21206			MAY 15 2008	2008	The tissues of the oyster were examined for the presence of shell matrix proteins (SMPs) using a combination of Western, proteomic, and epi-fluorescent microscopy techniques. SMP, including 48 and 55 kDa phosphoproteins, was detected in the epithelial cells of mantle, gill, heart, and adductor muscle and linings of arteries and veins. The 48kDa SMP circulates continuously within the hemolymph, and is present in the immune system hemocytes. It appears to be secreted from hemocytes on induction of shell repair. We suggest that the 48 and 55kDa proteins are multifunctional and bridge the process of soft tissue repair and shell formation by mediating cellular activities during immune response as well as interacting with the mineral phase during deposition.									9	0	0	9	0	9			1552-5007			WOS:000255770500003	18044742

We hope that this brief overview provides the engineers and researchers in the field with a perspective of the important issues that should be addressed to extend the life of next-generation fuel cells. Causes and fundamental mechanisms of cell degradation and their influence on long-term performance of fuel cells are discussed. Current research shows that main causes of short life and performance degradation are poor water management, fuel and oxidant starvation, corrosion and chemical reactions of cell components. Poor water management can cause dehydration or flooding, operation under dehydrated condition could damage the membrane whereas flooding facilitates corrosion of the electrodes, the catalyst layers, the gas diffusion media and the membrane. Corrosion products and impurities from outside can poison the cell. Thermal management is particularly important when the fuel cell is operated at sub-zero and elevated temperatures and is key at cold start-ups as well as when subjected to freezing conditions. 0 2008 Elsevier B.V.

With conversion of the fungi Mortierella alpina, modified lipids enhanced the oil profile with the addition of three PUFAs, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, gamma-CI8:3n6), arachidonic acid (ARA, C20:4n6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n3). The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid (P/S) increased 50% compared to the original canola oil. ARA yield of 20.3 mg/g flake was comparable to 20.1 mg/g glucose, and higher than 12.5 mg/g cake. EPA yield of 3.3 mg/g flake was greater than 2.7 mg/g cake, and much greater than 0.3 mg/g glucose. The mixed culture of two strains, M. alpina and Pythium irregulare, resulted in higher production of ARA and EPA than their single cultures. Mixed culture achieved ARA yields of 26 mg/g flake, 23 mg/g cake and 38 mg/g glucose, and had favorable lipid profiles with P/S of 6.5 and 8.7 for growth on flake and cake, respectively. in addition, a method was developed to estimate the bioconversion rate from digested canola oil to fungal oil, which was nearly 50% when canola flake and cake were utilized as substrate.

Determination of oxygen in high purity cadmium by radio frequency glow discharge optical emission spectrometry								ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY				29	3			90	92					MAY-JUN 2008	2008	A method was established for the determination of trace levels of oxygen in high purity cadmium by radio frequency glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (RF-GD-OES). The parameters optimized for the determination of oxygen in cadmium are nitrogen purge time, RF power, argon pressure, pre-integration time, and analysis duration. The method developed was evaluated for the determination of oxygen in Cd using an oxygen-nitrogen analyzer. The analysis results were satisfactory, which indicates that this method could fully satisfy the determination of trace gases (oxygen) in high purity Cd metal.									1	1	0	0	0	2			0195-5373			WOS:000257421100003		
J	Maag, John W.; Katsiyannis, Antonis								The Medical Model to Block Eligibility for Students With EBD: A Response-to-Intervention Alternative								BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS				33	3			184	194					MAY 2008	2008	The main tenant of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) reauthorization was improving student outcomes through the use of evidence-based interventions. A particularly interesting aspect that found its way into the legislation was the eligibility process. Current methods of eligibility identification for students with learning disabilities (LD) and emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) were criticized as being invalid and resulting in overidentification. In the case of LD, a response-to-intervention (RTI) approach was adapted as one of the methods for determining eligibility. In the case of EBD (as well as LD), the recommendation was to use the medical model for making eligibility decisions (i.e., diagnosis by a physician). Although it did not become part of IDEA 2004, it will likely be reintroduced in the next reauthorization. The purpose of this article is to provide a critique of the medical model to make eligibility decisions and point out its potential paradoxical results. A model of RTI is then presented for making EBD eligibility decisions.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0198-7429			WOS:000207640000005		
J	Kozak, Heather L.; Cirino, Lauren A.; Ptacek, Margaret B.								Female mating preferences for male morphological traits used in species and mate recognition in the Mexican sailfin mollies, Poecilia velifera and Poecilia petenensis								BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY				19	3			463	474		10.1093/beheco/arm139			MAY-JUN 2008	2008	We tested whether sexually selected morphological traits in the sailfin mollies, Poecilia velifera and Poecilia petenensis, are also used in species recognition. Our first experiment, using live males as stimuli and providing females with olfactory as well as visual cues, found that females of both sailfin species preferred conspecific males to males of shortfin species. However, neither species preferred conspecific males when compared with heterospecific sailfin males, suggesting that premating reproductive isolation is not well developed between them. Our second experiment, providing females with only visual cues when distinguishing between live males, found that females of P. velifera preferred the larger of 2 stimulus males, regardless of whether the larger male was a conspecific or an heterospecific sailfin male. Such a preference for the larger sized male was not found in P. petenensis. To further investigate the role of the dorsal "sailfin" in species recognition, we used model males that varied only in the species identity of their dorsal fins. Females of both sailfin species preferred conspecific models with conspecific sailfins to those with dorsal fins of the shortfin species. In addition, females of P. velifera preferred the model with the largest sailfin, regardless of species identity. Similarly to the live male experiments, females of P. petenensis did not distinguish between conspecific and heterospecific sailfins. Overall, our study suggests that females of P. velifera have a generalized preference for larger males and that species-specific differences in sailfin shape do not lead to premating reproductive isolation between these 2 sailfin species.									17	0	0	16	0	17			1045-2249			WOS:000255987600001

Soluble RANKL induces high bone turnover and decreases bone volume, density, and strength in mice								CALCIFIED TISSUE INTERNATIONAL				82	5			361	372		10.1007/s00223-008-9133-6			MAY 2008	2008	Receptor activator for nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) is an essential mediator of osteoclastogenesis. We hypothesized that administration of soluble RANKL to mice would result in high turnover and deleterious effects on both cortical and trabecular bone. For 10 days, 10-week-old C57BL/6J female mice (n = 12/group) were given twice-daily subcutaneous injections of human recombinant RANKL (0.4 or 2 mg/kg/day) or inert vehicle (VEH). Bone turnover was greatly accelerated by RANKL, as evidenced by the 49-84% greater levels of serum TRAP-5b (bone resorption marker) and 300-400% greater levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (bone formation marker). RANKL resulted in significantly greater endocortical bone erosion surface (79-83%) and periosteal bone formation rate (64-87%) vs. VEH. Microcomputed tomographic (microCT) analysis of the proximal tibia indicated a reduction in trabecular volume fraction (-84%) for both doses of RANKL. Cortical bone geometry and strength were also negatively influenced by RANKL. MicroCT analysis of the femoral diaphysis indicated significantly lower cortical bone volume (-10% to -13%) and greater cortical porosity (8-9%) relative to VEH. Biomechanical testing of the femur diaphysis revealed significantly lower maximum bending load (-19% to -25%) vs. VEH. Bone strength remained correlated with bone mass, independent of RANKL stimulation of bone turnover. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that soluble RANKL could be an important etiologic factor in pathologic bone loss. RANKL also has potential utility as a model for studying the consequences of high bone turnover on bone quality and strength in animals.									30	1	0	23	0	31			0171-967X			WOS:000256909300006	18465074

The vector constructs carrying a mutant alpha-tubulin gene from goosegrass conferring resistance to dinitroaniline herbicides were created for transformation of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. These constructs contained beta- and/or mutant alpha-tubulin genes driven either by ubiquitin or CaMV 35S promoter. The constructs were used for biolistic transformation of finger millet and soybean or for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of flax and tobacco. Trifluralin, the main representative of dinitroaniline herbicides, was used as a selective agent in experiments to select transgenic cells, tissues and plantlets. Selective concentrations of trifluralin estimated for each species were as follows: 10 mu M for Eleusine coracana, Glycine max, Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and Nicotiana sylvestris; 3 mu M for Linum usitatissimum. PCR and Southern blotting analyses of transformed lines with a specific probe to nptII, alpha-tubulin or beta-tubulin genes were performed to confirm the transgenic nature of regenerated plants. Band specific for the mutant alpha-tubulin gene was identified in transformed plant lines. Results confirmed the stable integration of the mutant tubulin gene into the plant genomes. The present study clearly demonstrates the use of a plant mutant tubulin as a selective gene for plant transformation. (C) 2007 International Federation for Cell Biology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Neilson, Andrew R.; Iacono, Scott T.; Budy, Steven M.; Smith, Dennis W., Jr.								Aromatic trifluorovinyl ethers - Versatile intermediates and monomers for unique fluoropolymers								CHIMICA OGGI-CHEMISTRY TODAY				26	3			14	16				1	MAY-JUN 2008	2008	The unique reactivity of aromatic trifluorovinyl ethers (TFVE) makes them precursors to two types of semifluorinated polymers. Thermally activated cyclopolmyerization gives perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) polymers, and base activated addition of phenolics gives fluorovinylene aryl ethers (FAE) polymers. TFVEs are synthesized from commercial phenols or from the versatile 4-bromotrifluorovinyloxyl intermediate. Having two pathways to TFVEs allows for the incorporation of nearly any functional group into PFCB or FAE polymers. The diverse functionality of PFCB polymers has led to their interest in variety of optical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0392-839X			WOS:000256627900005		
J	Talley, Kemper; Kundrotas, Petras; Alexov, Emil								Modeling salt dependence of protein-protein association: Linear vs non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation								COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS				3	5			1071	1086					MAY 2008	2008	Proteins perform various biological functions in the cell by interacting and binding to other proteins, DNA, or other small molecules. These interactions occur in cellular compartments with different salt concentrations, which may also vary under different physiological conditions. The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of salt concentration on the electrostatic component of the binding free energy (hereafter, salt effect) based on a large set of 1482 protein-protein complexes, a task that has never been done before. Since the proteins are irregularly shaped objects, the calculations have been carried out by a means of finite-difference algorithm that solves Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PB) numerically. We performed simulations using both linear and non-linear PB equations and found that non-linearity, in general, does not have significant contribution into salt effect when the net charges of the protein monomers are of different polarity and are less than five electron units. However, for complexes made of monomers carrying large net charges non-linearity is an important factor, especially for homo-complexes which are made of identical units carrying the same net charge. A parameter reflecting the net charge of the monomers is proposed and used as a flag distinguishing between cases which should be treated with non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann. equation and cases where linear PB produces sound results. It was also shown that the magnitude of the salt effect is not correlated with macroscopic parameters (such as net charge of the monomers, corresponding complexes, surface and number of interfacial residues) but rather is a complex phenomenon that depends on the shape and charge distribution of the molecules.									11	0	0	7	0	11			1815-2406			WOS:000256003600005		
J	Salehi-Khojin, Amin; Jalili, Nader								Buckling of boron nitride nanotube reinforced piezoelectric polymeric composites subject to combined electro-thermo-mechanical loadings								COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				68	6			1489	1501		10.1016/j.compscitech.2007.10.024			MAY 2008	2008	Unlike widely used carbon nanotubes, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have shown to possess stable semiconducting behavior and strong piezoelectricity. Such properties along with their outstanding mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, make BNNTs promising candidate reinforcement materials for a verity of applications especially nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices. Motivated by these abilities, we aim to study the buckling behavior of BNNT-reinforced piezoelectric polymeric composites when subjected to combined electro-thermo-mechanical loadings. For this, the multi-walled structure of BNNT is considered as elastic media and a set of concentric cylindrical shells with van der Waals interaction between them. Using three-dimensional equilibrium equations, Donnell shell theory is utilized to show that the axially compressive resistance of BNNT varies with applying thermal and electrical loads. Also, a new equivalent spring constant model of piezoelectric matrix under electro-thermo-mechanical loadings is developed according to the concept of Whitney-Riley model. Results indicate that the support of piezoelectric matrix significantly enhances the buckling resistance of BNNT. Alternatively, the effect of BNNT piezoelectric property on the buckling behavior of composites is demonstrated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the supporting effect of elastic medium depends on the direction of applied voltage and thermal flow. More specifically, it is shown that applying direct and reverse voltages to BNNT changes the buckling loads for any axial and circumferential wavenumbers. Such capability could be uniquely utilized when designing BNNT-reinforced composites for structural vibration control applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Household use of agricultural chemicals for soil-pest management and own labor for yard work								ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS				40	1			91	108		10.1007/s10640-007-9142-3			MAY 2008	2008	In spite of its potential health and environmental risks and contribution to agri-business, the use of agricultural chemicals for yard care has not been well studied. In our discrete-continuous choice model, estimated with data from a national survey, a household chooses how much money, if any, to initially spend on types of agricultural chemicals and applicators and how much time to subsequently spend on other yard work. Households in big cities or with large gardens are more likely to use organic chemicals. The probability that a household chooses a mix of do-it-yourself and hired applications of synthetic chemicals increases with income, age, and the presence of preschoolers. Among households that apply only synthetic chemicals without hired help, those with young children, with higher incomes, in big cities, and with male heads spend more on the chemicals. The time that such households spend on other yard work increases with expenditures on the chemicals. Cancellation of a pesticide registration might create an extra private cost for households with young children even though the ban might reduce external costs.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0924-6460			WOS:000255414200005

Since the problem is NP-hard, we propose a simple, new, general, heuristic due-date setting procedure called the SL rule. For the classical M/M/1 queuing model, we analytically determine the optimum parameter for the proposed rule to achieve best due-date performance. We then show that the optimized SL rule outperforms the work-content-based TWK rule in terms of fraction tardy, mean tardiness, and mean earliness. Additional numerical and simulation analysis for a range of conditions, covering different shop workload levels and priority regimes, confirms that the proposed rule produces best due-date performance, compared to the work-content-based rule, under most of the conditions studied.

This paper describes a technique for using transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell measurements to obtain an effective common-mode voltage (or magnetic moment) that quantifies the ability of traces and integrated circuits on PCBs to drive common-mode currents onto cables due to magnetic field coupling. This equivalent common-mode voltage can be used to reduce the complexity of full-wave models that calculate the radiated emissions from a system containing the board. It can also be used without full-wave modeling to provide a relative indication of the likelihood that a particular board design will have unintentional radiated emissions problems due to magnetic field coupling.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0018-9375			WOS:000208095400025

Ibasho and the adjustment, satisfaction, and well-being of expatriate spouses								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS				32	3			282	299		10.1016/j.ijintrel.2008.01.004			MAY 2008	2008	Success of the expatriate spouse has been repeatedly identified as a key to overall expatriate assignment success. However, little is known about how to increase the expatriate spouses' adjustment to an overseas assignment. This study examines this problem from an occupational health viewpoint, looking at the relationships of stress with various outcomes related to success: satisfaction, adjustment, and well-being. In addition, the current study tests the effects of social support and a new construct, Ibasho, briefly defined as a sense of comfort and psychological security that a person feels in specific locations they regularly visit, as moderators of stressor-outcome relationships. Results suggest that stress is highly related to all outcomes measured. In addition, initial support for the independence and importance of the construct of Ibasho is established. Ibasho showed significant bivariate relationships with all of the measured variables. In addition, Ibasho accounted for unique variance in the prediction of general adjustment, personal adjustment, satisfaction, and depression above and beyond demographic control variables and social support. Finally, Ibasho interacted with stressors in order to significantly predict perceived stress. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0147-1767			WOS:000256934700007

One effective approach to improving secondary math performance supported by research is the concrete-to-representational-to-abstract (CRA) sequence of instruction. Although CRA is an evidenced-based instructional practice, it is somewhat complicated for teachers to implement in their day-to-day instruction. To better assist implementation of the CRA, an instructional approach with the mnemonic CRA-MATH was developed as a flexible roadmap to help math teachers better address student deficits using the CRA sequence of instruction. The purpose of this article is to describe the seven-step strategy used to guide curricular CRA modifications in secondary mathematics.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1053-4512			WOS:000260767000002

We show that our simulations model the fluctuating hydrodynamics in nanofluids in a thermodynamically self-consistent manner, which is critical for resolving the current controversies on mechanisms of heat conduction in nanofluids. Simulation results indicate that the Brownian motion of nanoparticles plays a negligible role in determining the thermal conductivity of nanofluids at least within the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics at mesoscales.

The authors conducted a meta-analysis of available data and found an overall Black-White d of 0.52, an overall Hispanic-White d of 0.28, and an overall male-female d of -0.19. Consistent with our expectations, results suggest that Black-White ds in assessment center data may be larger than was previously thought. Hispanic-White comparisons were smaller than were Black-White comparisons. Females, on average, scored higher than did males in assessment centers. As such, assessment centers may be associated with more adverse impact against Blacks than is portrayed in the literature, but the predictor may have less adverse impact and be more "diversity friendly" for Hispanics and females.									27	2	0	2	1	30			0021-9010			WOS:000255556600015	18457496

In step 1, benzophenone was photografted on the film surface and in step 2, hydrophilic monomers acrylamide and acrylic acid were photopolymerized from the film surfaces. Another objective was to study the effect of the reaction solvent in step 2 on surface and bulk properties of these films. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and water contact angle goniometry were used to characterize the resultant film surfaces. When ethanol was used as the solvent in step 2, there was significant penetration of the monomers into the films, and bulk properties such as toughness and percent elongation at break were drastically affected. The penetration of these monomers into the bulk was characterized using transmission FTIR microspectroscopy. Microtomed sections of the surface-modified films were placed in a diamond compression cell to perform the FTIR microspectroscopic analyses. The observed monomer penetration into the films was successfully reduced by using water instead of ethanol in step 2, and resultant films showed higher toughness and percent elongation at break than films surface-modified using ethanol as a solvent in step 2.

J	Bashash, Saeid; Jalili, Nader								A polynomial-based linear mapping strategy for feedforward compensation of hysteresis in piezoelectric actuators								JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				130	3					031008	10.1115/1.2907372			MAY 2008	2008	A set of memory-based properties is employed in this paper for modeling multiple-path hysteresis response of piezoelectric actuators. These proper-ties, namely, targeting turning points, curve alignment, and wiping-out effect, are applied in a linear mapping strategy to develop a mathematical framework for modeling the hysteresis phenomenon. More specifically, the locations of taming points are detected and recorded for the prediction of future hysteresis trajectory. An internal trajectory is assumed to follow a multiple-segmented path via a continuous connection of several curves passing through every two consequent turning points. These curves adopt their shapes via a linear mapping strategy from the reference hysteresis curves with polynomial configurations. Experimental implementation of the proposed method demonstrates slight improvement over the widely used Prandtl-Ishlinskii hysteresis operator However to maintain the level of precision during the operation, a sufficient number of memory units must be included to record the turning points. Otherwise, in the event of memory saturation, two memory-allocation modes, namely, "open" and "closed" strategies, can be implemented. It is shown that the closed memory-allocation strategy demonstrates better performance by keeping the most important target points. The proposed modeling framework is adopted in an inverse model-based control scheme for feedforward compensation of hysteresis nonlinearity. The controller is experimentally implemented on a three-dimensional nanopositioning stage for surface topography tracking, a problem typically encountered in scanning probe microscopy applications.

Results revealed that children's perceived social support mediated the relation between intimate partner conflict and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Findings also indicated a mediational role of mother's perceived social support in the link between both physical and nonphysical partner abuse with children's internalizing problems. Results from this study suggest that diminished levels of perceived social support associated with intimate partner conflict is a risk factor for psychological problems in children from low-income, African American families. Based on these findings, it is recommended that interventions to address adjustment problems for children exposed to high levels of intimate partner conflict target enhancing the social support of both children and their mothers.									12	0	0	1	0	12			0885-7482			WOS:000253526400001

Correlations between the results of micro-Deval test and other tests were explored, and the NCHRP 4-19 study recommendation of maximum loss of 18% in micro-Deval test to characterize good versus poor aggregates was evaluated against the field performance of the aggregate. Also, the effect of aggregate gradation on the loss observed in micro-Deval and LA abrasion tests was studied. Based on the results from this study, the recommendations from the NCHRP 04-19 study appear to be valid for the aggregates evaluated. Also, a high degree of correlation was observed between the size of the aggregate evaluated and the micro-Deval loss, with smaller sized aggregates yielding larger loss. Good correlation was observed between results of sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate soundness tests, however, no significant correlation was observed between the losses observed in micro-Deval test and either of the two sulfate soundness tests or the LA abrasion test.					84th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board84th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 09-13, 2005JAN 09-13, 2005	US Dept Transportat; US Fed Aviat Adm; US Fed Highway Adm; US Fed Motor Carrier Safety Adm; US Fed Railroad Adm; US Fed Transit Adm; US Natl Highway Traff Safety Adm; US Res & Innovat Technol Adm; NASA; USA Corps Engineers; US Coast Guard; US DOE; US EPA; Transportat Res Board; Transportat Dept 50 States, Puerto Rico & District ColumbiaUS Dept Transportat; US Fed Aviat Adm; US Fed Highway Adm; US Fed Motor Carrier Safety Adm; US Fed Railroad Adm; US Fed Transit Adm; US Natl Highway Traff Safety Adm; US Res & Innovat Technol Adm; NASA; USA Corps Engineers; US Coast Guard; US DOE; US EPA; Transportat Res Board; Transportat Dept 50 States, Puerto Rico & District Columbia	Washington, DCWashington, DC	4	0	0	0	0	4			0899-1561			WOS:000255249700002

The heat of formation and the effective adsorption capacity are expressed as a function of H-2 distance from adsorbent. The heat of adsorption decreases rapidly with the distance and increasing H-2 loading results in weakening adsorption strength. The effects of nanotube packing and bundle thickness on hydrogen adsorption strength were investigated and the results show that the heat of adsorption can be improved slightly if hydrogen molecules are placed in thicker and inhomogeneously packed nanotube bundles. Only very small diameter nanotube bundles were found to hold promise for significant hydrogen storage for onboard applications.									12	1	0	0	0	13			1610-2940			WOS:000254361000002	18286311

Building on the well-established motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA) framework, we posit that knowledge sharing among employees is a function of their MOA to do so. Existing literature suggests that the interaction among motivation, opportunity, and ability drives knowledge-sharing behavior. In contrast, we specify a new model in which the "bottleneck" or constraining factor among the MOA variables determines the degree of knowledge sharing that occurs. This constraining-factor model (CFM) fits the data better than the traditional multiplicative model and reveals a new, qualitatively different portrait of knowledge sharing that resolves some of the puzzles in the previous literature. The CFM provides macro-level insights with respect to how operations managers can improve employee knowledge sharing by focusing on the bottleneck MOA variable. As a result, the CFM can help set strategic directions of related policies. The model emphasizes that, counter to conventional wisdom, the MOA variables should not be addressed independently, but rather in a dynamic and coordinated way. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These CNFs were incorporated into polypropylene (PP) at 10 wt% level by intensive mixing. Volume resistivity of composites containing CNFs heat treated at 2200 degrees C was higher than that of composites containing untreated CNFs. BET adsorption isotherms showed a significant reduction of specific surface area of CNFs after heat treatment, resulting from the decrease of pore volume without a change of surface roughness. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs revealed that after mixing, heat treated CNFs had a narrower length distribution (1-10 mu m) than that of untreated CNFs (1-30 mu m). We believe that these morphological changes of CNFs due to heat treatment contribute to a higher resistivity of composites with CNFs possessing even more graphitic content. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Both one- and two-column configurations were used to fractionate raw pitches into top and bottom cuts of controlled oligomeric distribution. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectroscopy for absolute molecular weight determination, the effect of changes in pitch oligomeric distribution on both the softening point and the degree of anisotropy (i.e., isotropic-mesophase equilibrium) was established. For example, pitch fractions rich in dimer and trimer species, and with essentially all monomer removed, exhibit the anisotropic microstructure typically found in precursors for high-performance carbon fibers.

In extra time, following a verbal exchange, Zidane head-butted Materazzi in the chest, sending the Italian defender to the ground in dramatic fashion. Zidane, one of the most prominent players in the history of French soccer, received a red card for his aggressive act and Italy went on to win the World Cup. Given the history of soccer in the three countries whose media reports we examine, in addition to broader socio-political factors, we expected to observe differences in how newspapers from the three nations covered the initial story and how they portrayed both Zidane and Materazzi in the aftermath. Consistent with these expectations, English newspapers appeared comparatively harsh toward Zidane, with newspapers in Ireland and Scotland publishing fewer reports and appearing slightly less critical.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0163-4437			WOS:000255964000006

During hepatic resection part of the liver containing the tumor is surgically removed. This type of surgery is accompanied by high blood loss of similar to 0.6-1.35 L. Blood loss is associated with increased complication rates, prolonged hospital stay, and reduced patient survival, especially when transfusion is required. Other researchers have suggested using radiofrequency (rf) or microwave ablation to coagulate a tissue slice before resection to reduce blood loss, but conventional devices typically take several hours. We developed a device consisting of a linear array of blade-shaped, 1 cm wide radiofrequency (rf) electrodes 1.5 cm apart. Bipolar rf power is applied between pairs of adjacent electrodes, leading to high tissue temperatures between the electrodes that promote coagulation of large vessels (>3 mm) in the resection plane. Rapid switching of applied power between pairs of adjacent electrodes allows simultaneous heating and coagulation of the entire resection plane within 3-6 min. In seven in vivo trials in a porcine model, resection along a plane pre-coagulated with the device resulted in little (<20 mL) to no blood loss, while coagulating all vessels (up to 4.5 mm diameter in this study). Average treatment time (from placement of the device to transection) was 6.8 +/- 0.5 min when four electrodes were used, and 11.3 +/- 1.2 min when 5-7 electrodes were used. This device may reduce blood loss related morbidity during resection and reduce treatment time by coagulating all vessels in the resection plane. (C) 2007 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Compact formulae in terms of phenomenological coefficients are derived for the streaming potential and the apparent viscosity ratio in channels with surface charge variations perpendicular and parallel to the applied pressure gradient. In the latter case, the streaming potential per unit liquid flow in a multi-section channel is found to be simply the summation of that in each homogeneous section. The apparent viscosity ratio is a weighted average of each section where the hydrodynamic resistance serves as the weighting factor. The phenomenological coefficients are specified using electrokinetic flow analysis, through which the streaming potential and electroviscous effect in a two-section slit channel are examined. It is found that they both depend on the arrangement of surface heterogeneity in small microchannels. This dependence, however, gets weak in large microchannels, which is consistent with the prediction of thin double layer approximation.									12	1	0	0	0	13			1613-4982			WOS:000254204300010

We used microsatellite markers to examine population genetic structure in the Mexican sailfin mollies Poecilia velifera and P. petenensis. We compared patterns of genetic structure and divergence to that in two types of phenotypic traits: morphological characters and mating behaviours. Populations within each species were genetically distinct, and conformed to a model of isolation by distance, with populations within different geographical regions being more genetically similar to one another than were populations from different regions. Bayesian clustering and barrier analyses provided additional support for population separation, especially between geographical regions. In contrast, none of the phenotypic traits showed any type of geographical pattern, and population divergence in these traits was uncorrelated with that found in neutral markers. There was also a weaker pattern of regional differences among geographical regions compared to neutral genetic divergence. These results suggest that while divergence in neutral traits is likely a product of population history and genetic drift, phenotypic divergence is governed by different mechanisms, such as natural and sexual selection, and arises at spatial scales independent from those of neutral markers.									11	0	0	11	0	11			0962-1083			WOS:000255139700012	18410289

Skeletal deterioration induced by RANKL infusion: a model for high-turnover bone disease								OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL				19	5			625	635		10.1007/s00198-007-0509-7			MAY 2008	2008	RANKL was administered continuously to rats for 28 days to investigate its potential as a disease model for the skeletal system. Bone turnover rates, bone material, structural and mechanical properties were evaluated. RANKL infusion caused overall skeletal complications comparable to those in high bone-turnover conditions, such as postmenopausal osteoporosis.Introduction RANKL is an essential mediator for osteoclast development. No study has examined in detail the direct skeletal consequences of excess RANKL on bone turnover, mineralization, architecture, and vascular calcification. We, therefore, administrated soluble RANKL continuously into mature rats and created a bone-loss model.Methods Six-month-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were assigned to three groups (n = 12) receiving continuous administration of saline (VEH) or human RANKL (35 mu g/kg/day, LOW or 175 mu g/kg/day, HI) for 28 days. Blood was collected routinely during the study. At sacrifice, hind limbs and aorta were removed and samples were analyzed.Results High dose RANKL markedly stimulated serum osteocalcin and TRAP-5b levels and reduced femur cortical bone volume (-7.6%) and trabecular volume fraction (BV/TV) at the proximal tibia (-64% vs. VEH). Bone quality was significantly degraded in HI, as evidenced by decreased femoral percent mineralization, trabecular connectivity, and increased endocortical bone resorption perimeters. Both cortical and trabecular bone mechanical properties were reduced by high dose RANKL. No differences were observed in the mineral content of the abdominal aorta.Conclusions Continuous RANKL infusion caused general detrimental effects on rat skeleton. These changes are comparable to those commonly observed in high-turnover bone diseases such as postmenopausal osteoporosis.									13	2	0	12	0	15			0937-941X			WOS:000254625200004	18038244

The accuracy and reproducibility of the PTC system has been confirmed by measuring several standard reference materials. The in-plane thermal conductivity kappa of Na(x)Co(2)O(4) single crystals grown by a NaCl flux method was measured from 10 K to 300 K and kappa was found to be similar to 5 W m(-1) K(-1) at 300 K. The phonon mean free path (MFP) is estimated to be lph similar to 9 angstrom at 300 K, which is comparable to the lattice constant but much smaller than the reported MFP of conducting carriers.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1862-6300			WOS:000256288400031

Effect of boundary scattering on the thermal conductivity of TiNiSn-based half-Heusler alloys								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				77	18					184203	10.1103/PhysRevB.77.184203			MAY 2008	2008	TiNiSn-based half-Heusler alloys have been of significant interest for their potential as thermoelectric materials. They exhibit promising electronic transport properties as revealed through high Seebeck coefficient and moderate electrical resistivity values. The chief disadvantage of these materials is a comparatively high lattice thermal conductivity. Attempts to "tune" the lattice thermal conductivity (K(L)) in these materials have led to the comparison and analysis of the thermal conductivity of two series of Ti- and Zr-based half-Heusler alloys. In the first series, Ti(1-y)Zr(y)NiSn(0.95)Sb(0.05), a significant reduction in K(L) is observed, with the substitution of large concentrations of Zr (y >= 25%) at Ti site, which is most likely due to mass fluctuation scattering. In the second series, TiNiSn(1-x)Sb(x), a nonsystematic increase in K(L) is observed, with minute amounts of Sb doping (x <= 5%) at the Sn site. Extensive microstructural analysis in a TiNiSn(1-x)Sb(x) series reveals a correlation between KL and the average grain diameter in these materials, which is in good agreement with theoretical predictions related to phonon boundary scattering. In addition, a comparison of the calculated phonon mean free path in each of the series of compounds shows some insight into the two different phonon scattering mechanisms.									49	1	0	1	0	49			1098-0121			WOS:000256885300044

Endogenous carbohydrate status affects postharvest ethylene sensitivity in relation to leaf senescence and adventitious root formation in Pelargonium cuttings								POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY				48	2			272	282		10.1016/j.postharvbio.2007.10.001			MAY 2008	2008	This study investigated the role of ethylene action in postharvest leaf senescence of two cultivars of pelaigonium (Pelargonium x hortorum L. H. Bailey 'Patriot Bright Red' and 'Patriot White') cuttings to determine whether endogenous carbohydrate status interacts with ethylene action in relation to leaf senescence and adventitious root formation. In the first experiment, ethylene or receptor-directed ethylene-action blocker, 1-MCP, was applied to cuttings harvested early in the morning, when carbohydrate status is relatively low. Cuttings were stored in sealed bags at 20 +/- 1 degrees C for 3 days in darkness. Ethylene promoted chlorophyll breakdown and leaf senescence during propagation, whilst application of 1-MCP decreased those responses. In the second experiment, application of ethylene had no significant effect on the leaf senescence of cuttings that were harvested at the end of the day, when carbohydrate status was relatively high. In contrast, ethylene application to cuttings with low carbohydrate status (harvested from stock plants kept in darkness for 9 h) resulted in substantially higher leaf senescence. Highly significant positive correlations were calculated between the total chlorophyll content of the oldest leaf after4 days of initial propagation and sucrose, total sugars, and total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations in the whole cutting, irrespective of postharvest ethylene concentration during storage. Adventitious root formation was inhibited by 1-MCP, whereas it was promoted by exogenous ethylene only when applied to cuttings with a higher carbohydrate status. For those cuttings, ethylene concentration was positively correlated with final root number. These results indicate that ethylene action is involved in postharvest leaf senescence, and that ethylene sensitivity decreases with the increase in preharvest endogenous carbohydrate status of the cuttings. In addition, when the endogenous carbohydrate status is high, ethylene sensitivity promotes adventitious root formation without triggering rapid leaf senescence. These results collectively suggest that preharvest endogenous carbohydrate status interacts with postharvest ethylene action to regulate leaf senescence and adventitious root formation in pelargonjum cuttings.

With resting cells of strain TD grown on vinyl chloride, ethene, and ethylene oxide, the maximum specific rate of ethylene oxide consumption decreased significantly in the absence of external CO2 in comparison to cells provided with room air or added CO2. The amount of (CO2)-C-14 incorporated into biomass by resting cells of strain TD grown on ethylene oxide increased more than 13-fold when the assay substrate was ethylene oxide versus acetate. These results indicate that strain TD uses a carboxylase. Similar experiments were performed with strain AJ with the results suggesting that a carboxylase is not involved. In this regard, strain AJ is more similar to various Mycobacterium isolates that also do not appear to use a carboxylase during metabolism of vinyl chloride and ethene. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we operationally define and discuss the concept of customer experience. In this context, we propose a reframing of the strategic role of operations strategy as one of choreographing experience-centric services. We then introduce the concept of services as destinations as an emerging business model for classifying experiential service strategies. Our conceptual typology of experience-based strategies uses two dimensions: (1) the depth of use of experience as a source of value creation, ranging from brand experience to the services as a destinations business model, and (2) the degree of integration of experience internally within the firm. Using this conceptual typology, we develop five propositions and use multiple cases to illustrate firms' use of these experience strategies. Laying the groundwork for future research, we highlight insights from the qualitative, multiple-case data as they pertain to service operations strategy and the business model that employs services as destinations. A number of questions for further research are suggested.

J	Menor, Larry J.; Roth, Aleda V.								New service development competence and performance: An empirical investigation in retail banking								PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				17	3			267	284		10.3401/poms.1080.0034			MAY-JUN 2008	2008	W hat can service firms do to improve their ability to offer new services? In this paper we argue that new service development success results from building a competence in the management of service development resources and routines. We conceptualize new service development competence as a multidimensional, second-order latent construct that is represented by a system of four interrelated and complementary dimensions: (1) formalized new service development processes, (2) market acuity, (3) new service development strategy, and (4) information technology use and experience. We hypothesize that the growth of new service development competence is related to improved new service development performance. Using structural equations modeling, we analyze survey data from 166 retail banks and report three key empirical findings. First, we show that the four hypothesized dimensions are statistically significant in defining new service development competence. Second, contrary to conventional wisdom in new product development, we find that formalized processes play a lesser role in the success of new service development compared with the other three dimensions. Instead, market acuity-which captures the firm's ability to see the competitive environment clearly and to anticipate and respond to customers' evolving needs and wants-was the most important new service development competence indicator. Finally, we demonstrate the positive effect of new service development competence on new service development performance and show that new service development competence is also significantly related to business-level performance. Together, our empirical results suggest that complementary benefits arise from the adoption of a more holistic approach to the management of new service development at the program level.

Geotextile filtration performance for lagoon sludges and liquid animal manures dewatering								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				51	3			1067	1076					MAY-JUN 2008	2008	Maintenance and control of liquid levels in anaerobic lagoons and storage ponds is enhanced by pretreatment with liquid-solid separation or periodic removal of accumulated sludges. Until local disposal or nutrient recycling options become available, sludges can be contained, dewatered, and stored using geotextile filtration. A geotextile filtration testing method termed a hanging-bag test was used to treat dairy lagoon sludge, swine lagoon sludge, liquid dairy manure, and liquid swine manure. Hanging-bag performance was evaluated by: (1) determining solids and plant nutrient mass retention efficiencies (MRE), (2) quantifying the overall volume reduction, and (3) characterizing the dewatered manure. After three fill-dewater cycles, geotextile filtration performed similarly for the sludges, retaining an average 87.6% of total solids (TS), 58.4% of total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), and 86.7% total phosphorous (TP). Geotextile filtration was also effective in dewatering and concentrating the sludges; by highly concentrating the retained solids, it reduced the total influent sludge volume requiring disposal to less than 18.5%. Despite relatively high MRE values for liquid swine manure (70.2% of TS, 65.1% of TAN, and 75.7% of TP), geotextile filtration was ineffective as a primary liquid-solid separation, with 60.3% of the total influent volume remaining. For liquid dairy manure (TS = 0.71%), geotextile filtration reduced the total influent volume to less than 1%, concentrated the solids and nutrients in the dewatered material 16 to 21 times greater than the influent, and retained 38.4% of TS, 25.8% of TAN, and 45.0% of TP, making this an effective liquid-solid separation technique.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0001-2351			WOS:000258425600029

Vertical confinement of injected steam in the vadose zone using cold air injection								VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL				7	2			732	740		10.2136/vzj2007.0093			MAY 2008	2008	Steam flooding is used for removal of volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) from concentrated source zones. The application of steam flooding to shallow vadose zone sites can be problematic if the steam or contaminants vent to the ground surface. Cold air injection holds promise as a technique for controlling the vertical movement of the injected steam. A series of two-dimensional numerical simulations using a radially symmetric grid show the sensitivity of this process to geological and operational parameters. Air control of vertical steam movement appears to be a useful technique, using approximately equal air and steam volumetric flow rates. Air, injection is shown to be more effective than a low-permeability cap at the ground surface for keeping high temperatures away from the surface. The most effective design appears to be a combination of a low-permeability surface cap and air injection above the steam injector. The cap mainly serves to direct the air flow, preventing it from exiting at the ground surface near the air injection point.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1539-1663			WOS:000256204600032		
J	Jha, Prashant; Norsworthy, Jason K.; Bridges, William, Jr.; Riley, Melissa B.								Influence of glyphosate timing and row width on Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) and pusley (Richardia spp.) demographics in glyphosate-resistant soybean								WEED SCIENCE				56	3			408	415		10.1614/WS-07-174.1			MAY-JUN 2008	2008	The influence of soybean row width and glyphosate application timing was determined on survival, biomass, and seed production of cohorts from a mixed population of Palmer amaranth and pusley species (Florida and Brazil pusley) along with soybean seed yield. The first Palmer amaranth and pusley cohort comprised plants that emerged from soybean planting through the V3 (3 wk after soybean emergence [WAE]) soybean stage (cohort 1). The second cohort comprised plants that emerged between the V3 to V6 (5 WAE) soybean stages (cohort 2), and the third cohort emerged after the V6 through the R2 soybean stage (cohort 3). Glyphosate at 840 g ae ha(-1) was applied at V3; V6; V3 and V6; and V3, V6, and R2 in rows either 19 or 97 cm wide. A nontreared control was included for comparison in each row width. Sequential glyphosate applications at V3 and V6 or at V3, V6, and R2 soybean stages resulted in 1 to 3% survival of cohort I compared with 23 to 28% survival after a single glyphosate application. Vegetative biomass production by cohort I accounted for 71% of the total pusley biomass produced in the nontreated plots. Cohort 1, 2, and 3 contributed 68, 31, and 1%, respectively, of the total 37,900 seeds m(-2) produced by pusley plants in nontreated plots. Delaying a glyphosate application to the V6 stage resulted in higher biomass and more than twice the seed produced from cohort 1 when compared with cohort 2. Glyphosate applied at V3 and V6 stages prevented pusley seed production from cohort 1, and an additional glyphosate application at the R2 stage prevented seed production from cohorts 2 and 3. No Palmer amaranth emergence occurred after the V6 soybean stage in either row width. A single glyphosate application at the V3 or V6 stage eliminated cohort I of Palmer amaranth in narrow rows. Palmer amaranth plants from cohort 1 in wide rows that survived the V3 glyphosate application produced 3.3 g m(-2) biomass and 600 seeds m(-2). Averaged over years and row widths, soybean yields after sequential glyphosate applications were 2,490 to 2,640 kg ha(-1) compared with 1,850 to 2,020 kg ha(-1) after a single glyphosate application at the V3 or V6 stage. This research confirms that sequential glyphosate applications are superior to a single application for minimizing pusley and Palmer amaranth survival, biomass, and seed production along with an improvement in soybean yields.									16	0	0	15	0	16			0043-1745			WOS:000256105500013

More specifically, LaF3 nanoparticles with trifluorovinyl ether (TFVE) ligands were synthesized. Because a single nanoparticle will have many functional ligands attached to its surface, the nanoparticles themselves act as cross-linkers, without the need for a matrix phase for the composite, promoting homogeneity and reduced optical scattering. In order to distinguish these new types of composites from traditional nanocomposites, they are referred to here as "omni-composites because the material is composed entirely (Lat. omnino) of composite nanoparticles.									8	1	0	0	0	9			0002-7863			WOS:000255360100011	18396875

The response of these PMAA-b-PNIPAM bi-level brushes to changes in pH, temperature and ionic strength is investigated by using in-situ multi-angle ellipsometry to measure changes in solvated layer thickness. As expected for a block copolymer architecture, PMAA blocks swell as pH is increased, with the maximum change in the thickness occurring near pH = 5, and PNIPAM blocks exhibit lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior, marked by a broad transition between swollen and collapsed states. The response of the bi-level brushes to changes in added salt at constant pH is complex, as the swelling behaviors of both the weak polyelectrolyte, PMAA, and thermoresponsive PNIPAM are affected by changes in ionic strength. This work demonstrates not only the robustness of SI-PMP for making novel, bi-level stimuli-responsive brushes, but also the complex links between synthesis, structure, and response of these materials.									55	1	0	4	0	55			1616-301X			WOS:000255695400009		
J	Padgett, Jamie E.; Nielson, Bryant G.; DesRoches, Reginald				DesRoches, Reginald /F-5875-2011				Selection of optimal intensity measures in probabilistic seismic demand models of highway bridge portfolios								EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS				37	5			711	725		10.1002/eqe.782			APR 25 2008	2008	Probabilistic seismic demand models are a common and often essential step in generating analytical fragility curves for highway bridges. With these probabilistic models being traditionally conditioned on a single seismic intensity measure (IM), the degree of uncertainty in the models is dependent on the IM used. Selection of an optimal IM for conditioning these demand models is not a trivial matter and has been the focus of numerous studies. Unlike previous studies that consider a single structure for IM selection, this study evaluates optimal IMs for use when generating probabilistic seismic demand models for bridge portfolios such as would be found in HAZUS-MH. Selection criteria such as efficiency, practicality, sufficiency, and hazard computability are considered in the selection process.A case study is performed considering the multi-span simply supported steel girder bridge class. Probabilistic seismic demand models are generated considering variability in the geometric configurations and material properties, using two suites of ground motions-one synthetic and one recorded motion suite. Results show that of the 10 IMs considered, peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral acceleration at the fundamental period are the most optimal for the synthetic motions, and that cumulative absolute velocity is also a close contender when using recorded motions. However, when hazard computability is considered, PGA is selected as the IM of choice. Previous studies have shown that spectrally based quantities perform better than PGA for a given structure, but the findings of this study indicate that when a portfolio of bridges is considered, PGA should be used.

J	Suwannakarn, Kaewta; Lotero, Edgar; Goodwin, James G., Jr.; Lu, Changqing								Stability of sulfated zirconia and the nature of the catalytically active species in the transesterification of triglycerides								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				255	2			279	286		10.1016/j.jcat.2008.02.014			APR 25 2008	2008	Sulfated zirconia (SZ) exhibits remarkable activity for various hydrocarbon reactions under mild conditions and is of interest for biodiesel synthesis. Nevertheless, to date no detailed study has addressed its activity and stability in liquid polar media such as alcohols, although a number of papers have suggested the possibility for some sulfur leaching. This paper presents an investigation into the activity and stability of a commercial SZ catalyst for the liquid-phase transesterification of triglycerides at 120 degrees C. The kinetics of tricaprylin (TCP) transesterification with a series of aliphatic alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol) were investigated at 120 degrees C and 6.8 atm in a Parr batch reactor. It was found that the catalytic activity for TCP conversion decreased as the number of carbons in the alkyl chain of alcohol increased, most likely as a result of increased steric hindrance. The SZ catalyst exhibited significant activity loss with subsequent reaction cycles. The characterization of used catalysts after their exposure to various alcohols at 120 degrees C showed that the SO42- moieties in SZ were permanently removed. The SO42- species were leached out, most likely as sulfuric acid, which further reacted with alcohols to form monoalkyl and dialkyl sulfate species, as demonstrated by H-1 NMR studies. This was in essence the main route for catalyst deactivation. Our findings conclusively demonstrate for the first time that in alcoholic-liquid media at higher temperatures, SZ deactivates by leaching of its active sites, most likely leading to significant homogeneous rather than heterogeneous Catalysis.

Two different architectures of the composite-laminate armor are considered: (a) a hybrid armor consisting of a 100 mu m-thick high MWCNT-content PVEE-matrix MWCNT-reinforced lamina sandwiched between two PVEE-matrix/E-glass mat reinforced laminas and (b) a monolithic E-glass mat reinforced composite laminate with a low MWCNT-content MWCNT-doped PVEE-matrix. The projectile/armor interaction simulation results show that both armor architectures yield a minimal (similar to 6%) increase in the ballistic-protection as measured by the armor V50, a velocity at which the probability of armor penetration by a given fragment is 50%. The results obtained are rationalized using a simple analysis of the effect of MWCNTs on the in-plane and the through-the-thickness properties of the armor. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

CO2 fixation kinetics of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus mutant carboxysomes lacking carbonic anhydrase suggest the shell acts as a diffusional barrier for CO2								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				283	16			10377	10384		10.1074/jbc.M709285200			APR 18 2008	2008	The widely accepted models for the role of carboxysomes in the carbon-concentrating mechanism of autotrophic bacteria predict the carboxysomal carbonic anhydrase to be a crucial component. The enzyme is thought to dehydrate abundant cytosolic bicarbonate and provide ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase (RubisCO) sequestered within the carboxysome with sufficiently high concentrations of its substrate, CO2, to permit its efficient fixation onto ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. In this study, structure and function of carboxysomes purified from wild type Halothiobacillus neapolitanus and from a high CO2-requiring mutant that is devoid of carboxysomal carbonic anhydrase were compared. The kinetic constants for the carbon fixation reaction confirmed the importance of a functional carboxysomal carbonic anhydrase for efficient catalysis by RubisCO. Furthermore, comparisons of the reaction in intact and broken microcompartments and by purified carboxysomal RubisCO implicated the protein shell of the microcompartment as impeding diffusion of CO2 into and out of the carboxysome interior.									67	0	0	64	0	68			0021-9258			WOS:000254894700018	18258595

In addition, for the first time, the catalyzed rate of hydrolysis/esterification + transesterification of triglycerides has been quantified and compared to that of the rate of simultaneous esterification of FFAs present in the same reaction mixture. Tricaprylin and caprylic acid were used as representative compounds for the comparison of the catalyst for transesterification and esterification since they give reaction rates related to those of larger TGs and FFAs typically present in vegetable oils and animal fats. For the measurement of the kinetics for the simultaneous reaction of a TG-FFA mixture, the reaction of tricaprylin and oleic acid with ethanol was studied using the most promising of the Zr-based catalysts, WZ. Reaction was carried out in a well-mixed batch reactor under mild conditions (75-120 degrees C). TiZ, while more active than WZ for transesterification, had by far the lowest activity for esterification. SZ, while the most active catalyst (on a weight basis) for both transesterification and esterification reactions, exhibited significant sulfur loss, which greatly reduced its long term activity. As expected, esterification occurred at a much faster rate than transesterification. However, under simultaneous reaction conditions, by virtue of the water being produced in esterification and hydrolysis of the TG taking place, the conversion of the triglycerides to ester products was greatly increased. The resulting caprylic acid from hydrolysis did not accumulate in the reaction mixture due to its rapid esterification to ethyl caprylate. The activity results for WZ indicate how biodiesel can be efficiently produced from free-fatty-acid-containing feedstocks using a solid-acid-catalyzed pre-esterification step, and how a significant fraction of the triglycerides can also be converted at the same time assisted by initial hydrolysis with byproduct water from esterification.

Mechanics of limb bone loading during terrestrial locomotion in river cooter turtles (Pseudemys concinna)								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				211	8			1187	1202		10.1242/jeb.012989			APR 15 2008	2008	Studies of limb bone loading during terrestrial locomotion have focused primarily on birds and mammals. However, data from a broader functional and phylogenetic range of species are critical for understanding the evolution of limb bone function and design. Turtles are an interesting lineage in this context. Although their slow walking speeds and robust limb bones might lead to low locomotor forces and limb bone stresses similar to other non-avian reptiles, their highly sprawled posture could produce high bending loads, leading to high limb bone stresses similar to those of avian and mammalian species, as well as high torsion. To test between these possibilities, we evaluated stresses experienced by the femur of river cooter turtles (Pseudemys concinna) during terrestrial walking by synchronizing measurements of three-dimensional joint kinematics and ground reaction forces (GRFs) during isolated hindlimb footfalls. Further, we evaluated femoral safety factors for this species by comparing our locomotor stress calculations with the results of mechanical property tests. The net GRF magnitude at peak tensile bone stress averaged 0.35 BW ( body weight) and was directed nearly vertically for the middle 40 - 65% of the contact interval, essentially orthogonal to the femur. Peak bending stresses experienced by the femur were low ( tensile: 24.9 +/- 9.0 MPa; compressive: - 31.1 +/- 9.1 MPa) and comparable to those in other reptiles, yet peak shear stresses were higher than those in other reptiles, averaging 13.7 +/- 4.2 MPa. Such high torsion is present despite cooters lacking a large tail, a feature that has been hypothesized to contribute to torsion in other reptiles in which the tail is dragged along the ground. Comparison of femoral stresses to measurements of limb bone mechanical properties in cooters indicates safety factors to yield of 13.9 in bending and 6.3 in torsion, considerably higher than values typical for birds and mammals, and closer to the elevated values calculated for other reptile species. Thus, not only do turtle limb bones seem considerably. over-designed' for resisting the loads that they encounter, but comparisons of bone loading across tetrapod lineages are consistent with the hypothesis that low limb bone loads, elevated torsion and high safety factors may be primitive features of limb bone design.									20	0	0	19	0	20			0022-0949			WOS:000254463600007	18375843

The optimum electrokinctic devices performance is dependent on a figure of merit defined in terms of hydrodynamic conductance, streaming effects and electrical conductance of slip nanochannels. These phenomenological coefficients are all enhanced by the fluid slip as compared to those without slip effects. The net result is an increased figure of merit and thus an enhanced electrokinetic devices performance, particularly in nanochannels with a high ratio of slip length to channel height.

Zinc blende ZnTe nanocrystals growth in three different shapes under various conditions, that is, quasi-spheres, tetrahedrons, and nanorods, have been observed. It is believed that the crystal growth of ZnTe is the rate-controlling step when superhydride was employed at 250 degrees C, resulting in quasi-spherical ZnTe nanocrystals. Replacement of superhydride with oleylamine alters the precursor-reduction step as the rate-controlling step, giving tetrahedral ZnTe nanocrystals. At low temperature (150 degrees C) and in the presence of superhydride and oleylamine, kinetic growth and/or surfactant-template dominate the process, causing an anisotropic crystal growth into ZnTe nanorods. ZnTe nanocrystals are typically surface-active with a similar crystal structure of CdSe. The present study provides a clue to understand the zinc blende-type nanocrystal growth mechanism in high-temperature colloidal system, and may lighten certain strategies of future nanomaterials processing, for example, the synthesis of one-dimensional zinc blende-type semiconductors in solution phase.									56	2	0	4	0	57			1932-7447			WOS:000254710800033

Attention Restoration Theory [Kaplan, S., 1995. The restorative benefits of nature: toward an integrative framework, J. Environ. Psychol.15, 241-248.] and theorized components of restorative environments were used as an orientation for selection of the visual stimuli. Conducted in Taiwan, the studies recorded the psychophysiological responses of 110 laboratory participants while viewing 12 images that hypothetically represented the Being Away, Extent or Coherence, Fascination, and Compatibility components of restorative environments. Psychological responses were measured using the perceived restorativeness scale and physiological responses were recorded by electromyography (EMG), electrocephalography (EEG), and blood volume pulse (BVP) measurements. Results revealed a large degree of congruency between the psychological measures of restorativeness and the three physiological responses. Improved scores on the perceived restorativeness scale corresponded to increased EMG and EEG readings and lower BVP measurements. These findings provide some objective evidence toward the psychophysiological values; and perhaps benefits, of wildland-wilderness environments. The potential importance of wildland-wildemess environments for the restoration of human well-being is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bhadbhade, Vikrant; Jahli, Nader; Mahmoodi, S. Nima								A novel piezoelectrically actuated flexural/torsional vibrating beam gyroscope								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				311	3-5			1305	1324		10.1016/j.jsv.2007.10.017			APR 8 2008	2008	Vibrating beam gyroscopes are fast becoming the most widely used gyroscopes in marly commercial applications. This paper deals with a vibrating beam gyroscope consisting of a cantilever beam with rigid mass attached to its end and undergoing coupled flexural-torsional vibrations. The gyroscope can be used to measure the angular velocity of the rotating base of the beam. The primary (flexural) vibrations are produced in the beam using a piezoelectric patch (bender type) actuator. Due to the base rotation, a gyroscopic effect is generated which induces secondary (torsional) vibrations in the beam. First, a detailed mathematical modeling of the system is developed using extended Hamilton's Principle. The system governing equations are solved and simulated using assumed mode model expansion to analyze the gyroscopic coupling produced due to the base rotations. Finally, the effects of secondary base rotation (cross-axis effects) on the performance of the gyroscope are presented. Also, it is shown that the gyroscopic effect increases with increase in base rotation rate, primary excitation amplitude and length of the beam. It is further proven that the secondary base rotations (cross-axis effects) have an adverse effect oil the gyroscope performance. Such detailed analysis on the effects of secondary rotation can be utilized to devise elimination strategies in order to improve gyroscopic performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mahmoodi, S. Nima; Jahli, Nader; Khadem, Siamak E.								An experimental investigation of nonlinear vibration and frequency response analysis of cantilever viscoelastic beams								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				311	3-5			1409	1419		10.1016/j.jsv.2007.09.027			APR 8 2008	2008	The nonlinear vibration analysis of a directly excited cantilever beam modeled as ail inextensible viscoelastic Euler-Bernoulli beam has been studied by the authors and is reported in the literature. The viscoelastic damping was modeled as Kelvin-Voigt damping, and the nonlinearities arisen from the inextensibility assumption. This paper extends our theoretical developments presented in the previous papers and utilizes the method of multiple scales in order to arrive at the modulation equations and the closed-form frequency response function. The analytically derived frequency response is experimentally verified through harmonic force excitation of samples of carbon nano tube-rein forced beams. The beam used in experiment consists of two elastic layers of high-carbon steel sandwiched together through a viscoelastic layer of carbon nanotube-epoxy mixture. The results demonstrate that increasing the excitation amplitude or decreasing damping ratio can cause a minor decrease in the nonlinear resonance frequency despite the significant increase in the amplitude of vibration due to reduced damping.

We introduce the k-reinforcement number of a graph as the smallest number of edges that have to be added to a graph to reduce the domination number by k. We present an O(k(2)n) dynamic programming algorithm for computing the maximum number of vertices that can be dominated using gamma(G) - k dominators for trees. A corollary of this is a linear-time algorithm for computing the k-reinforcement number of a tree. We also discuss extensions and related problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Geoff				hu, huifeng/I-4694-2012	hu, huifeng/0000-0003-2223-170X			Changes in forest biomass carbon storage in the South Carolina Piedmont between 1936 and 2005								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				255	5-6			1400	1408		10.1016/j.foreco.2007.10.064			APR 5 2008	2008	With the widespread land-use conversion from abandoned farmlands to forests since 1930s, the Piedmont region of eastern United States has likely become an important carbon (C) sink. To quantify this potential C sink and understand its implication to the regional carbon budget and future forest management, we estimated the changes in forest biomass carbon storage in the South Carolina (SC) Piedmont between 1936 and 2005. Based on the nine periods of Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data obtained for the Piedmont of South Carolina (18 counties, about 2.8 x 10(6) ha I and area), we used allometric biomass regression equations, directly developed from recent FIA data, and biomass expansion factors to estimate the forest biomass carbon pool for each inventory year. Since 1936, the SC Piedmont forests have accumulated 81.84 Tg C.due to forest expansion and regrowth, increasing from 57.36 Tg C in 1936 to 139.20 Tg C in 2005. Hardwood and softwood forests accounted for 74% (60.38 Ta C) and 26% (21.45 Tg C) of carbon accumulation during this period, respectively. The aboveground forest biomass carbon pool represented 80% or 65.17 Tg C of the total carbon accumulation while the belowground fine and coarse roots only accounted for 20% or 16.67 Ta C. From 1936 through 2005, forest carbon accumulated at a rate of 1.19 Tg C yr(-1), offsetting 5.7% of CO2 emission (20.94 Tg C in 2003) of the entire state of South Carolina. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The most probable energy shows a strong temperature dependence and increases linearly with temperature in the measured range. The observed blueshift of the surface boson peak (shift rate 0.008 +/- 0.002 meV/K) is a factor of 4 to 10 times stronger than shift rates measured in the bulk by inelastic neutron and Raman scattering. We suggest that the anomalous shift direction of the boson peak to higher energies with increasing temperature has the same origin as the unusual temperature dependence of the bulk modulus of silica glass.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0031-9007			WOS:000254670300048	18517967

Reaction kinetics and mechanism for the gas- and liquid-phase esterification of acetic acid with methanol on tungstated zirconia								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				47	7			2221	2230		10.1021/ie070665a			APR 2 2008	2008	A comprehensive kinetic investigation of the esterification of acetic acid with methanol in both the liquid phase (21-60 degrees C) and the gas phase (100-140 degrees C) was carried out using tungstated zirconia (WZ) as the catalyst. The goal of this study was to derive rate law expressions and to propose a reaction mechanism that would support reaction rate data for esterification on WZ. Upon increasing the concentration of acetic acid, an increase in the rate of esterification was obtained at all reaction temperatures. In contrast, the reaction order with respect to methanol evolved from positive to negative as the reaction temperature increased. Using a model discrimination procedure, we found that a single-site (Eley-Rideal) mechanism with the adsorbed carboxylic acid reacting with the methanol from the gas/liquid phase successfully describes these reactions. One important conclusion of this study was that, even though there were significant differences in the power law exponents for gas- and liquid-phase esterifications, the same reaction mechanism can successfully describe both situations. We propose that the adsorption of the carboxylic acid becomes the rate-determining step (RDS) as the reaction temperature increases. At lower esterification temperatures (liquid phase), the rate-determining step appears to be the nucleophilic attack of the alcohol on the adsorbed/protonated acetic acid molecules. At higher reaction temperature (gas phase), the adsorption of the carboxylic acid becomes rate determining. It was also found that the catalytic activity of WZ was inhibited by water similarly to other strong acid catalysts.									20	0	0	0	1	21			0888-5885			WOS:000254471800014		
J	Jackson, D. Michael; Lynn, Dwight E.; Fuxa, James R.; Shepard, B. Merle; Shapiro, Martin								Efficacy of Entomopathogenic Viruses on Pickleworm Larvae and Cell Lines								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN ENTOMOLOGY				25	2			81	97					APR 2008	2008	A critical need exists for new biological pest management techniques for the pickleworm, Diaphania nitidalis (Stoll) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), a major pest of Cucurbitaceae. One potential management strategy for this pest is the use of entomopathogenic viruses. In this study, several viruses were evaluated for efficacy against pickleworm cell lines and second-stage larvae. First, selected viruses were bioassayed ill vitro against one suspended cell line (IPLB-DnEs1) and one attached cell line (IPLB-DnEa3) that we derived from pickleworm embryos. In these experiments, a multiply-embedded nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgMNPV) from velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis Habner, showed the greatest activity toward the pickleworm cell lines. Following these results, 14 entomopathogenic viruses in the families Baculoviridae, Reoviridae, and Iridoviridae were evaluated ill vivo in bioassays of second instar D. nitdalis. Among these 14 viruses, only six baculoviruses showed significant activity against pickleworm larvae. AgMNPV and a multiply-embedded nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) from alfalfa looper, Autographa californica (Speyer), were the most efficacious against second instar D. nitidalis. Moreover, five of six stilbene fluorescent brighteners significantly increased efficacy of AgMNPV against pickleworm larvae.									3	0	0	3	0	4			1523-5475			WOS:000207495200002		
J	Welch, Shane M.; Waldron, Jayme L.; Eversole, Arnold G.; Simoes, Jody C.								Seasonal variation and ecological effects of Camp Shelby burrowing crayfish (Fallicambarus gordoni) burrows								AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST				159	2			378	384		10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[378:SVAEEO]2.0.CO;2			APR 2008	2008	Foam casts and burrow excavations were used to examine Fallicambarus gardoni burrow occupancy rates, seasonal variation in burrow morphology, correlation between crayfish abundance and burrow abundance and potential ecological effects of burrowing through soil disturbance and the creation of fossorial habitat. Burrow occupancy rates were high (75%) and consistent between active and inactive seasons, although several burrow metrics differed significantly between seasons. Crayfish abundance was strongly correlated with burrow abundance. Estimates of annual soil disturbance (82 metric tons/ha/y) and fossorial habitat created (29-49 km/ha) suggest F. gordoni serves important ecological functions within the greater habitat.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0003-0031			WOS:000254844300010

Methods: A series of 3 experiments with 24, 12, and 48 subjects respectively, balanced for gender, was completed: Experiment 1 investigated the effect of body position (upright, supine) and gender; Experiment 2 investigated the additional influence of the visual pattern (dots, stripes), but only for the supine position; and Experiment 3 investigated the complex interaction of gender, body position, and visual pattern on symptom rating (SR), rotation tolerance (RT), and time to first perception of vection (VT). A novel vection drum that allowed varied body positions and visual patterns was used to create pseudo-rotation. Results: Experiment 7: there was a significant effect of rotation on SR, and a significant rotation x position interaction such that the rotation-induced symptom increase was significantly higher in the supine compared to the upright position. in addition, there was a significant effect of gender, with women showing lower SR in both positions. RT was lower while supine compared to upright; this effect was significantly more pronounced in male subjects. Experiment 2: a significant effect of rotation on SR was found, but no effect of the visual stimulus pattern or gender on SR, RT, or VT Women exhibited significantly lower VT than men. Experiment 3: rotation induced a significant increase in SR independent of gender, body position, and visual pattern. Supine position induced significantly higher SR and RT than upright, and a significant interaction between gender, body position, and visual pattern. Conclusion: The complex interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic factors may partially explain the mixed findings in the literature regarding the relationship of gender to motion sickness.									10	0	0	5	0	10			0095-6562			WOS:000254545500003	18457295	
J	Shah, Sagar R.; Vyavahare, Naren R.								The effect of glycosaminoglycan stabilization on tissue buckling in bioprosthetic heart valves								BIOMATERIALS				29	11			1645	1653		10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.12.009			APR 2008	2008	Bioprosthetic valves are used in thousands of heart valve replacement surgeries. Existing glutaraldehyde-crosslinked bioprosthetic valves fail due to either calcification or degeneration. Glutaraldehyde crosslinking does not stabilize valvular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs, predominantly present in the medial spongiosa layer of native heart valve cusps, play an important role in regulating physico-mechanical behavior of the native cuspal tissue during dynamic motion. The primary objective of this study was to identify the role of cuspal GAGs in valve tissue buckling. Glutaraldehyde-crosslinked cusps showed extensive buckling compared to fresh, native cusps. Removal of GAGs by treatment with GAG-degrading enzymes led to a marked increase in buckling behavior in glutaraldehyde-crosslinked cusps. We demonstrate that the retention of valvular GAGs by carbodiimide crosslinking together with chemical attachment of neomycin trisulfate (a hyaluronidase inhibitor), prior to glutaraldehyde crosslinking, reduces the extent of buckling in bioprosthetic heart valves. Furthermore, following exposure to GAG-digestive enzymes, neomycin-trisulfate-bound cusps experienced no alterations in buckling behavior. Such moderate buckling patterns mimicked that of fresh, untreated cusps subjected to similar bending curvatures. Thus, GAG stabilization may subsequently improve the durability of these bioprostheses. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									18	0	0	9	0	18			0142-9612			WOS:000253619900011	18199477

Four simulated waters representing the range of contaminant concentrations typical of actual produced waters were treated, and the system's performance was monitored. Freshwater wetland cells planted with Schoenoplectus californicus and Typha latifolia were used to treat fresh and brackish waters. Saline and hypersaline waters were treated by saltwater wetland cells planted with Spartina alterniflora and by reverse osmosis. Effective removal of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc was achieved by the pilot-scale system. Results suggest that use of specifically designed constructed wetland treatment systems provides a flexible and effective approach for treating gas storage produced waters over a wide range of compositions.

Influence of supramammary lymph node extract on in vitro cell proliferation								CELL PROLIFERATION				41	2			299	309		10.1111/j.1365-2184.2008.00521.x			APR 2008	2008	Objectives: Experiments were conducted to evaluate whether or not bovine supramammary lymph node extract (LNE) could support cell proliferation when it was substituted for bovine growth serum (BGS) in cell culture media. Materials and Methods: Two different preparations of LNE were tested. The first yielded protein concentration of 3 mg/mL and the second contained 27 mg/mL protein. Three cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MAC-T and 1C6) were used in serum starvation assays to evaluate LNE. Cell proliferation assays were used to determine growth stimulation in the presence of LNE, and short-term or rapid adaptation cultures were evaluated for LNE effects on cell survival. Results: Heat-inactivated preparation 1 supported cell proliferation as well as or better (12-39%) than BGS following 2 days of serum starvation in culture. The second lymph node preparation provided a stimulatory effect (263-702% greater than BGS across all cell lines) following serum starvation at 2.7 and 5.4 mg/mL protein supplementation. A gradual adaptation process with lymph node supplementation into media maintained cell population growth on a short-term basis. However, once cells were trypsinized or scraped and re-seeded into 2.7 mg/mL LNE protein containing media, cells were unable to re-adhere, leaving them detached, and eventually appearing to be dead. Conclusions: Substitution of BGS with LNE protein dramatically stimulated cells to proliferate, but did not allow for rapid cell population growth adaptation in vitro.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0960-7722			WOS:000253978100008	18336474

Such processes include the perturbation of population distributions from external events shaping habitat landscape and internal factors shaping the probability of contemporaneous alleles in a population (coalescence). Several patterns have recently emerged: spatial and temporal heterogeneity in population structure have different influences on the persistence of new mutations and genetic variation, multi-locus analyses indicate that gene flow continues to occur during speciation and the incorporation of demographic processes into models of molecular evolution and association genetics approaches has improved statistical power to detect deviations from neutral-equilibrium expectations and decreased false positive rates.									16	0	0	15	0	17			1369-5266			WOS:000255623300002	18353707

In addition, the effects of common drugs also act through a mechanism of binding to specific biomolecular targets. Models for the prediction of binding affinity are used in basic research to study the molecular basis of biological function as well as in applied research to study the development of new drugs. This review will address the biological importance of molecular recognition as well as its influence on the development of pharmaceuticals. Further, a broad overview of computational approaches used for the prediction of biological activity and specifically binding free energy will be presented.									9	0	0	7	0	9			1389-2010			WOS:000256617800005	18393865

Approaches and resources for prediction of the effects of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism on protein function and interactions								CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY				9	2			123	133		10.2174/138920108783955164			APR 2008	2008	Almost all (99.9%) nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all people, however, the remaining 0.1% account for about 1.4 million locations where single-base DNA differences/polymorphisms (SNPs) occur in humans. Some of these SNPs, called non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs), result in a change of the amino acid sequences of the corresponding proteins affecting protein functions and interactions. This review summarizes the plausible mechanisms that nsSNPs may affect the normal cellular function. It outlines the approaches that have been developed in the past to predict the effects caused by nsSNPs with special emphasis on the methods that use structural information. The review provides systematic information on the available resources for predicting the effects of nsSNPs and includes a comprehensive list of existing SNP databases and their features. While nsSNPs resulting in amino acid substitution in the core of a protein may affect protein stability irreversibly, the effect of an nsSNP resulting to a mutation at the surface of a protein or at the interface of protein-protein complexes, could, in principle be, subject of drug therapy. The importance of understanding the effects caused by nsSNP mutations at the protein-protein and protein-DNA interfaces is outlined.									36	1	0	29	0	38			1389-2010			WOS:000256617800008	18393868	
J	Chong, Juang-Horng; Roda, Amy L.; Mannion, Catharine M.								Life history of the mealybug, Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Hemiptera : Pseudococcidae), at constant temperatures								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				37	2			323	332		10.1603/0046-225X(2008)37[323:LHOTMM]2.0.CO;2			APR 2008	2008	Important life history parameters of the mealybug, Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Green), were characterized on hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L.) cuttings at six constant temperatures between 15 and 35 degrees C. The development of M. hirsutus was the fastest at 27 degrees C, where the mealybugs completed development in approximate to 29 d. The lower (T(min)) and upper (T(max)) developmental thresholds and the optimal developmental temperature (T(opt)) for the development of female mealybugs were estimated as 14.5, 35, and 29 degrees C, respectively. The thermal constant (K), which is the number of temperature-day or degree-day units required for development, of the-females was 347 DD. The original distribution range prediction (based on T(min) = 17.5 degrees C and K = 300 DD) indicated that M. hirsutus could complete at least one generation in all of the continental United States. However, results of this study suggested that the distribution range of M. hirsutus may expand northward because of the lower T(min), and the predicted number of generations in a year may be lower because of the higher K required to complete each generation. The average cumulative survival rate of M. hirsutus at 25 and 27 degrees C was 72%, which was significantly higher than 51 and 62% at 20 and 30 degrees C, respectively. M. hirsutus reproduced sexually, with each mated female producing 260-300 eggs between 20 and 27 degrees C but only approximate to 100 eggs at 30 degrees C. Female longevity was reduced from 28 d it 20 degrees C to 19-21 d at 25-30 degrees C. At 27 degrees C, the net reproductive rate (R(o)) was estimated at 165 female/female, the intrinsic rate of population increase (r(m)) was 0.119 (female/female/d), the generation time (T(G)) was 43 d, and the doubling time (DT) was 5.8 d. The life table statistics suggested that the currently released biological control agents, which have higher r(m), than M. hirsutus, will be able to complete more generations than the mealybug within the tested temperature range; thus, they are effective against M. hirsutus.									32	1	0	32	6	38			0046-225X			WOS:000258342400006	18419903

In calling for a new approach to child protection, the Board argued that only a universal system of family support, grounded in the creation of caring communities, could provide an effective foundation for ensuring children's safety. Strong Communities for Children is the first initiative to attempt a comprehensive, large-scale implementation of the Board's proposed strategy. Using a public health approach, Strong Communities blends research about the causes and correlates of child abuse and neglect with public health concepts of community-wide prevention and intervention. Strong Families, the direct service component of Strong Communities, relies heavily on the health sector for the engagement of families.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0160-6379			WOS:000254562000003	18360152

Toward a science of community intervention								FAMILY & COMMUNITY HEALTH				31	2			113	125					APR-JUN 2008	2008	Most programs for preventing child maltreatment have relied largely or exclusively on individual and family-level interventions. However, the absence of community-level strategies conflicts with a growing body of research showing the importance of community factors in the prevalence of child abuse and neglect. Parents trying to cope with dangerous community conditions may become too punitive or, conversely, insufficiently watchful. In short, parents rearing children in weak communities have a hard job to do. Conversely, however, supportive communities can mitigate the threats posed by risky environments. Programmatic experience and the research program in Strong Communities for Children suggest some possible directions. The study also indicates reasons that the generation and application of community research have been slow, and suggests steps to remediate these problems.									11	0	0	1	0	11			0160-6379			WOS:000254562000004	18360153

FAMILY & COMMUNITY HEALTH				31	2			126	135					APR-JUN 2008	2008	Detailed information about what actually happened in large-scale efforts to transform communities is sparse. Using biweekly reports of the Strong Communities initiative's outreach workers' activities over a 3.5-year period, this article examines the characteristics of individuals whom the outreach workers were able to involve in the project, the degree of involvement that various community sectors (eg, fire, police, churches, civic groups) have had, the types of activities that they have undertaken, and the characteristics of volunteer groups that have participated. Results showed that Strong Communities has indeed penetrated into the target communities in diverse ways engaging people of disparate backgrounds. The first years of the initiative show the feasibility of engaging primary community institutions in a broad-based effort to enhance children's safety in their homes and the community at large. They indicate the importance of community gatekeepers and of seemingly "natural" but actually constructed events and groups in facilitating such efforts.									7	0	0	1	0	7			0160-6379			WOS:000254562000005	18360154

Between neighborliness and volunteerism - Participants in the strong communities initiative								FAMILY & COMMUNITY HEALTH				31	2			150	161					APR-JUN 2008	2008	The Strong Communities initiative in the Upstate region of South Carolina strives to strengthen the community and prevent child maltreatment through the enhancement of neighborliness and volunteerism. During the first 5 years of the initiative, more than 4,500 volunteers contributed their time. Strong Communities has nurtured neighborly volunteers-residents whose community service could be characterized as being between formal agency-based volunteerism and pure neighborliness (good citizenship). Conducting a phone survey of a random sample of volunteers in Strong Communities and analyzing an existing database on the contributed service, we studied the volunteers' characteristics, attitudes, and perceptions. Volunteers in Strong Communities come from all parts of the community and include a high percentage of minorities. They have a strong psychological sense of neighborliness and commitment to their communities. The volunteers also expressed a high level of integration into Strong Communities in their knowledge, identity, ongoing activities, satisfaction, and attitudes. The Strong Communities initiative appears to be succeeding in making opportunities for neighborly action easily available in everyday life.									14	0	0	1	0	14			0160-6379			WOS:000254562000007	18360156

"I can conquer a mountain" - Ordinary people who provide extraordinary community service								FAMILY & COMMUNITY HEALTH				31	2			162	172					APR-JUN 2008	2008	The Strong Communities initiative in the Upstate region of South Carolina relies on expansion and utilization of social capital as the principal strategy in preventing child maltreatment. The 44 volunteers (out of more than 4,500) whom outreach staff identified as most central to mobilization of the community were interviewed about their background, motivation, and experience in the initiative. These exceptionally productive volunteers were less distinctive in their background than in their beliefs. Almost all were active church-goers, and many reported a strong religious foundation for their commitment to community service. The exceptional volunteers generally reported that they had become involved in Strong Communities through interaction with outreach staff of the initiative. Most appraised Strong Communities as effective in improving the community, and they regarded the initiative as providing deeper and more personally meaningful experiences than other volunteer programs in which they had participated. Strong Communities appears to be making progress toward both personal and community transformations.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0160-6379			WOS:000254562000008	18360157	
J	Melton, Gary B.; Anderson, David								From safe sanctuaries to strong communities - The role of communities of faith in child protection								FAMILY & COMMUNITY HEALTH				31	2			173	185					APR-JUN 2008	2008	In both popular and professional discourse, religious institutions are often perceived as sources of risk to children either as places where children are unusually vulnerable to abuse or as belief systems that sometimes result in mistreatment of children. However, religious institutions can be leading resources in the development of community-wide safety nets for children. In one such initiative (Strong Communities for Children, a large-scale initiative in the Upstate region of South Carolina), multiple indicators show that, even in an area dominated by theologically conservative churches, churches have been the sector most heavily engaged in protective action to strengthen families and thereby to prevent harm to children. Another faith-based project (Safe Families in Chicago) has shown the potential of similarly conceptualized support to ensure the safety of children in high-need situations.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0160-6379			WOS:000254562000009	18360158

Merr. 'Williams 82') has made it important to integrate its physical and genetic maps. To facilitate this integration of maps, we screened 3290 microsatellites (SSRs) identified from BAC end sequences of clones comprising the 'Williams 82' physical map. SSRs were screened against 3 mapping populations. We found the AAT and ACT motifs produced the greatest frequency of length polymorphisms, ranging from 17.2% to 32.3% and from 11.8% to 33.3%, respectively. Other useful motifs include the dinucleotide repeats AG, AT, and AG, with frequency of length polymorphisms ranging from 11.2% to 18.4% (AT), 12.4% to 20.6% (AG), and 11.3% to 16.4% (GT). Repeat lengths less than 16 bp were generally less useful than repeat lengths of 40-60 bp. Two hundred and sixty-five SSRs were genetically mapped in at least one population. Of the 265 mapped SSRs, 60 came from BAC singletons not yet placed into contigs of the physical map. One hundred and ten originated in BACs located in contigs for which no genetic map location was previously known. Ninety-five SSRs came from BACs within contigs for which one or more other BACs had already been mapped. For these fingerprinted contigs (FPC) a high percentage of the mapped markers showed inconsistent map locations. A strategy is introduced by which physical and genetic map inconsistencies can be resolved using the preliminary 4 x assembly of the whole genome sequence of soybean.									30	4	0	30	0	33			0831-2796			WOS:000254645600007	18356965	
J	Griffin, Sarah F; Wilson, Dawn K; Wilcox, Sara; Buck, Jacqueline; Ainsworth, Barbara E								Physical activity influences in a disadvantaged African American community and the communities' proposed solutions.								Health promotion practice				9	2			180	90		10.1177/1524839906296011			2008-Apr	2008	The purpose of this assessment is to increase our understanding of how safety and environmental factors influence physical activity among African American residents living in a low-income, high-crime neighborhood and to get input from these residents about how to best design physical activity interventions for their neighborhood. Twenty-seven African American adult residents of a low-income, high-crime neighborhood in a suburban southeastern community participated in three focus groups. Participants were asked questions about perceptions of what would help them, their families, and their neighbors be more physically active. Two independent raters coded the responses into themes. Participants suggested three environmental approaches in an effort to increase physical activity: increasing law enforcement, community connectedness and social support, and structured programs. Findings suggest that safety issues are an important factor for residents living in disadvantaged conditions and that the residents know how they want to make their neighborhoods healthier.									25	0	0	5	0	25			1524-8399			MEDLINE:17728204	17728204

Taxonomic diversity of rhizosphere bacteria in golf course putting greens at representative sites in the southeastern United States								HORTSCIENCE				43	2			514	518					APR 2008	2008	Taxonomic diversity of bacteria associated with golf course putting greens is a topic that has not been widely explored. The purpose of this project was to isolate and identify culturable bacteria from the rhizosphere of creeping bentgrass (Agrostris palustris Huds.) at two sites (Alabama and North Carolina) and hybrid bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy] at two sites (Florida and South Carolina) for a minimum of 3 years with sampling initiated after the construction process. Randomly selected colonies were identified using gas chromatography for analysis of fatty acid methyl ester profiles. Over 9000 isolates were successfully analyzed. When a similarity index of 0.300 or higher was used, the average number of unidentifiable isolates was 38.6%. The two dominant genera in both bentgrass and bermudagrass rhizospheres were Bacillus and Pseudomonas with Bacillus dominant in bermudagrass and Pseudomonas dominant or equal to Bacillus in bentgrass. Other genera that comprised at least 1% of the isolates at all four sites were Clavibacter, Flavobacterium, and Microbacterium. Arthrobacter also comprised a significant portion of the bacterial isolates in the bentgrass rhizosphere, but not the bermudagrass rhizosphere. Overall, there were 40 genera common to all four sites. At the species level, there were five that comprised at least 1% of the isolates at each location: B. cereus, B. Megaterium, C. michiganensis, F. johnsoniae, and P. putida. As has been reported for many grasses, we found considerable taxonomic diversity among the culturable bacterial populations from the rhizospheres of bentgrass and bermudagrass grown in sand-based putting greens.

J	Carpio, Carlos E.; Safley, Charles D.; Poling, E. Barclay								Estimated costs and investment analysis of producing and harvesting muscadine grapes in the southeastern United States								HORTTECHNOLOGY				18	2			308	317					APR-JUN 2008	2008	This study estimates and compares the production costs and profitability of muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifilia) production under the single-wire (Sw) and the Geneva double curtain (GDC) trellis systems with and without drip irrigation. Profitability analysis revealed that muscadine grape production can be a profitable venture. Irrigated muscadine grape vineyards were shown to be more profitable than nonirrigated vineyards. The comparison of the GDC trellis system and the SW trellis system indicates that the GDC trellis system is more profitable. Returns to land and management from muscadine grapes grown under the GDC system were found to be less sensitive to changes in prices and yields than the returns from muscadine grapes grown under the SW trellis system. Net returns from irrigated systems were also found to be less sensitive to variations in prices and yields than nonirrigated systems. The estimated total costs of establishing (Years 0-3) a muscadine grape vineyard were between $9783/acre and $15,065/acre depending on the production system used. For the GDC production system, which was the most profitable production system, the estimated return to land and management was $447/acre. Cash flow analysis demonstrated that the payback period for this system can be achieved in the 10th year, whereas the net present value of the investment was estimated at $4484 and the internal rate of return was estimated at 9.6%.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1063-0198			WOS:000254233300018		
J	Mitchell, K.

Background: Because AEDs were recently approved for home use, brief training for nonprofessional users needs investigation. Method: During training, the exposure training group read an article about AEDs that provided no information on how to operate them; the low-training group inspected the AED and read the operating instructions in the paper-based manual but was not allowed to use the device; and the high-training group watched a training video and performed a mock resuscitation using the AED but no manikin. All participants returned 2 weeks later and performed a surprise simulated AED resuscitation on a manikin. Results: Most participants in each training group met criteria of minimally acceptable performance during the simulated manikin resuscitation, as measured by time to first shock, pad placement accuracy, and safety check performance. All participants who committed errors were able to successfully recover from them to complete the resuscitation. Compared with exposure training, the low and high training had a beneficial effect on time to first shock and errors. Conclusion: Untrained users were able to adequately use this AED, demonstrating walk-up-and-use usability, but additional brief training improved user performance. Application: This study demonstrated the importance of providing high-quality but brief training for home AED users. In conjunction with other findings, the current study helps demonstrate the need for well-designed training for consumer medical devices.									16	0	0	4	1	16			0018-7208			WOS:000255472400011	18516840	
J	Frye, J. Michael; Martin, Anthony Q.								Extrapolation of time and frequency responses of resonant antennas using damped sinusoids and orthogonal polynomials								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION				56	4			933	943		10.1109/TAP.2008.919195			APR 2008	2008	An extrapolation technique is presented which reduces the computational demands of obtaining a wideband electromagnetic response from a resonant antenna using traditional computational electromagnetic methods. It has been shown that a wideband response can be extrapolated by fitting early-time and low-frequency data with a summation of orthogonal polynomials. However, representing responses characteristic of resonant structures in practice proves computationally inefficient and can lead to numerical instabilities. This paper outlines the incorporation of damped sinusoids to efficiently, accurately, and reliably extrapolate both time- and frequency-domain responses of resonant antennas due to a wideband source. A genetic algorithm is used to select the necessary extrapolation parameters. The wideband driving-point current response of several resonant antennas is accurately extrapolated. The transmission-line matrix method and the method of moments are used to compute early-time and low-frequency data, respectively. Fundamentally different discretizations of the structure of interest are used, illustrating in principle the independence of the technique and the choice of computational methods used to provide the directly-computed data.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0018-926X			WOS:000254869000003

Compared to undamaged DNA, the diffusion coefficient of lambda-DNA was significantly increased with 12 min or 20 min of radiation but remained unchanged for 40 min of exposure possibly due to strand crosslinking. The structural damage of DNA was further examined using transmission electron microscopy which revealed kinks and sharp bends along the DNA backbone.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1422-0067			WOS:000255516100017	19325771

Product design with multiple suppliers for component variants								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS				112	2			723	741		10.1016/j.ijpe.2005.11.011			APR 2008	2008	The issue of vendor choice has traditionally not been considered in determining the optimal set of products to produce. That is, component purchase has typically been considered only at the MRP explosion stage, well after the set of products to produce and their production quantities has been decided. This decoupling of roles may sometimes result in high acquisition cost of components. To control costs, it is crucial that unit prices of component variants, fixed costs of doing business with vendors, and their capabilities to supply different component variants be assessed before deciding which set of models to include in a product line. In our analysis, we have explicitly provided for this coupling between product choice and vendor selection, and have gone a step further by bringing in customers to determine the sales potential of the different models of a product that may be produced. We use our analysis to study the following issues: (1) how can a manufacturer decide which product models to offer and which vendors to select to offer components for these models, (2) under what situations are general vendors (who offer a larger variety of component variants) preferred to more focused vendors, (3) how much discount do focused vendors need to offer to compensate for their lack of versatility, (4) how does the fixed cost of vendor relationships influence the vendor selection decision, (5) how does the intensity of market competitiveness influence this decision, (6) how can a manufacturer work with a general vendor to exploit new market opportunities, and (7) how much incentive can a manufacturer offer focused vendors to get them to become more versatile in their capabilities. For each problem scenario, the output of our procedure tells us the set of models that should be chosen for a product line, production quantities of each model, specific vendors front whom component variants needed to produce these models should be procured, and profits to the manufacturer and each vendor selected.

In this study, the impact of adding various different transition metals (Cr, Mn, Mo, Ta, V. W, and Zr) on the catalytic properties of precipitated bulk Fe-based catalysts was investigated using the same preparation method and reaction conditions. All of the Fe catalysts prepared in this study exhibited high BET surface areas with excellent metal distributions. The addition of the third metal in addition of Fe and Cu (all except W) increased the activity of the Fe catalyst for CO hydrogenation and for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. with Cr-, Mn- and Zr-promoted Fe-based catalysts exhibiting the highest catalytic activities. However, hydrocarbon selectivity was not affected by the presence or type of added third metal. The enhanced activity of the Fe catalyst by third metal promotion (with the exception of Mn and Zr) appears to have been primarily due to a higher degree of Fe dispersion on the surface of catalyst whereas the higher activities observed for Mn- and Zr-promoted Fe catalysts were especially due to higher TOFchem values based on CO chemisorption.

Hydrothermal methods have been used to synthesize and grow single crystals of Sc2O3 and Er:Sc2O3 at a temperature over 1800 degrees C below their melting point. Scandia crystals up to 6 mm in size have been obtained by spontaneous nucleation. A preliminary hydrothermal growth study was performed and rates of up to 0.16 mm/day were observed for seeded growth of both Sc2O3 and Er:Sc2O3. Hydrothermal scandia has also been doped with trivalent Ho, Tin and Yb, making this an attractive technique for the growth of refractory optical crystals.

The insect is expected to reach sugarcane and rice production areas in Louisiana by 2008, and infest 2,11 of Louisiana sugarcane and rice industries by 2035. When all sugarcane in Louisiana becomes infested, annual yield losses of $220 million would be expected for a cultivar of comparable susceptibility to LCP 85-384 (assuming this cultivar is planted on 100% of the production area). This also assumes the use of the current practice of rainfed production and one application of insecticide, which is presently used by farmers in Louisiana. Irrigation with 30 cm of water is predicted to reduce estimated losses by 29%, whereas four applications of a biorational insecticide such as tebufenozide are expected to reduce the loss in revenue by 53%. The use of the resistant 'HoCP 85-845' Would reduce the projected loss in revenue by 24%. Combining all three management tactics on sugarcane, anticipated net loss in revenue would decrease by 66%. The rice industry in Louisiana is projected to suffer from a loss in revenue of $45 million when the entire state is infested. A 77% reduction in loss in revenue is expected with one application of lambda-cyhalothrin. A quarantine on east Texas sugarcane is estimated to save the Louisiana industry between $1.1 billion and $3.2 billion (depending on management) during the time needed for the insect to fully invade the state's sugarcane and rice producing area by natural migration rather than by accidental introduction. The rapid deployment of appropriate management tactics will have a key role in reducing the anticipated economic impact of E. loftini once it becomes a pest in Louisiana sugarcane and rice.									26	0	0	22	0	26			0022-0493			WOS:000258337100001	18459384

A high-density exciton system bound to a nitrogen impurity superlattice and GaP:N, GaP:N:Sm nanocrystals distributed in transparent fluorine-containing polymers will be used as the base elements for a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

Impacts of parasitism on the survivorship and reproduction of the Madeira mealybug (Hemiptera : Pseudococcidae)								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				43	2			169	176					APR 2008	2008	This study was conducted to assess the impacts of parasitism by Anagyrus sp. nov. nr. sinope Noyes and Menezes on the reproductive potential and the survivorship of the Madeira mealybug, Phenacoccus madeirensis Green. The reproductive responses of P. madeirensis to parasitism were dependent upon the reproductive status of the adult mealybugs. The reproductive period and fecundity of parasitized preovipositing adult mealybugs were significantly lower (4 d and 290 eggs, respectively) than those of the unparasitized individuals (8 d and 380 eggs, respectively). However, the reproductive longevity and fecundity were not different between the parasitized and unparasitized ovipositing mealybugs. Destructive feeding by parasitoid larvae reduced the total longevity of all adult mealybugs by 1-4 d. The parasitoid only host fed on 2.4% of the 1(st)-instar mealybugs and none in other developmental stages. In the 4 developmental stages examined (1(st), 2(nd) and 3(rd) nymphal instars, and prereproductive adult), only the survival rate of 1(st)-instar nymphs was significantly reduced by ovipositor insertion (97% of the unparasitized versus 88% of the parasitized). After accounting for the mortality due to host feeding and ovipositor insertion, the parasitism rate of P. madeirensis by Anagyrus sp. nov. nr. sinope was estimated at 30%.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0749-8004			WOS:000256095800002		
J	George, Ryan; Bell, Lansford C.; Back, W. Edward								Critical activities in the front-end planning process								JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING				24	2			66	74		10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2008)24:2(66)			APR 2008	2008	Previous research conducted by the Construction Industry Institute (CH) and others has demonstrated the value of front-end planning as it impacts project success. A recently completed research project funded by CII, described in this paper, examines ways to improve information flow through the front-end planning process. This paper focuses on one specific objective of this research project, namely to isolate and closely examine the information critical activities within the front-end planning process. The front-end planning process was carefully diagrammed as consisting of 33 distinct activities, each with its own information flow entities and interactions. Fifty-one questionnaire survey forms were analyzed to obtain data for the 33 activities that included activity duration, resources expended, and the extent to which information was available to perform the activity. The 51 projects were then grouped according to survey respondents' perceptions as to whether the front-end planning process was executed more or less effectively. An analysis of the data concluded with a degree of statistical significance that seven of the 33 activities have some impact on achieving project success. In addition, statistically significant differences were uncovered with respect to the extent that information was available for selected activities, and survey respondent perceptions with respect to how efficiently the activity was performed. These seven activities are involved in planning the following areas: Public relations, start up, quality and safety, the project execution plan, and project scope definition. Other activities for which information was frequently not available and/or for which considerable resources were expended relate to preliminary cost estimating and the development of a funding plan. A second survey form was forwarded to the original survey participants to obtain more specific information with respect to the information categories and interfaces associated with the critical activities that were identified in the original survey. This survey indicated problem areas including inadequate scope definition, risk identification and mitigation, minimal resource allocation for task execution, unclear definitions of roles and responsibilities, and ineffective external communication mechanisms.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0742-597X			WOS:000254369800002		
J	Long, Yu; Zhang, Ning; Huang, Yong; Wen, Xuejun								Formation of highly aligned grooves on inner surface of semipermeable hollow fiber membrane for directional axonal outgrowth								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				130	2					021011	10.1115/1.2896111			APR 2008	2008	It is generally believed that organized neural architecture is essential for nervous system development, function, and regeneration. In the absence of guidance cues, regenerating axons may lose their directions and become misaligned, resulting in the formation of neuromas and/or misappropriate connections. To help regenerate axons across damaged regions and guide them to appropriate targets, some bridging devices such as micro-grooves are being intensively researched to achieve a better directional axonal growth. This paper reports a novel fabrication process to generate a highly aligned groove texture on the inner surface of semipermeable hollow fiber membranes (HFMs). HFMs have demonstrated promising results in guiding axonal regeneration. The fabrication process utilized a wet phase-inversion procedure with polyurethane (PU) as model polymer dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent, and water as nonsolvent. Data indicated that highly aligned groove texture could be formed on the HFM inner surface by carefully controlling phase-inversion conditions such as the polymer solution flow rate, and/or nonsolvent flow rate, and/or polymer solution concentration ratio. The texture forming mechanism is qualitatively explained using a PU-DMSO-water ternary phase diagram and the dynamics of fluid instability. Axonal outgrowth on the HFM with aligned grooves showed the highly aligned orientation and improved axonal outgrowth length. This study may eventually lead to a new and effective way to fabricate nerve grafts for the spinal cord injury and nerve damage treatment based on this highly aligned three dimensional scaffold.									8	0	0	3	0	8			1087-1357			WOS:000255846300012		
J	Maunder, Nathan A.; Schmitz, Tony L.; Ziegert, John C.								The influence of process variation on a cortical bone interference fit pin connection								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				130	2					024501	10.1115/1.2896103			APR 2008	2008	The interference fit is a common method for creating mechanical assemblies. When manufacturing the individual components to be assembled in this method, close dimensional control of the mating components is required in order to ensure that the amount of interference is sufficient to create a secure assembly, but not so great as to cause excessive stresses or failure of the individual components. In this work, we study interference fit connections in an assembly of human (cadaveric) cortical and cancellous bone, i.e., an allograft, used in spinal fusion surgeries. A difficulty encountered in this application is that, in addition to the machining steps, the assembly must go through subsequent sterilization and lyophilization, or freeze drying, processes that may affect the quality of the interference fit. This report examines the quality of the allograft interference fits using dimensional measurements of manufactured components at all stages of the manufacturing process, followed by examination for cracking and measurement of the pull-apart forces for assemblies. The experimental results are compared to finite element models of the interference fit and also to Monte Carlo models of the assembly using a simple thick-wall cylinder model. Experimental results show that the lyophilization process significantly affects the component dimensions, resulting in a much greater spread in interference values and likely leading to cracking and/or loss of interference.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1087-1357			WOS:000255846300020		
J	Shor, L.; Gueceri, S.; Gandhi, M.; Wen, X.; Sun, W.								Solid freeform fabrication of polycaprolactone/hydroxyapatite tissue scaffolds								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				130	2					021018	10.1115/1.2898411			APR 2008	2008	Bone tissue engineering is an emerging field providing viable substitutes for bone regeneration. Freeform fabrication provides an effective process tool to manufacture scaffolds with complex shapes and designed properties. We developed a novel precision extruding deposition (PED) technique to fabricate composite polycaprolactone/hydroxyapatite (PCL/HA) scaffolds. 25% concentration by weight of HA was used to reinforce 3D scaffolds. Two groups of scaffolds having 60% and 70% porosities and with pore sizes of 450 mu m and 750 mu m respectively, were evaluated for their morphology and compressive properties using scanning electron microscopy and the mechanical testing. In vitro cell scaffold interaction study was carried out using primary fetal bovine osteoblasts. The cell proliferation and differentiation were evaluated by Alamar Blue assay and alkaline phosphatase activity. Our results suggested that compressive modulus of PCL/HA scaffold was 84 Mpa for 60% porous scaffolds and was 76 MPa for 70% porous scaffolds. The osteoblasts were able to migrate and proliferate for the cultured time over the scaffolds. Our study demonstrated the viability of the PED process to fabricate PCL scaffolds having necessary mechanical property, structural integrity, controlled pore size, and pore interconnectivity desired for bone tissue engineering.									8	0	0	1	0	8			1087-1357			WOS:000255846300019		
J	Wang, Wei; Huang, Yong; Grujicic, Mica; Chrisey, Douglas B.								Study of impact-induced mechanical effects in cell direct writing using smooth particle hydrodynamic method								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				130	2					021012	10.1115/1.2896118			APR 2008	2008	Biomaterial direct-write technologies have been receiving more and more attention as rapid prototyping innovations in the area of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and biosensor/actuator fabrication based on computer-aided designs. However cell damage due to the mechanical impact during cell direct writing has been observed and is a possible hurdle for broad applications of fragile cell direct writing. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact-induced cell mechanical loading profile in cell landing in terms of stress, acceleration, and maximum shear strain component during cell direct writing using a mesh-free smooth particle hydrodynamic method. Such cell mechanical loading profile information can be used to understand and predict possible impact-induced cell damage. It is found that the cell membrane usually undergoes a relatively severe deformation and the cell mechanical loading profile is dependent on the cell droplet initial velocity and the substrate coating thickness. Two important impact processes may occur during cell direct writing: the first impact between the cell droplet and the substrate coating and the second impact between the cell and the substrate. It is concluded that the impact-induced cell damage depends not only on the magnitudes of stress, acceleration, and/or shear strain but also the loading history that a cell experiences.									24	0	0	6	0	24			1087-1357			WOS:000255846300013

SOI-based micro scanning grating interferometers: device characterization, control and demonstration of parallel operation								JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING				18	4					045007	10.1088/0960-1317/18/4/045007			APR 2008	2008	An array of micro scanning grating interferometers (mu SGIs) with tunable gratings is designed, fabricated and successfully tested for simultaneous static and dynamic displacement measurements. Each mu SGI has capabilities of an optical scanning interferometer and in addition, miniaturization has made array operation feasible. All of the mu SGIs in an array can actively tune the distances between the gratings and the corresponding samples, simultaneously and independent of the other gratings, to maintain a bias position in a fringe for high displacement measurement sensitivity. The mu SGIs are fabricated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers and the gratings are moved by electrostatic actuation. The fabricated tunable gratings exhibit the first resonance mode at 50 kHz and a small damping ratio of similar to 0.05. The gratings show a sufficient (similar to 500 nm) displacement range for tuning to a high sensitivity position, achieved with a 30 V operating voltage range. Simulation results obtained from the finite element model of the mu SGI are in agreement with the experimental results. A control algorithm is implemented in real time in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to track the surface and to actively reduce the vibration noise. The use of the FPGA enables parallel and independent control and also operation of two mu SGIs. Experimental results show that approximately 40 dB vibration noise reduction is obtained at 100 Hz with the current setup.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0960-1317			WOS:000254151800007

However, puzzling results obtained from dependent measures of student learning were quite inconsistent with the previous research. With no adequate theoretical explanation for these results, a follow-up explanations phase of qualitative investigation was conducted. Analyses of interview data indicated that certain experimental conditions imposed upon students an unexpected distraction. Furthermore, quantitizing students' note-taking documents showed that many students in this study used a more effective note-taking strategy than did students in a similar condition in previous research.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1558-6898			WOS:000259070000003

Recaptured whelks were at large an average of 298 d (4-2,640 d). Growth, an increase in shell length (SL), was evident in 24% of the recaptured whelks, whereas 29% of recaptured individuals were the same size as when released and 47% were smaller than the released size. Mean growth rate was <0.001 mm SL/d and 0.022 mm SL/d if decreases in SL were assumed to be zero. Smaller whelks (<= 90 min SL) at large for over one year grew seven times faster than larger whelks. The von Bertalanffy growth model: SLt = 159.5(l - e(-0.0765(t+0.4162))), was developed from the mark-recapture whelks exhibiting growth. Based on a South Carolina minimum legal size of 102 mm SL, whelks recruit into the fishery at 13 y of age. The longevity, large size at maturity and slow growth suggest the potential for over harvest of knobbed whelk. Future whelk management plans may wish to consider whether economically viable commercial harvest can be sustainable.									13	0	1	12	1	16			0730-8000			WOS:000254880600024

One study utilized a sample of college students and the other a sample of U.S. Army soldiers. Factor analytic results from the two samples supported stigma and barriers to care being separate constructs. In the student sample, perceived stigma interacted with subjective stress to predict depression, such that the relationship between stress and depression was stronger when perceived stigma was high. In the military sample, barriers to care interacted with work overload to predict depression, such that the relationship between overload and depression was stronger when perceived barriers to care were high. Results reveal the importance of examining both stigma and barriers to care as moderators of the stressor-strain relationship, and reinforce the need to develop interventions to address stigma and remove barriers to care.									68	0	0	14	0	68			0736-7236			WOS:000255537700001		
J	Joshi, Hem Chandra; Toler, Joe; Walker, Terry								Optimization of cottonseed oil ethanolysis to produce biodiesel high in gossypol content								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OIL CHEMISTS SOCIETY				85	4			357	363		10.1007/s11746-008-1200-7			APR 2008	2008	Transesterification of cottonseed oil was carried out using ethanol and potassium hydroxide (KOH). A central composite design with six center and six axial points was used to study the effect of catalyst concentration, molar ratio of ethanol to cottonseed oil and reaction temperature for percentage yield (% yield) and percentage initial absorbance (%A(385nm)) of the biodiesel. Catalyst concentration and molar ratio of ethanol to cottonseed oil were the most significant variables affecting percentage conversion and %A(385nm). Maximum predicted % yield of 98% was obtained at a catalyst concentration of 1.07% (wt/wt) and ethanol to cottonseed oil molar ratio of 20:1 at reaction temperature of 25 degrees C. Maximum predicted %A (385nm) of more than 80% was obtained at 0.5% (wt/wt) catalyst concentration and molar ratio of 3:1 at 25 degrees C. The response surfaces that described % yield and %A(385nm) were inversely related. Gossypol concentration (% wt), oxidative stability and %A(385nm) of biodiesel were found to be highly correlated with each other. Hence, color %A(385nm) is a measure of the amount of pigments present in biodiesel fuels that have not yet been subjected to autoxidation. High gossypol concentration also corresponds to a fuel with high oxidative stability. The fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) produced from cottonseed oil had superior oxidative stability to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) produced from cottonseed oil.									27	2	0	9	0	29			0003-021X			WOS:000253755700009		
J	Pomper, Kirk W.; Crabtree, Sheri B.; Layne, Desmond R.; Peterson, R. Neal; Masabni, Joseph; Wolfe, Dwight								The Kentucky pawpaw regional variety trial								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN POMOLOGICAL SOCIETY				62	2			58	69					APR 2008	2008	The North American pawpaw [Asimina triloba (L.) Donal] is in the initial stages of commercial production. Two pawpaw variety trial orchards were established in Kentucky to evaluate the suitability of various varieties for this region. The first orchard was planted in the fall of 1995 in Princeton, at the University of Kentucky Research and Education Center (UKREC). A second orchard was planted in the spring of 1998 at the Kentucky State University (KSU) Research Farm in Frankfort. A randomized complete block design was used in both plantings with 8 replicates of 28 grafted cultivars and advanced selections. Cultivars being evaluated included 'Middletown', 'Mitchell', 'NC-1', 'Overleese', 'PA-Golden', 'Sunflower', 'Taylor', 'Taytwo', 'Wells', and 'Wilson'. The other 18 clones were selections from the PawPaw Foundation (PPF) breeding effort. Trunk cross-sectional area, number of fruit per tree, fruit weight, cumulative yield, cumulative yield efficiency, number of fruit per cluster, growing degree days required for ripening, harvest peak, harvest duration (days), and biennial bearing index all varied significantly among cultivars and advanced selections 7 to 9 years after planting at both planting sites. Fruit weight varied greatly, with some clones averaging less than 100 g per fruit ('Middletown', 'Wilson', and 'Rappahannock') and others averaging over 170 g per fruit ('Overleese', 8-20, 'NC-1', 'Susquehanna', 'Wabash', 5-5, and 'Potomac'). 'PA-Golden' and 2-10 were early ripening clones while 'Middletown' and 9-47 were late ripening clones. Cumulative yield varied greatly, with some cultivars and advanced selections exceeding 30 kg/tree. Cumulative yield efficiency ranged from 0.38 to 0.91 kg/cm(2) TCA. Based on fruit size yield, and availability, 'Potomac', 'Susquehanna', 'Wabash', 'Overleese', 'Shenandoah', 'NC-1', and 'Sunflower' can be recommended for production in this region. Additional PPF advanced selections that show promise are 10-35, 9-58, 2-10, 8-20, 5-5, and 1-68.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1527-3741			WOS:000255490700003

Proteges were 106 college freshmen randomly assigned to a senior college student mentor and to one of the two communication modes. Fifty-one mentors interacted with one of these proteges face-to-face and one solely through electronic chat. Electronic chat resulted in less psychosocial support, career support, and post-mentoring protege self-efficacy for those with male but not female mentors. Analyses of coded transcripts revealed that males condensed their language to a greater extent than did females in the electronic chat condition relative to the face-to-face condition. Dyads in the electronic chat condition had more interactive dialogue than did those in the face-to-face condition. Finally, dialogue inter-activity predicted post-mentoring self-efficacy but only for those who communicated through electronic chat. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The present research reports a detailed continuous one-dimensional transient-dynamic model of a metal V-belt CVT that accurately captures the various transient dynamic interactions occurring in the CVT system. Since a sundry of models mentioned in the literature ignore the influence of slip between the band pack and the belt element on the CVT performance, a unique model is outlined in this paper that aptly captures the slip-dynamics between the band-pack and the belt element. A considerable amount of effort in this paper is also dedicated towards modeling the inertial coupling between the belt and the pulley and studying its influence on the dynamic performance of a CVT. A metal V-belt CVT falls under the category of friction-limited drives as its performance and torque capacity rely significantly on the friction characteristic of the contact patch between the belt element and the pulley. A unique friction characteristic is also embedded into the CVT model to capture the effects of friction under dry and lubricated contact conditions. Simple trigonometric functions are introduced to capture the effects of pulley. exibility on the thrust ratio and slip behavior of the CVT. The results discuss the influence of band pack slip, friction characteristic, and pulley. exibility on the dynamic performance, the axial force requirements, and the torque transmitting capacity of a metal V-belt CVT drive.

The first step in this metabolic pathway is mediated by hexokinase, an enzyme that transfers they-phosphate of ATP to a hexose. The T brucei genome (TREU927/4 GUTat10.1) encodes two hexokinases (TbHK1 and TbHK2) that are 98% identical at the amino acid level. Our previous efforts have revealed that TbHK2 is an important regulator of TbHK1 in procyclic form parasites. Here, we have found through RNAi that TbHK1 is essential to the bloodstream form parasite. Silencing the gene for 4 days reduces cellular hexokinase similar to 60% and leads to parasite death. Additionally, we have found that the recombinant enzyme is inhibited by lonidamine (IC50 = 850 mu M), an anti-cancer drug that targets tumor hexokinases. This agent also inhibits HK activity from whole parasite lysate (IC50 = 965 mu M). Last, lonidamine is toxic to cultured bloodstream form parasites (LD50 = 50 mu M) and procyclic form parasites (LD50 = 180 mu M). Interestingly, overexpression of TbHK1 protects PF parasites from lonidamine. These studies provide genetic evidence that TbHK1 is a valid therapeutic target while identifying a potential molecular target of the anti-trypanosomal agent lonidamine. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Activation of growth hormone receptors by growth hormone and growth hormone antagonist dimers: Insights into receptor triggering								MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY				22	4			978	988		10.1210/me.2007-0424			APR 1 2008	2008	GH binds dimerized GH receptors (GHRs) to form a trimolecular complex and induces downstream signaling events. The mechanism by which GH binding converts the inactive predimerized GHR to its active signaling conformation is uncertain. GH has no axis of symmetry. Its interaction with GHR is mediated by two asymmetric binding sites on GH, each with distinct affinity. Site 1 is of high affinity and is thought to mediate the first binding step. Mutation of binding site 2 ( as in the human GH mutant, G120R) disrupts the second binding but leaves site 1 binding intact. G120R is a GH antagonist; it binds only one GHR and thus fails to signal, and it prevents productive GHR binding by normal GH. We previously demonstrated that prolactin receptor signaling was achieved by a dimeric version of a prolactin antagonist. We now employ assays of cellular signaling and receptor conformational changes to examine whether GH molecules harboring two site 1 regions can trigger GHR activation. We used recombinantly produced GH-GH and G120R-G120R dimers in which monomers in tandem are connected by a short linker peptide. Rabbit GHR-expressing human fibrosarcoma cells (C14) were treated with GH, G120R, GH-GH, or G120R-G120R. As expected, GH and GH-GH, but not G120R, induced GHR disulfide linkage, as assessed by anti-GHR blotting of cell extracts resolved by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Disulfide linkage of GHRs reflects attainment of the active signaling conformation. Likewise, GH and GH-GH, but not G120R, caused Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation. Notably, G120RG120R, despite its lack of an intact site 2 in either dimer partner, also promoted GHR disulfide linkage and JAK2 and STAT5 activation, albeit less potently than either GH or GH-GH. Time-course responses of the three agonists were similar in terms of JAK2 and STAT5 activation. Pretreatment of cells with our conformation-sensitive inhibitory monoclonal antibody, anti-GHR(ext-mAb), prevented ligand-induced receptor activation for all three agonists. GHR was also rendered less immunoprecipitable by anti-GHR (ext-mAb), after treatment with these agonists. These results are important in that they indicate that a ligand with two intact binding sites 1 causes GHR to adopt similar conformational changes as does GH and thus triggers activation of JAK2 and downstream signaling. Furthermore, we infer that there is substantial flexibility in the GHR extracellular domain, such that it productively accommodates GH dimers that are much larger than GH.					89th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine-Society89th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine-Society	20072007	Endocrine SocEndocrine Soc	Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	22	1	0	21	2	26			0888-8809			WOS:000254421500016	18096690

A chain CVT is a friction-limited drive as its performance and torque capacity rely significantly on the friction characteristic of the contact patch between the chain and the pulley. Moreover, such a CVT is susceptible to clearance formation due to assembly defects or extensive continual operation of the system, which further degrades its performance and leads to early wear and failure of the system. The present research focuses on developing models to understand the influence of clearance and different friction characteristics on the dynamic performance of a chain CVT drive. A detailed planar multibody model of a chain CVT is developed in order to accurately capture the dynamics characterized by the discrete structure of the chain, which causes polygonal excitations in the system. A suitable model for clearance between the chain links is embedded into this multibody model of the chain CVT. Friction between the chain link and the pulley sheaves is modeled using different mathematical models which account for different loading scenarios. The mathematical models, the computational scheme, and the results corresponding to different loading scenarios are discussed. The results discuss the influence of friction characteristics and clearance parameters on the dynamic performance, the axial force requirements, and the torque transmitting capacity of a chain CVT drive.									16	0	0	0	0	16			1384-5640			WOS:000253528900004		
J	van Landingham, Nathaniel B.; Straka, Thomas J.; Franklin, Robert M.								Economic analysis of conservation forestry practices: a south Carolina Lowcountry example								NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL				28	2			171	179		10.3375/0885-8608(2008)28[171:EAOCFP]2.0.CO;2			APR 2008	2008	The Lowcountry Forest Conservation Project was designed to encourage conservation forestry practices on South Carolina's lower coastal plain. The area has great ecological diversity and need for the type of protections afforded by conservation forestry. The project provided demonstrations of these practices and offered forest owners an estimate of the cost-effectiveness of the techniques. This article reports on a financial analysis of the three main practices: (1) the reintroduction of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris P. Miller) into areas that are now loblolly pine plantations (Pinus taeda L.), (2) more and better use of prescribed fire, and (3) bottomland hardwood management. Longleaf pine reintroduction was accomplished using partial clearcuts of existing pine plantations over several decades. Financial return was shown to be competitive with intensively-managed loblolly pine plantations. Pine straw production played a large role in increasing cash flows. Prescribed burning was shown to "pay for itself" in increased stumpage prices and reduced harvesting costs. A technique to better manage bottomland hardwoods for economic returns was discussed. Conservation forestry practices were shown to be economically-effective means to manage forests while benefiting wildlife, aesthetics, and other ecological values. These techniques can be used to analyze other practices and techniques that are used to protect natural areas. Often they can be shown to "pay their own way".									0	0	0	0	0	0			0885-8608			WOS:000255615300009		
J	Holloway, Mary V.; Beasley, Donald E.; Conner, Michael E.								Single-phase convective heat transfer in rod bundles								NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN				238	4			848	858		10.1016/j.nucengdes.2007.08.003			APR 2008	2008	The convective heat transfer for turbulent flow through rod bundles representative of nuclear fuel rods used in pressurized water reactors is examined. The rod bundles consist of a square array of parallel rods that are held on a constant pitch by support grids spaced axially along the rod bundle. Split-vane pair support grids, which create swirling flow in the rod bundle, as well as disc and standard support grids are investigated. Single-phase convective heat transfer coefficients are measured for flow downstream of support grids in a rod bundle. The rods are heated using direct resistance heating, and a bulk axial flow of air is used to cool the rods in the rod bundle. Air is used as the working fluid instead of water to reduce the power required to heat the rod bundle. Results indicate heat transfer enhancement for up to 10 hydraulic diameters downstream of the support grids. A general correlation is developed to predict the heat transfer development downstream of support grids. In addition, circumferential variations in heat transfer coefficients result in hot streaks that develop on the rods downstream of split-vane pair support grids. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Stone-Romero, Eugene F.; Rosopa, Patrick J.								The relative validity of inferences about mediation as a function of research design characteristics								ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH METHODS				11	2			326	352		10.1177/1094428107300342			APR 2008	2008	Tests of assumed mediation models are common in the organizational sciences. However, the validity of inferences about mediation is a function of experimental design and the setting of a study. Regrettably, most tests of mediation have relied on the application of so-called "causal modeling" techniques to data from nonexperimental studies. As we demonstrate, inferences about the validity of assumed mediation models are highly suspect when they are based on the findings of nonexperimental research. One of the many reasons for this is the failure of the model being tested to be consistent with reality. Valid research-based inferences about mediation are possible. However, inferences from such tests are most likely to be valid when they are based on research that uses randomized experimental designs. Strategies for conducting research using these and other designs are described. Finally, we offer a set of conclusions and recommendations that stem from our analysis.									112	1	0	5	1	113			1094-4281			WOS:000253949700006

Effects of time-specific F-Strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum inoculation overlays on prelay ts11-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum inoculation on performance characteristics of commercial laying hens								POULTRY SCIENCE				87	4			655	660		10.3382/ps.2007-00492			APR 2008	2008	Mycoplasma bacteria are virtually ubiquitous in layer chicken flocks, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum is the species of greatest concern to commercial egg producers. Live M. gallisepticum vaccines were initially approved by the USDA for use in commercial layers in 1988 to help control M. gallisepticum outbreaks. In the present study, 2 trials were conducted to determine the effects of 2 currently available live Mycoplasma vaccines (the ts11- and F-strains) when used together. The following 4 inoculation treatments were used: 1) sham inoculation at 10 wk of age, 2) ts11 at 10 wk, 3) ts11 at 10 wk overlaid by the F-strain at 22 wk, and 4) ts11 at 10 wk overlaid by the F-strain at 45 wk. In each trial, at various ages between 18 and 57 wk of age, hen mortality; BW; egg weight; egg production; eggshell breaking strength; incidences of egg blood spots, egg meat spots, and eggshell pimpling; and eggshell weight per unit of surface area were assessed. The effects of inoculation treatment on egg weight at 27, 37, and 38 wk were inconsistent and variable. Eggshell pimpling and egg blood spot incidences at 56 wk were highest in eggs belonging to the ts11 at 10 wk/F-strain at 45 wk group. Despite increases in pimpling and blood spot incidences very late in production because of the ts11 at 10 wk/F-strain at 45 wk treatment, performance in layers was not adversely affected by a 10-wk ts11 inoculation alone or in conjunction with subsequent overlay inoculations of the F-strain during lay. It is therefore suggested that the 10-wk inoculation of commercial layers with ts11 may reduce the negative impacts of a prelay F-strain inoculation on performance, as reported in earlier studies, while providing protection against subsequent field strain M. gallisepticum infections. Furthermore, the ts11- and F-strain M. gallisepticum treatment combinations may overcome some of the inadequacies that prelay ts11- or F-strain M. gallisepticum vaccines may have when given independently.									9	0	0	8	0	9			0032-5791			WOS:000254307100008	18339985

Measurements were performed to independently evaluate the: (1) quasi-static geometric errors using the laser ball bar; (2) variations in geometric errors due to thermal effects; (3) spindle thermal growth errors using a capacitance gage nest; (4) two-dimensional contouring errors using a grid plate encoder; and (5) surface location error due to (stable) forced vibrations during cutting. The effects of the first three error components were related to part dimensions using a homogeneous transformation matrix approach integrated into a Monte Carlo simulation. A comparison of the individual influences of these error sources showed that the cutting force error was dominant for the high-speed machining center/tool-holder combination selected for this study.

Nymphs and adults were found in Newfoundland at 16 localities on common or soft rush, Juncus effusus ssp. effusus L., and at a site in Washington on J. effusus ssp. pacificus (Fernald & Wiegand) Lint ex Zika (Juncaceae). Although the distributional status is equivocal, we consider C. anceps an immigrant in Newfoundland and the Pacific Northwest. Also newly recorded for the Atlantic provinces of Canada are the Nearctic planthopper Phyllodinus nervatus Van Duzee, collected from common hairgrass, Deschampsia flexuosa (L.) Trin. (Poaceae); the Holarctic Megamelus flavus Crawford, which was found on the sedge Carex buxbaumii Wahlenberg (Cyperaceae); and the Nearctic Muellerianella laminalis (Van Duzee), swept from grasses. Pissonotus basalis Van Duzee, a Nearctic delphacid known previously in the Atlantic provinces from Nova Scotia, was found on Aster novi-belgii L. (Asteraceae). Diagnoses, brief descriptions, and habitus photographs of the adults are provided to facilitate identification of these delphacids.									2	0	0	3	0	3			0013-8797			WOS:000254568200001

Expectation affects verbal judgments but not reaches to visually perceived egocentric distances								PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW				15	2			437	442		10.3758/PBR.15.2.437			APR 2008	2008	Two response measures for reporting visually perceived egocentric distances-verbal judgments and blind manual reaches-were compared using a within-trial methodology. The expected range of possible target distances was manipulated by instructing the subjects that the targets would be between .50 and 1.00 of their maximum arm reach in one session and between .25 and .90 in another session. The actual range of target distances was always .50-.90. Verbal responses varied as a function of the range of expected distances, whereas simultaneous reaches remained unaffected. These results suggest that verbal responses are subject to a cognitive influence that does not affect actions. It is suggested that action responses are indicative of absolute perception, whereas cognitive responses may reflect only relative perception. The results also indicate that the dependant variable utilized for the study of depth perception will influence the obtained results.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1069-9384			WOS:000257217700029	18488665

Effects of crumb rubber variability on failure temperature of Crumb Rubber Modified binders								ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN				9	2			291	309		10.3166/RMPD.9.291-309			APR-JUN 2008	2008	Failure temperature of an asphalt binder is one of the criteria used when assigning a performance grade to the binder. Previous studies have shown that the modification of the binder with crumb rubber improves the high temperature properties. This paper investigates the effects of different crumb rubber sources on Crumb Rubber Modified (CRM) binder failure temperatures as defined by SHRP testing procedures. The objectives of this research were to identify crumb rubber properties affecting the rutting susceptibility of the CRM binders. The properties of four crumb rubber sources were identified by: grinding procedure (ambient and cryogenic), elemental analysis by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and glass transition temperature by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). Findings suggest that ambient ground particles yielded the highest G*/sin delta values, while the elemental composition of the crumb rubber exhibited only a limited effect on the G*/sin delta.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1468-0629			WOS:000257263200008

J	Tascan, Mevlut; Vaughn, Edward A.								Effects of total surface area and fabric density on the acoustical behavior of needlepunched nonwoven fabrics								TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL				78	4			289	296		10.1177/0040517507084283			APR 2008	2008	Nonwoven fabrics are ideal materials for use as acoustical insulation products because they have high total surface. The surface area of the fabric is directly related to the denier and cross-sectional shape of the fibers in the fabric. Smaller deniers yield more fibers per unit weight of the material, higher total fiber surface area and greater possibilities for a sound wave to interact with the fibers in the structure. Another important parameter is the packing density of the fibers in the nonwoven material. More fibers per unit volume at the same fabric thickness yield greater possibilities for sound waves to interact with the fibers. Fabric density also affects the geometry and the volume of the voids in the fabric structure. Acoustical properties of fabric materials are measured by one of two methods: the impedance tube method (ASTM C 384-98) and the acoustical chamber method. The impedance tube method uses very small test samples. Large reverberation rooms and large test samples are used for the acoustic chamber method. A direct comparative acoustical properties measurement device has been developed and fabricated at Clemson University School of Materials Science and Engineering. This paper provides a description of the measurement devices and acoustical measurement data for needlepunched nonwoven fabrics made from three different polyester fiber shapes and two denier levels.									27	1	0	0	0	28			0040-5175			WOS:000255714700002

In apricots, the resistance is controlled by a major quantitative trait locus that explains up to 70% of the phenotypic variance; it is localised in the upper part of linkage group 1. In this report, we transformed candidate genes that mapped in the region of the apricot resistance locus into polymerase chain reaction markers (SSCP and SSR) and tested for their co-localisation with the major PPV resistance locus in related and unrelated populations. Three populations of F1 and F2 individuals issued from crosses between the PPV-resistant cultivar `Stark Early Orange' or `Goldrich' and three susceptible parents were used in this study. Molecular-marker data were collected to determine the linkage relationship between the PPV resistance locus in apricots and markers that target candidate disease-resistance genes. In addition, SSR markers linked to resistance-gene candidates were mapped to positions flanking the PPV resistance locus in different apricot populations. Therefore, we demonstrate that this strategy helps to saturate the major genomic region controlling resistance to PPV in apricot with valuable co-dominant markers.									16	0	0	16	0	17			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000253091100020

Scar differentiation involves inputs from multiple cell types in a predictable and overlapping sequence of cellular events that includes inflammation, migration/proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. Research into the molecular mechanisms underpinning these processes in embryonic and adult wounds has contributed to the development of a growing number of novel therapeutic approaches for improving scar appearance. This review discusses some of these emerging strategies for shifting the balance of healing from scarring to regeneration in the context of non-pathological wounds. Particular focus is given to potential therapies based on transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling and recent unexpected findings involving targeting of gap junctional connexins. Lessons learned in promoting scarless healing of cutaneous injuries might provide a basis for regenerative healing in other scenarios, such as spinal cord rupture or myocardial infarction.									98	8	0	68	0	107			0167-7799			WOS:000255266200003	18295916

Palmer amaranth and large crabgrass growth with plasticulture-grown bell pepper								WEED TECHNOLOGY				22	2			296	302		10.1614/WT-07-043.1			APR-JUN 2008	2008	Field experiments were conducted in 2004 and 2005 at Clemson, SC, and in 2004 at Clinton, NC, to quantify Palmer amaranth and large crabgrass growth and interference with plasticulture-grown bell pepper over multiple environments and develop models which can be used on a regional basis to effectively time removal of these weeds. Experiments at both locations consisted of an early and a late spring planting, with the crop and weeds planted alone and in combination. Daily maximum and minimum air temperatures were used to calculate growing degree days (GDD, base 10 Q accumulated following bell pepper transplanting and weed emergence. Linear and nonlinear empirical models were used to describe ht, canopy width, and biomass production as a function of accumulated GDD. Palmer amaranth reduced bell pepper fruit set as early as 6 wk after transplanting (WATP) (648 GDD), whereas large crabgrass did not significantly reduce fruit set until 8 WATP (864 GDD). Using the developed models and assuming Palmer amaranth and large crabgrass emergence on the day of bell pepper transplanting, Palmer amaranth was predicted to be the same ht as bell pepper at 287 GDD (20 cm tall) and large crabgrass the same ht as bell pepper at 580 GDD (34 cm tall).									25	0	0	24	0	25			0890-037X			WOS:000257097000016

Modification of regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membranes by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization								JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE				311	1-2			225	234		10.1016/j.memsci.2007.12.036			MAR 20 2008	2008	This paper describes the modification of 100, 300 and 1000kD regenerated cellulose membranes by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Surface-initiated ATRP was used to grow poly[poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate] layers from the membrane pore surfaces. Membrane characterization was done by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, FE SEM, AFM, and contact angle measurements. Water flux measurements and dextran rejection studies were also conducted with membranes modified for different polymerization times. Water flux decreased monotonically with increasing polymerization times, while the dextran rejection curves shifted to lower molecular weight cutoff values. AFM images collected before and after rejection testing showed no evidence of fouling by dextran adsorption. These findings support our conclusion that ATRP allows the controlled manipulation of membrane pore size. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, electric-force microscopy is used to probe the electrical properties of a heterogeneous layout of manganese oxide nanostructures grown as a film on a MnCO3 substrate. The role of water sorption is examined by carrying out experiments for increasing relative humidity (RH). Electric-force images collected with a negative dc tip bias show that the apparent heights of the nanostructures decrease from +3.4 urn at 16% RH to +0.7 nm at 33% RH to -5.6 nm at 74% RH, although the topographic height is 2.3 nm regardless of RH. The apparent heights for a positive dc bias also decrease with increasing RH from -3.5 nm at 16% RH to -8.9 nm at 74%. The explanation for these trends is that the dominant electric-force transitions with increasing RH from an electrostatic force attributable to surface potential to a polarization force arising from hydrated, mobile surface ions including Mn2+ and CO32-. The positive-to-negative trend in apparent heights implies that either the density or the intrinsic mobility (or both) of mobile ions over the substrate exceeds that over the nanostructures, implying increased water sorption over the former compared to the latter. Ridges around the perimeter of the nanostructures also develop above 40% RH for images collected using a negative dc tip bias. A tip-induced gradient of net positive charge near the nanostructure edges, which implies the nonequivalence of cations and anions there, explain this observation. The findings of this study show that thin films of nanostructures on mineral surfaces have complex but measurable RH-dependent electrical properties.									6	0	0	2	0	6			0743-7463			WOS:000253941000037	18288869

In this paper, we suggest and evaluate an optimization procedure which specializes in solving a wide variety of optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is designed as a generic multi-objective, multi-optima optimizer. Care has been taken while designing the algorithm such that it automatically degenerates to efficient algorithms for solving other simpler optimization problems, such as single-objective uni-optimal problems, singleobjective multi-optima problems and multi-objective uni-optimal problems. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm in solving various problems is demonstrated on a number of test problems chosen from the literature. Because of its efficiency in handling different types of problems with equal ease, this algorithm should find increasing use in real-world optimization problems. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Based on ecological background and availability, we select three variables, the aspect class, the soil depth and the land type association as covariates for analysis. To allow great flexibility of the smoothness of the random field, we choose the Matern family as the correlation function. We adopt the reference prior as an appropriate prior because there is no previous knowledge of the parameters in the model. An efficient algorithm based on the generalized Ratio-of-Uniforms method is developed for the posterior simulation. One advantage of the algorithm is that it generates independent samples from the required posterior distribution, which is much more efficient for both statistical inference of the parameters and prediction of the site indexes at unsampled locations. Our results show that the aspect class and the soil depth are both significant while the land type association is less significant. The model validation is briefly discussed. In addition, our simulation method allows easy realization for computing quantities from the posterior predictive distributions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In these p-type materials, the Zr site is primarily substituted with Ti to reduce thermal conductivity (kappa), while the Sn content is varied to optimize thermoelectric properties. For these compositions, these alloys exhibit moderate resistivity (rho) in the m Omega cm range and high positive thermopower (kappa), on the order of hundreds of mu V/K. Measured Hall coefficients suggest that holes are dominant charge carriers. Calculated carrier mobilities are rather low in the range of 0.8-1.5 cm(2)/V s. Thermal conductivity (kappa) values as low as similar to 8.5-4.5 W m(-1) K(-1) are also measured. The calculated thermoelectric figure of merit ZT = alpha(2)T/rho kappa is as high as 0.2 at T = 1000 K, implying that these alloys could be potential p-type thermoelectric materials for energy conversion at high temperatures.

The reduction and oxidation processes were found to be electrochemically quasi-reversible by cyclic voltammetry techniques, suggestive of a nondegenerate LUMO and accessible LUMO + 1. The electrochemical properties of SC3N@C-80 (I-h) were comparatively discussed with our previous results performed in o-dichlorobenzene and results published by other authors in an acetonitrile/toluene solvent mixture.

The effects of several key processing parameters, including the number of deposition cycles, cationic concentration, dipping speed, and holding/immersing time, have been investigated. Growth rates of similar to 4-12 nm per deposition cycle for as-deposited films (i.e., similar to 2-6 nm/cycle for annealed films), tunable via varying the key deposition parameters, have been demonstrated.

The associated material includes associated right and left vomerine plates, and the right palatine plate. Comparison of the Kansas vomerines with the type of "Edaphodon" laqueatus, a right vomerine from Lower Campanian strata of eastern Mississippi, indicates that the remains are conspecific. However, our analysis also shows that these vomerine plates are distinct from Edaphodon, principally because of a massive, hammer-like beak, and overall modification of the oral surfaces into flat crushing plates, rather than oblique shearing surfaces as seen in Edaphodon. In addition, whereas there are three large tritors on an Edaphodon palatine, the Niobrara palatine has four very small tritors, with two inner tritors, a middle tritor, and an outer tritor. Our conclusion is that the original taxonomic designation, Eumylodus laqueatits Leidy, 1873, is valid, and the geographic distribution of the taxon extended from the Mississippi embayment to the central portion of the Western Interior Seaway, U.S.A.									6	0	0	7	0	7			0272-4634			WOS:000254408700004

Impact of solvent quality on the density profiles of looped triblock copolymer brushes by neutron reflectivity measurements								MACROMOLECULES				41	5			1745	1752		10.1021/ma702179x			MAR 11 2008	2008	Preferential adsorption of poly(2-vinylpyridine)-deuterated polystyrene-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PVP-dPS-PVP) triblock copolymers from toluene onto silicon leads to the formation of dPS loops tethered by the PVP end blocks. Using neutron reflectometry, we have determined the segment density profiles of these looped polymer brushes in toluene, a good solvent for the dPS block, and in cyclohexane at 20 degrees C (poor solvent), 32 degrees C, (near-Theta solvent), and 50 degrees C (marginal solvent). While the swelling behavior qualitatively agrees with that observed for singly grafted brushes, there are interesting differences in the local structural details: In a good solvent, the segment density profiles are composed of an inner parabolic region and a long, extended tail. In cyclohexane, the profiles are described by exponential decays. We ascribe these features to a novel polydispersity effect that arises due to tethering the PS loops by both ends. The results also show that the less dense layers undergo more significant changes in swollen height as solvent quality is changed and that the looped brushes of different molecular weight, asymmetry, and tethering density adhere to scaling relationships derived for lightly cross-linked polymer gels.									13	0	0	1	0	13			0024-9297			WOS:000253728100026

However, to date, little has been reported about their activation/deactivation characteristics. For this paper, the activation/deactivation behaviors of such sulfonated carbon catalysts were investigated through the esterification of free fatty acids (acetic acid and caprylic acid) and transesterification of triglycerides (triacetin, tricaprylin and soybean oil) with methanol. The catalytic properties of the sulfonated catalysts were compared with those of Nafion (R) SAC-13 and sulfuric acid, other similar Bronsted acid catalysts. For the liquid-phase esterification of acetic acid and transesterification of triacetin with methanol, the sulfonated carbon catalysts exhibited catalytic site activities comparable to those for sulfuric acid, along with higher (by weight) specific catalytic activities but lower initial TOFs compared with Nafion (R) SAC-13. Catalyst swelling was critical for catalytic activity of the sulfonated carbon catalysts. Poor swelling in the gas phase of the catalysts led to the appearance of an induction period and inferior catalytic performance in the gas-phase esterification of acetic acid. In the liquid-phase esterification of acetic acid, catalytic activity decreased during the initial reaction batch cycles but reached a plateau after several catalytic cycles at 60 degrees C. Elemental analysis, H-1 NMR results of the liquid reaction mixtures after reaction, and the decreased activity of the catalysts after extensive solvent washing suggest that the initial catalyst deactivation was caused by the leaching of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons containing -SO3H groups. Cycling experiments involving large triglycerides actually showed a cumulative effect of slower catalyst swelling in the less-polar reaction mixtures moderated by deactivation of the catalyst due to leaching, resulting in increased activity in the early cycles followed by a loss of activity in later cycles.

The suitability of the spraying technologies is assessed with respect to a need for metal-stamping surface preparation/treatment, their ability to deposit the polymeric material without significant material degradation, the ability to selectively overcoat the metal-stamping, the resulting magnitude of the polymer-to-metal adhesion strength, durability of the polymer/metal bond with respect to prolonged exposure to high-temperature/high-humidity and mechanical/thermal fatigue service conditions, and compatibility with the automotive body-in-white (BIW) manufacturing process chain. The analysis revealed that while each of the spraying technologies has some limitations, the cold-gas dynamic-spray process appears to be the leading candidate technology for the indicated applications.

Hybrid rice response to nitrogen fertilization for midsouthern United States rice production								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				100	2			381	386		10.2134/agronj2007.0047			MAR-APR 2008	2008	Limited data representing the southern U.S. production area exists for N nutrition in hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of N fertilizer rates and application timings on grain and whole milled rice yield for 'XL723'(RiceTec, Inc., Alvin, TX) as compared with widely grown inbred rice cv. Cocodrie on clay soils and Cheniere on silt loam soils. A factorial arrangement of cultivar, preflood (PF), particle differentiation (PD), and panicle emergence (PE) N rates were established in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri for a total of three site-years each for clay and silt loam soils. On clay soils, XL723 grain yield increased with increasing PF-N rate reaching 12,332 kg ha(-1) at a PF-N rate of 202 kg N ha(-1). 'Cocodrie' grain yield did not substantially increase with PF-N >151 kg N ha(-1). Averaged across cultivars, a PD-N rate of 50 kg N ha(-1) increased grain yields by 729 kg ha(-1) when 101 kg N ha(-1) was applied; however, as PF-N rate increased, the effects of PD-N were not significant. On silt loam soils, grain yields were 327 kg ha(-1) greater when 151 kg N ha(-1) was applied PF compared with 101 kg N ha(-1). Furthermore, a PE-N rate of 50 kg N ha(-1) increased grain yield by 333 kg ha(-1). On clay soils, maximum whole milled rice was obtained when a minimum of 151 kg N ha(-1) was applied PF and 50 kg N ha(-1) was applied at PE. On silt loam soils, the 101 kg N ha(-1) PF rate produced 625 mg g(-1) whole milled rice for Cheniere, whereas, the greatest concentration (613 mg g(-1)) of whole milled rice for XL723 was produced with 202 kg N ha(-1). Finally, yield potential was 17 to 20% greater for XL723 compared with the inbred cultivars; however, at equal N rates, whole milled rice was higher with conventional inbred cultivars compared with XL723. Hybrid rice can be used in the southern U.S. rice-growing region to increase rice yield per unit of land area. Preflood N rates on hybrid rice should be equal to or greater than inbred cultivars. For practical implications, N management for hybrid rice should include a PE application to increase yield, whole milled rice, and also decrease the potential for lodging. As straw-strength increases with new rice hybrids, PF-N management should be reevaluated for increased yield potential.									24	2	0	24	0	27			0002-1962			WOS:000254501200019

Specifically, at a Weissenberg number larger than a critical value, the iterative nonlinear solver fails to converge. In this paper a two-parameter defect-correction method for viscoelastic fluid flow is presented and analyzed. In the defect step the Weissenberg number is artificially reduced to solve a stable nonlinear problem. The approximation is then improved in the correction step using a linearized correction iteration. Numerical experiments support the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Stuart, Steven/H-1111-2012				Calculation of adsorption free energy for solute-surface interactions using biased replica-exchange molecular dynamics								BIOINTERPHASES				3	1			9	18		10.1116/1.2840054			MAR 2008	2008	The adsorption behavior of a biomolecule, such as a peptide or protein, to a functionalized surface is of fundamental importance for a broad range of applications in biotechnology. The adsorption free energy for these types of interactions can be determined from a molecular dynamics simulation using the partitioning between adsorbed and nonadsorbed states, provided that sufficient sampling of both states is obtained. However, if interactions between the solute and the surface are strong, the solute will tend to be trapped near the surface during the simulation, thus preventing the adsorption free energy from being calculated by this method. This situation occurs even when using an advanced sampling algorithm such as replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD). In this paper, the authors demonstrate the fundamental basis of this problem using a model system consisting of one sodium ion (Na+) as the solute positioned over a surface functionalized with one negatively charged group (COO-) in explicit water. With this simple system, the authors show that sufficient sampling in the coordinate normal to the surface cannot be obtained by conventional REMD alone. The authors then present a method to overcome this problem through the use of an adaptive windowed-umbrella sampling technique to develop a biased-energy function that is combined with REMD. This approach provides an effective method for the calculation of adsorption free energy for solute-surface interactions.

Many polymeric composite biomaterials have been designed and used for modulating dual-protein delivery to enhance tissue regeneration in vitro or in vivo. However, the fabrication conditions and low water contents within the portions of these composite matrices that determine protein release rates are not optimal for maintaining the stability of encapsulated macromolecular therapeutics. In this proof-of-concept work, we aim to resolve this deficiency by single-step fabrication of affinity hydrogels capable of independently delivering two or more proteins. Selective protein-binding sites were incorporated into poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels via copolymerization with glycidyl methacrylate-immodiacetic acid (GMIDA) ligands to modulate release of two model proteins, lysozyme and hexahistidine tagged green fluorescent protein (hisGFP), via two distinct matrix-binding mechanisms, namely electrostatic interaction and metal-ion chelation. Differing from composite matrices for dual-protein delivery, the results reported herein indicate that injectable monolithic affinity hydrogels are capable of rapidly encapsulating multiple therapeutic agents under mild physiological conditions and independently controlling their localized delivery. Most importantly, these affinity hydrogels retain high water permeabilities throughout the entire device, characteristics that are necessary for maintaining the stability and viability of encapsulated proteins and cells.									29	0	0	12	0	29			1525-7797			WOS:000253926400006	18257528

Characterizing the toxicity of pulsed selenium exposure to Daphnia magna								CHEMOSPHERE				71	3			429	438		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.11.019			MAR 2008	2008	The acute toxicity of selenium (Se) to aquatic biota has been studied extensively for decades. However, most studies have used a constant concentration aqueous exposure of Se to an invertebrate species. Since constant concentration exposure of toxicants to invertebrates is unusual in the environment, episodic exposure or pulsed exposures may represent true risk to aquatic biota more accurately. This research was designed to characterize the toxicity effects of pulsed Se exposure to Daphnia magna. Selenium exposure was varied during a 21-d chronic toxicity test to examine the effects of exposure concentration, duration, and recovery on survival, growth, and reproduction of D. magna. While D. magna did not die during exposures, latent mortality was observed. Latent mortality increased with exposure concentration and duration. Hence, standard toxicity test using continuous exposures would underestimate Se toxicity. Risk assessment method using results of continuous exposure would underestimate risk of Se to biota. For double-pulse exposures, cumulative mortality on day 21 was higher when time interval between pulses was shorter. With the same total exposure time, continuous exposure caused higher toxicity than did pulsed exposures due to recovery and tolerance development in D. magna after earlier pulses. Growth and reproduction of surviving D. magna were not affected by pulsed Se exposure due to recovery of D. magna after removal of the pulses. Based on these results, risk assessment for Se should take latent effects and the effect of recovery in to account. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This study compared isotherms of two commonly available and distinct reference BCs (n-hexane soot (BCRM) and diesel particulate matter (SRM 2975)) and a natural sediment from a source with little black carbon (Lake Hartwell, SC) using 3,3',4-trichlorobiphenyl (IUPAC #35) as a model sorbate. There was greater sorptivity for PCB-35 by BCRM than by SRM 2975. The observed differences in sorption between the two reference black carbons for PCB-35 may be ascribed to the different chemical characteristics of the black carbons. Differences in pore volume distribution at < 16 A pore width are less likely to be responsible for the observed differences in sorption. The elemental analysis confirmed that BCRM was a pure n-hexane soot because only C, H and O were measured. In contrast, SRM 2975 also contained N and S and a higher O% than BCRM. Compared to the low BC sediment, the two reference BCs had greater pore volume distributions, surface areas, total pore volumes and sorption. The observed n(F) (i.e., Freundlich exponent) values for PCB indicated greater linearity of the isotherms for the natural sediment than for the reference black carbons. For designing studies of sorption of HOCs in natural systems, in particular, when PCBs are contaminants of concern, results of this study can aid selection of the appropriate reference BCs.

The optimum electrokinetic devices performance is dependent on a figure of merit, in which the Stem layer conductance appears as a nondimensional Dukhin number. Such surface conductance is found to significantly reduce the figure of merit and thus the efficiency and power output. This finding may explain why the recently measured electrokinetic devices performances are far below the theoretical predictions where the effects of Stem layer conductance have been ignored.									47	0	0	10	0	47			0173-0835			WOS:000254195300016	18246575

Methodology for comparing source and plume remediation alternatives								GROUND WATER				46	2			272	285		10.1111/j.1745-6584.2007.00416.x			MAR-APR 2008	2008	It is often difficult at contaminated sites to decide whether remediation effort should be focused on the contaminant source, the dissolved plume, or on both zones. The decision process at these sites is hampered by a lack of quantitative tools for comparing remediation alternatives. A new screening-level mass balance approach is developed for simulating the transient effects of simultaneous ground water source and plume remediation. The contaminant source model is based on a power function relationship between source mass and source discharge, and it can consider partial source remediation at any time after the initial release. The source model serves as a time-dependent mass flux boundary condition to a new analytical plume model, where flow is assumed to be one dimensional, with three-dimensional dispersion. The plume model simulates first-order sequential decay and production of several species, and the decay rates and parent/daughter yield coefficients are variable functions of time and distance. This new method allows for flexible simulation of natural attenuation or remediation efforts that enhance plume degradation. The plume remediation effort may be temporary or delayed in time, limited in space, and it may have different chemical effects on different contaminant species in the decay chain.									21	0	0	12	0	21			0017-467X	1745-6584		WOS:000253812000012	18266737

Robust feedback control for a class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL				53	2			591	596		10.1109/TAC.2008.916658			MAR 2008	2008	In this paper, a continuous feedback tracking controller is developed for a class of high-order multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with an input gain matrix that has nonzero leading principal minors but can be nonsymmetric. Under the mild assumption that the signs of the leading minors of the control input gain matrix are known, the controller yields locally uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) tracking while compensating for unstructured uncertainty in both the drift vector and the input matrix. First, a full-state feedback controller is designed based on limited assumptions on the structure of the system nonlinearities, and the singularity-free controller is proven to yield locally UUB tracking through a Lyapunov-based analysis. Then, it is shown that an output feedback control can be designed based on a high-gain observer. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed control algorithm.									25	0	0	0	0	25			0018-9286			WOS:000254184600015

SU-8 is attractive for micromachined multilayer circuit fabrication because it is photo-polymerizable resin, leading to safe, economical processing. The ability to fabricate air-bridges provides a means of suppressing the coupled slotline mode, thereby enabling single-mode design. The air-bridges also provide ground equalization at coplanar discontinuities. The properties of the air-bridge are investigated and compared to similar structures without air-bridges. As examples of possible device applications of this technology, an asymmetrical slot antenna and coplanar waveguide both operating at 35 GHz are presented. The return loss of both devices is 5 dB lower on structures that contain the air-bridge. This technology is promising for extending the use of SU-8 at millimeter-wave frequencies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1521-3331			WOS:000253734000018

At an initial stage, designers must evaluate many architecture design points to achieve a suitable design. Currently, most architecture exploration is performed using cycle accurate simulators. Although accurate, these tools are slow, thus limiting a comprehensive design search. The vast design space of today's complex processors and time to market economic pressures motivate the need for faster architectural evaluation methods. This paper presents a superscalar processor performance model that enables rapid exploration of the architecture design space for superscalar processors. It supplements current design tools by quickly identifying promising areas for more thorough and time consuming exploration with traditional tools. The model estimates the instruction throughput of a superscalar processor based on early architectural design parameters and application properties. It has been validated with the SimpleScalar out-of-order simulator. The core of the model, which executes 1.6 million times faster, produces instruction throughput estimates that are with within 5.5 percent of the corresponding SimpleScalar values.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0018-9340			WOS:000252471400008

Real-time incremental segmentation and tracking of vehicles at low camera angles using stable features								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				9	1			148	160		10.1109/TITS.2007.911357			MAR 2008	2008	We present a method for segmenting and tracking vehicles on highways using a camera that is relatively low to the ground. At such low angles, 3-D perspective effects cause significant changes in appearance over time, as well as severe occlusions by vehicles in neighboring lanes. Traditional approaches to occlusion reasoning assume that the vehicles initially appear well separated in the image; however, in our sequences, it is not uncommon for vehicles to enter the scene partially occluded and remain so throughout. By utilizing a 3-D perspective mapping from the scene to the image, along with a plumb line projection, we are able to distinguish a subset of features whose 3-D coordinates can be accurately estimated. These features are then grouped to yield the number and locations of the vehicles, and standard feature tracking is used to maintain the locations of the vehicles over time. Additional features are then assigned to these groups and used to classify vehicles as cars or trucks. Our technique uses a single grayscale camera beside the road, incrementally processes image frames, works in real time, and produces vehicle counts with over 90% accuracy on challenging sequences.									50	5	0	0	0	55			1524-9050			WOS:000253790100014

The review employs the following criteria; reliability under different experimental settings (pulse and acquisition durations), and bulks anisotropy levels, in addition to each code depth inversion accuracy under different host material conditions. The Signal to Noise ratio SNR and the contrast signal decay are used to quantitatively assess each code performance. The review implements the flash thermography experiments in an analytical domain to manipulate the test scenarios in greater details using finite differencing calculations in explicit mode, for two bulks; steel alloy and an epoxy-graphite composite. The PPT is found to be least sensitive to anisotropy variations, while the signal time-delay in TSR is shown to be dependant on defectives aspect ratio and on not its depth. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Development of a low-dose anti-resorptive drug regimen reveals synergistic suppression of bone formation when coupled with disuse								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY				104	3			729	738		10.1152/japplphysiol.00632.2007			MAR 2008	2008	Safe and effective countermeasures to spaceflight-induced osteoporosis are required to mitigate the potential for mission-critical fractures and ensure long-term bone health in astronauts. Two anti-resorptive drugs, the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZOL) and the anti-receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand protein osteoprotegerin (OPG), were investigated to find the minimum, comparable doses that yield a maximal increase in bone quality, while minimizing deleterious effects on turnover and mineralization. Through a series of five trials in normally loaded female mice (n = 56/trial), analysis of trabecular volume fraction and connectivity using microcomputed tomography, along with biomechanical testing, quantitative histomorphometry, and compositional analysis, was used to select 45 mu g/kg ZOL and 500 mu g/kg OPG as doses that satisfy these criteria. These doses were then examined for their ability to mitigate bone loss following short-term unloading through hindlimb suspension (HLS). Seventy-two mice were prophylactically administered ZOL, OPG, or PBS and assigned to loaded control or 2-wk HLS groups (n = 12 for each of 6 groups). Both anti-resorptives were able to preserve trabecular microarchitecture and femoral elastic and maximum force in HLS mice (+ 30-40% ZOL/OPG vs. PBS). In HLS mice, anti-resorptive dosing reduced resorption perimeter at the femoral endocortical surface by 30% vs. PBS. In loaded control mice, anti-resorptives produced no change in bone formation rate; however, reductions in bone formation rate brought about by HLS were exacerbated by anti-resorptive treatment, suggesting synergistic inhibition of osteoblasts during disuse. Refined anti-resorptive dosing will tend to target countermeasures to the period of disuse, resulting in faster recovery and less adverse effects for astronauts.									13	1	0	11	0	14			8750-7587			WOS:000253822900022	18174391

Past research suggests, however, that the African American community is less concerned about issues of being overweight, and therefore child obesity was expected to have less impact upon the parenting practices of African American mothers and fathers. Therefore, we did not expect to find a relationship between quality of parenting and child's obesity for African American parents. These hypotheses were tested using two samples: the first was comprised of approximately 847 European American families, and second consisted of 867African American families. The findings supported the hypotheses. Our analyses showed the predicted negative association between child's weight and the parenting of European American mothers and fathers whereas there was no such relationship for African Americans parents. These results were largely consistent across four dimensions of parenting (warmth, monitoring, inductive reasoning, and problem solving), and held for both daughters and sons.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0047-2328			WOS:000256502900005		
J	Liu, Aining; Stuart, Steven J.				Stuart, Steven/H-1111-2012				Empirical bond-order potential for hydrocarbons: Adaptive treatment of van der Waals interactions								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY				29	4			601	611		10.1002/jcc.20817			MAR 2008	2008	Bond-order potentials provide a powerful class of models for simulating chemically reactive systems with classical potentials. In these models, the covalent bonding interactions adapt to the environment, allowing bond strength to change in response to local chemical changes. However, the non-bonded interactions should also adapt in response to chemical changes, an effect which is neglected in current bond-order potentials. Here the AIREBO potential is extended to include adaptive Lennard-Jones terms, allowing the van der Waals interactions to vary adaptively with the chemical environment. The resulting potential energy surface and its gradient remain continuous, allowing it to be used for dynamics simulations. This new potential is parameterized for hydrocarbons, and is fit to the energetics and densities of a variety of condensed phase molecular hydrocarbons. The resulting model is more accurate for modeling aromatic and other unsaturated hydrocarbon species, for which the original AIREBO potential had some deficiencies. Testing on compounds not used in the fitting procedure shows that the new model performs substantially better in predicting heats of vaporization and pressures (or densities) of condensed-phase molecular hydrocarbons.

J	Simoson, Christopher; Wagner, John								Effects of cooled EGR on a small displacement diesel engine: A reduced-order dynamic model and experimental study								JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				130	1					011102	10.1115/1.2824286			MAR 2008	2008	Diesel engines are critical in fulfilling transportation and mechanical/electrical power generation needs throughout the world. The engines combustion by-products spawn health and environmental concerns, so there is a responsibility to develop emission reduction strategies. However, difficulties arise since the minimization of one pollutant often bears undesirable side effects. Although legislated standards have promoted successful emission reduction strategies for larger engines, developments in smaller displacement engines has not progressed in a similar fashion. In this paper, a reduced-order dynamic model is presented and experimentally validated to demonstrate the use of cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to alleviate the tradeoff between oxides of nitrogen reduction and performance preservation in a small displacement diesel engine. EGR is an effective method for internal combustion engine oxides of nitrogen (NO(x)) reduction, but its thermal throttling diminishes power efficiency. The capacity to cool exhaust gases prior to merging with intake air may achieve the desired pollutant effect while minimizing engine performance losses. Representative numerical results were validated with experimental data for a variety of speed, load, and EGR testing scenarios using a 0.697 1 three-cylinder diesel engine equipped with cooled EGR. Simulation and experimental results showed a 16% drop in NO(x) emissions using EGR, but experienced a 7% loss in engine torque. However the use of cooled EGR realized a 23% NO(x) reduction while maintaining a smaller performance compromise. The concurrence between simulated and experimental trends establishes the simplified model as a predictive tool for diesel engine performance and emission studies. Further the presented model may be considered in future control algorithms to optimize engine performance and thermal and emission characteristics.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0195-0738			WOS:000253823200002

Antecedents and performance outcomes of global competence: An empirical investigation								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT				25	1-2			75	92		10.1016/j.jengtecman.2008.01-003			MAR-JUN 2008	2008	We examine the role of commitment to supply chain management (CSCM) and information technology (IT) in the achievement of global competence (GC). Through an empirical examination of 667 manufacturing business units in the U.S., we confirm the importance of global competence using two objective measures of firm performance. We investigate the direct effects of CSCM and experience with IT on performance, in addition to their indirect effects through global competence. We show global competence to be linked directly to objective measures of sales, and indirectly to return on assets (ROA). Despite manufacturers' hefty investments in IT, we find that experience with IT does not drive ROA directly, but only indirectly through global competence and sales. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Woods, H. Arthur; Moran, Amy L.				Moran, Amy/F-7072-2011				Oxygen profiles in egg masses predicted from a diffusion-reaction model								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				211	5			790	797		10.1242/jeb.014613			MAR 1 2008	2008	We developed a novel diffusion-reaction model to describe spatial and temporal changes in oxygen concentrations in gelatinous egg masses containing live, respiring embryos. We used the model in two ways. First, we constructed artificial egg masses of known metabolic density using embryos of the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechnius neumayeri, measured radial oxygen profiles at two temperatures, and compared our measurements to simulated radial oxygen profiles generated by the model. We parameterized the model by measuring the radius of the artificial masses, metabolic densities (=embryo metabolic rate x embryo density) and oxygen diffusion coefficients at both ambient (-1.5 degrees C) or slightly warmer (+1.5-2 degrees C) temperatures. Simulated and measured radial oxygen profiles were similar, indicating that the model captured the major biological features determining oxygen distributions. Second, we used the model to analyze sources of error in step-change experiments for determining oxygen diffusion coefficients (D), and to determine the suitability of simpler, analytical equations for estimating D. Our analysis indicated that embryo metabolism can lead to large (several-fold) overestimates of D if the analytical equation is fitted to step-down-traces of central oxygen concentration (i.e. external oxygen concentration stepped from some high value to zero). However, good estimates of D were obtained from step-up-traces. We used these findings to estimate D in egg masses of three species of nudibranch molluscs: two Antarctic species (Tritonia challengeriana and Tritoniella belli; -1.5 and +2 degrees C) and one temperate Pacific species (Tritonia diomedea; 12 and 22 degrees C). D for all three species was approximately 8 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1), and there was no detectable effect of temperature on estimated D. For the Antarctic species, D in egg masses was 70-90% of its value in seawater of similar temperature.									10	0	0	10	0	11			0022-0949			WOS:000253196600026	18281342	
J	Woods, H. Arthur; Moran, Amy L.				Moran, Amy/F-7072-2011				Temperature-oxygen interactions in Antarctic nudibranch egg masses								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				211	5			798	804		10.1242/jeb.014621			MAR 1 2008	2008	The Southern Ocean is one of the coldest, most stable marine environments on Earth and represents a unique environment for investigating metabolic consequences of low temperature. Here we test predictions of a new diffusion-reaction model of O-2 distributions in egg masses, using egg masses of the Antarctic nudibranch mollusk, Tritonia challengeriana. When warmed from -1.5 degrees to + 1.5 degrees C, embryos of T. challengeriana showed large increases in O-2 consumption (Q(10) values of 9.6-30.0). Oxygen electrode measurements in intact masses showed, however, that O2 levels were high throughout and virtually unaffected by temperature. The model suggested that both effects stemmed from very low metabolic densities in egg masses. Detailed morphological measurements of egg masses of T. challengeriana and a temperate congener, T. diomedea, revealed large differences in structure that may be related to O-2 availability. Egg masses of T. challengeriana were approximately twice as thick. However, the most dramatic effects were observed in embryos: embryos of T. challengeriana were >32 times larger (by volume) than embryos of T. diomedea. Antarctic embryos also were contained singly in large egg capsules (similar to 500 mu m diameter). Consequently, Antarctic embryos occurred at much lower densities, with very low metabolic densities.									8	0	0	8	1	9			0022-0949			WOS:000253196600027	18281343

Impact of new rainfall patterns on detention pond design								JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING-ASCE				134	2			197	201		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(2008)134:2(197)			MAR-APR 2008	2008	A new set of dimensionless rainfall hyetographs has been developed for the state of South Carolina. The new hyetographs show trends similar to those developed recently in other states and in general have milder intensities and lower peak rainfall than the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) rainfall hyetographs. This paper evaluates the impact the new hyetographs have on rainfall runoff and detention pond design and compares the results with those using the SCS hyetographs. Peak discharges for basin runoff were reduced up to approximately 20% of the predicted peak runoff rate using the current SCS hyetographs. Detention pond peak stage was also reduced by 25-50% of the predicted SCS stage. This analysis suggests that design hyetographs should be regularly updated to incorporate recent rainfall data.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0733-9437			WOS:000254677000010		
J	Jermanowski, Michal; Nabar, Malhar								The welfare consequences of irrational exuberance: Stock market booms, research investment, and productivity								JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS				30	1			111	133		10.1016/j.jmacro.2007.01.006			MAR 2008	2008	This paper studies the effects of stock market valuation on research investment, the rate of innovation, and welfare. In the presence of financing constraints for R&D investment, episodes of high market valuation can ease these constraints and raise the economy-wide investment in R&D and the rate of innovation. If the decentralized equilibrium rate of innovation is inefficiently low, then such episodes may lead to an increase in aggregate welfare even if the higher valuation is not entirely justified by fundamentals. We present a Schumpeterian-style growth model with a costly financial intermediation process to characterize the relationship between market value, entry of new firms, and the aggregate rate of innovation. We use the model to measure the welfare consequences of a stock market run-up that may only partly be justified by fundamentals. In particular, we apply the model to the US economy in the 1990s and calibrate the impact of the NASDAQ boom on the rate of innovation, growth and welfare, The welfare effect depends on the underlying change in fundamentals. We find that with an acceleration in US trend productivity growth from a pre-1995 rate of 1.4% to a rate of 2.0% per annum, the NASDAQ boom will have resulted in a net welfare gain of 0.55%. If the new growth rate is as high as 3%, the net gain was 1.35% of the present discounted value of consumption. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

J	Hu, Yuna; Blouin, Vincent Y.; Fadel, Georges M.								Design for manufacturing of 3D heterogeneous objects with processing time consideration								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				130	3					031701	10.1115/1.2829894			MAR 2008	2008	Rapid prototyping (RP) technology, such as laser engineering net shaping, can be used to fabricate heterogeneous objects with various levels of gradient variations in material composition. These objects are engineered to achieve a potentially enhanced functional performance. Past research on the design of such objects has focused on representatipn, modeling, and desired functional performance. However, the inherent constraints in RP processes, such as system capability and processing dwell time, lead to heterogeneous objects that may not meet the designer's original intent. To overcome this situation, the research presented in this paper focuses on the identification and implementation of manufacturing concerns into the design process. Previous work on a 2D disk brake rotor design has shown that processing dwell time is one of the critical factors that affect manufacturability. This paper focuses on incorporating the processing time into the optimization design for manufacturing of 3D heterogeneous objects. A node-based finite element modeling technique is used for the representation and analysis. The multicriteria design problem corresponds to finding the nodal material compositions with minimized structural weight, maximized structural stiffness, and minimized extra processing time used to deposit the multimaterial subjected to stress constraints. The optimizer used in this research is a self-adaptive, real-valued evolutionary strategy, which is well suited for this type of multimodal problem. A 3D I-beam made of two materials, aluminum for lightweight and steel for better strength characteristics, is used to illustrate the trade-off between manufacturability and functionality.									8	2	0	0	0	9			1050-0472			WOS:000254144900009

Molding was performed using three different types of amorphous polymers: cyclo-olefin copolymer (COC), polystyrene (PS) and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) on a silicon mold containing surface features as small as 700 nm in depth and aspect ratios ranging from 5 to 0.02. In this study, processing temperatures were selected in order to match the viscosity for all polymers used. Polymer viscosity was characterized via cone and plate rheometry and wettability was characterized via contact angle analysis to quantify interfacial effects. Feature replication was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to compare the molded feature depth ratio. It was observed that for the features with an aspect ratio (depth/width) bigger than 2 the depth ratio of the molded parts decreases. PS shows the best replication because of high wettability behavior. PMMA shows the intermediate replication because of dipole-dipole interaction and its lower diffusion coefficient than PS. COC has the worse replication especially in low aspect ratio because of sticking to the silicon oxide layer. PS has the best surface roughness among all polymers.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0960-1317			WOS:000254151600036

Narrow plasmon mode in 2D arrays of silver nanoparticles self-assembled on thin silver films								JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY-OXFORD				229	3			567	574		10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.01945.x			MAR 2008	2008	Extinction spectra of 2D arrays of silver nanoparticles self-assembled on 5-20-nm-thick vacuum-deposited silver films exhibit extremely narrow plasmon mode in the blue spectral region, whereas the same particles self-assembled on thin films of Au, Cu, Cr and Ti damp the plasmon resonance. The observed narrowing was attributed to the plasmon coupling between the nanoparticles and between the nanoparticles and surface modes in the underlying silver film.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0022-2720			WOS:000253826800030	18331512

A literature review related to this important issue was performed. Credible arguments supporting parental presence during invasive procedures as well as opposing arguments were discussed. One must consider both views in order to create a nonbiased analysis of the issue. Parental presence during invasive procedures raises critical debates related to maintaining or altering the continuum of holistic patient care. Additional research would provide an objective approach to the problem. Development of an evidence-based protocol would provide a framework for this issue.									10	1	0	0	0	11			0891-5245			WOS:000259056400009	18294581

Multidimensional numerical simulation of ammonium-perchlorate-based propellant combustion with fine/ultrafine aluminum								JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER				24	2			161	174		10.2514/1.26728			MAR-APR 2008	2008	This paper presents a computational investigation on the deflagration of composite ammonium-perchlorate-based propellant with fine/ultrafine aluminum. The model relies on an Eulerian representation of the particle cloud formed by the ejected aluminum and a gray-medium approximation of the radiative field supported by the emitting particles. The aluminum oxidation is modeled by means of an experimentally evaluated diameter power law valid for constant-ambient conditions. The energetic consequences of the addition of nanoscale aluminum are analyzed, with particular emphasis on the contributions of radiative transport and aluminum oxidation heat release. The model is validated versus experimental measurements of burn rates for both one-dimensionally (fine ammonium perchlorate) and three-dimensionally (monomodal and bimodal coarse ammonium perchlorate) supported combustion fields. The burn rate and surface shape or two-dimensional laminate propellant is also considered, and the particle consumption time is related to experimental observations.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0748-4658			WOS:000254016900001

JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION				63	2			77	90		10.2489/63.2.77			MAR-APR 2008	2008	The effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs) at preventing erosion and controlling storm water and sediment runoff in developing catchments in the Reedy River (South Carolina) watershed was evaluated from 2004 to 2005. Catchment-normalized storm water runoff and event mean concentrations and cumulative mass loads of selected pollutants were compared among four catchments exhibiting similar rainfall, soil, and geographic characteristics but undergoing varying degrees of development. Despite the implementation of BMPs, streams below catchments undergoing active development exhibited patterns characteristic of urbanized watersheds, namely, storm hydrographs characterized by steep rising and descending limbs due to accelerated storm water runoff. In contrast with the developing catchments, streams below relatively undisturbed catchments exhibited more gradual rising and descending limbs on their hydrographs, presumably due to enhanced infiltration and interflow and less direct surface runoff. A comparison of surface runoff depths and runoff ratios confirmed more direct surface runoff was generated from rainfall in the developing catchments versus the undisturbed catchments despite the use of BMPs. In addition, area-normalized maximum stream discharges during storm events were generally higher for the developing versus undisturbed catchments. Similarly, mean concentrations and mass loads of total suspended solids were consistently higher for the developing versus undisturbed catchments. In many cases, mean concentrations for total suspended solids and other selected pollutants in storm water runoff from the developing catchments exceeded recognized water quality criteria. Taken together, the quantity and quality of storm water runoff from the developing catchments indicate that the overall protective goals of erosion prevention and sediment control regulations are not being met. Possible explanations for this include BMPs that have not been properly designed or located, are not the correct type, are insufficiently numerous, and/or have not been adequately maintained to control the increased surface runoff and/or soil erosion due to land disturbance. Alternatively, the failure may reflect shortcomings in the regulations themselves.									9	0	0	7	0	9			0022-4561			WOS:000253435600021

Each is based upon a specific specimen size and static loading regime. However, few studies have examined the relationship, if any, of failure loads among these methods. This study was conducted to determine the effects of varying specimen sizes on the static wind uplift performance or failure loads of mechanically-attached single-ply roofing membranes. Full-scale wind uplift pressure tests were performed in three phases, using six specimen sizes, and three membrane materials. The results were used to determine the minimum acceptable specimen sizes to be used for testing. In Phase 1, fastener failure loads were monitored, while in Phases 2 and 3, the failure experiments were repeated without measuring fastener loads. A significant difference in the apparent failure loads occurs among different specimen sizes for the same membrane materials. The results suggest that correction factors are necessary for comparing tests on different test beds and that the performance of membranes in the test chamber may not produce the same results on full scale structures.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0733-9445			WOS:000253466200016

Different initial temperature and pressure conditions were chosen, ranging from 25 to 65 degrees C and 500 to 3000 psi covering initial liquid, supercritical and gas phases. Under certain initial conditions with low temperature and high pressure, the depressurization process caused a phase change that increased the release time where the depressurization-time curves did not exponentially decrease. This explosion process was characterized based on total release time, rate of depressurization, and effect of phase change on the rate of depressurization. The temperature change associated with the change of pressure was also discussed. Canola flakes were exploded using chosen initial conditions. Oil extraction from canola flakes using supercritical carbon dioxide was improved after explosion treatment. Explosion at 35 degrees C and 3000 psi of initial condition resulted in the highest oil yield. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									9	0	0	5	0	9			0896-8446			WOS:000254430100009		
J	Khasawneh, Mohammad T.; Bowling, Shannon R.; Cho, Byung Rae								A Markovian approach to determining process means with dual quality characteristics								JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING				17	1			66	85		10.1007/s11518-008-5064-z			MAR 2008	2008	This paper studies a production system where products are produced continuously and whose specification limits are specified for screening inspection. In this paper, we consider dual quality characteristics and different costs associated with each quality characteristic that falls below a lower specification limit or above an upper specification limit. Due to these different costs, the expected total profit will greatly depend on the process parameters, especially a process mean. This paper develops a Markovian-based model for determining the optimum process means with the consideration of dual quality characteristics in a single-stage system. The proposed model is then illustrated through a numerical example and sensitivity analysis is performed to validate the model. The results showed that the optimum process mean for both quality characteristics have a significant effect on the performance of the system. Since the literature survey shows that dealing with multi-quality characteristics is extremely limited, the proposed model, coupled with the Markovian approach, provides a unique contribution to this field.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1004-3756			WOS:000258569900005

J	Kothapalli, Chandrasekhar R.; Ramamurthi, Anand								Benefits of concurrent delivery of hyaluronan and IGF-1 cues to regeneration of crosslinked elastin matrices by adult rat vascular cells								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				2	2-3			106	116		10.1002/term.70			MAR-APR 2008	2008	Elastin, a major component of vascular matrices, critically determines vascular mechanics and maintains the quiescence of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Attempts to regenerate elastin in elastin-compromised blood vessels using tissue-engineering approaches is limited by the unavailability of elastogenic cues to upregulate poor elastin output and matrix assembly by adult vascular cells. We previously showed that hyaluronan (HA) elastogenically stimulates aortic SMCs, although these effects are highly specific to HA fragment size. The elastogenic response of SMCs can also be modulated with growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). Here, we evaluate the benefits of concurrent delivery of HA fragments (0.76-2000 kDa) and IGF-1 (500 ng/ml) to elastin synthesis, organization and crosslinking. The study outcomes show that, relative to supplement-free cultures, IGF-1 and long-chain HA/large HA fragments, but not HA oligomers, together induce multifold increases in the synthesis of elastin precursors, structural elastin matrix yields and crosslink densities within cell layers, and encourage elastic fibre formation. These outcomes are not all obtained when either of the cues is provided separately. IGF-1 and large HA fragments (>20 kDa) also together inhibit cell proliferation, a concern in elastin-compromised vessels, where SMC hyperproliferation is common. The results will benefit efforts to provide exogenous or scaffold-based elastogenic cues (IGF-1 + HMW HA/large HA fragments) to enable robust and faithful regeneration of elastin matrix structures in vivo or in vitro. The present outcomes may be used to restore elastin matrix homeostasis in de-elasticized vessels and tissue-engineered constructs that may be grafted as a substitute.

J	Maxson, Scott; Burg, Karen J. L.								Conditioned media cause increases in select osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation markers in mesenchymal stem cell cultures								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				2	2-3			147	154		10.1002/term.76			MAR-APR 2008	2008	The optimal mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) culture conditions that would allow clinically viable tissue-engineered devices are still yet to be determined. Most MSCs are found in the bone marrow, an area that also contains numerous osteoblasts and adipocytes. Paracrine signalling may be leveraged to modulate MSC differentiation in the preparation of a tissue-engineered device. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the effects of adipocyte-conditioned medium (CM) on MSC differentiation to osteoblasts and to determine the effects of osteoblast CM on MSC differentiation to adipocytes. Two groups of murine MSCs were given either an osteogenic differentiation medium or an adipogenic differentiation medium. CM was taken from one group and administered to the opposite group in concentrations of 25% or 50%. Metabolic activity, total protein and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assays were conducted on the osteogenic group at predefined time points throughout the 21 day study, while metabolic activity, triglyceride and oil red 0 assays were conducted on the adipogenic group at predefined time points. Adipocyte CM administered at a concentration of 50% increased the ALP production of MSCs undergoing osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, osteoblast CM increased the triglyceride production of MSCs undergoing adipogenic differentiation and enlarged the lipid vesicles that were produced by the cells. The effects of the osteoblast CM were seen at both concentrations, but were greatest at the 50% CM level.

Application of a histogram modification algorithm to the processing of raindrop images								OPTICAL ENGINEERING				47	3					037011	10.1117/1.2899101			MAR 2008	2008	Automatic processing of digital images of falling raindrops is complicated by a less than ideal grayscale image histogram. These histograms do not display a bimodal shape and lack an easily defined minimum, making it difficult to choose a threshold for creating a binary image. To help identify peaks in these histograms, and simplify threshold selection, a histogram modification technique originally developed by Peleg is used. This method was modified slightly and then applied to raindrop image processing. Its performance is quantified.

We compared the effects of convective flow on large-tip cryo and radiofrequency (RF) lesions dimensions.Methods: Cryoablation and RF ablation were performed on porcine heart sections in a saline bath with varying directed flow rates. Cryoablation was performed for 4 minutes on 50 tissue pieces with tip temperature controlled at -80 degrees C. RF ablation was performed on 50 tissue pieces for 60 seconds at 60 degrees C tip temperature. The pieces were placed in culture media for 24 hours, and then sectioned, stained, and measured.Results: Cryoablation and RF lesion sizes varied significantly with flow such that higher flow rates produced smaller cryoablation lesions and larger RF lesions (mean cryoablation volumes: 854 +/- 402, 808 +/- 217, 781 +/- 217, 359 +/- 114, and 292 +/- 117 mm(3), and mean RF volumes: 211 +/- 35, 304 +/- 79, 439 +/- 125, 525 +/- 187, and 597 +/- 126 mm(3) for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5L/min flow rates, respectively, P < 0.0005). Trabeculated pieces had larger cryoablation lesions and smaller RF lesions than nontrabeculated ones at higher flow rate (P < 0.005). Cryoablation lesion volume increased as the time to reach -80 degrees C decreased (r(2) = 0.72).Conclusion: In contrast to RF ablation, cryoablation lesion size is smaller at high flow rates, and larger at low flow rates due to the warming effects of local convective flow. The effects of high flow are reduced in areas of trabeculation, and the time to reach -80 degrees C predicts cryoablation lesion size.									6	0	0	2	0	6			0147-8389			WOS:000253634600006	18307624

J	Amiri, A.; Scherm, H.; Brannen, P. M.; Schnabel, G.								Laboratory evaluation of three rapid, agar-based assays to assess fungicide sensitivity in Monilinia fructicola								PLANT DISEASE				92	3			415	420		10.1094/PDIS-92-3-0415			MAR 2008	2008	Three rapid, agar-based assays were compared with a traditional petri dish method for assessing the sensitivity of Monilinia fructicola to propiconazole (0.3 and 2.0 mu g/ml), thiophanate-methyl (1.0 and 50 mu g/ml), and azoxystrobin (1.0 and 35 mu g/ml) in the lab oratory. The three assays were based on mycelial growth inhibition on agar disks sliced from lipbalm tubes filled with fungicide-amended potato dextrose agar (PDA), on PDA-coated cotton swabs, or in PDA-filled microcentrifuge tubes. Mycelial growth inhibition of eight previously characterized isolates (two resistant to propiconazole, two highly resistant to thiophanate-methyl, two with low levels of resistance to thiophanate-methyl, and two sensitive to all three fungicides) was determined visually 24, 48, and 72 h after inoculation. The 48-h time point was it e earliest suitable time to collect data for all methods because insufficient growth was recorded in the petri dish and tube assays after 24 h. With the exception of the swab assay, all methods classified the isolates previously determined to be fungicide sensitive correctly (i.e., no fungal growth was observed for these isolates). For propiconazole-resistant isolates, the lipbalm assay resulted in levels of growth inhibition very similar to the petri dish method, whereas the swab assay and the tube assay overestimated and underestimated, respectively, the level of resistance. Both the lipbalm and the swab assays classified isolates correctly as being thiophanate-methyl resistant, and both were able to discriminate the isolates previously classified as having low versus high levels of resistance when treated with this fungicide at 50 mu g/ml, as was the petri dish method. None of the eight isolates which previously were determined to be azoxystrobin sensitive grew on azoxystrobin-amended media, regardless of the assay type. Overall, the average percentage of correct isolate classifications (relative to their previously determined res stance status) on propiconazole- and thiophanate-methyl-amended media after 48 h ranged from 87.5 to 100, 85.3 to 100, 63.2 to 94.5, and 50.5 to 81.0% for the petri dish, lipbalm, swab, and tube assays, respectively. The lipbalm assay provided the most accurate assessments (85.3 to 100%) after only 24 h of incubation, supporting its use as a rapid and simple tool to monitor resistance levels in M. fructicola field populations.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0191-2917			WOS:000253267200013

The fluoroalkylated PFCB polymers (20 % functionalized) showed increases in both hydrophobicity and oleophobicity. Static contact angle for hexadecane was increased after fluoroalkylation from 0 degrees to greater than 30 degrees for the two PFCB polymers tested. Increased oil repellency makes these materials potential candidates for various coatings applications.									3	1	0	0	0	4			0170-0839			WOS:000253976600020

Effects of 6/85-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum inoculation alone at ten weeks of age or in conjunction with F-Strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum inoculation overlays at twenty-two or forty-five weeks of age on the performance of commercial egg-laying hens								POULTRY SCIENCE				87	3			588	593		10.3382/ps.2007-00424			MAR 2008	2008	The effects of 6/85-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (6/85MG) inoculation alone or in conjunction with a F-strain M. gallisepticum (FMG) overlay and its timing on the performance of commercial egg-laying hens were investigated. Control birds received sham inoculations at 10 wk of age. A second treated group of birds was inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk of age, a third treatment group of birds was inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk and received an overlay of FMG at 22 wk, and a fourth treatment group was inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk followed by a 45-wk overlay inoculation of FMG. Parameters investigated between 20 and 55 wk of age included BW, mortality, weekly and total egg production, egg weight, relative eggshell conductance, eggshell weight per unit of surface area, percentage shell weight, yolk/albumen ratio, and egg shape index. Hen age effects were reported for BW, egg weight, yolk/albumen ratio, and egg production. No treatment effects or hen age x treatment interactions were noted for those parameters except for yolk/albumen ratio, and no significant effects of any kind were noted for the remaining parameters examined. At wk 47, a significant treatment effect for yolk/albumen ratio was noted. The yolk/albumen ratio in the group of birds that received 6/85MG at 10 wk followed by an overlay of FMG at 22 wk was significantly lower than the sham control birds and those that were inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk followed by a 45-wk overlay inoculation of FMG. Prelay 6/85MG inoculations may be a suitable substitute for prelay FMG inoculations, and FMG overlays during lay on prelay 6/85MG inoculations may provide continual protection without eliciting any subsequent suppressive effects on performance.									10	0	0	9	0	10			0032-5791			WOS:000253855400026	18281589

Effects of supplemental dietary phytase and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on the performance characteristics of commercial layers inoculated before or at the onset of lay with the F-strain of Mycoplasma gallisepticum								POULTRY SCIENCE				87	3			598	601		10.3382/ps.2007-00367			MAR 2008	2008	The effects of dietary supplementation with phytase and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on the performance characteristics of commercial layers that were inoculated prelay ( 12 wk of age) or at the onset of lay ( 22 wk of age) with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum were assessed. Experimental layer diets, which included a basal control diet or the same diet supplemented with 0.025% phytase and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, were fed from 20 through 58 wk of age. Weekly and total egg production were determined from 22 through 58 wk, and egg weight and various internal egg and eggshell quality characteristics were examined at 34, 50, and 58 wk of age. F-strain M. gallisepticum inoculation decreased egg production at the beginning of lay ( wk 22 and 23) but increased post-peak lay at wk 45. However, there were no treatment effects of any kind on total egg production, egg weight, or any of the internal egg and eggshell characteristics examined during lay. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with phytase and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol did not affect layer performance or interact with the effects of F-strain M. gallisepticum inoculation; however, F-strain M. gallisepticum inoculation resulted in a shift in egg production from wk 22 to 45 without having an overall effect on total egg production.									8	0	0	6	0	8			0032-5791			WOS:000253855400028	18281591

This includes macrocycles with remarkable electronic, optical, and supramolecular properties, as well as intriguing frameworks. Expanded radialenes are a class of conjugated shape-persistent macrocycles that arise from the formal insertion of acetylene units into a radialene framework. A related class of macrocycles, the expanded radiaannulenes, contains both endo- and exocyclic vinylene and vinylidene segments, respectively, and accordingly exhibits properties intermediate between radialenes and annulenes. Enyne building blocks have been developed that are suitable for forming a macrocyclic framework through a step-wise sequence of Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. This "building-block" approach allows us to explore a range of molecular architectures that will ultimately provide for an understanding of pi-delocalization in these compounds. The synthesis and structural characterization of the first members of this new class of expanded radialenes and radiaannulenes are described.					12th International Symposium on Novel Aromatic Compounds (ISNA-12)12th International Symposium on Novel Aromatic Compounds (ISNA-12)	JUL 22-27, 2007JUL 22-27, 2007	IUPACIUPAC	Awaji Island, JAPANAwaji Island, JAPAN	17	0	0	3	0	17			0033-4545			WOS:000253883400018

Relying on the Religious Education curriculum currently in use in the United Kingdom, the authors sketch a religious literacy curriculum designed to help students thrive in a pluralistic and democratic society. In order to help young citizens develop the skills, dispositions, and knowledge to thrive in an increasingly global, pluralistic, and democratic society, they need to become religiously literate. For students to be religiously literate they must learn to respect the religious other as well as understand the role of religious in contributing to civic life.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0034-4087	1547-3201		WOS:000255364100009

Design analysis of polymer filtration using a multi-objective genetic algorithm								SEPARATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				43	4			710	726		10.1080/01496390701870713			MAR 2008	2008	Filtration of particle debris is an important component of the polymer fiber melt-spinning process. The filter lifespan is determined by the pressure drop across the filter, which increases as debris accumulates inside the filtration medium. The cost of filter replacement is high, as is the cost of a loss of the finished fiber product due to debris inclusion in the spun fiber. We use a multiobjective genetic algorithm to examine the trade-off curve that evolves from these competing goals. A "blackbox" simulator models the debris deposition, and we choose filter porosity and pore diameter as the design variables. We provide numerical results and analysis for two sets of competing objectives.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0149-6395	1520-5754		WOS:000254394700002

As changes in N cycling resulting from these treatments could have potential negative impacts on forest health that might limit their usefulness as management alternatives, we monitored treatment effects on extractable total inorganic N (TIN), net N mineralization, net nitrification, and proportional nitrification during the growing season before treatment, the first growing season after treatment, and the third or fourth growing season after treatment. Mechanical treatment resulted in increases in extractable TIN, N mineralization, and nitrification during the first post-treatment year in Ohio and TIN was greater in the mechanical treatment and the mechanical + fire treatment during the third post-treatment year in North Carolina. Net N mineralization was reduced by fire alone in Ohio, but not in North Carolina. Nitrogen transformation rates were 2- to 10-fold higher in Ohio than North Carolina, a difference that may partly result from of the ericaceous shrub understory present in North Carolina but not in Ohio. Impacts of these treatments on N transformations were modest and for the most part transient, and would therefore not eliminate these treatments as viable management strategies for wildfire hazard reduction or ecosystem restoration.									6	0	0	6	0	7			0361-5995			WOS:000254060200031

The genome is 161,453 bp in length and includes a pair of inverted repeats (IR) of 26,954 bp. The genome includes 128 genes; 96 are single copy and 16 are duplicated in the IR. There are four rRNA genes and 30 distinct tRNAs, seven of which are duplicated in the IR. The infA gene is absent; expansion of IRb has duplicated 62 amino acids at the 3' end of rps19 and a number of coding regions have large insertions or deletions, including insertions within the 23S rRNA gene. There are 17 intron-containing genes in cassava, 15 of which have a single intron while two (clpP, ycf3) have two introns. The usually conserved atpF group II intron is absent and this is the first report of its loss from land plant chloroplast genomes. The phylogenetic distribution of the atpF intron loss was determined by a PCR survey of 251 taxa representing 34 families of Malpighiales and 16 taxa from closely related rosids. The atpF intron is not only missing in cassava but also from closely related Euphorbiaceae and other Malpighiales, suggesting that there have been at least seven independent losses. In cassava and all other sequenced Malphigiales, atpF gene sequences showed a strong association between C-to-T substitutions at nucleotide position 92 and the loss of the intron, suggesting that recombination between an edited mRNA and the atpF gene may be a possible mechanism for the intron loss.									26	0	0	23	0	73			0040-5752			WOS:000253632700012	18214421

J	Goddard, Wayne								Automated bounds on recursive structures								UTILITAS MATHEMATICA				75				193	210					MAR 2008	2008	Tables are the basis for many dynamic programming algorithms on recursive structures such as trees and grids. These tables record the rules for combining structures. We show how such a table can be used to determine the maximum or minimum value of the associated parameter (the extremal function), and implement software that automatically determines the extremal function from the table, and outputs a proof thereof. We also produce software that automatically generates a candidate table from a black-box oracle for the parameter. We use the software to solve some old and new problems; for example, we obtain the values of domination parameters for some small grids.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0315-3681			WOS:000254111900014

The risk of experiencing this distress, however, is not equally distributed across members of all racial groups. African American girls are generally more satisfied with their bodies and thus may be less vulnerable to experiencing depression as a result of weight concerns. Several scholars have suggested that membership in African American culture provides social resources that protect Black females from experiencing high levels of weight-based psychological distress. The authors examine the relationship between body size and depression and the potentially moderating role of African American culture using data from the Family and Community Health Study. Assessing a cohort of 343 African American girls ages 12 to 14, the authors found support for a link between weight and depression. There was no evidence that exposure to African American culture moderated this relationship.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0044-118X			WOS:000253254900002	19834569

An integrated genetic and physical map of homoeologous chromosomes 12 and 26 in Upland cotton (G. hirsutum L.)								BMC GENOMICS				9						108	10.1186/1471-2164-9-108			FEB 28 2008	2008	Background: Upland cotton (G. hirsutum L.) is the leading fiber crop worldwide. Genetic improvement of fiber quality and yield is facilitated by a variety of genomics tools. An integrated genetic and physical map is needed to better characterize quantitative trait loci and to allow for the positional cloning of valuable genes. However, developing integrated genomic tools for complex allotetraploid genomes, like that of cotton, is highly experimental. In this report, we describe an effective approach for developing an integrated physical framework that allows for the distinguishing between subgenomes in cotton.Results: A physical map has been developed with 220 and 115 BAC contigs for homeologous chromosomes 12 and 26, respectively, covering 73.49 Mb and 34.23 Mb in physical length. Approximately one half of the 220 contigs were anchored to the At subgenome only, while 48 of the 115 contigs were allocated to the Dt subgenome only. Between the two chromosomes, 67 contigs were shared with an estimated overall physical similarity between the two chromosomal homeologs at 40.0%. A total of 401 fiber unigenes plus 214 non-fiber unigenes were located to chromosome 12 while 207 fiber unigenes plus 183 non-fiber unigenes were allocated to chromosome 26. Anchoring was done through an overgo hybridization approach and all anchored ESTs were functionally annotated via blast analysis.Conclusion: This integrated genomic map describes the first pair of homoeologous chromosomes of an allotetraploid genome in which BAC contigs were identified and partially separated through the use of chromosome-specific probes and locus-specific genetic markers. The approach used in this study should prove useful in the construction of genome-wide physical maps for polyploid plant genomes including Upland cotton. The identification of Gene-rich islands in the integrated map provides a platform for positional cloning of important genes and the targeted sequencing of specific genomic regions.									25	3	0	25	0	28			1471-2164			WOS:000254286000003	18307816

Evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that when AlCl(3) is used as the Lewis acid, acylation proceeds via reaction of an organoaluminum intermediate with the acyl halide. This leads to the production of the 3-acyl derivative as the major product. With weaker Lewis acids (EtAlCl(2), Et(2)AlCl) or less than 1 equiv of AlCl(3) the relative amount of 2-acyl product is increased. A mechanistic rationalization is presented to explain these data.

J	Njoroge, Samuel M. C.; Reighard, Gregory L.								Thinning time during stage I and fruit spacing influences fruit size of 'Contender' peach								SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE				115	4			352	359		10.1016/j.scienta.2007.10.019			FEB 21 2008	2008	Early peach thinning during stage I was done at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days after full bloom (DAFB). At each thinning time, trees were hand-thinned to achieve different crop loads by spacing flowers or fruits 10, 15, or 25 cm along the shoot on whole tree canopies. In 2001 and 2002, fruit weight decreased quadratically with increasing time to hand-thin and increased linearly with increasing spacing. In both years, fruit diameter decreased linearly with increasing time to thin and increased linearly with increased fruit spacing. In both years, number of fruits harvested and yield per tree decreased linearly with increased spacing. Hand-thinning at 0 or 10 DAFB resulted in fewer fruit and lower yield; therefore, thinning at 20 DAFB was better. The effect of time of thinning on soluble solids was not consistent. In both years spacing (i.e., crop load) did not affect soluble solids. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									8	3	0	6	0	11			0304-4238			WOS:000254058300006		
J	Liang, Hailian; Falta, Ronald W.								Modeling field-scale cosolvent flooding for DNAPL source zone remediation								JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY				96	1-4			1	16		10.1016/j.jconhyd.2007.09.005			FEB 19 2008	2008	A three-dimensional, compositional, multiphase flow simulator was used to model a field-scale test of DNAPL removal by cosolvent flooding. The DNAPL at this site was tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and the flooding solution was an ethanol/water mixture, with up to 95% ethanol. The numerical model, UTCHEM accounts for the equilibrium phase behavior and multiphase flow of a ternary ethanol-PCE-water system. Simulations of enhanced cosolvent flooding using a kinetic interphase mass transfer approach show that when a very high concentration of alcohol is injected, the DNAPL/water/alcohol mixture forms a single phase and local mass transfer limitations become irrelevant. The field simulations were carried out in three steps. At the first level, a simple uncalibrated layered model is developed. This model is capable of roughly reproducing the production well concentrations of alcohol, but not of PCE. A more refined (but uncalibrated) permeability model is able to accurately simulate the breakthrough concentrations of injected alcohol from the production wells, but is unable to accurately predict the PCE removal. The final model uses a calibration of the initial PCE distribution to get good matches with the PCE effluent curves from the extraction wells. It is evident that the effectiveness of DNAPL source zone remediation is mainly affected by characteristics of the spatial heterogeneity of porous media and the variable (and unknown) DNAPL distribution. The inherent uncertainty in the DNAPL distribution at real field sites means that some form of calibration of the initial contaminant distribution will almost always be required to match contaminant effluent breakthrough curves.

Results show that a first-order, mass transfer rate coefficient is scale-dependent and decreasing with experiment duration. This is in agreement with previous studies and predictions. Factors contributing to the scale-dependency are errors or approximations in boundary conditions, hydraulic conductivity ( K) measurements and interpolations, mass transfer rate expressions and conceptual errors in model development. In order to formulate a self-consistent, dual-porosity model, it was necessary to assume that the injected tracer was trapped hydraulically in the vicinity of the injection site. This was accomplished by lowering all K values near the injection site by a factor of 30, while holding all other K values, boundary conditions and parameters at their measured or estimated magnitudes. Resulting simulations, using the same scale-dependent mass transfer rate coefficient, were then able to reasonably match the movement of the center of mass, overall plume geometry and the anomalous mass recovery ratios observed at each snapshot. The dual-porosity model is conceptually simple, relatively easy to apply mathematically and it simulates differences in advection that are probably the root cause of dispersion in natural heterogeneous sediments. Also, a small more realistic amount of local hydrodynamic dispersion is not precluded.									18	0	0	3	0	18			0043-1397			WOS:000253535700003		
J	Arai, Yuji								Spectroscopic evidence for Ni(II) surface speciation at the iron oxyhydroxides - Water interface								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				42	4			1151	1156		10.1021/es0719529			FEB 15 2008	2008	Understanding in situ metal surface speciation on mineral surfaces is critical to predicting the natural attenuation of metals in the subsurface environment. In this study, we have demonstrated the novel Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements needed to understand MOO surface speciation in three synthetic iron oxyhydroxides (ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite). The adsorption of Ni gradually increases with increasing pH from 5 to 8, and the adsorption edge appears at near the point of zero salt effect (PZSE) of the solids. The results of XAS analysis indicate four different Ni inner-sphere surface species are present. While total Ni surface species in hematite at pH 6.85 surfaces consist of similar to 63% face-sharing (interatomic distance of Ni-Fe (RNi-Fe) similar to 2.9 angstrom) and similar to 37% corner-sharing (RNi-Fe similar to 4.0 angstrom) surface species on iron octahedra, a combination of two different edge-sharing (between NiO6 and FeO6 octahedra, in chains or in rows) and corner-sharing surface species are observed in goethite and ferrihydrite at pH 5.09-6.89. In ferrihydrite, approximately 70% of surface species are edge-sharing surface species (in chains) (RNi-Fe similar to 3.0 angstrom), followed by similar to 30% of edge-sharing species (in rows) (RNi-Fe similar to 3.2 angstrom) and similar to 3-5% of corner-sharing surface species (RNi-Fe similar to 4.0 angstrom). Goethite contains similar to 54% edge-sharing (RNi-Fe similar to 3.0 angstrom), similar to 26% edge-sharing (RNi-Fe similar to 3.2 angstrom), and 20% corner-sharing surface species. These findings indicate that the reactivity and surface speciation of Ni are sensitive to the crystallinity of iron oxyhydroxides. The spectroscopic evidence for multi-Ni surface speciation should be factored into predictions of the transport of Ni in soil-water environments.									34	2	0	15	1	35			0013-936X			WOS:000253250800033	18351086

The orientation and crystallinity of PP-cp matrix in the blend did not change significantly with the addition of EMA. The low machine direction and transverse direction tear strengths, which are observed for neat polypropylene blown films more than doubled at 6 wt % or higher content of EMA. The increase in tear properties was mainly attributed to a fine dispersion of EMA in the matrix with an average particle size of 100-500 nm and the formation of elongated domains. The dispersed nonrounded EMA domains, resulting from the blown-film process, enhance better energy dissipation mechanism with the formation of an extended plastic zone in the blend films as compared with that in pure PP-cp films.

Surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization was used to grow the cation-exchanger poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). By varying the polymerization time, the thickness of the nanolayer was controlled. Characterization was done by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to follow the modification steps. Water flux measurements illustrated that polymerization time could be used to decrease average effective pore sizes controllably. Pore-size distributions measured by liquid dewetting permporometry also confirmed that polymer chains were grown from the surface of the membrane pores. Static and dynamic binding capacities were measured for lysozyme on the PAA-modified RC membranes. Capacities initially increase with increasing modification times and reach maximum values of 98.5 mg/ml (static) and 71.2 mg/ml (dynamic). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to visualize binding of fluorescently labeled lysozyme on the unmodified and PAA-modified membranes. CLSM of labeled membranes also showed that the modification procedure had no detrimental effects on the membrane pore structure. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Meehan, Kristin; Jodice, Patrick G.R.								An assessment of fox squirrel habitat on golf courses along the South Carolina Coast.								USGA Turfgrass and Environmental Research Online				7	4			1	8					February 15 2008	2008	Fox squirrels are declining throughout the southeastern U.S. but appear to occur regularly on golf courses in this same region. Researchers at Clemson University and the South Carolina Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit conducted surveys on golf courses along the entire South Carolina coast to determine which landscape-level characteristics best predicted fox squirrel presence on a golf course. The data indicate: Fox squirrels were present on 68 of 98 courses surveys, but abundance appeared low on most courses. There was a strong correlation in the determination of fox squirrel presence or absence between on-the-ground surveys and phone interviews with golf course personnel. The best predictor of fox squirrel presence on a course was the presence of a fox squirrel population on the nearest neighbor course regardless of distance. For golf courses with fox squirrels, the mean distance to the nearest neighbor course with fox squirrels also present was ca. 2.0 km while for golf courses without fox squirrels the mean distance to the nearest neighbor course was ca. 2.5 km. Results suggest that fox squirrel populations in this region may be stabilized by multi-patch population dynamics, and, as such, landscape-level variables need to be considered when assessing the potential conservation value of golf courses for fox squirrels. Connectivity among courses or habitat patches may be important given the strength of the "nearest neighbor effect".									0	0	0	0	0	0			1541-0277			ZOOREC:ZOOR14406035567

As the doping host, polyfluorene possesses extraordinary "light harvesting" ability, resulting in higher per-particle brightness as compared to dye-loaded silica nanoparticles of similar dimensions. Both the steady-state fluorescence spectra and time-resolved fluorescence measurements indicate highly efficient energy transfer from the host polymer to the acceptor dye molecules. A model that takes into account the combined effects of energy diffusion, Forster transfer, and particle size was developed. Comparisons of experimental data to the model results elucidate the importance of particle size and energy diffusion within the polymer in determining the optical properties of the doped conjugated polymer nanoparticles. Fluorescence quantum yields of similar to 40% and peak extinction coefficients of 1.5 x 10(9) M(-1)cm(-1) were determined for aqueous suspensions of similar to 30 nm diameter polymer nanoparticles doped with perylene or coumarin 6 (2 wt %). Photobleaching experiments indicate that energy transfer phenomena strongly influence the photostability of these dye-doped nanoparticles. Significant features of these nanoparticles include the high brightness, highly red-shifted emission spectrum, and excellent photostability, which are promising for biological labeling and sensing applications. in addition, the nanoparticles are a useful model system for studying energy transfer in dense, nanostructured, multichromophoric systems.									137	4	0	22	0	141			1932-7447			WOS:000252968100010	19221582

The mature hardwood forest was dominated by Populus tremuloides, Populus grandidentata, Betula papyrifera, Quercus rubra, Acer rubrum, and Acer saccharum. We evaluated the model's capability to predict the seasonal and interannual dynamics of GEP and explored the sources of discrepancy between PnET-Day and eddy covariance GEP estimates. GEP was directly estimated from the two eddy-flux towers, one for each forest type, during 2002 and 2003. PnET-Day growing season GEP for the mature hardwood forest was 12% higher in 2002 and 12% lower in 2003 than eddy covariance GEP estimates, while the modeled growing season GEP of the mature red pine forest was overestimated by 43 and 32% compared to eddy covariance GEP in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The disagreement between the two methods was attributed to year-to-year variability in foliage biomass and foliar nitrogen (N) in the mature hardwood forest and to high foliage biomass and specific leaf weight in the mature red pine forest (>50% larger than red pine in Harvard Forest where the model was developed and validated). The difference between PnET-Day and eddy covariance GEP estimates was greatest in May in the hardwood forest, primarily due to the discrepancy between the true and parameterized foliage onset day. Our results suggest that improved prediction of foliage onset is necessary to improve PnET-Day estimation of GEP in a hardwood forest. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

By constraining specific clopants to individual shells, their relative distance to one another can be carefully controlled. Core-shell LaF3 nanoparticles doped with Tb3+ and EU3+ and consisting of up to four layers were synthesized with an outer diameter of approximate to 10 nm. It is found that by varying the thicknesses of an undoped layer between a Tb3+- doped layer and a EU3+-doped layer, the degree of ET can be engineered to allow for zero, partial, or total ET from a donor ion to an acceptor ion. More specifically, the ratio of the intensities of the 541-nm Tb3+ and 590 nm Eu3+ peaks was tailored from <0.2 to approximate to 2.4 without changing the overall composition of the particles but only by changing the internal structure. Further, the emission spectrum of a blend of singly doped nanoparticles is shown to be equivalent to the spectra of co-doped particles when a core-shell configuration that restricts ET is used. Beyond simply controlling ET, which can be limiting when designing materials for optical applications, this approach can be used to obtain truly engineered spectral features from nanoparticles and composites made from them. Further, it allows for a single excitation source to yield multiple discrete emissions from numerous lanthanide clopants that heretofore would have been quenched in a more conventional active optical material.									34	1	0	5	0	35			0027-8424			WOS:000253261900009	18250307

The tunable solvent strength of gas-expanded liquids, via CO2 pressurization, results in an effective method to fractionate nanoparticles, based on the size-dependent dispersibility of the particles. Specifically, the thermodynamic model is used to estimate the size of dodecanethiol-capped Ag nanoparticles that can be dispersed at a given CO2 pressure by equating the total interparticle interaction energy to the Boltzmann threshold stabilization energy (-3/2k(B)T). The ligand-solvent interaction is found to have the greatest impact on the total interaction energy. This model illustrates that the entire length of the ligand is not accessible to the solvent, and three phenomenological model variations were developed to vary the ligand-solvent interaction.									29	0	0	1	0	29			0888-5885			WOS:000252777500009

In this study, we developed a method using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy for the direct measurement of the pK(d) of a SAM surface by combining the ability of SPR to detect the change in mass concentration close to a surface and the shift in ion concentration over the surface as a function of surface charge density. This method was then applied to measure the pK(d) values of both COOH- and NH2-functionalized SAM surfaces using solutions of CsCl and NaBr salts, respectively, which provided pK(d) values of 7.4 and 6.5, respectively, based on the bulk solution pH. An analytical study was also performed to theoretically predict the shape of the SPR plots by calculating the excess mass of salt ions over a surface as a function of the difference between the solution pH and surface pK(d). The analytical relationships show that the state of surface charge also influences the local hydrogen ion concentration, thus resulting in a substantial local shift in pH at the surface compared to the bulk solution as a function of the difference between the bulk solution pH and the pK(d) of the surface.									57	0	0	11	0	57			0743-7463			WOS:000252777700040	18181651

Ceramic-surfaced femoral components have increased scratch resistant surfaces, which offer the potential to reduce UHMWPE wear rates. In this Study, oxidized zirconium (OxZr) and cobalt chromium (CoCr) femoral components were first subjected to a standardized roughening protocol. An in vitro total knee replacement (TKR) wear study was then conducted using conventional UHMWPE to quantify the effect of femoral surface roughening on TKR kinematic, kinetic and wear performance over time. An Instron/Stanmore force-controlled knee simulator was used to conduct a 5 million cycle wear simulation using ISO-14243 walking cycles. During the pre-test roughening procedure, the OxZr component surfaces resisted third body scratching better than the CoCr component surfaces. During wear testing, the roughened OxZr femoral components generated 82% less wear when compared to the roughened CoCr femoral components. Significant reductions in TKR ranges of motion were found over time despite linear wear rates. This Study demonstrates the potential of OxZr femoral knee components for reducing polyethylene wear in vivo when under potentially abrasive conditions and offers new insights into the effects of wear on TKR kinematics over time.

Acta Mater 2000;48:4501]. This study further explores anisotropic wetting of ZnO single crystals by Bi2O3-rich liquid with and without SAFs. For Bi2O3 on the ZnO {11 (2) over bar0} surfaces wherein nanometer-thick SAFs are present in equilibrium with partial wetting drops, the measured (advancing) contact angle decreases with increasing temperature, but it stabilizes at similar to 6 degrees above similar to 860 degrees C. In contrast, the contact angle is virtually a constant on the {1 (1) over bar 00} surfaces where SAFs are not present. This observation suggests that wetting in the presence of nanoscale SAFs follows a generalized Cahn wetting model. Faceted ridge formation at the triple lines and associated pinning effects are observed. Observation and analysis of unique two-stage isothermal drop receding kinetics show that complete wetting does not occur up to 1050 degrees C and that the receding contact angle is estimated to be similar to 4 degrees via two methods. Quantitative evaluation of a thermodynamic model shows that the observed "residual" contact angle of similar to 4-6 degrees and the extended SAF stability can be explained on the basis of a significant attractive London dispersion force.

J	Xie, De; Biggers, Sherrill B., Jr.								Progressive damage arrest mechanism in tailored laminated plates with a cutout								ACTA MECHANICA SOLIDA SINICA				21	1			62	72		10.1007/s10338-008-0809-2			FEB 2008	2008	This study addresses the effectiveness of a simple stiffness tailoring concept to delay damage initiation, control damage progression, and improve residual strength in tensile-loaded composite plates with a central circular cutout. The tailoring concept is to simply reposit all axially oriented (0 degrees) material into regions near the edge of the plate away from the cutout. This tailoring is done in a way so as not to affect the weight of the plate. This accomplishes several beneficial changes in the way that the plate resists loading with no increases in material cost or weight. Lowering the axial stiffness of the laminate surrounding the cutout lowers the stress concentration. Increasing the axial stiffness near edges of the plate attracts loading away from the vicinity of the cutout to further lower stresses in the critical cutout region. This study focuses on in-plane response including damage progression and residual strength as a function of the degree of tailoring and cutout size. Strength and stiffness properties typical of IM7/8551-7 preperg material were assumed and a modified version of the Hashin failure criteria was used to identify the local damage. Results show that tailoring can significantly increase the damage initiation load and the residual strength. In some cases. observed evidence shows that tailoring performs as a damage arrest mechanism.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0894-9166			WOS:000258355100009

Bacteria that function optimally under extreme conditions are beginning to be examined because they may serve as more effective catalysts (higher activity, greater stability, longer life, capable of utilizing a broader range of fuels) in microbial fuel cells. An examination of marine sediment from temperate waters (Charleston, SC) proved to be a good source of thermophilic electrode-reducing bacteria. Electric current normalized to the surface area of graphite electrodes was approximately ten times greater when sediment fuel cells were incubated at 60 C (209 to 254 mA/m(2)) vs 22 C (10 to 22 mA/m(2)). Electricity-generating communities were selected in sediment fuel cells and then maintained without sediment or synthetic electron-carrying mediators in single-chambered fuel cells. Current was generated when cellulose or acetate was added as a substrate to the cells. The 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid genes from the heavy biofilms that formed on the graphite anodes of acetate-fed fuel cells were cloned and sequenced. The preponderance of the clones (54 of 80) was most related to a Gram-positive thermophile, Thermincola carboxydophila (99% similarity). The remainder of clones from the community was most related to T. carboxydophila, or uncultured Firmicutes and Deferribacteres. Overall, the data indicate that temperate aquatic sediments are a good source of thermophilic electrode-reducing bacteria.									52	3	0	36	0	55			0175-7598			WOS:000252466900016	18080121

Their protein constituents are encoded by a set of tightly clustered genes that are thought to form an operon (the cso operon). This study is the first to systematically address transcriptional regulation of carboxysome protein expression. Quantification of transcript levels derived from the cso operon of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus, the sulfur oxidizer that has emerged as the model organism for carboxysome structural and functional studies, indicated that all cso genes are transcribed, albeit at different levels. Combined with comparative genomic evidence, this study supports the premise that the cso gene cluster constitutes an operon. Characterization of transcript 5'- and 3'-ends and examination of likely regulatory sequences and secondary structure elements within the operon suggested potential strategies by which the vastly different levels of individual carboxysome proteins in the microcompartment could have arisen.									14	0	0	13	0	14			0302-8933			WOS:000252252100006	17899012

Applying these techniques to the mission design proposed for the Beyond Einstein program, we find that with its very large field of view and faint gamma-ray burst detection threshold, EXIST will detect and localize approximately two bursts per day, a large fraction of which may be at high redshift. We estimate that EXIST's maximum sensitivity will be similar to 4 times greater than that of Swift's Burst Alert Telescope. Bursts will be localized to better than 4000 at threshold, with a burst position as good as a few arcseconds for strong bursts. EXIST's combination of three different detector systems will provide spectra from 3 keV to more than 10MeV. Thus, EXIST will enable a major leap in the understanding of bursts, their evolution, environment, and utility as cosmological probes.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0004-637X			WOS:000253454300054		
J	Ryan, Joseph B.; Reid, Robert; Gallagher, Ken; Ellis, Cynthia								Prevalence Rates of Psychotropic Medications for Students Placed in Residential Facilities								BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS				33	2			99	107					FEB 2008	2008	The use of psychotropic interventions to manage the inappropriate behaviors displayed by students who are emotionally disturbed (ED) has continued to increase over the past several decades. To date, few studies have investigated the use of psychotropic medications among students with ED placed in the most restrictive educational settings (Le, residential facilities). For this study, medication records from 137 students placed in three nonpublic residential schools were reviewed This survey found that medication rates varied from 65% to 94%, with an overall medication rate of 76% among students placed in residential care. Other findings of interest included (a) Caucasian students were more likely to receive medication therapy than their African American or Hispanic peers, and (b) students placed in a residential center specializing in treating students with a history of substance abuse were less likely to receive medication therapy.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0198-7429			WOS:000207639900004		
J	Cantalupo, Claudio; Freeman, Hani; Rodes, William; Hopkins, William								Handedness for tool use correlates with cerebellar asymmetries in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)								BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE				122	1			191	198		10.1037/0735-7044.122.1.191			FEB 2008	2008	Recent studies have shown that great ape species possess patterns of macrostructural neocortical asymmetries that are similar to those found in humans. However, little is known about the asymmetry of subcortical structures in great apes. To address this lack of data, the authors assessed left-right asymmetry of the anterior and posterior aspects of cerebellum from MRI brain scans of 53 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). No population-level bias was found for either the anterior or the posterior region of the cerebellum. However, a significant inverse association was found in the asymmetry quotients of the anterior and posterior regions, indicating that the cerebellum was torqued at the individual level. Additionally, handedness for tool use but not other measures was associated with variation in cerebellar asymmetries. Last, older chimpanzees had a smaller cerebellum after brain volume was adjusted for. The results are discussed in the context of brain changes in primate evolution related to tool use.									13	0	0	10	0	13			0735-7044			WOS:000253332700020	18298262

It is well known that the functional CUSUM statistic and its randomly permuted version both converge weakly to a Brownian bridge if second moments exist. Surprisingly, an infinite-variance counterpart does not hold true. In the present paper, we let {X(j)} be in the domain of attraction of a strictly alpha-stable law, alpha is an element of (0, 2). While the functional CUSUM statistics itself converges to an alpha-stable bridge and so does the permuted version, provided both the {X(j)} and the permutation are random, the situation turns out to be more delicate if a realization of the {X(j)} is fixed and randomness is restricted to the permutation. Here, the conditional distribution function of the permuted CUSUM statistics converges in probability to a random and nondegenerate limit.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1350-7265			WOS:000253512700006		
J	Foulk, Jonn A.; Akin, Danny E.; Dodd, Roy B.								INFLUENCE OF PECTINOLYTIC ENZYMES ON RETTING EFFECTIVENESS AND RESULTANT FIBER PROPERTIES								BIORESOURCES				3	1			155	169					FEB 2008	2008	Enzymes have the potential to provide an improved method to ret flax for textile fibers. Retting is the separation or loosening of fiber bundles from the cuticularized epidermis and the woody core cells. New commercial pectinase products were evaluated both with and without ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for retting efficiency. The Fried Test identified the most efficient enzymes and best retting conditions. All enzymes retted flax stems better in the presence of 18 mM EDTA. Pectinases that also contained cellulases reduced fiber strength, whereas those without cellulases effectively retted flax without substantial strength loss. Viscozyme, which has been used extensively in our enzyme-retting research, and several pectinolytic enzymes were compared in pilot plant scale tests. Texazym BFE and Bioprep 3000 L retted flax as well as Viscozyme in this system, and the fibers had higher tenacity. The monocomponent nature, commercial availability and price, and ability to ret flax in combination with EDTA at high pH indicated a potential advantage for Bioprep 3000 L in these tests. Retting with different enzymes and formulations resulted in fibers with different properties, thereby leading to protocols for tailored fiber characteristics.									15	0	0	5	0	15			1930-2126			WOS:000263689800015

The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N-2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, and H-2 chemisorption. Increasing Co loading from 5 to 20 wt% for the mixed phase Al2O3-supported Co catalysts resulted in a constant increase in both the number of cobalt metal active sites and the hydrogenation activities. However, for those supported on gamma-Al2O3, Co dispersion increased up to 15 wt%Co and declined at 20 wt%Co loading. It is suggested that the spherical-shape like morphology of the chi-phase Al2O3 prevented agglomeration of Co particles, especially at high Co loadings. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Growth of Brown Pelican nestlings exposed to sublethal levels of soft tick infestation								CONDOR				110	1			134	142		10.1525/cond.2008.110.1.134			FEB 2008	2008	Ectoparasites are a common component of seabird colonies and are generally considered to have a negative impact on their hosts. Nest parasites such as the soft tick Carios capensis may pose a distinct threat to altricial nestlings confined to the nest and unable to escape infestation. To assess the potential effects of ticks on growth, we measured linear growth rates of Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) nestlings during early development in relation to C. capensis infestation at insecticide treated and untreated nests at two colonies in South Carolina during the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons. Tick infestation levels differed between colonies but not between years. We found a positive relationship between tick infestation and both growth rates and hatching success at the more infested colony. We did not find a consistent relationship between insecticide treatment and growth rates, although chicks from nests treated with insecticide had fewer ticks compared to chicks from untreated nests. Our study suggests that the cohabitation of ectoparasites and seabirds within colonies may result in behavioral or physiological adaptations of adults or nestlings that inhibit the expected negative effect of ectoparasites on nestling growth at sublethal levels of infestation.									8	0	0	9	0	9			0010-5422			WOS:000255504900015
