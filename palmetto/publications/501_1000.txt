J	Fleck, Robert K.; Hanssen, F. Andrew								Persistence and change in age-specific gender gaps: Hollywood actors from the silent era onward								INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS				48				36	49		10.1016/j.irle.2016.08.002			OCT 2016	2016	In this paper, we examine a set of workers for whom age-based and gender-based discrimination has been widely alleged: motion picture actors. We document, measure, and consider possible explanations for age-specific gender gaps among Hollywood actors, using nearly a century's worth of data on films and film roles. Consistent with reports in the popular press, we find a large and very persistent gender gap: Of the nearly half-million different roles played in more than 50,000 feature films between 1920 and 2011, two-thirds have gone to males, and the average male actor is consistently older (by six to ten years) than the average female actor. Yet the age-based gender differences that we observe cannot be explained by a simple model of discrimination while there are fewer roles for middle-aged women than for middle-aged men, there are more roles for young women than for young men. The fact that these patterns have held steady through major changes in the film industry-and in society as a whole -suggests that correspondingly stable aspects of moviegoer preferences contribute to the age-specific nature of gender gaps.

Hexokinase (HK) catalyzes the first step in glycolysis, transferring the gamma-phosphoryl group of ATP to glucose to yield glucose-6-phosphate. Here, we describe the validation of a high-throughput assay for screening small-molecule collections to identify inhibitors of the P. falciparum HK (PfHK). The assay, which employed an ADP-Glo reporter system in a 1,536-well-plate format, was robust with a signal-to-background ratio of 3.4 +/- 1.2, a coefficient of variation of 6.8% +/- 2.9%, and a Z'-factor of 0.75 +/- 0.08. Using this assay, we screened 57,654 molecules from multiple small-molecule collections. Confirmed hits were resolved into four clusters on the basis of structural relatedness. Multiple singleton hits were also identified. The most potent inhibitors had 50% inhibitory concentrations as low as similar to 1 mu M, and several were found to have low-micromolar 50% effective concentrations against asexual intraerythrocytic-stage P. falciparum parasites. These molecules additionally demonstrated limited toxicity against a panel of mammalian cells. The identification of PfHK inhibitors with antiparasitic activity using this validated screening assay is encouraging, as it justifies additional HTS campaigns with more structurally amenable libraries for the identification of potential leads for future therapeutic development.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0066-4804	1098-6596		WOS:000389059800045	27458230

RAPID COMMUNICATION: Impact of contemporary light sources on oxidation of fresh ground beef								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				94	10			4457	4462		10.2527/jas2016-0728			OCT 2016	2016	Meat color is considered one of the driving factors in consumer purchasing decisions. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of 2 different lighting sources on color and lipid oxidation of ground beef patties in a controlled environment. USDA Select top rounds (n = 20) were processed to produce ground beef at 2 different fat levels (5 and 25%) and made into patties (113.4 g). Patties were packaged with oxygen permeable polyvinyl chloride, assigned to one of three lighting treatments (low UV fluorescent [FLO], light emitting diode [LED], and no light [DRK, negative control]), and placed within deli cases at 5 degrees C. Patty removal for evaluation occurred on retail display d 1, 3, 5, and 7. Objective color measurements were obtained using a HunterLab MiniScan 45/0 LAV. These values were utilized to determine myoglobin redox forms as a measure of myoglobin oxidation. Additionally, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured to indicate lipid oxidation. Objective color measurement for a* (redness), decreased for all light treatments by retail display day (P < 0.0001). Oxymyoglobin values for all light treatments decreased daily but showed no differences between treatments until d 5 (P < 0.0001) where DRK > LED > FLO. Conversely, metmyoglobin values increased daily (P < 0.0001), but showed no differences between treatments until d 5 where FLO > LED > DRK. TBARS values increased by day for each fat percentage (P < 0.0001) with 5% fat patties having higher TBARS values indicating great oxidation occurring in the phospholipids than adipose tissues. Results indicate that light treatment affected discoloration and metmyoglobin formation in ground beef patties; LED lighting may lead to increased meat quality shelf life in a retail setting.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000388955400041	27898846	
J	Niaki, Farbod Akhavan; Michel, Martin; Mears, Laine								State of health monitoring in machining: Extended Kalman filter for tool wear assessment in turning of IN718 hard-to-machine alloy								Journal of Manufacturing Processes				24		SI		361	369		10.1016/j.jmapro.2016.06.015			OCT 2016	2016	An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed in this work for tracking tool flank wear area in wet turning of Inconel 718 (IN718) nickel-based alloy in variable feed condition. The tool wear area evolution is modeled with a 3rd order polynomial empirical function and an analytical solution for discrete state space system is derived. The state uncertainty was found to decrease up to a critical range of 200-250 mu m of average flank wear length, and then increase abruptly with an increase in tool wear. Therefore, the tool wear uncertainty was modeled with failure probability density, i.e. the bathtub function, while a constant uncertainty was considered for the measurement signal (spindle power). To demonstrate the significance of using this method, the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) were calculated and compared with deterministic method in estimation of the tool wear area. It was shown that the proposed estimation based on stochastic filter EKF increased the accuracy of estimation by maximum of 60%. Results for estimation of the rate of tool wear area indicate additional possible effects or transitions of effects at higher wear conditions. (C) 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

J	Pasumarthi, Pavan; Absar, Saheem; Choi, Hongseok								The effect of geometrical parameters on the characteristics of ultrasonic processing for metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs)								Journal of Manufacturing Processes				24		SI		382	390		10.1016/j.jmapro.2016.06.019			OCT 2016	2016	Metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) can offer significant improvement of properties such as higher specific strength, specific modulus, controlled thermal expansion and higher corrosion resistance, compared to the base metallic materials. However, agglomeration or clustering of nanomaterials makes it very difficult to disperse them in the metal matrix. Non-linear effects of ultrasonic processing, such as acoustic cavitation and acoustic streaming, help in the dispersion and distribution of the nanomaterials. Non-linearity of the ultrasonic processing makes it very hard to measure or characterize the process experimentally. There is very limited knowledge about the interactions between the geometrical parameters of the ultrasonic processing and the extent of cavitation achieved. Numerical modeling offers powerful tools to overcome the experimental difficulties involved. In this study, a non-linear numerical model was developed to resolve the acoustic pressure field, and the cavitation zone size was quantified from the numerical modeling results. The model was then used to study the effect of geometry on the cavitation zone size. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify the significant parameters. A parametric analysis involving these parameters was subsequently performed. A configuration of geometrical parameters offering the highest cavitation zone size was determined. It was found out that a probe immersion depth of 25.4 mm produced a maximum cavitation zone in the ultrasonic processing cell with a diameter of 35.9 mm for processing 57 ml of molten Al alloy. An experimental validation has been accomplished by ultrasonically processing an aluminum alloy with carbon nanofibers and silicon carbide microparticles. With selected parameters the area of micro pores in the MMNC was significantly decreased by 50% and a deviation of the hardness was also decreased by 46% due to further dispersion and distribution of the carbon nanofibers.

Wepreviously demonstrated the use of these species adsorbed onto polypropylene capillary-channeled polymer fibers. The general use of lipid tethered ligands on other hydrophobic chromatographic supports is demonstrated here for polystyrene-divinylbenzene. Evaluation of ligand adsorption conditions was performed using a fluorescein isocyanate head group to quantify the extent of loading by UV-Vis absorbance and by fluorescence microscopy. Selective protein capture was demonstrated by the detection of Texas Red labeled streptavidin (using fluorescence microscopy imaging, with quantification assessed through the depletion of solution-phase protein using UV-Vis absorbance. A second demonstration of the coupling involved an iminodiacetic acid head group lipid tethered ligand to capture the cationic dye, methylene blue. Two common means of alleviating nonspecific binding, adsorption in detergent media and use of a bovine serum albumin block, were evaluated. The first was found to cause release of the ligands, while the second was nominally effective. Indeed, the lipid tethered ligands itself may be most effective at impeding nonspecific binding. While further optimization and chromatographic evaluation is required, the general viability of this ligand immobilization method onto this common polymer support is demonstrated.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1615-9306	1615-9314		WOS:000389045100003	27541805	
J	Roy, Judhajit; Law, E. Harry								Effect of Cab Suspension Configuration and Location on Tractor Semi-Trailer Driver Comfort								SAE International Journal of Commercial Vehicles				9	2			405	416		10.4271/2016-01-9018			OCT 2016	2016	It is well known that the ride quality of trucks is much harsher than that of automobiles. Additionally, truck drivers typically drive trucks for much longer duration than automobile drivers. These two factors contribute to the fatigue that a truck driver typically experiences during long haul deliveries. Fatigue reduces driver alertness and increases reaction times, increasing the possibility of an accident. One may conclude that better ride quality contributes to safer operation.The secondary suspensions of a tractor have been an area of particular interest because of the considerable ride comfort improvements they provide. A gap exists in the current engineering domain of an easily configurable high fidelity low computational cost simulation tool to analyze the ride of a tractor semi-trailer. For a preliminary design study, a 15 d.o.f. model of the tractor semi-trailer was developed to simulate in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The developed model incorporates the effects of frame beaming. The contributions of the different modes of vibration to the ride comfort were analyzed. It is shown in this work that the ride at the driver seat can be significantly improved by relocating the cab mounts near the nodes of the first mode of bending of the tractor frame and by employing a full cab suspension. The developed simulation tool was used to quantify the improvements in the driver ride comfort.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1946-391X	1946-3928		WOS:000389233800030		
J	Yang, Ye; Kucukkal, Tugba G.; Li, Jing; Alexov, Emil; Cao, Weiguo								Binding Analysis of Methyl-CpG Binding Domain of MeCP2 and Rett Syndrome Mutations								ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY				11	10			2706	2715		10.1021/acschembio.6b00450			OCT 2016	2016	Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) binds to methylated cytosine in CpG island through its methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD). Here, the effects of the Rett syndrome-causing missense mutations on binding affinity of MBD to cytosine (C), methylcytosine (mC), hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), formylcytosine (fC), and carboxylcytosine (caC) in CpG dinucleotide are investigated. MeCP2-MBD binds to mC-containing variants of double stranded CpG stronger than any other cytosine modified CpG with the strongest affinity to mC/mC. Thirteen MBD missense mutations show reduced binding affinity for mC/mC ranging with a 2-fold decrease for T158M to 88-fold for R111G. The binding affinities of these mutants to C/C are also reduced to various degrees except for T158M. Consistent with free energy perturbation analysis, correlation of binding affinity with protein unfolding allows for grouping mutations into three clusters. Correlation of the first cluster includes mutations that have a higher tendency to unfold and have lesser affinity to mC/mC and C/C. Mutations in the second cluster have similar structural stability but various affinities to mC/mC and C/C. R111G and A140V belong to the third cluster in which the loss of protein flexibility may underlie their reduction in binding affinity to mC/mC and C/C. Most notably, R111 emerges as the key structural element that modulates the specific contacts with mCpG. Implications of the results for the mCpG binding mechanism of MeCP2-MBD are discussed. These analyses provide new insights on the structure and function relationships in MeCP2-MBD and offer new clues to their roles in the pathology of Rett syndrome.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1554-8929	1554-8937		WOS:000386187700006	27356039

The study was carried out in the Spruce Woods Provincial Park (SWPP) located in southwestern Manitoba, Canada. The dry regional climate restricted trembling aspen growth during the growing season via moisture deficiency and temperature induced drought stress. Warm, mild winters also negatively affected radial growth of trembling aspen. Growth of white spruce was moderated by conditions within the aspen stands as radial growth patterns showed low variability from year to year, a low common growth signal, and a stronger response to temperature than to precipitation. Nonetheless, the dry regional climate still restricted growth of white spruce during the growing season via temperature induced drought stress. The findings of the study for white spruce support the stress gradient hypothesis in which facilitative interactions between tree species are expected under harsher environmental conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1999-4907			WOS:000388670800026

The current study created a cold condition to examine the impact of cold stress on driving behavior. Forty-four participants drove a high-fidelity driving simulator during a thermal neutral or local torso cooled condition. Participants performed additional tasks to assess attention, psychomotor vigilance, and manual dexterity. Skin temperature was significantly lower in the cold condition while internal temperature was unaffected. Participants who had higher subjective ratings of cold followed lead vehicles closer and started to brake later. Participants in the cold condition followed the lead car 22% (0.82 s) closer and started braking 20% (2.35 s) later when approaching a stop sign during the car-following task. No change in attention, psychomotor vigilance, or dexterity was observed. The current results suggest that cold environmental conditions can contribute to dangerous driving behaviors. Measures of cold perception were also shown to predict changes in driving behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Colonization and demographic expansion of freshwater fauna across the Hawaiian archipelago								JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY				29	10			2054	2069		10.1111/jeb.12929			OCT 2016	2016	It is widely accepted that insular terrestrial biodiversity progresses with island age because colonization and diversification proceed over time. Here, we assessed whether this principle extends to oceanic island streams. We examined rangewide mtDNA sequence variation in four stream-dwelling species across the Hawaiian archipelago to characterize the relationship between colonization and demographic expansion, and to determine whether either factor reflects island age. We found that colonization and demographic expansion are not related and that neither corresponds to island age. The snail Neritina granosa exhibited the oldest colonization time (similar to 2.713 mya) and time since demographic expansion (similar to 282 kya), likely reflecting a preference for lotic habitats most prevalent on young islands. Conversely, gobioid fishes (Awaous stamineus, Eleotris sandwicensis and Sicyopterus stimpsoni) colonized the archipelago only similar to 0.411-0.935 mya, suggesting ecological opportunities for colonization in this group were temporally constrained. These findings indicate that stream communities form across colonization windows, underscoring the importance of ecological opportunities in shaping island freshwater diversity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1010-061X	1420-9101		WOS:000388311200020	27369460

The systemic nodule number regulation kinase SUNN in Medicago truncatula interacts with MtCLV2 and MtCRN								PLANT JOURNAL				88	1			108	119		10.1111/tpj.13234			OCT 2016	2016	Autoregulation of nodulation (AON), a systemic signaling pathway in legumes, limits the number of nodules formed by the legume in its symbiosis with rhizobia. Recent research suggests a model for the systemic regulation in Medicago truncatula in which root signaling peptides are translocated to the shoot where they bind to a shoot receptor complex containing the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase SUNN, triggering signal transduction which terminates nodule formation in roots. Here we show that a tagged SUNN protein capable of rescuing the sunn-4 phenotype is localized to the plasma membrane and is associated with the plasmodesmata. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis we show that, like its sequence ortholog Arabidopsis CLV1, SUNN interacts with homologous CLV1-interacting proteins MtCLAVATA2 and MtCORYNE. All three proteins were also able to form homomers and MtCRN and MtCLV2 also interact with each other. A crn Tnt1 insertion mutant of M. truncatula displayed a shoot controlled increased nodulation phenotype, similar to the clv2 mutants of pea and Lotus japonicus. Together these data suggest that legume AON signaling could occur through a multi-protein complex and that both MtCRN and MtCLV2 may play roles in AON together with SUNN.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0960-7412	1365-313X		WOS:000388442100009	27296908

Understanding the role of latent feature diversification on choice difficulty and satisfaction								USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION				26	4			347	389		10.1007/s11257-016-9178-6			OCT 2016	2016	People like variety and often prefer to choose from large item sets. However, large sets can cause a phenomenon called "choice overload": they are more difficult to choose from, and as a result decision makers are less satisfied with their choices. It has been argued that choice overload occurs because large sets contain more similar items. To overcome this effect, the present paper proposes that increasing the diversity of item sets might make them more attractive and satisfactory, without making them much more difficult to choose from. To this purpose, by using structural equation model methodology, we study diversification based on the latent features of a matrix factorization recommender model. Study 1 diversifies a set of recommended items while controlling for the overall quality of the set, and tests it in two online user experiments with a movie recommender system. Study 1a tests the effectiveness of the latent feature diversification, and shows that diversification increases the perceived diversity and attractiveness of the item set, while at the same time reducing the perceived difficulty of choosing from the set. Study 1b subsequently shows that diversification can increase users' satisfaction with the chosen option, especially when they are choosing from small, diverse item sets. Study 2 extends these results by testing our diversification algorithm against traditional Top-N recommendations, and finds that diverse, small item sets are just as satisfying and less effortful to choose from than Top-N recommendations. Our results suggest that, at least for the movie domain, diverse small sets may be the best thing one could offer a user of a recommender system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0924-1868	1573-1391		WOS:000388188100002

Quadratic scalarization for decomposed multiobjective optimization								OR SPECTRUM				38	4			1071	1096		10.1007/s00291-016-0453-z			OCT 2016	2016	Practical applications in multidisciplinary engineering design, business management, and military planning require distributed solution approaches for solving nonconvex, multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). Under this motivation, a quadratic scalarization method (QSM) is developed with the goal to preserve decomposable structures of the MOP while addressing nonconvexity in a manner that avoids a high degree of nonlinearity and the introduction of additional nonsmoothness. Under certain assumptions, necessary and sufficient conditions for QSM-generated solutions to be weakly and properly efficient for an MOP are developed, with any form of efficiency being understood in a local sense. QSM is shown to correspond with the relaxed, reformulated weighted-Chebyshev method as a special case. An example is provided for demonstrating the application of QSM to a nonconvex MOP.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0171-6468	1436-6304		WOS:000383708000010

Volatile compounds of a locally cultivated muscadine cultivar Cowart were characterized by solid-phase microextraction coupled with GC-MS. Twenty-eight volatile compounds, including fruity short-chain esters, alcohols, terpenes, and carbonyl compounds, were detected based on mass spectra and Kovats indices. Based on principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, the grapes in stages I and II had relatively similar flavor patterns, which were different from that in stage III. Butyl-2-butenoate, hexyl acetate, propyl acetate, ethyl trans-2-butenoate, hexyl-2-butenoate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, 1-octanol, ethyl hexanoate, and beta-citral were present as distinct volatile chemicals in stage III, while nonanal, decanal, and beta-citronellol were distinct in stage II, and myrcenol, beta-ocimene, and I-limonene were biomarkers in stage I. Understanding volatile compounds at each stage can assist farmers in choosing the optimal time to harvest muscadine grapes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-7708	2092-6456		WOS:000387529400013

Postoperative acute care use after freestanding ambulatory surgery								JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH				205	2			331	340		10.1016/j.jss.2016.06.084			OCT 2016	2016	Background: Surgical procedures in the United States are increasingly performed in the ambulatory setting, including freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). However, there is a lack of research and tracking of surgical outcomes in this setting.Materials and methods: We analyzed data from a state all-payer claims database to produce a retrospective cohort study on the rate of acute care use (emergency department [ED] visits and inpatient admissions) within 7 d after operations performed in freestanding ASCs in South Carolina. Two-level reliability-adjusted generalized linear mixed models accounting for random facility-level effects were used to adjust for patient-level and facility-level characteristics.Results: A total of 1,328,708 procedures were performed in 86 freestanding ASCs in South Carolina from 2006-2013. The overall rate of postoperative acute care per 1000 procedures within 7 d was 17.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.3-19.5). Patient characteristics associated with the highest postoperative acute care use within 7 d included Medicaid insurance (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.79; 95% CI, 1.70-1.90), lowest median household income (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.30-1.43), and preoperative Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score 3+ (aOR, 4.14; 95% CI, 3.95-4.34). Total charges for postoperative ED visits (n = 14,682) and inpatient admissions (n = 8945) within 7 d were approximately $51.4 and $361.1 million, respectively from 2006-2013.Conclusions: Acute care use within 7 d was commonly >= 10 per 1000 procedures performed in freestanding ASCs in South Carolina.

Adults are short winged (micropterous) and flightless. The known host plants are two species of the grass genus Muhlenbergia: M. lindheimeri in Texas and M. reverchonii in Oklahoma and Texas. The present paper provides additional information on the study sites and host plants, adds collection sites not included in the original description, and gives notes on seasonality. Adults overwintered and first instars were observed as early as late April. Second instars were present in late May, third instars in early to mid-June, and fourth and fifth instars in early July. The bug might be univoltine, but the adults observed in late October probably represented those of a second generation. Vascular plants and other insect groups with similar Arbuckle Mountains-Edwards Plateau range disjunctions are noted. As a host restricted, dispersal-limited, and habitat-specialized species, W muhlenbergiae is a potential indicator of the ecological integrity of grasslands on limestone and sandstone substrates.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000387738500012

All records are from western North America: British Columbia in Canada; Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington in the United States; and Baja California in Mexico. Its host plants have remained unknown. Based on fieldwork in Oregon and Washington (2007-2009), N. occlusa is reported to develop on common rush, Juncus effusus (Juncaceae), in natural stands and ornamental plantings. The presence of N. occlusa in waterside gardens and other landscape plantings suggests that it can be transported with Juncus nursery stock. It was not found on grasses (Poaceae) or sedges (Cyperaceae). All adult males collected (n = 170) were brachypterous; females were mainly brachypterous (n = 47), with the remainder macropterous (n = 19). The adult male and female are described, and color photographs of the male and female (dorsal habitus) and hindleg (showing calcar and teeth) are included.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000387738500013

Strain D5610 was originally isolated from the bronchial wash of a patient in Ohio, USA. The bacteria were gram-negative, rod-shaped, and exhibited green fluorescence under long wave UV light. Phylogenetic analysis and fatty acid composition revealed a distinct separation within the genus. The strain grows between 26-45 degrees C and forms biofilms equivalent to L. pneumophila Philadelphia 1. These characteristics suggest that this isolate is a novel Legionella species, for which the name Legionella clemsonensis sp nov. is proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0385-5600	1348-0421		WOS:000387006400005	27619817

The servers are flexible, yet non-collaborative, so that at most one server can work at a station at any time. The objective is to maximize the long-run average throughput. We show that if each server is the fastest at one station, then a dedicated server assignment policy is optimal for systems of arbitrary size and with general service requirement distributions. Otherwise, the optimal policy is more complex as servers must divide their time between stations. For Markovian systems with two stations and two servers, we characterize the optimal policy completely. For larger Markovian systems, we use our results for two-station systems to propose four heuristic server assignment policies and provide computational results that show that our heuristics are near-optimal. We also compare collaborative and non-collaborative settings to evaluate the benefits of dynamic server allocation, as opposed to collaboration, in systems with flexible servers. We conclude that the loss in the long-run average throughput due to lack of collaboration is mitigated by the similarity of the tasks in the system, and cross-training can still be beneficial in non-collaborative systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0257-0130	1572-9443		WOS:000387352900004

Vasoactivity and Vasoconstriction Changes in Cattle Related to Time off Toxic Endophyte-Infected Tall Fescue								TOXINS				8	10					271	10.3390/toxins8100271			OCT 2016	2016	Previous research has indicated that serotonergic and ff -adrenergic receptors in peripheral vasculature are affected by exposure of cattle grazing toxic endophyte-infected (E+; Epichle coenophialia) tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum). The objective of this experiment was to determine the period of time necessary for the vascular effects of ergot alkaloids to subside. Two experiments were conducted to investigate changes in vascular contractile response and vasoconstriction over time relative to removal from an ergot alkaloid-containing E+ tall fescue pasture. In Experiment 1, lateral saphenous vein biopsies were conducted on 21 predominantly Angus steers (357 +/- 3 kg body weight) at 0 (n = 6), 7 (n = 6), 14 (n = 5), or 28 days (n = 4) after removal from grazing pasture (3.0 ha; endpoint ergovaline + ergovalinine = 1.35 mg/kg DM) for 126 days. In Experiment 2, lateral saphenous veins were biopsied from 24 Angus-cross steers (361 +/- 4 kg body weight) at 0, 21, 42, and 63 days (n = 6 per time point) following removal from grazing tall fescue pastures (3.0 ha; first 88 days endpoint ergovaline + ergovalinine = 0.15 mg/kg DM; last 18 days endpoint ergovaline + ergovalinine = 0.57 mg/kg DM) for 106 total days. Six steers (370 +/- 18 kg body weight) off of bermudagrass pasture for the same time interval were also biopsied on Day 0 and Day 63 (n = 3 per time point). Additionally, in Experiment 2, cross-sectional ultrasound scans of caudal artery at the fourth coccygeal vertebra were taken on Days 0, 8, 15, 21, 29, 36, 42, and 45 to determine mean artery luminal area to evaluate vasoconstriction. In both experiments, steers were removed from pasture and housed in a dry lot and fed a corn silage diet for the duration of biopsies and ultrasound scans. Biopsied vessels used to evaluate vasoactivity were cleaned, incubated in a multimyograph, and exposed to increasing concentrations of 4-Bromo-3,6-dimethoxybenzocyclobuten-1-yl) methylamine hydrobromide (TCB2; 5HT(2A) agonist), guanfacine (GF; alpha(2A)-adrenergic agonist), and (R)-(+)-m-nitrobiphenyline oxalate (NBP; alpha(2C)-adrenergic agonist) in both experiments and ergovaline (ERV) and ergotamine (ERT) in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. In Experiment 1, days off pasture x agonist concentration was not significant (p > 0.1) for all four compounds tested. In Experiment 2, GF, NBP, TCB2 and ERT were significant for days off pasture x agonist concentration interaction (p < 0.02) and vasoactivity increased over time. Vasoactivity to agonists was reduced (p < 0.05) when steers were initially removed from E+ tall fescue pasture compared to bermudagrass, but did not differ by Day 63 for any variable. Luminal areas of caudal arteries in steers grazed on E+ tall fescue relaxed and were similar to steers that had grazed bermudagrass for 36 days on non-toxic diet (p = 0.15). These data demonstrate changes in peripheral vasoactivity and recovery from vasoconstriction occur beyond five weeks off toxic pasture and 5HT2A receptors appear to be more dramatically affected in the lateral saphenous vein by grazing E+ tall fescue pasture than adrenergic receptors.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2072-6651			WOS:000387347300003

Improved algorithmic results for unsplittable stable allocation problems								JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION				32	3			657	671		10.1007/s10878-015-9889-3			OCT 2016	2016	The stable allocation problem is a many-to-many generalization of the well-known stable marriage problem, where we seek a bipartite assignment between, say, jobs (of varying sizes) and machines (of varying capacities) that is "stable" based on a set of underlying preference lists submitted by the jobs and machines. Building on the initial work of Dean et al. (The unsplittable stable marriage problem, 2006), we study a natural "unsplittable" variant of this problem, where each assigned job must be fully assigned to a single machine. Such unsplittable bipartite assignment problems generally tend to be NP-hard, including previously-proposed variants of the unsplittable stable allocation problem (McDermid and Manlove in J Comb Optim 19(3): 279-303, 2010). Our main result is to show that under an alternative model of stability, the unsplittable stable allocation problem becomes solvable in polynomial time; although this model is less likely to admit feasible solutions than the model proposed in McDermid and Manlove (J Comb Optim 19(3): 279-303, McDermid and Manlove 2010), we show that in the event there is no feasible solution, our approach computes a solution of minimal total congestion (overfilling of all machines collectively beyond their capacities). We also describe a technique for rounding the solution of a stable allocation problem to produce "relaxed" unsplit solutions that are only mildly infeasible, where each machine is overcongested by at most a single job.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1382-6905	1573-2886		WOS:000382939800001

Texture-based forming limit prediction for Mg sheet alloys ZE10 and AZ31								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES				117				102	114		10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2016.08.013			OCT 2016	2016	A viscoplastic self-consistent crystal plasticity model was employed to study the formability of two magnesium sheet alloys, i.e., AZ31 and ZE10 at 200 degrees C. The flow stress-strain curves obtained by uniaxial tension tests at various strain rates and the crystallographic texture obtained from X-ray diffraction were used to calibrate the model. The crystal plasticity model was incorporated with the Marciniak-Kuczynski model in order to address the forming limits of the magnesium sheets. A good agreement of the model predictions with the experimental data obtained by Nakajima tests was achieved. The model was further studied to quantify the effects of the sample orientation with respect to laboratory axes, the amount of pre-strain applied to the sheet prior to forming, and the initial crystallographic texture. The resulting forming limit diagrams demonstrate the optimal choice of sample orientation and crystallographic texture that can lead to a significant improvement in forming limit strains.

VARIABLE INFECTION DYNAMICS IN FOUR PEROMYSCUS SPECIES FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTAL INOCULATION WITH BAYLISASCARIS PROCYONIS								JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY				102	5			538	544		10.1645/16-57			OCT 2016	2016	Wild rodents such as Peromyscus spp. are intermediate hosts for the zoonotic ascarid Baylisascaris procyonis (raccoon roundworm), and previous studies indicate Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse) likely serves an important role in parasite ecology. Natural infections have been sporadically identified in a few Peromyscus spp., but no data are available on differences in susceptibility among the many other species. We compared survival and infection dynamics of B. procyonis in 4 species (P. leucopus, Peromyscus maniculatus [deer mouse], Peromyscus californicus [California mouse], Peromyscus polionotus [Oldfield mouse]) from regions of varying habitat types as well as B. procyonis prevalence in raccoons. Six captive-bred mice of each species were inoculated per os with 1 of 3 biologically-relevant doses of embryonated B. procyonis eggs (similar to 10, similar to 50, or similar to 500). Animals were monitored twice daily for clinical signs and behavioral abnormalities and were euthanized at the onset of neurological signs or extensive (>= 20%) weight loss, or at 45 days post-infection if no disease developed. Larvae were counted in the brain via microscopic examination and in skeletal muscle and visceral organs via artificial digestion. In the high-dose group, all but 1 mouse developed severe neurologic disease and were euthanized. In the medium-dose group, survival was variable and ranged from 33-85% across species. Little to no disease was observed in the low-dose group, although 1 P. maniculatus developed disease and was euthanized. Survival analysis reveals P. leucopus had a longer time until clinical disease onset versus the other species, which did not differ significantly from each other. Interestingly, larval recovery relative to dose was nearly identical across species and doses; however, larvae were differentially distributed in skeletal muscle, visceral organs, and brain among species. These data indicate that P. leucopus may be more resilient toward severe baylisascariasis compared to the other species and that even closely-related rodents may experience differential mortality. This variation in tolerance may have ecological implications for the different species as B. procyonis intermediate hosts, although more work is needed to put these experimental findings into context.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3395	1937-2345		WOS:000386566600008	27351237

Bounds on cost effective domination numbers								QUAESTIONES MATHEMATICAE				39	6			773	783		10.2989/16073606.2016.1167133			OCT 2016	2016	A vertex upsilon in a set S is said to be cost effective if it is adjacent to at least as many vertices in V\S as it is in S and is very cost effective if it is adjacent to more vertices in V\S than to vertices in S. A dominating set S is (very) cost effective if every vertex in S is (very) cost effective. The minimum cardinality of a (very) cost effective dominating set of G is the (very) cost effective domination number of G. Our main results include a quadratic upper bound on the very cost effective domination number of a graph in terms of its domination number. The proof of this result gives a linear upper bound for hereditarily sparse graphs which include trees. We show that no such linear bound exists for graphs in general, even when restricted to bipartite graphs. Further, we characterize the extremal trees attaining the bound. Noting that the very cost effective domination number is bounded below by the domination number, we show that every value of the very cost effective domination number between these lower and upper bounds for trees is realizable. Similar results are given for the cost effective domination number.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1607-3606	1727-933X		WOS:000386443500005

Porcine aortic root scaffolds were prepared by decellularization. After verifying that roots exhibited adequate hemodynamics in vitro, we seeded human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) within the interstitium of the cusps and subjected the valves to in vitro pulsatile bioreactor testing in pulmonary pressures and flow conditions. As controls we incubated cell-seeded valves in a rotator device which allowed fluid to flow through the valves ensuring gas and nutrient exchange without subjecting the cusps to significant stress. After 24 days of conditioning, valves were analyzed for cell phenotype using immunohistochemistry for vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle cell actin (SMA) and prolyl-hydroxylase (PHA). Fresh native valves were used as immunohistochemistry controls. Analysis of bioreactor-conditioned valves showed that almost all seeded cells had died and large islands of cell debris were found within each cusp. Remnants of cells were positive for vimentin. Cell seeded controls, which were only rotated slowly to ensure gas and nutrient exchange, maintained about 50% of cells alive; these cells were positive for vimentin and negative for alpha-SMA and PHA, similar to native VICs. These results highlight for the first time the extreme vulnerability of hADSCs to valve-specific mechanical forces and also suggest that careful, progressive mechanical adaptation to valve-specific forces might encourage stem cell differentiation towards the VIC phenotype.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1738-2696			WOS:000386602400007

Stability of Spatial Distributions of Stink Bugs, Boll Injury, and NDVI in Cotton								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				45	5			1243	1254		10.1093/ee/nvw084			OCT 2016	2016	A 3-yr study was conducted to determine the degree of aggregation of stink bugs and boll injury in cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., and their spatial association with a multispectral vegetation index (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]). Using the spatial analysis by distance indices analyses, stink bugs were less frequently aggregated (17% for adults and 4% for nymphs) than boll injury (36%). NDVI values were also significantly aggregated within fields in 19 of 48 analyses (40%), with the majority of significant indices occurring in July and August. Paired NDVI datasets from different sampling dates were frequently associated (86.5% for weekly intervals among datasets). Spatial distributions of both stink bugs and boll injury were less stable than for NDVI, with positive associations varying from 12.5 to 25% for adult stink bugs for weekly intervals, depending on species. Spatial distributions of boll injury from stink bug feeding were more stable than stink bugs, with 46% positive associations among paired datasets with weekly intervals. NDVI values were positively associated with boll injury from stink bug feeding in 11 out of 22 analyses, with no significant negative associations. This indicates that NDVI has potential as a component of site-specific management. Future work should continue to examine the value of remote sensing for insect management in cotton, with an aim to develop tools such as risk assessment maps that will help growers to reduce insecticide inputs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000386053100019	27436843

Assessment of a Cross-Vane Trap as a Tool for Sampling the Invasive Megacopta cribraria (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) in Soybean with Associated Evaluations of Female Reproductive Status								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				45	5			1262	1270		10.1093/ee/nvw113			OCT 2016	2016	Megacopta cribraria (F.) (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) is an established pest of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, in the southeastern United States. Populations of this pest in soybean are typically estimated using sweep nets, a time-consuming procedure. Cross-vane traps may provide an alternative to using sweep nets. The relationship between trap and sweep-net sampling, and the effect of distance from field edges on M. cribraria densities were studied in 2013 and 2014. Adults were detected in the traps up to 3 wk before they were present in the sweep-net samples. Adults and nymphs collected from trap and sweep-net sampling decreased from the field edge toward the field interior. Across all dates and distances, there was a strong positive association between the two sampling methods (r = 0.60), but only 36% of location analyses by week showed significant association. Females collected using both sampling methods were dissected and rated based on egg development. Female populations of all reproductive maturities dispersed into soybean, but proportions varied with sampling method. Results provide a foundation for work into understanding dispersal cues, with implications for management in soybean. Cross-vane traps may serve as an early-season tool to monitor populations, but more studies are needed before robust sampling recommendations can be defined.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000386053100021	27550166

Dynamics in entangled polyethylene melts								EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS				225	8-9			1707	1722		10.1140/epjst/e2016-60142-7			OCT 2016	2016	Polymer dynamics creates distinctive viscoelastic behavior as a result of a coupled interplay of motion at the atomic length scale and motion of the entire macromolecule. Capturing the broad time and length scales of polymeric motion however, remains a challenge. Using linear polyethylene as a model system, we probe the effects of the degree of coarse graining on polymer dynamics. Coarse-grained (CG) potentials are derived using iterative Boltzmann inversion with. methylene groups per CG bead (denoted CG.) with lambda = 2, 3,4 and 6 from a fully-atomistic polyethylene melt simulation. By rescaling time in the CG models by a factor a, the chain mobility for the atomistic and CG models match. We show that independent of the degree of coarse graining, all measured static and dynamic properties are essentially the same once the dynamic scaling factor a and a non-crossing constraint for the CG6 model are included. The speedup of the CG4 model is about 3 times that of the CG3 model and is comparable to that of the CG6 model. Using these CG models we were able to reach times of over 500 mu s, allowing us to measure a number of quantities, including the stress relaxation function, plateau modulus and shear viscosity, and compare directly to experiment.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1951-6355	1951-6401		WOS:000386267000024

Flowing water affects fish fast-starts: escape performance of the Hawaiian stream goby, Sicyopterus stimpsoni								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				219	19			3100	3105		10.1242/jeb.137554			OCT 1 2016	2016	Experimental measurements of escape performance in fishes have typically been conducted in still water; however, many fishes inhabit environments with flow that could impact escape behavior. We examined the influences of flow and predator attack direction on the escape behavior of fish, using juveniles of the amphidromous Hawaiian goby Sicyopterus stimpsoni. In nature, these fish must escape ambush predation while moving through streams with high-velocity flow. We measured the escape performance of juvenile gobies while exposing them to a range of water velocities encountered in natural streams and stimulating fish from three different directions. Frequency of response across treatments indicated strong effects of flow conditions and attack direction. Juvenile S. stimpsoni had uniformly high response rates for attacks from a caudal direction (opposite flow); however, response rates for attacks from a cranial direction (matching flow) decreased dramatically as flow speed increased. Mechanical stimuli produced by predators attacking in the same direction as flow might be masked by the flow environment, impairing the ability of prey to detect attacks. Thus, the likelihood of successful escape performance in fishes can depend critically on environmental context.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000385956100022	27471278

For incompressible isothermal and non-isothermal Stokes equations and Navier-Stokes equations, we develop the associated sensitivity equations for changes in the grad-div parameter. Finite element schemes are devised for computing solutions to the sensitivity systems, analyzed for stability and accuracy, and finally tested on several benchmark problems. Our results reveal that solutions are most sensitive for small values of the parameter, near obstacles and corners, when the pressure is large, and when the viscosity is small.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1570-2820	1569-3953		WOS:000386273100004

Electronic structure of hydrothermally synthesized single crystal U0.22Th0.78O2								PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS				253	10			1970	1976		10.1002/pssb.201600277			OCT 2016	2016	Single crystals of ThO2, UO2, and their solid solutions, UxTh1-xO2, have been obtained through various hydrothermal growth conditions. This technique offers the better of two other growth processes: (i) single crystal purity as by photochemical growth of nanocrystals; and (ii) large/bulk sizes as obtained by the arc melt method. The band gap of the UxTh1-xO2 single crystal solid solution, along with the luminescence transition, have been characterized. The occupied and unoccupied structures are determined using ultraviolet and inverse photoemission spectroscopy and the electronic band gap was measured to be 3-4eV. The strain of incorporating U into the ThO2 is analyzed through Vegard's law. In this crystal there are defect and impurity sites, likely arising from the kinetic growth process, giving rise to a similar yet slightly different optical gap evident with cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. There is a major luminescence feature spanning the range from 3.18 to 4.96eV (250-390nm) with a maximum at 4.09eV (303nm), corresponding with the measured electronic band gap. In this paper, the electronic properties of a solid solution U0.22Th0.78O2 are measured and interpreted compared to the pure actinide oxides, ThO2 and UO2. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Relationships of eggshell, air cell, and cloacal temperatures of embryonated broiler hatching eggs during incubation(1,2)								POULTRY SCIENCE				95	10			2306	2313		10.3382/ps/pew230			OCT 2016	2016	The relationships of eggshell, air cell, and embryo cloacal temperatures in Ross x Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs were determined. Twenty eggs were weighed and set on each of 3 tray levels of a single incubator. Eggshell temperature (EST) of the eggs were recorded once in the morning (AM) and afternoon (PM) between 0 and 19 d of incubation (DOI) using an infrared thermometer (IRT). All eggs were candled and a transponder was implanted in the air cell of eggs containing live embryos (12 per tray level) at 12 DOI. At 19 DOI, transponders were implanted in the cloaca of live embryos from those same eggs. Air cell temperature (ACT) and EST readings were recorded once in the AM and PM between 12 and 19 DOI, and ACT and cloaca temperature (CLT) readings were recorded every 6 h between 19 and 21 DOI. The EST and ACT readings between 13 and 19 DOI were positively correlated. However, their respective mean temperatures between 13 and 19 DOI differed. The EST and ACT were not significantly influenced by tray level. Nevertheless, a main effect due to location (eggshell vs. air cell), and an interaction between DOI and time of day (AM and PM) in the 13 to 19 DOI interval were observed. Furthermore, an interaction was observed between location (air cell and cloaca) and the 6 h sequential time periods in the 19 to 21 DOI interval. However, across the entire 19 to 21 DOI interval, mean ACT and CLT were not significantly different, and were positively correlated. These data suggest that ACT readings are higher than those of EST during the last half of incubation, and that between 13 and 19 DOI, ACT readings may have the potential for use as a minimally invasive method by which to more accurately estimate the true core body temperature of broiler embryos. The effects of this method on hatchability and post-hatch performance need determination to better establish its practicality.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000386205600011	27433009

Peach skin powder inhibits oxidation in cooked turkey meat								POULTRY SCIENCE				95	10			2435	2440		10.3382/ps/pew139			OCT 2016	2016	The objective of this study was to measure the antioxidant activity of peach skin and test the antioxidant effect of peach skin powder on cooked ground turkey meat during 12 d of refrigerated storage. Antioxidant activity of 3 cultivars of peaches grown in South Carolina was first evaluated by 3 antioxidant assays. The peach variety O'Henry showed the greatest antioxidant effect and therefore was used for further study. Two levels of peach skin powder (0.5%, 1%) and 0.01% butylated hydroxylanisole (BHA) were applied to ground turkey meat. Oxidation of cooked turkey meat was measured by detection of hexanal using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results indicated that all levels of peach skin powder used in this study had an antioxidant effect on ground turkey with a greater effect at the higher concentration. O'Henry peach skin powder was as effective as BHA in preventing oxidation at the levels tested.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000386205600027	27252372

Multiparametric optimization for multidisciplinary engineering design								STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION				54	4			795	810		10.1007/s00158-016-1437-y			OCT 2016	2016	The area of Multiparametric Optimization (MPO) solves problems that contain unknown problem data represented by parameters. The solutions map parameter values to optimal design and objective function values. In this paper, for the first time, MPO techniques are applied to improve and advance Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) to solve engineering problems with parameters. A multiparametric subgradient algorithm is proposed and applied to two MDO methods: Analytical Target Cascading (ATC) and Network Target Coordination (NTC). Numerical results on test problems show the proposed parametric ATC and NTC methods effectively solve parametric MDO problems and provide useful insights to designers. In addition, a novel Two-Stage ATC method is proposed to solve nonparametric MDO problems. In this new approach elements of the subproblems are treated as parameters and optimal design functions are constructed for each one. When the ATC loop is engaged, steps involving the lengthy optimization of subproblems are replaced with simple function evaluations.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1615-147X	1615-1488		WOS:000386356700006

PANCHROMATIC IMAGING OF A TRANSITIONAL DISK: THE DISK OF GM AUR IN OPTICAL AND FUV SCATTERED LIGHT								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				829	2					65	10.3847/0004-637X/829/2/65			OCT 1 2016	2016	We have imaged GM Aurigae with the Hubble Space Telescope, detected its disk in scattered light at 1400 and 1650 angstrom, and compared these with observations at 3300 angstrom, 5550 angstrom, 1.1 mu m, and 1.6 mu m. The scattered light increases at shorter wavelengths. The radial surface brightness profile at 3300 angstrom shows no evidence of the 24 au radius cavity that has been previously observed in submillimeter observations. Comparison with dust grain opacity models indicates that. the surface of the entire disk is populated with submicron grains. We have compiled a. spectral energy distribution from 0.1 mu m to 1 mm. and used it to constrain a model of the star + disk system that includes the submillimeter cavity using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code by Barbara Whitney. The best-fit model image indicates that the cavity should be detectable in the F330W bandpass if the cavity has been cleared of both large and small dust grains, but we do not detect it. The lack of an observed cavity can be explained by the presence of submicron grains interior to the submillimeter cavity wall. We suggest one explanation for this that. could be due to a planet of mass <9 M-J interior to 24 au. A unique cylindrical structure is detected in the far-UV data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys/ Solar Blind Channel. It is aligned along the system semiminor axis, but does not resemble an accretion-driven jet. The structure is limb. brightened and extends 190 +/- 35 au above the disk midplane. The inner radius of the limb. brightening is 40 +/- 10 au, just beyond the submillimeter cavity wall.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000385377200007

Setting: University'research laboratory.Participants: People with chronic stroke were included in the study if they: had sustained a fall or had fear of falling, were able to stand, and hand impaired balance and were at risk for falls (<= 46 on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS)).Interventions: Individuals completed an 8 week intervention that included 16 sessions of both yoga and group occupational therapy (OT). Yoga included physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation. OT focused on post-stroke fall risk factor management.Main outcome measures: The BBS was used to assess balance, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) was used to measure balance self-efficacy. Five fall risk factor management scales were used.Results: Overall, the intervention was considered feasible, as individuals were able to safely complete the intervention with little attrition and high attendance. Balance improved by 30% (p = 0.002). Balance self-efficacy improved by 15% (p = 0.034). Each of the five fall risk factor management scales improved, but only two significantly improved (Fall Prevention and Management Questionnaire, 29%, p =0.004 and Fall Prevention Strategy Survey, 42%, p = 0.032). Conclusion: The results demonstrate that MY-OT is a potential intervention to improve multiple fall related outcomes for people with stroke. Therapists may consider these interventions for people with stroke, but additional research is warranted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the effects of gender, age, intellectual abilities and/or behaviour regulation difficulties on the likelihood that a child with WS would be diagnosed with SP.Methods A total of 194 6-17 year-olds with WS were evaluated. To best characterise the relations between the predictors and the probability of a SP diagnosis, we explored not only possible linear effects but also curvilinear effects.Results No gender differences were detected. As age increased, the likelihood of receiving a SP diagnosis decreased. As IQ increased, the probability of receiving a SP diagnosis also decreased. Behaviour regulation difficulties were the strongest predictor of a positive diagnosis. A quadratic relation was detected: The probability of receiving a SP diagnosis gradually rose as behaviour regulation difficulties increased. However, once behaviour regulation difficulties approached the clinical range, the probability of receiving a SP diagnosis asymptoted at a high level.Conclusion Children with behaviour regulation difficulties in or just below the clinical range were at the greatest risk of developing SP. These findings highlight the value of large samples and the importance of evaluating for nonlinear effects to provide accurate model specification when characterising relations among a dependent variable and possible predictors.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0964-2633	1365-2788		WOS:000385737600012	27545817

Understanding the effect of porosity on thermal properties of yttria-stabilized zirconia using molecular dynamics								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS				222				88	93		10.1016/j.molliq.2016.07.018			OCT 2016	2016	Thermal properties of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Several YSZ samples were designed to elucidate the effect of porosity on thermal conductivity of the designed YSZ systems. Mean square displacement (MSD), vibrational density of state (VDOS) and atomic movement in designed YSZ and other samples were also investigated. Results of MD simulation indicated the key role of pores in preventing thermal transport behavior. For same volume of a single pore, samples with larger pore volume showed smaller thermal conductivity (K), while for same amount of total porosity, samples with small-sized pores displayed a smaller thermal conductivity. The latter was due to the presence of relatively larger number of smaller-sized pores as compared to larger-sized ones. Samples with smaller-sized pores in greater numbers also exhibited lower vibration frequency and lower amplitude of single atoms, suggesting smaller thermal conductivity (K) values. For constant pore volume, YSZ samples were observed to have a decrease in thermal conductivity with increasing number of pores. Among YSZ samples with same levels of porosity, those with smaller pores displayed smaller thermal conductivity. Similar levels of thermal conductivity could be acquired in samples with smaller pore amounts and/or smaller porosity as compared to those with larger pores.

The tool scoring and medical record review were in retrospect of the hospital admission.Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 70 patients with primary diagnosis of HF who were readmitted at least one time during fiscal year 2012. The RRAT score was calculated on index admission. Patients with high risk scores were assessed for palliative care consult.Results: Forty-nine of the 70 patients scored high risk for readmission at their index admission. The other 21 patients scored moderate risk at the index admission but subsequently scored high risk on their second admission. A total of 35 patients received palliative care consults. Only 10 of those patients received palliative care consults on the index admission.Conclusion: Many healthcare providers are unsure when to consult nonhospice palliative care (NHPC) teams for patients with chronic diseases. The findings of this study are important, as they suggest an RRAT can assist with identifying patients with HF in need of NHPC consults.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1096-6218	1557-7740		WOS:000385376500016

Bacterial-fungal communities were enriched from switchgrass bales to deconstruct ammonia-pretreated switchgrass (DSG). Correlation analysis was carried out to elucidate the relationship between microbial decomposition of DSG by these communities, enzymatic activities produced and enzymatic saccharification of DSG using these enzyme mixtures. Results of the analysis showed that beta-glucosidase and xylosidase activities limited the extent of microbial deconstruction and enzymatic saccharification of DSG. The results also underlined the importance of ligninase activity for the enzymatic saccharification of pretreated lignocellulosic feedstock. The bacterial-fungal communities developed in this research can be used to produce enzyme mixtures to deconstruct DSG, and the results from the correlation analysis can be used to optimize these enzyme mixtures for efficient saccharification of DSG to produce second-generation biofuels.

The method combines a linear treatment of the advection term, together with stabilization terms that are proportional to discrete curvature of the solutions in both velocity and pressure. We rigorously prove that the entire new family of methods are unconditionally stable and O(Delta t(2)) accurate. The idea of 'curvature stabilization' is new to CFD and is intended as an improvement over the commonly used 'speed stabilization', which is only first order accurate in time and can have an adverse effect on important flow quantities such as drag coefficients. Numerical examples verify the predicted convergence rate and show the stabilization term clearly improves the stability and accuracy of the tested flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison between Human and Bite-Based Methods of Estimating Caloric Intake								JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS				116	10			1568	1577		10.1016/j.jand.2016.03.007			OCT 2016	2016	Background Current methods of self-monitoring kilocalorie intake outside of laboratory/clinical settings suffer from a systematic underreporting bias. Recent efforts to make kilocalorie information available have improved these methods somewhat, but it may be possible to derive an objective and more accurate measure of kilocalorie intake from bite count.Objective This study sought to develop and examine the accuracy of an individualized bite-based measure of kilocalorie intake and to compare that measure to participant estimates of kilocalorie intake. It was hypothesized that kilocalorie information would improve human estimates of kilocalorie intake over those with no information, but a bite-based estimate of kilocalorie intake would still outperform human estimates.Participants/settings Two-hundred eighty participants were allowed to eat ad libitum in a cafeteria setting. Their bite count and kilocalorie intake were measured. After completion of the meal, participants estimated how many kilocalories they consumed, some with the aid of a menu containing kilocalorie information and some without. Using a train and test method for predictive model development, participants were randomly divided into one of two groups: one for model development (training group) and one for model validation (test group).Statistical analysis Multiple regression was used to determine whether height, weight, age,. sex, and waist-to-hip ratio could predict an individual's mean kilocalories per bite for the training sample. The model was then validated with the test group, and the model-predicted kilocalorie intake was compared with human-estimated kilocalorie intake.Results Only age and sex significantly predicted mean kilocalories per bite, but all variables were retained for the test group. The bite-based measure of kilocalorie intake outperformed human estimates with and without kilocalorie information.Conclusions Bite count might serve as an easily measured, objective proxy for kilocalorie intake. A tool that can monitor bite count may be a powerful assistant to Self-monitoring.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2212-2672	2212-2680		WOS:000385056600006	27085871

Development of a panel of unigene-derived polymorphic EST-SSR markers in lentil using public database information								CROP JOURNAL				4	5			425	433		10.1016/j.cj.2016.06.012			OCT 2016	2016	Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), a diploid (2n = 14) with a genome size greater than 4000 Mbp, is an important cool season food legume grown worldwide. The availability of genomic resources is limited in this crop species. The objective of this study was to develop polymorphic markers in lentil using publicly available curated expressed sequence tag information (ESTs). In this study, 9513 ESTs were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database to develop unigene-based simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The ESTs were assembled into 4053 unigenes and then analyzed to identify 374 SSRs using the MISA microsatellite identification tool. Among the 374 SSRs, 26 compound SSRs were observed. Primer pairs for these SSRs were designed using Primer3 version 1.14. To classify the functional annotation of ESTs and EST-SSRs, BLASTx searches (using E-value 1 x 10(-5)) against the public UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/) and NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlh.nih.gov/) databases were performed. Further functional annotation was performed using PLAZA (version 3.0) comparative genomics and GO annotation was summarized using the Plant GO slim category. Among the synthesized 312 primers, 219 successfully amplified Lens DNA. A diverse panel of 24 Lens genotypes was used to identify polymorphic markers. A polymorphic set of 57 markers successfully discriminated the test genotypes. This set of polymorphicmarkers with functional annotation data could be used as molecular tools in lentil breeding.

This paper investigates the effects of the protection system on the reliability performance of a microgrid integrated with weather-dependent microsources. It relies on a stochastic model to simulate the challenges existing in current protection schemes designed for microgrids. Abnormal operating conditions, including overcurrent, overvoltage, and undervoltage, which are detected by a deficient protection scheme, are analyzed by a defined fuzzy virtual setting value. Their contributions, along with the conventional random failure rate achieved by statistical results, are jointly used to evaluate the short-term outage rate of a feeder. A series of fuzzy reliability indices is further proposed for the short-term and periodical reliability of both microgrid system and customers. Subsequently, an evaluation strategy, combined with fuzzy simulation and load restoration, is presented as a solution tool. Simulations on a test system are provided to support the necessity of considering the effects of protection operation in evaluating microgrid reliability.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0885-8977	1937-4208		WOS:000384647900004

For the special case in which every entry of takes the same value for some integer the convex hull of the set of n-ary vectors results. Our facets generalize the known family of cover inequalities for the binary case. They allow for advances relative to both the modeling of integer variables using base-n expansions, and the solving of knapsack problems having weakly super-decreasing coefficients. Insight is gained by alternately constructing the convex hull representation in a higher-variable space using disjunctive programming arguments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-5001	1573-2916		WOS:000383654400008		
J	Feng, Lujia; Mears, Laine								Energy Consumption Modeling and Analyses in Automotive Manufacturing Plant								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				138	10	SI				101005	10.1115/1.4034302			OCT 2016	2016	Manufacturing plants energy consumption accounts for a large share in world energy usage. Energy consumption modeling and analyses are widely studied to understand how and where the energy is used inside of the plants. However, a systematic energy modeling approach is seldom studied to describe the holistic energy in the plants. Especially using layers of models to share information and guide the next step modeling is rarely studied. In this paper, a manufacturing system temporal and organizational framework was used to guide the systematic energy modeling approach. Various levels of models were established and tested in an automotive manufacturing plant to illustrate how the approach can be implemented. A detail paint spray booth air unit was described to demonstrate how to investigate the most sensitive variables in affecting energy consumption. While considering the current plant metering status, the proposed approach is advanced in information sharing and improvement suggestion determination.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1087-1357	1528-8935		WOS:000384576700007

The rating technique ranked damaged conditions based on a 0 to 3 rating. A total of 156 structures were analyzed using the rating technique. Unlike previously published condition ratings, the technique does not include functional assessments such as mechanical and electrical systems and does not directly consider habitant safety nor costs to structure. The intent of the rating is to provide a quantitative measure of the effects of Haiyan. The outcomes indicate that wind damage dominated as the major cause of failures (53%) and that roof damage is the most significant of the damage modes (21%). The rating gives a first-order assessment of the damaged conditions of the structures pertaining to the loading effects (wind, water or storm surge, or combined) from Super Typhoon Haiyan.

The new telechelomer was characterized by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), elemental analysis, and by F-19 and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The telechelomer and 4,4-bis(4-trifluorovinyloxy)biphenyl (BPVE) were thermally copolymerized via step-growth [2+2] cycloaddition at 160 degrees C. The polymerization afforded PEG enchained biphenyl perfluorocyclobutyl (BP-PFCB) copolymers that are solution processable and film forming. These copolymers were characterized by ATR-FTIR, F-19 NMR, and H-1 NMR. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) gave number-average molecular weight (M-n) ranging 11,000 to 12,000. Compatibilization of PEG and a commercial polymer BP-PFCB was achieved utilizing the new PEG BP-PFCB copolymer, 3-co2-4. It was found that 5wt% of 3-co2-4 was ideal to reduce interfacial tension by scanning electron microscope (SEM). In addition, phase homogeneity was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

Method 1 can predict the reliability index and the critical probabilistic slip surface directly and it is computational efficient, but it needs the development of new codes for integrating the reliability analysis code and the slope stability code. Method 2 makes the reliability analysis code call the slope stability analysis code directly, and each code can be considered as an intact part. The main result of Method 2 is the reliability index of soil slope. Combined with the proposed method for locating the critical slip surface, Method 2 can also predict the probabilistic slip surface. Although Method 2 needs much more callings of the subprogram of slope stability analysis code, it needs not the developing of new computer program. Thus, Method 2 is easy to use and can be applied to different reliability analysis methods and slope stability analysis methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0960-3182	1573-1529		WOS:000384332200002		
J	Liu, Guoxin; Shen, Haiying; Wang, Haoyu								Deadline Guaranteed Service for Multi-Tenant Cloud Storage								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				27	10			2851	2865		10.1109/TPDS.2015.2513054			OCT 1 2016	2016	It is imperative for cloud storage systems to be able to provide deadline guaranteed services according to service level agreements (SLAs) for online services. In spite of many previous works on deadline aware solutions, most of them focus on scheduling work flows or resource reservation in datacenter networks but neglect the server overload problem in cloud storage systems that prevents providing the deadline guaranteed services. In this paper, we introduce a new form of SLAs, which enables each tenant to specify a percentage of its requests it wishes to serve within a specified deadline. We first identify the multiple objectives (i.e., traffic and latency minimization, resource utilization maximization) in developing schemes to satisfy the SLAs. To satisfy the SLAs while achieving the multi-objectives, we propose a Parallel Deadline Guaranteed (PDG) scheme, which schedules data reallocation (through load reassignment and data replication) using a tree-based bottom-up parallel process. The observation from our model also motivates our deadline strictness clustered data allocation algorithm that maps tenants with the similar SLA strictness into the same server to enhance SLA guarantees. We further enhance PDG in supplying SLA guaranteed services through two algorithms: i) a prioritized data reallocation algorithm that deals with request arrival rate variation, and ii) an adaptive request retransmission algorithm that deals with SLA requirement variation. Our trace-driven experiments on a simulator and Amazon EC2 show the effectiveness of our schemes for guaranteeing the SLAs while achieving the multi-objectives.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000384239300006		
J	Smith, Kelly C.								Life is hard: countering definitional pessimism concerning the definition of life								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY				15	4			277	289		10.1017/S1473550416000021			OCT 2016	2016	Cleland and Chyba published a classic piece in 2002 that began a movement I call definitional pessimism, where it is argued that there is no point in attempting anything like a general definition of life. This paper offers a critical response to the pessimist position in general and the influential arguments offered by Cleland and her collaborators in particular. One such argument is that all definitions of life fall short of an ideal in which necessary and sufficient conditions produce unambiguous categorizations that dispose of all counterexamples. But this concept of definition is controversial within philosophy; a fact that greatly diminishes the force of the admonition that biologists should conform to such an ideal. Moreover, biology may well be fundamentally different from logic and the physical sciences from which this ideal is drawn, to the point where definitional conformity misrepresents biological reality. Another idea often pushed is that the prospects for definitional success concerning life are on a par with medieval alchemy's attempts to define matter - that is, doomed to fail for lack of a unifying scientific theory. But this comparison to alchemy is both historically inaccurate and unfair. Planetary science before the discovery of the first exoplanets offers a much better analogy, with much more optimistic conclusions. The pessimists also make much of the desirability of using microbes as models for any universal concept of life, from which they conclude that certain types of 'Darwinian' evolutionary definitions are inadequate. But this argument posits an unrealistic ideal, as no account of life can both be universal and do justice to the sorts of precise causal mechanisms microbes exemplify. The character of biology and the demand for universality in definitions of life thus probably accords better with functional rather than structural categories. The bottom line is that there is simply no viable alternative, either pragmatically or theoretically, to the pursuit of definitions. If nothing else, the empirical data the pessimists demand will be a very long time coming and scientists will of necessity continue to employ definitions of life in the interim. Chastising them for this will only drive their ideas underground where they can escape critical analysis, making the problems caused by problematic conceptions of life worse.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1473-5504	1475-3006		WOS:000384280300004		
J	Carpenter, Noel; Bausman, Dennis C.								Project Delivery Method Performance for Public School Construction: Design-Bid-Build versus CM at Risk								JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT				142	10					05016009	10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001155			OCT 2016	2016	The construction of public schools is a complex endeavor due to the involvement of multiple and diverse parties, funding and budgetary concerns, and statutory limitations imposed by local, state, and federal agencies, all of which serve to increase project risk. Project delivery methods using distinctive procedures to manage the design and construction process have been developed to reduce risk and improve project performance. To increase the probability of successful project outcomes, those responsible for public school construction require conclusive delivery method performance data. Completed in 2014, this two-year study used actual construction documents from 137 southeastern public schools to analyze and determine project delivery method cost, time, quality, and claims performance. The analysis indicated that performance of the Design-Bid-Build (DBB) method was significantly superior across all cost metrics, whereas the Construction Manager at Risk (CM at Risk) method produced higher levels of product and service quality. Essentially, public school administrators were paying a significant premium to obtain perceived improvements in both service and product quality. This research empowers decision-makers and benefits the public by providing evidence of the most efficient and effective means for the construction of new public schools.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0733-9364	1943-7862		WOS:000384309900005		
J	Dowling, Madeline E.; Hu, Meng-Jun; Schmitz, Linus T.; Wilson, Jennifer R.; Schnabel, Guido								Characterization of Botrytis cinerea Isolates from Strawberry with Reduced Sensitivity to Polyoxin D Zinc Salt								PLANT DISEASE				100	10			2057	2061		10.1094/PDIS-02-16-0166-RE			OCT 2016	2016	Polyoxin D is a Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) code 19 fungicide that was recently registered for gray mold control of strawberry in the United States. In this study, we determined the sensitivity to polyoxin D zinc salt (hereafter, polyoxin D) of Botrytis cinerea isolates from 41 commercial strawberry farms in South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, and Ohio and investigated the fitness of sensitive (S) and reduced sensitive (RS) isolates. Relative mycelial growth ranged between 0 and over 100% on malt extract agar amended with a discriminatory dose of polyoxin D at 5 mu g/ml. Isolates that grew more than 70% at that dose were designated RS and were found in three of the five states. The 50% effective dose (EC50) values of three S and three RS isolates ranged from 0.59 to 2.27 and 4.6 to 5.8 mu g/ml, respectively. The three RS isolates grew faster on detached tomato fruit treated with Ph-D WDG at recommended label dosage than S isolates (P < 0.008). In all, 25 randomly selected RS isolates exhibited reduced sporulation ability (P < 0.0001) and growth rate (P < 0.0001) but increased production of sclerotia (P < 0.0386) compared with 25 S isolates. Of 10 isolates tested per phenotype, the number of RS isolates producing sporulating lesions on apple, tomato, and strawberry was significantly lower compared with S isolates (P < 0.0001 for each fruit type). The results of this study indicate that resistance management is necessary for fungicides containing polyoxin D. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating reduced sensitivity to FRAC 19 fungicides in B. cinerea isolates from the United States.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000383640500012

In chronic pain conditions, this relationship is inverted. The precise mechanisms responsible for the inversion are unknown. Using a tonic pain protocol, we report findings closely resembling this inversion in healthy participants. Resting BP and state measures of anxiety and mood were assessed from 33 participants (21 female). Participants then immersed their dominant hand in painfully hot water (47 degrees C) for five trials of 1-min duration, with 30-s intertrial intervals. Throughout the trials, participants continually registered their pain. After a 35-min intermission, the trial sequence was repeated. A disassociation of the negative relationship of resting systolic BP (as per Trial 1) was found using hierarchical linear modeling (p<.001, R-2=.07). The disassociation unfolds over each consecutive trial, with an increasingly positive relationship. In Sequence 2, the initially negative relationship is almost completely absent. Furthermore, the association of BP and pain was found to be moderated by anxiety, such that only persons with low anxiety exhibited BP hypoalgesia. Our findings expand the existing literature by incorporating anxiety as a moderator of BP hypoalgesia. Furthermore, the protocol emulates the changing relationship between BP and pain observed in chronic pain patients. The protocol has potential as a model for chronic pain; however, future research should determine if similar physiological systems are involved. The finding holds potential diagnostic or prognostic relevance for certain clinical pain conditions, especially those involving dysfunction of the descending modulation of pain.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0048-5772	1469-8986		WOS:000384453200015	27424846

Design Optimization of Honeycomb Core Sandwich Panels for Maximum Sound Transmission Loss								JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				138	5					051005	10.1115/1.4033459			OCT 2016	2016	This study focuses on sound transmission frequency response through honeycomb core sandwich panels with in-plane orientation. Specifically, an optimization technique has been presented to determine the honeycomb unit cell geometric parameters that maximize the sound transmission loss (STL) through a sandwich panel, while maintaining constraints of constant mass and overall dimensions of panel length and height. The vibration characteristics and STL response of a sandwich panel are parameterized in terms of four honeycomb unit cell independent geometric parameters; two side lengths, cell wall thickness, and interior cell wall angle. With constraints of constant mass and overall dimensions, relationships are determined such that the number of independent variables needed to define the honeycomb cell and panel geometry is reduced to three; the integer number of unit cells in the longitudinal direction of the core, number of unit cells in the height direction, and interior cell wall angle. The optimization procedure is implemented by linking a structural acoustic finite-element (FE) model of the panel, with MODEFRONTIER, a general purpose optimization software. Optimum designs are obtained in representative frequency ranges within the resonance region of the STL response. Optimized honeycomb geometric solutions show at least 20% increase in STL response compared to standard hexagonal honeycomb core panels. It is found that the STL response is not only affected by the cell wall angle, but strongly depends also on the number of unit cells in the horizontal and vertical direction.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1048-9002	1528-8927		WOS:000383872200005

The current study details the development and validation of the Teacher Intentionality of Practice Scale (TIPS), an observational protocol designed to measure intentional teaching practices and provide support for teacher growth over time. Findings suggest that TIPS provides a valid and highly reliable research-based teacher observational instrument that also serves as a professional development model to help scaffold the growth and improvement of K-12 educators. This paper details the theoretical foundations of TIPS, reports reliability and validity measures (including both Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses), and discusses applications and implications of TIPS for teacher evaluation and professional development.

We find, however, women often describe fantasy sports as a male/masculine space in which they are highly visible and have their ability to compete like men questioned, largely because of gendered assumptions regarding sports knowledge. Women's attitudes and behaviors frequently reproduce traditional gender dynamics, although women also engage in behaviors and assert definitions of themselves that are potentially transformativeimplicitly and explicitly pushing the boundaries of what females are expected to be and accomplish in sport. Often, however, they simultaneously reproduce and resist men's dominance and women's marginalization, exercising (1) mediated agency by using men to improve their fantasy sports experience and play or (2) conflicted agency by reinforcing or accepting gender stereotypes about women while using those stereotypes to their advantage or positioning themselves as atypical women to whom the stereotypes do not apply.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0891-2432	1552-3977		WOS:000382969200005

Based on the monitored PAH concentrations in 188 topsoil (0-5 cm) samples in Shenzhen, the most rapidly developing city in China, in recent decades, we applied geographical demarcation to determine the occurrences, source apportionments, and spatial ecological risks of soil PAHs across five zones of varying urban densities. Mean concentrations of the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) priority PAHs (Sigma(16)PAHs) and the 7 carcinogenic PAHs (Sigma(7)CarPAHs) both followed the order: Zone D (60%-80% constructive land density (CLD)) > Zone E (80%-100% CLD) > Zone C (40%-60% CLD) > Zone B (20%-40% CLD) > Zone A (0%-20% CLD), suggesting that the highest PAH levels occurred in the suburban-urban center transitional zone (Zone D) rather than the urban center zone (Zone E) in Shenzhen. There were significant correlations of Sigma(16)PAHs to TOC and sampling altitude across all samples but not within highly-urbanized regions (Zones D and E), implying a considerable disturbance of urbanization to the soil PAH pool. Source apportionments suggested that soil PAHs of all zones were mainly derived from fossil fuel combustion, with Zone E showing the highest contribution from oil sources among different zones. Spatial ecological risk analysis showed that the contaminated area (467 km(2); 23.9% of total area; toxic equivalency quotients > 33 ng g(-1)) had a higher contribution from the highly-urbanized regions (Zones D and E) than the uncontaminated area (42.3% vs. 18.1%). Overall, our study highlighted a strong spatial relationship between urbanization and soil PAH pollution.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1002-0160	2210-5107		WOS:000383219200009

To characterize a chemical treatment method, both generated solvent based extract and pulp were examined. The generated pulps were evaluated through chemical composition and enzymatic saccharification. The enzyme mixtures were investigated including Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30 originated cellulase, T. reesei Rut C-30 originated cellulase with external added beta-glucosidase, Accellerase (R) 1500, and Cellic (R) CTec2. The physiochemical effects of chemical treatments on the structural-chemical properties of treated-bagasse were also analyzed at high substrate enzymatic saccharification. The substrate loadings (using both SAA-treated and EHOs-treated bagasse) of 125, 150, 175, 200, and 225 g L-1 were examined during enzymatic saccharification process. The generated phenolic compounds were characterized based on density, antioxidant activity, and anticancer activity. All findings are discussed in relation to developing a self-sustainable integrated biorefinery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given numerous studies support the positive effects of games on learning, a growing number of researchers are committed to developing educational games to promote students' 21st century skill development in schools. However, little is known regarding how games may influence student acquisition of 21st century skills. This paper examines the most recent literature in regard to game-based learning and identified 29 studies which targeted 21st century skills as outcomes. The range of game genres and game design elements as well as learning theories used in these studies are discussed, together with the range of indicators, measures and outcomes for impacts on 21st century skills. The findings suggest that a game-based learning approach might be effective in facilitating students' 21st century skill development. The paper also provides valuable insights for researchers, game designers, and educators in issues related to educational game design and implementation in general. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

How the media frame such information may enhance public understanding and enable appropriate responses by individuals and communities. This study follows up on previous research examining media portrayals of climate change in US newspapers from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2008. Here, we content analyze 270 news stories on climate change as a public health issue from five US newspapers between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012. Findings indicate that the total number of articles about climate change declined while emphasis on the public health dimension of climate change increased. The types of generic news frames (i.e., dramatic/substantive) most frequently used did not considerably change across the two time periods, however. To explain this, we discuss ways in which people may assess and spark change in news framing of public issues to better reach and influence a range of audiences.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1752-4032	1752-4040		WOS:000382584100004

Mutations in 10 genes have been implicated in human NM, but spontaneous cases in dogs have not been genetically characterized. We identified a novel recessive myopathy in a family of line-bred American bulldogs (ABDs); rod bodies in muscle biopsies established this as NM. Using SNP profiles from the nuclear family, we evaluated inheritance patterns at candidate loci and prioritized TNNT1 and NEB for further investigation. Whole exome sequencing of the dam, two affected littermates, and an unaffected littermate revealed a nonsense mutation in NEB (g.52734272 C > A, S8042X). Whole tissue gel electrophoresis and western blots confirmed a lack of full-length NEB in affected tissues, suggesting nonsense-mediated decay. The pathogenic variant was absent from 120 dogs of 24 other breeds and 100 unrelated ABDs, suggesting that it occurred recently and may be private to the family. This study presents the first molecularly characterized large animal model of NM, which could provide new opportunities for therapeutic approaches.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0938-8990	1432-1777		WOS:000382400300005	27215641

A new generation of succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) was developed recently. The inhibitory activity of the five SDHI fungicides against Colletotrichum species was determined in this study.RESULTSIsolates of C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. cereale and C. orbiculare were insensitive (naturally resistant) to boscalid, fluxapyroxad and fluopyram on YBA agar medium. In contrast, these isolates were relatively sensitive to penthiopyrad, except for C. orbiculare. Most interestingly, benzovindiflupyr showed highest inhibitory activity against all of these four species. Benzovindiflupyr was effective against C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum on apple and peach fruit, as well as on cucumber plants inoculated with C. orbiculare. The sdhB, sdhC and sdhD genes encoding the subunits of fungicide-targeted succinate dehydrogenase were sequenced, but, despite high polymorphisms, no apparent resistance mutations were found in Colletotrichum species.CONCLUSIONSThis is the first report on the activity of benzovindiflupyr against Colletotrichum species. The broad-spectrum efficacy of benzovindiflupyr within the Colletotrichum genus might be exploited when designing disease management strategies against various pathogens on a wide range of crops. Other mechanism(s) than fungicide target-site modification may be responsible for differential sensitivity of Colletotrichum species to SDHI fungicides.

Frankliniella fusca resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides: an emerging challenge for cotton pest management in the eastern United States								PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				72	10			1934	1945		10.1002/ps.4232			OCT 2016	2016	BACKGROUNDOver the past two decades, neonicotinoid seed treatments have become the primary method to manage tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca Hinds, on seedling cotton. Because this insect is highly polyphagous and the window of insecticide exposure is short, neonicotinoid resistance was expected to pose a minimal risk. However, reports of higher than expected F. fusca seedling damage in seed-treated cotton fields throughout the Mid-South and Southeast US production regions suggested neonicotinoid resistance had developed. To document this change, F. fusca populations from 86 different locations in the eastern United States were assayed in 2014 and 2015 for imidacloprid and thiamethoxam resistance to determine the extent of the issue in the region.RESULTSApproximately 57 and 65% of the F. fusca populations surveyed had reduced imidacloprid and thiamethoxam sensitivity respectively. Survivorship in diagnostic bioassays was significantly different at both the state and regional scales. Multiple-dose bioassays conducted on 37 of the populations documented up to 55- and 39-fold resistance ratios for imidacloprid and thiamethoxam respectively.CONCLUSIONEstimates of neonicotinoid resistance indicate an emerging issue for management of F. fusca in the eastern United States. Significant variation in survivorship within states and regions indicated that finer-scale surveys were needed to determine factors (genetic, insecticide use) driving resistance evolution.

The overall objective of this study was to determine the influence of concentrations of N (as ammonia) and P (as phosphate), and DO, as well as pH and temperatures on degradation of a commercial NA in bench-scale reactors. Commercial NAs provided replicable compounds necessary to compare influences of environmental conditions on degradation. NAs were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography. Microbial diversity and relative abundance were measured in treatments as explanatory parameters for potential effects of environmental conditions on microbial populations to support analytically measured NA degradation. Environmental conditions that positively influenced degradation rates of Fluka NAs included nutrients (C:N 10:1-500:1, C:P 100:1-5000:1), DO (4.76-8.43 mg L-1), pH (6-8), and temperature (5-25 degrees C). Approximately 50% removal of 61 +/- 8 mg L-1 was achieved in less than 2 d after NA introduction, achieving the method detection limit (5 mg L-1) by day 6 of the experiment in treatments with a C:N:P ratio of 100:10:1, DO > 8 mg L-1, pH-8-9, and temperatures >23 degrees C. Microbial diversity was lowest in lower temperature treatments (6-16 degrees C), which may have resulted in observed slower NA degradation. Based on results from this study, when macro-and micronutrients were available, DO, pH, and temperature (within environmentally relevant ranges) influenced rates of aerobic degradation of Fluka NAs. This study could serve as a model for systematically evaluating environmental factors that influence NA degradation in field scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Diverse non-fishing trip attributes including onboard amenities, onshore activities, quality of captain and crew, onboard nature-based tourism, onboard culture-based tourism and interpretation and education services were tested. Sampling of saltwater, recreational fishing, license owners and coastal tourists in 2013 produced 544 surveys (anglers = 277, non-anglers = 267). Study results showed that both groups placed importance on Quality of Captain and Crew, Onboard Amenities and Boat Fee. Only non-anglers placed importance on Onboard Nature-based Tourism. The marginal willingness to pay of Quality of Captain and Crew (high level) was $115 for anglers and $69 for non-anglers and of Onboard Amenities (high level) was $41 for anglers and $63 for non-anglers.

J	Geer, Tyler D.; Kinley, Ciera M.; Iwinski, Kyla J.; Calomeni, Alyssa J.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								Comparative toxicity of sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate to freshwater organisms								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				132				202	211		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.05.037			OCT 2016	2016	Sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate (SCP) is a granular algaecide containing H2O2 as an active ingredient to control growth of noxious algae. Measurements of sensitivities of target and non-target species to hydrogen peroxide are necessary for water resource managers to make informed decisions and minimize risks for non-target species when treating noxious algae. The objective of this study was to measure and compare responses among a target noxious alga (cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa) and non-target organisms including a eukaryotic alga (chlorophyte Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata), microcrustacean (Ceriodaphnia dubia), benthic amphipod (Hyalella azteca), and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) to exposures of hydrogen peroxide as SCR Hydrogen peroxide exposures were confirmed using the I-3 - method. SCP margins of safety for these organisms were compared with published toxicity data to provide context for other commonly used algaecides and herbicides (e.g. copper formulations, endothall, and diquat dibromide). Algal responses (cell density and chlorophyll a concentrations) and animal mortality were measured after 96 h aqueous exposures to SCP in laboratory-formulated water to estimate EC50 and LC50 values, as well as potency slopes. Despite a shorter test duration, M. aeruginosa was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide as SCP (96 h EC50:0.9-1.0 mg L-1 H2O2) than the eukaryotic alga P. subcapitata (7-d EC50:5.2-9.2 mg L-1 H2O2), indicating potential for selective control of prokaryotic algae. For the three non-target animals evaluated, measured 96-h LC50 values ranged from 1.0 to 19.7 mg L-1 H2O2. C dubia was the most sensitive species, and the least sensitive species was P. promelas, which is not likely to be affected by concentrations of hydrogen peroxide as SCP that would be used to control noxious algae (e.g. M. aeruginosa). Based on information from peer-reviewed literature, other algaecides could be similarly selective for cyanobacteria. Of the algaecides compared, SCP can selectively mitigate risks associated with noxious cyanobacterial growths (e.g. M. aeruginosa), with an enhanced margin of safety for non-target species (e.g. P. promelas).

Double Roman domination								DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS				211				23	29		10.1016/j.dam.2016.03.017			OCT 1 2016	2016	For a graph G = (V, E), a double Roman dominating function is a function f : V -> {0, 1, 2, 3} having the property that if f (v) = 0, then vertex v must have at least two neighbors assigned 2 under f or one neighbor with f (w) = 3, and if f (v) = 1, then vertex v must have at least one neighbor with f (w) >= 2. The weight of a double Roman dominating function f is the sum f (V) = Sigma(v is an element of V) f(v), and the minimum weight of a double Roman dominating function on G is the double Roman domination number of G. We initiate the study of double Roman domination and show its relationship to both domination and Roman domination. Finally, we present an upper bound on the double Roman domination number of a connected graph G in terms of the order of G and characterize the graphs attaining this bound. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A modified Z-source breaker design is introduced for the operation at medium-voltage dc with future applications in naval ship power systems. Compared to existing designs, the respective design will allow for greater control of step changes in load. This new design also limits capacitor current in the circuit and can be easily modified for fault detection. Analysis of the breaker operation is presented during both the fault and step changes in load. Low-voltage laboratory validation of the breaker was carried out on two different versions of the proposed circuit.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0885-8993	1941-0107		WOS:000379955000055		
J	Xiao, Junhua; Gong, Wenping; Martin, James R., II; Shen, Menfeng; Luo, Zhe								Probabilistic seismic stability analysis of slope at a given site in a specified exposure time								ENGINEERING GEOLOGY				212				53	62		10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.08.001			SEP 30 2016	2016	This paper presents a probabilistic approach for seismic stability analysis of a slope at a given site in a specified exposure time. For a probabilistic seismic stability analysis, the ground motion parameter, in terms of the peak ground acceleration (PGA), at a given site in a specified exposure time of interest (say, 30 years) is treated as a random variable, and the PGA distribution at the given site is derived based on the USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps data. Further, the spatial variability of the soil property is simulated herein by a random field, and the fluctuation of the groundwater level is simulated by a random variable. Within the probabilistic framework, a deterministic model for evaluating the slope stability is required; here, a pseudo-static analysis is adopted and implemented through 2D finite difference program FLAC version 7.0. In the face of the uncertainties in the input parameters, the performance or safety of the slope is expressed as a failure probability; within the proposed probabilistic analysis framework, a recently developed sampling method is adopted for the uncertainties propagation through the deterministic solution model. This probabilistic analysis framework is demonstrated with an illustrative example of a two-layer earth slope. Finally, a parametric study is undertaken to investigate how the failure probability of the slope (at a given site in a specified exposure time) is affected by the uncertain factors such as the earthquake-induced ground motion and the spatial variability of soil property. The study results demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed framework for probabilistic seismic stability analysis of slope at a given site in a specified exposure time.

We show that for many operations T of this kind, a surprisingly large family of functions f on S (including the function that sends 71 to the number of blocks of pi) exhibits the homomesy phenomenon: the average of f over the elements of a T-orbit is the same for all T-orbits. We can apply our method of proof more broadly to toggle operations back on the collection of independent sets of certain graphs. We utilize this generalization to prove a theorem about toggling on a family of graphs called "2-cliquish." More generally, the philosophy of this "toggle-action," proposed by Striker, is a popular topic of current and future research in dynamic algebraic combinatorics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1077-8926			WOS:000385229100004

Dissipative particle dynamics simulations indicate that miktoarm star copolymers localize at the interface between the incompatible solvents and act as molecular bridging agents between the respective gel layers. Miktoarm stars composed of poly (n-butyl acrylate)-co-poly ((oligo (ethylene glycol) methacrylate) were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and successfully used as an interfacial compatibilizer/linker in mechanically interconnected bilayer stacks comprised of a primary layer of cross-linked hydrophobic n-butyl methacrylate polymerized in toluene and of a secondary layer of cross linked hydrophilic 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate polymerized in water. Without the miktoarm stars, no connection between the two layers could be obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0032-3861	1873-2291		WOS:000384784800044

We simulate individuals' life course and calibrate CHD trends to observed trends in the past. Using the Health Forecasting Community Health Simulation Model, we simulate CHD prevalence and CHD mortality in 2 CHD prevention scenarios: (1) "comprehensive hypertension intervention" and (2) "gradual reduction of the average adult body mass index back to the year 2000 level." We use microsimulation methodology so that nonprofit hospitals can easily use our model to forecast intervention results in their specific hospital catchment area. Our baseline model (without intervention) forecasts an increase in CHD prevalence that will reach 13.01% among those 45+ in Los Angeles County in 2030. Under scenario 1, the increase in CHD prevalence is slower (12.47% in 2030), and the prevalence in scenario 2 reaches 12.83% in 2030. The baseline scenario projects a number of 21 300 CHD deaths in 2030, whereas there will be 20 070 CHD deaths under scenario 1 and 20 970 CHD deaths under scenario 2. At the population level, the CHD mortality outcome, as compared with the metric of CHD prevalence, might be more sensitive to preventive lifestyle interventions. Both CHD prevalence and CHD mortality might be more sensitive to the hypertension intervention than to the obesity reduction in the time horizon of 20 years.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0046-9580	1945-7243		WOS:000384364200001

Escape to Ferality: The Endoferal Origin of Weedy Rice from Crop Rice through De-Domestication								PLOS ONE				11	9					e0162676	10.1371/journal.pone.0162676			SEP 23 2016	2016	Domestication is the hallmark of evolution and civilization and harnesses biodiversity through selection for specific traits. In regions where domesticated lines are grown near wild relatives, congeneric sources of aggressive weedy genotypes cause major economic losses. Thus, the origins of weedy genotypes where no congeneric species occur raise questions regarding management effectiveness and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for weedy population success. Since eradication in the 1970s, California growers avoided weedy rice through continuous flood culture and zero-tolerance guidelines, preventing the import, presence, and movement of weedy seeds. In 2003, after decades of no reported presence in California, a weedy rice population was confirmed in dry-seeded fields. Our objectives were to identify the origins and establishment of this population and pinpoint possible phenotypes involved. We show that California weedy rice is derived from a different genetic source among a broad range of AA genome Oryzas and is most recently diverged from O. sativa temperate japonica cultivated in California. In contrast, other weedy rice eco-types in North America (Southern US) originate from weedy genotypes from China near wild Oryza, and are derived through existing crop-wild relative crosses. Analyses of morphological data show that California weedy rice subgroups have phenotypes like medium-grain or gourmet cultivars, but have colored pericarp, seed shattering, and awns like wild relatives, suggesting that reversion to non-domestic or wild-like traits can occur following domestication, despite apparent fixation of domestication alleles. Additionally, these results indicate that preventive methods focused on incoming weed sources through contamination may miss burgeoning weedy genotypes that rapidly adapt, establish, and proliferate. Investigating the common and unique evolutionary mechanisms underlying global weed origins and subsequent interactions with crop relatives sheds light on how weeds evolve and addresses broader questions regarding the stability of selection during domestication and crop improvement.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000383893500009	27661982

Yet, little has been known about how leaf shape affects the morphological response of trees to wind load. We studied eight Quercus species, with different leaf shapes, to determine the morphological response to simulated wind load. Quercus trees with long elliptical leaves, were significantly affected by wind load (P<0.05), as indicted by smaller specific leaf area (SLA), stem base diameter and stem height under windy conditions when compared to the control. The Quercus trees with leaves characterized by lanceolate or sinuous edges, showed positive morphological responses to wind load, such as bigger leaf thickness, larger stem diameter, allocation to root biomass, and smaller stem height (P<0.05). These morphological responses to wind can reduce drag and increase the mechanical strength of the tree. Leaf dissection index (LDI), an important index of leaf shape, was correlated with morphological response to wind load (P<0.05), including differences in SLA, in stem base diameter and in allocation to root biomass. These results suggest that trees with higher LDI, such as those with more and/or deeper lobes, are better adapted to wind load.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000383893500049	27662594

The resulting shape change in turn induces a red-shift in the localized surface plasmon resonance scattering spectrum and exposes new surface area. The flattened particles were characterized by optical and electron microscopy, single-nanoparticle scattering spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy images show that the AgNPs deform into discs; increasing the applied load from 0 to 100 N increases the AgNP diameter and decreases the height. This deformation caused a dramatic red shift in the nanoparticle scattering spectrum and also generated new surface area to which thiolated molecules could attach, as evident from SERS measurements. The simple technique employed here requires no lithographic templates and has potential for rapid, reproducible, inexpensive, and scalable tuning of nanoparticle shape, surface area, and resonance while preserving particle volume.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447			WOS:000384034600048	28239431	
J	Maroli, Amith; Nandula, Vijay; Duke, Stephen; Tharayil, Nishanth								Stable Isotope Resolved Metabolomics Reveals the Role of Anabolic and Catabolic Processes in Glyphosate-Induced Amino Acid Accumulation in Amaranthus palmeri Biotypes								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY				64	37			7040	7048		10.1021/acs.jafc.6b02196			SEP 21 2016	2016	Biotic and abiotic stressors often result in the buildup of amino acid pools in plants, which serve as potential stress mitigators. However, the role of anabolic (de novo amino acid synthesis) versus catabolic (proteolytic) processes in contributing to free amino acid pools is less understood. Using stable isotope-resolved metabolomics (SIRM), we measured the de novo amino acid synthesis in glyphosate susceptible (S-) and resistant (R-) Amaranthus palmeri biotypes. In the S-biotype, glyphosate treatment at 0.4 kg ae/ha resulted in an increase in total amino acids, a proportional increase in both N-14 and N-18 amino acids, and a decrease in soluble proteins. This indicates a potential increase in de novo amino acid synthesis, coupled with a lower protein synthesis and a higher protein catabolism following glyphosate treatment in the S-biotype. Furthermore, the ratio of glutamine/glutamic acid (Gln/Glu) in the glyphosate-treated S- and R-biotypes indicated that the initial assimilation of inorganic nitrogen to organic forms is less affected by glyphosate. However, amino acid biosynthesis downstream of glutamine is disproportionately disrupted in the glyphosate treated S-biotype. It is thus concluded that the herbicide-induced amino acid abundance in the S-biotype is contributed by both protein catabolism and de novo synthesis of amino acids such as glutamine and asparagine.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000384037700015	27469508

Knee arthrodesis: procedures and perspectives in the US from 1993 to 2011								SPRINGERPLUS				5						1606	10.1186/s40064-016-3285-z			SEP 20 2016	2016	Background: The incidence and prevalence of knee arthrodesis (fusion) in the United States is largely unknown, in spite of numerous case reports and review articles that have called attention to this life altering procedure.Purpose: This study was conducted to determine long-term knee arthrodesis incidence and patient populations, and to characterize the associated healthcare burden.Methods: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to evaluate knee arthrodesis procedures performed in the United States between 1993 and 2011. Patient age, sex, and reimbursement method were evaluated along with hospital attributes. Procedural rates for individual demographics were calculated using population data from the US Census. Commonly occurring diagnoses and procedures in knee arthrodesis were compiled.Results: The annual number of reported knee arthrodesis procedures remained relatively unchanged between 1993 and 2011 (Mean 1014, Standard Deviation 113), but there was a small but significant decrease in the procedure rate when taking population changes into account. Over 80 % of patients were aged 45 or above. Approximately 65 % of patients utilized governmental payers for reimbursement. Nearly all of the procedures were performed in metropolitan area hospitals (92.5 %), and a significant majority performed in teaching hospitals (62 %).Conclusions: The low incidence of knee arthrodesis procedures reflects both clinician and patient antipathy for this undesirable surgery. Case studies continue to reflect an interest to improve methodology, but also suggest a significant number of patients that go untreated given the current state of the art. Future work should seek to quantify the prevalence of patients with a severely dysfunctional knee who might otherwise undergo arthrodesis, but opt against it given the significant quality of life issues associated with the procedure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2193-1801			WOS:000391801000003	27652179

These gratings are perfectly phased matched for mode couplings, which can lead to transverse mode instabilities at high average powers in fiber lasers. A detailed understanding of this process is critical for further power scaling of fiber lasers. We have directly observed and characterized this quantum-defect-assisted mode coupling for the first time using polarization modes in a PM fiber amplifier, providing solid experimental evidence for this key mechanism for transverse mode instability in fiber lasers.

Configuration of the thermal landscape determines thermoregulatory performance of ectotherms								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				113	38			10595	10600		10.1073/pnas.1604824113			SEP 20 2016	2016	Although most organisms thermoregulate behaviorally, biologists still cannot easily predict whether mobile animals will thermoregulate in natural environments. Current models fail because they ignore how the spatial distribution of thermal resources constrains thermoregulatory performance over space and time. To overcome this limitation, we modeled the spatially explicit movements of animals constrained by access to thermal resources. Our models predict that ectotherms thermoregulate more accurately when thermal resources are dispersed throughout space than when these resources are clumped. This prediction was supported by thermoregulatory behaviors of lizards in outdoor arenas with known distributions of environmental temperatures. Further, simulations showed how the spatial structure of the landscape qualitatively affects responses of animals to climate. Biologists will need spatially explicit models to predict impacts of climate change on local scales.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0027-8424			WOS:000383622600047	27601639	
J	Sharma, Girish; Tewari, Sumanta								Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states and topological superconductivity in Ising paired superconductors								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				94	9					094515	10.1103/PhysRevB.94.094515			SEP 20 2016	2016	An unusual form of superconductivity, called Ising superconductivity, has recently been uncovered in mono- and few-layered transitionmetal dichalcogenides. This 2D superconducting state is characterized by the so-called Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which produces strong oppositely oriented effective Zeeman fields perpendicular to the 2D layer in opposite momentum space valleys. We examine the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states localized at magnetic impurities in Ising superconductors and show that the unusual SOC manifests itself in unusually strong anisotropy in magnetic field response observable in STM experiments. For a chain of magnetic impurities with moments parallel to the plane of Ising superconductors we show that the low energy YSR band hosts topological superconductivity and Majorana excitations as a direct manifestation of topological effects induced by Ising spin-orbit coupling.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000383860700005

Estimating the prevalence of multiple diseases from two-stage hierarchical pooling								STATISTICS IN MEDICINE				35	21			3851	3864		10.1002/sim.6964			SEP 20 2016	2016	Testing protocols in large-scale sexually transmitted disease screening applications often involve pooling biospecimens (e.g., blood, urine, and swabs) to lower costs and to increase the number of individuals who can be tested. With the recent development of assays that detect multiple diseases, it is now common to test biospecimen pools for multiple infections simultaneously. Recent work has developed an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the prevalence of two infections using a two-stage, Dorfman-type testing algorithm motivated by current screening practices for chlamydia and gonorrhea in the USA. In this article, we have the same goal but instead take a more flexible Bayesian approach. Doing so allows us to incorporate information about assay uncertainty during the testing process, which involves testing both pools and individuals, and also to update information as individuals are tested. Overall, our approach provides reliable inference for disease probabilities and accurately estimates assay sensitivity and specificity even when little or no information is provided in the prior distributions. We illustrate the performance of our estimation methods using simulation and by applying them to chlamydia and gonorrhea data collected in Nebraska.

One compound, Mn-5(VO4)(2)(OH)(4), was grown from Mn2O3 and V2O5 in 3 M CsOH at 580 degrees C and 1.5 kbar. Changing the mineralizer to 1 M CsOH/3MCsCl leads to the formation of another product, Mn6O(VO4)(2)(OH). Both compounds were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Mn-5(VO4)(2)(OH)(4): C2/m, Z = 2, a = 9.6568(9) angstrom, b = 9.5627(9) angstrom, c = 5.4139(6) angstrom, beta = 98.529(8)degrees; Mn6O(VO4)(2)(OH): P2(1)/m, Z = 2, a = 8.9363(12) angstrom, b = 6.4678(8) angstrom, c = 10.4478(13) angstrom, beta = 99.798(3)degrees), revealing interesting low-dimensional transition-metal features. Mns(VO4)(2)(OH)(4) possesses complex honeycomb-type Mn-O layers, built from edge-sharing [MnO6] octahedra in the be plane, with bridging vanadate groups connecting these layers along the a-axis. Mn6O(VO4)(2)(OH) presents a more complicated structure with both octahedral [MnO6] and trigonal bipyramidal [MnO5] units. A different pattern of planar honeycomb sheets are formed by edge-shared [MnO6] octahedra, and these sublattices are connected through edge-shared dimers of [MnO5] trigonal bipyramids to form corrugated sheets. Vanadate groups again condense the sheets into a three-dimensional framework. Infrared and Raman spectroscopies indicated the presence of OH groups and displayed characteristic Raman scattering due to vanadate groups. Temperature-dependent magnetic studies indicated Curie-Weiss behavior above 100 K with significant anti ferromagnetic coupling for both compounds, with further complex magnetic behavior at lower temperatures. The data indicate canted anti-ferromagnetic order below 57 K in Mns(VO4)(2)(OH)(4) and below 45 K in Mn6O(VO4)(2)(OH). Members of another class of compounds, K2M3(VO4)(2)(OH)(2) (M = Mn, Co), also containing a honeycomb-type sublattice, were also synthesized to allow a comparison of the structural features across all three structure types and to demonstrate extension to other transition metals.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000383733100015	27564229

Macro porous supports in planar-disc configuration were prepared through a sacrificial filler approach, intermediate structures and microporous layers were deposited via dip-coating. Microporosity in the selective layer was generated through a controlled thermal decomposition of the precursor component in nitrogen atmosphere at temperatures up to 600 degrees C, resulting in micropores with average pore sizes of 0.8 nm, as investigated by nitrogen adsorption and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The general feasibility of the single-precursor approach towards selective permeation of gaseous species was demonstrated by the investigation of gas permeances of the generated structures using single-gas permeance testing of He, N-2, Ar, C2H6, and CO2. By variation of the deposition sequence during preparation of the selective layer by dip-coating, asymmetric structures with ideal permselectivities exceeding predicted Knudsen values were obtained. At 500 degrees C, He/N-2 and He/CO2 permselectivities of up to 3.1 and 4.1 were found, respectively, at He permeances up to 3 x 10(-8) mol m(-2) Pa-1 s(-1). The new single-material system is a first step towards the potential establishment of new, alternative membrane materials systems, circumventing thermal and chemical incompatibilities between constituents, and increasing material performance due to the applicability under extreme operating conditions.

PNT uptake was higher than TCE by all adsorbents on both mass and surface area bases. This was attributed to the hydrophobicity of PNT. The adsorption capacities of PNT and TCE depend on the accessibility of the organic molecules to the inner regions of the adsorbent which was influenced from the molecular size of OCs. The adsorption capacities of all adsorbents decreased as a result of NOM preloading due to site competition and/or pore/interstice blockage. However, among all adsorbents, GO was generally effected least from the NOM preloading for PNT, whereas there was not observed any trend of NOM competition with a specific adsorbent for TCE. In addition, SWCNT was generally affected most from the NOM preloading for TCE and there was not any trend for PNT. The overall results indicated that the fate and transport of organic contaminants by GNSs and CNTs type of nanoadsorbents and GACs in different natural systems will be affected by water quality parameters, characteristics of adsorbent, and properties of adsorbate.

Effect of Curvature on Carbon Chemical Shielding in Extended Carbon Systems								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				120	35			7011	7019		10.1021/acs.jpca.6b05560			SEP 8 2016	2016	The effect of curvature on the chemical shielding of carbons in curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has been systematically studied by examining structures analogous to the circumcoronene molecule with different degrees of curvature. We attempt to eliminate effects from Knight shifts in carbon nanotubes, differing ring currents from five-membered rings, and edge effects in finite nanotube models in order to separate out the change in shielding that is due to curvature alone. Using curved structures derived from geometry-optimized structures of carbon nanotubes, we calculate the carbon chemical shielding tensor for carbons in the central aromatic ring as well as the Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) on the convex and concave side of each structure. All three tensor components become less Shielded with increasing curvature Of the system, with the sigma(33) component radial to the curve experiencing the greatest change. The NICS values are influenced by both the decrease in aromaticity as the structure is curved as well as geometric effects that bring the outside rings closer to the central aromatic ring.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1089-5639			WOS:000383004900013	27564451

Brominated species are typically more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogs. The impact of granular activated carbon (GAC) on controlling the formation of regulated and selected unregulated DBPs following chlorine disinfection was evaluated. The predicted cyto- and genotoxicity of DBPs was calculated using published potencies based on the comet assay for Chinese hamster ovary cells (assesses the level of DNA strand breaks). Additionally, genotoxicity was measured using the SOS-Chromotest (detects DNA-damaging agents). The class sum concentrations of trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, and unregulated DBPs, and the SOS genotoxicity followed the breakthrough of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), however the formation of brominated species did not. The bromide/DOC ratio was higher than the influent through much of the breakthrough curve (GAC does not remove bromide), which resulted in elevated brominated DBP concentrations in the effluent. Based on the potency of the haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes, these nitrogen-containing DBPs were the driving agents of the predicted genotoxicity. GAC treatment of drinking or reclaimed waters with appreciable levels of bromide and dissolved organic nitrogen may not control the formation of unregulated DBPs with higher genotoxicity potencies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000382805800075	27467860

In this study, the diffusivities of nutrient/metabolite solutes in healthy CEP were assessed, and further correlated with tissue biochemical composition and structure. The CEPs from non-degenerated human IVD were divided into four regions: central, lateral, anterior, and posterior. The diffusivities of glucose and lactate were measured with a custom diffusion cell apparatus under 0%, 10%, and 20% compressive strains. Biochemical assays were conducted to quantify the water and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) contents. The Safranin-O and Ehrlich׳s hematoxylin and eosin staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to reveal the tissue structure of the CEP. Average diffusivities of glucose and lactate in healthy CEP were 2.68±0.93*10-7cm2/s and 4.52±1.47*10-7cm2/s, respectively. Solute diffusivities were region-dependent (p<0.0001) with the highest values in the central region, and mechanical strains impeded solute diffusion in the CEP (p<0.0001). The solute diffusivities were significantly correlated with the tissue porosities (glucose: p<0.0001, r=0.581; lactate: p<0.0001, r=0.534). Histological and SEM studies further revealed that the collagen fibers in healthy CEP are more compacted than those in the nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) and show no clear orientation. Compared to human AF and NP, much smaller solute diffusivities in human CEP suggested that it acts as a gateway for solute diffusion through the disc, maintaining the balance of nutritional environment in healthy human disc under mechanical loading and preventing the progression of disc degeneration.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1873-2380		MEDLINE:27338525	27338525

Fringe patterns are projected onto a scene and modulated by the scene depth then a structured light field is detected using light field recording devices. The structured light field contains information about ray direction and phase-encoded depth via which the scene depth can be estimated from different directions. The multidirectional depth estimation can achieve high dynamic 3D imaging effectively. We analyzed and derived the phase-depth mapping in the structured light field and then proposed a flexible ray-based calibration approach to determine the independent mapping coefficients for each ray. Experimental results demonstrated the validity of the proposed method to perform high-quality 3D imaging for highly and lowly reflective surfaces.

A 7-cm-long and 150-micron-inner-diameter capillary light guide was capable to amplify a pulsed optical signal at 1550 nm with a gain coefficient of 0.15 cm(-1) at a pump power of 4 mW ( 980-nm wavelength). The nanocolloid gain medium was prepared by pulverizing the phosphor powder with a highspeed planetary ball mill. Ball milling of the powder in water produced nanoparticles with a size of approximately 130 nm that after drying were transferred to a liquid with high refractive index ( 1.551 at 1550 nm) required to maintain light confinement within the fused silica capillary light guide. The results show that RE-doped colloids of nanocrystals can be potentially used as liquid gain media fillers in capillary light guide lasers and amplifiers with high photostability and low toxicity.

Magnetic separation has several advantages over other field-driven particle separation techniques. It, however, has been limited primarily to situations where particles differ in size or magnetization. We demonstrate in this paper a continuous-flow separation of equal-volumed spherical and peanut-shaped diamagnetic particles in a dilute ferrofluid. This separation is attributed to the shape-dependent magnetophoretic motion, which is the combined result of the shape dependences of the magnetic force and viscous drag. We also develop a three-dimensional numerical model to understand this shape-based diamagnetic particle separation and predict the effects of the determining factors.

Although barcodes were not designed for phylogenetics, they can be beneficial to the completion of the Tree of Life. The barcode database for Trichoptera is relatively comprehensive, with data from every family, approximately two-thirds of the genera, and one-third of the described species. Most Trichoptera, as with most of life's species, have never been subjected to any formal phylogenetic analysis. Here, we present a phylogeny with over 16 000 unique haplotypes as a working hypothesis that can be updated as our estimates improve. We suggest a strategy of implementing constrained tree searches, which allow larger datasets to dictate the backbone phylogeny, while the barcode data fill out the tips of the tree. We also discuss how this phylogeny could be used to focus taxonomic attention on ambiguous species boundaries and hidden biodiversity. We suggest that systematists continue to differentiate between 'Barcode Index Numbers' (BINs) and 'species' that have been formally described. Each has utility, but they are not synonyms.

The green ash transcriptome and identification of genes responding to abiotic and biotic stresses								BMC GENOMICS				17						702	10.1186/s12864-016-3052-0			SEP 2 2016	2016	Background: To develop a set of transcriptome sequences to support research on environmental stress responses in green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), we undertook deep RNA sequencing of green ash tissues under various stress treatments. The treatments, including emerald ash borer (EAB) feeding, heat, drought, cold and ozone, were selected to mimic the increasing threats of climate change and invasive pests faced by green ash across its native habitat.Results: We report the generation and assembly of RNA sequences from 55 green ash samples into 107,611 putative unique transcripts (PUTs). 52,899 open reading frames were identified. Functional annotation of the PUTs by comparison to the Uniprot protein database identified matches for 63 % of transcripts and for 98 % of transcripts with ORFs. Further functional annotation identified conserved protein domains and assigned gene ontology terms to the PUTs. Examination of transcript expression across different RNA libraries revealed that expression patterns clustered based on tissues regardless of stress treatment. The transcripts from stress treatments were further examined to identify differential expression. Tens to hundreds of differentially expressed PUTs were identified for each stress treatment. A set of 109 PUTs were found to be consistently up or down regulated across three or more different stress treatments, representing basal stress response candidate genes in green ash. In addition, 1956 simple sequence repeats were identified in the PUTs, of which we identified 465 high quality DNA markers and designed flanking PCR primers.Conclusions: North American native ash trees have suffered extensive mortality due to EAB infestation, creating a need to breed or select for resistant green ash genotypes. Stress from climate change is an additional concern for longevity of native ash populations. The use of genomics could accelerate management efforts. The green ash transcriptome we have developed provides important sequence information, genetic markers and stress-response candidate genes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1471-2164			WOS:000383468300003	27589953

Crystal Structure of the Nephila clavipes Major Ampullate Spidroin 1 A N-terminal Domain Reveals Plasticity at the Dimer Interface								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				291	36			19006	19017		10.1074/jbc.M116.736710			SEP 2 2016	2016	Spider dragline silk is a natural polymer harboring unique physical and biochemical properties that make it an ideal biomaterial. Artificial silk production requires an understanding of the in vivo mechanisms spiders use to convert soluble proteins, called spidroins, into insoluble fibers. Controlled dimerization of the spidroin N-terminal domain (NTD) is crucial to this process. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Nephila clavipes major ampullate spidroin NTD dimer. Comparison of our N. clavipes NTD structure with previously determined Euprosthenops australis NTD structures reveals subtle conformational alterations that lead to differences in how the subunits are arranged at the dimer interface. We observe a subset of contacts that are specific to each ortholog, as well as a substantial increase in asymmetry in the interactions observed at the N. clavipes NTD dimer interface. These asymmetric interactions include novel intermolecular salt bridges that provide new insights into the mechanism of NTD dimerization. We also observe a unique intramolecular "handshake" interaction between two conserved acidic residues that our data suggest adds an additional layer of complexity to the pH-sensitive relay mechanism for NTD dimerization. The results of a panel of tryptophan fluorescence dimerization assays probing the importance of these interactions support our structural observations. Based on our findings, we propose that conformational selectivity and plasticity at the NTD dimer interface play a role in the pH-dependent transition of the NTD from monomer to stably associated dimer as the spidroin progresses through the silk extrusion duct.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000383242300035	27445329	
J	Steuben, John; Mustoe, Graham; Turner, Cameron								Massively Parallel Discrete Element Method Simulations on Graphics Processing Units								JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING				16	3					031001	10.1115/1.4033724			SEP 2016	2016	This paper outlines the development and implementation of large-scale discrete element method (DEM) simulations on graphics processing hardware. These simulations, as well as the topic of general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) computing, are introduced and discussed. We proceed to cover the general software design choices and architecture used to realize a GPGPU-enabled DEM simulation, driven primarily by the massively parallel nature of this computing technology. Further enhancements to this simulation, namely, a more advanced sliding friction model and a thermal conduction model, are then addressed. This discussion also highlights some of the finer points and issues associated with GPGPU computing, particularly surrounding the issues of parallelization, synchronization, and approximation. Qualitative comparison studies between simple and advanced sliding friction models demonstrate the effectiveness of the friction model. A test problem and an application problem in the area of wind turbine blade icing demonstrate the capabilities of the thermal model. We conclude with remarks regarding the simulations developed, future work needed, and the general suitability of GPGPU architectures for DEM computations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-9827	1944-7078		WOS:000393189400008

Despite much discussion about what policies are needed, there has been little discussion about the professional practice issues and the ethical issues related to these practices. The purpose of this report is to present six clusters of professional practice and ethical issues that have not heretofore been specifically identified. To do so, we will examine the codes of professional practice and ethics of organizations representing educators who work with students with severe behavioral challenges. To illustrate these issues, we use real-world case examples from media stories and official reports about problems resulting from restraint and seclusion. Although individuals may disagree regarding decisions about these ethical issues, these questions should be a part of any policy discussion related to professional practice regarding these issues, and they have rarely been addressed in the restraint and seclusion policy debate. In addition, they are also questions that must be examined by all professional educators for them to assure adherence to the professional practice and ethical codes for their field.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1044-2073	1538-4802		WOS:000393144300003

The Legal Landscape of Concussion: Implications for Sports Medicine Providers								SPORTS HEALTH-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH				8	5			465	468		10.1177/1941738116662025			SEP-OCT 2016	2016	Context: Concussion legislation has been enacted in all 50 of the United States, aiming to prevent mild traumatic brain injuries and the potential long-term sequelae of these injuries in youth athletics. Sports medicine providers, in addressing this major public health concern, are tasked with adhering to the established standards of medical care while also considering the legal implications.Evidence Acquisition: The PubMed (2011-2016) database was searched using the following search terms: concussion, sports concussion, legislation, and concussion legislation. References from consensus statements, review articles, and book chapters were also utilized.Study Design: Clinical review.Level of Evidence: Level 4.Results: The Lystedt law and its progeny have increased awareness of the signs and symptoms of sports concussion, but adherence to state legislation can pose some challenges.Conclusion: The presence of concussion legislation places a responsibility on the sports medicine provider to have a firm understanding of the legality of concussion management in the state(s) in which they practice.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1941-7381	1941-0921		WOS:000391285100010	27530613

DATA MINING TO INVESTIGATE THE METEOROLOGICAL DRIVERS FOR EXTREME GROUND LEVEL OZONE EVENTS								ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS				10	3			1673	1698		10.1214/16-AOAS954			SEP 2016	2016	This project aims to explore which combinations of meteorological conditions are associated with extreme ground level ozone conditions. Our approach focuses only on the tail by optimizing the tail dependence between the ozone response and functions of meteorological covariates. Since there is a long list of possible meteorological covariates, the space of possible models cannot be explored completely. Consequently, we perform data mining within the model selection context, employing an automated model search procedure. Our study is unique among extremes applications, as optimizing tail dependence has not previously been attempted, and it presents new challenges, such as requiring a smooth threshold. We present a simulation study which shows that the method can detect complicated conditions leading to extreme responses and resists overfitting. We apply the method to ozone data for Atlanta and Charlotte and find similar meteorological drivers for these two Southeastern US cities. We identify several covariates which help to differentiate the meteorological conditions which lead to extreme ozone levels from those which lead to merely high levels.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6157			WOS:000389657400025

While much of the British Empire has been dismantled, Bermuda remains within the Imperial fold, and is today designated a "British overseas territory." Within this framework, Bermuda's heritage tourism landscape perpetuates an institutionally imposed colonialist narrative that neglects to explore the contributions of the island's under-represented communities. This article explores these issues with respect to the island's tourism plan. It concludes by highlighting new archaeological research centered on the material lives of enslaved Bermudians.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1092-7697	1573-7748		WOS:000388366300011

Agricultural Supply Management and Market Power: Evidence from the US Dairy and Potato Industries								AGRIBUSINESS				32	4			563	568		10.1002/agr.21485			FAL 2016	2016	Agricultural over-supply, increasing output price volatility, and producers' returns below production costs were the economic forces that influenced the decision of the organizations of agricultural producers in the U.S. dairy and potato industries to implement agricultural supply management programs. Using a theoretical framework, this research evaluates potential seller market power of agricultural cooperatives implementing agricultural supply management practices at the farm-gate level. A theoretical analysis is conducted by comparing agricultural cooperatives with classic cartels. Available empirical evidence on the effects of agricultural supply management programs in the U.S. dairy and potato industries is discussed.

We have demonstrated that guiding in macrocapillaries exhibits position- and angle-dependent transmission properties which are directly related to the capillary material (either metal or insulator) and geometry. Specifically, we have passed 1 keV Rb+ ions through glass and metal macrocapillaries, and have observed oscillations for the transmitted ion current passing through the insulating capillaries. Straightforward calculations show that these oscillations can be attributed to beam deflections from charge patches that form on the interior walls of the capillary. The absence of these oscillations in the metal capillary data serve as further confirmation of the role of charge patch formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nitrogen Strategy and Seeding Rate Affect Rice Lodging, Yield, and Economic Returns in the Midsouthern United States								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				108	5			1938	1943		10.2134/agronj2016.03.0128			SEP-OCT 2016	2016	Seeding rate and N application strategies have been extensively researched for drill-seeded, delayed flood rice (Oryza sativa L.) production in the midsouthern United States. However, little economic analysis has been performed to determine the effects of seeding rate and N fertilization strategies on high-yielding, lodging susceptible rice cultivars. The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of multiple N fertilization strategies and seeding rates on rice lodging and grain yield and use the data to determine optimal rice management practices based on evaluation of economic returns. Studies were established in Louisiana and Mississippi during the 2010 and 2012 growing seasons. Rice was drilled at seeding rates of 161, 323, and 483 seeds m(-2). Rice was fertilized with N at multiple rates and timings, representing recommended strategies as well as strategies designed to reduce lodging. Lodging and grain yield data were collected and used to determine net returns at high and low rice and N prices. Rice grain yield and net returns were maximized at a seeding rate of 323 seeds m(-2). Splitting N application between early-season (V3) and late-season (R1 or R3) applications decreased lodging, but resulted in decreased grain yield compared to optimal rates of N applied at V3. The 202 kg N ha(-1) applied early-season (V3) N fertilization strategy maximized both grain yield and net returns, despite relatively high levels of lodging. Optimal N fertilization during early-vegetative growth appears to be necessary to maximize yield potential in this rice production system.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0002-1962	1435-0645		WOS:000387553900018

Current electrokinetic particle separation techniques primarily rely on dielectrophoresis, where the electric field gradients are generated by either active microelectrodes or inert micro-insulators. We develop herein a new type of electrokinetic method to continuously separate particles in a bifurcating micro-channel. This sheath-free separation makes use of the inherent wall-induced electrical lift to focus particles towards the centerline of the main-branch and then deflect them to size-dependent flow paths in each side-branch. A theoretical model is also developed to understand such a size-based separation, which simulates the experimental observations with a good agreement. This electric field-driven sheathless separation can potentially be operated in a parallel or cascade mode to increase the particle throughput or resolution.

J	Ragozzino, Roberto; Blevins, Dane P.								Venture-Backed Firms: How Does Venture Capital Involvement Affect Their Likelihood of Going Public or Being Acquired?								ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY AND PRACTICE				40	5			991	1016		10.1111/etap.12154			SEP 2016	2016	This paper investigates how venture capitalists' involvement in new ventures affects the likelihood of entrepreneurial exit, either via an acquisition or via an initial public offering. We examine the prominence of venture capitals (VCs), the number of VCs invested in a company, as well as the timing, duration, and magnitude of their investments in new ventures. We find that each of these dimensions directly explains entrepreneurial exit, although their effects tend to differ depending on whether the exit occurs via an acquisition or an initial public offering (IPO). These results withstand several robustness checks and offer a more precise account of how the relationship between new ventures and VC firms unfolds in the early years of the entrepreneurial cycle.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1042-2587	1540-6520		WOS:000387042400002

Sensing and Bio-Sensing Research				10				9	14					2016-Sep	2016	We have established a long-term, stable primary chick forebrain neuron (FBN) culture on a microelectrode array platform as a biosensor system for neurotoxicant screening and for neuroelectrophysiological studies for multiple purposes. This paper reports some of our results, which characterize the biosensor pharmacologically. Dose-response experiments were conducted using NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 and GABAA receptor agonist musimol (MUS). The chick FBN biosensor (C-FBN-biosensor) responds to the two agents in a pattern similar to that of rodent counterparts; the estimated EC50s (the effective concentration that causes 50% inhibition of the maximal effect) are 2.3 muM and 0.25 muM, respectively. Intercultural and intracultural reproducibility and long-term reusability of the C-FBN-biosensor are addressed and discussed. A phenomenon of sensitization of the biosensor that accompanies intracultural reproducibility in paired dose-response experiments for the same agent (AP5 or MUS) is reported. The potential application of the C-FBN-biosensor as an alternative to rodent biosensors in shared sensing domains (NMDA receptor and GABAA receptor) is suggested.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:27551670	27551670	
J	Morris, Eric A; Hirsch, Jana A								Does rush hour see a rush of emotions? Driver mood in conditions likely to exhibit congestion.								Travel behaviour & society				5				5	13					2016-Sep	2016	Polls show that a large portion of the public considers traffic congestion to be a problem and believes a number of policy interventions would ameliorate it. However, most of the public rejects new taxes and fees to fund these improvements. This may be because of a disconnect between the public's stated antipathy towards congestion and the recalled emotional costs congestion imposes. To explore this, we use a large and representative sample drawn from the American Time Use Survey to examine how drivers experience four emotions (happiness, sadness, stress, and fatigue), plus a constructed composite mood variable, when they travel in peak periods, in large cities, in city centers, and in combinations of these. We also explore the interactions between these indicators and trip duration. We find evidence that drivers in the largest cities at the very peak of rush hour (5:00pm-6:00pm) are in a less positive mood, presumably because of congestion. However, this effect, though significant, is small, and we find no significant results using broader definitions of the peak period. In all, our findings suggest that congestion's impact on drivers as a group is quite limited. This may help explain why the public's attitude toward painful financial trade-offs to address congestion is lukewarm.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2214-367X			MEDLINE:27231669	27231669

ASYMMETRIES IN SN 2014J NEAR MAXIMUM LIGHT REVEALED THROUGH SPECTROPOLARIMETRY								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				828	1					24	10.3847/0004-637X/828/1/24			SEP 1 2016	2016	We present spectropolarimetric observations of the nearby Type Ia supernova SN 2014J in M82 over six epochs: +0, +7, +23, +51, +77, +109, and +111 days with respect to B-band maximum. The strong continuum polarization, which is constant with time, shows a wavelength dependence unlike that produced by linear dichroism in Milky Way dust. The observed polarization may be due entirely to interstellar dust or include a circumstellar scattering component. We find that the polarization angle aligns with the magnetic field of the host galaxy, arguing for an interstellar origin. Additionally, we confirm a peak in polarization at short wavelengths that would imply R-V < 2 along the light of sight, in agreement with earlier polarization measurements. For illustrative purposes, we include a two-component fit to the continuum polarization of our +51-day epoch that combines a circumstellar scattering component with interstellar dust where scattering can account for over half of the polarization at 4000 angstrom. Upon removal of the interstellar polarization signal, SN 2014J exhibits very low levels of continuum polarization. Asymmetries in the distribution of elements within the ejecta are visible through moderate levels of time-variable polarization in accordance with the Si II lambda 6355 absorption line. At maximum light, the line polarization reaches similar to 0.6% and decreases to similar to 0.4% 1 week later. This feature also forms a loop on theqRSP-uRSP plane, illustrating that the ion does not have an axisymmetric distribution. The observed polarization properties suggest that the explosion geometry of SN 2014J is generally spheroidal with a clumpy distribution of silicon.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000386894900024

A numerical model for water and heat transport in freezing soils with nonequilibrium ice-water interfaces								WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH				52	9			7366	7381		10.1002/2016WR019116			SEP 2016	2016	A one-dimensional numerical model of heat and water transport in freezing soils is developed by assuming that ice-water interfaces are not necessarily in equilibrium. The Clapeyron equation, which is derived from a static ice-water interface using the thermal equilibrium theory, cannot be readily applied to a dynamic system, such as freezing soils. Therefore, we handled the redistribution of liquid water with the Richard's equation. In this application, the sink term is replaced by the freezing rate of pore water, which is proportional to the extent of supercooling and available water content for freezing by a coefficient, . Three short-term laboratory column simulations show reasonable agreement with observations, with standard error of simulation on water content ranging between 0.007 and 0.011 cm(3) cm(-3), showing improved accuracy over other models that assume equilibrium ice-water interfaces. Simulation results suggest that when the freezing front is fixed at a specific depth, deviation of the ice-water interface from equilibrium, at this location, will increase with time. However, this deviation tends to weaken when the freezing front slowly penetrates to a greater depth, accompanied with thinner soils of significant deviation. The coefficient, , plays an important role in the simulation of heat and water transport. A smaller results in a larger deviation in the ice-water interface from equilibrium, and backward estimation of the freezing front. It also leads to an underestimation of water content in soils that were previously frozen by a rapid freezing rate, and an overestimation of water content in the rest of the soils.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0043-1397	1944-7973		WOS:000386977900037

Along the way we construct such a test complex that detect finiteness of Gorenstein dimension, but not that of projective dimension.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-0757	2038-4815		WOS:000386332500017

The samples were investigated using SEM, TEM, XRD, and UV/VIS/FTIR photoacoustic spectroscopy. The SEM/TEM images show relatively spherical particles that form elongated, connected domains post-anneal. XRD measurements indicate a typical wurtzite structure and reveal an increase in average grain size from 16.3 nm to 21.2 nm in Ar-annealed samples over pristine samples. Visible photoacoustic spectra reveal the contribution of defect levels on the absorption edge of the fundamental gap of zinc oxide. The steepness parameter of the absorption edge, which is inversely proportional to the width of the absorption edge, decreased from 0.1582 (pristine) to 0.1539 (annealed for 90 minutes) revealing increased density of defect states upon annealing. The FTIR photoacoustic spectra show an intense peak at 412 cm(-1) and a shoulder at 504 cm(-1) corresponding to the two transverse optical stretching modes of ZnO. These results may indicate a self-assembly mechanism upon anneal under Ar atmosphere leading to early-stage nanorod growth.

J	Hartman, Leah S.; Kil, Irfan; Pagano, Christopher C.; Burg, Timothy								Investigating haptic distance-to-break using linear and nonlinear materials in a simulated minimally invasive surgery task								ERGONOMICS				59	9			1171	1181		10.1080/00140139.2015.1127429			SEP 2016	2016	Accurate detection of mediated haptic information in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is critical for applying appropriate force magnitudes onto soft tissue with the aim of minimising tissue trauma. Force perception in MIS is a dynamic process, with surgeons' administration of force into tissue revealing information about the remote surgical site which further informs the surgeons' haptic interactions. The relationship between applied force and material deformation rate provides biomechanical information specifying the deformation distance remaining until a tissue will fail: which is termed distance-to-break (DTB). The current study demonstrates that observers can detect DTB while deforming simulated tissues and stop before reaching the tissues' failure points. The design of training simulators, control devices and automated robotic systems for applications outside of MIS is discussed.Practitioner Summary: In MIS, haptic information is critical for applying appropriate forces onto soft tissue to minimise tissue trauma. Observers used force information to detect how far they could deform a virtual tissue before it would break. The design of training simulators, control devices and automated robotic systems is discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0014-0139	1366-5847		WOS:000385535700003	26646857

To optimize these candidates, research examining the genetic architecture of yield, carbon partitioning, and composition is required to advance breeding objectives. Significant progress has been made developing genetic and genomic resources for Andropogoneae, and advances in comparative and computational genomics have enabled research examining the genetic basis of photosynthesis, carbon partitioning, composition, and sink strength. To provide a pivotal resource aimed at developing a comparative understanding of key bioenergy traits in the Andropogoneae, we have established and characterized an association panel of 390 racially, geographically, and phenotypically diverse Sorghum bicolor accessions with 232,303 genetic markers. Sorghum bicolor was selected because of its genomic simplicity, phenotypic diversity, significant genomic tools, and its agricultural productivity and resilience. We have demonstrated the value of sorghum as a functional model for candidate gene discovery for bioenergy Andropogoneae by performing genome-wide association analysis for two contrasting phenotypes representing key components of structural and non-structural carbohydrates. We identified potential genes, including a cellulase enzyme and a vacuolar transporter, associated with increased non-structural carbohydrates that could lead to bioenergy sorghum improvement. Although our analysis identified genes with potentially clear functions, other candidates did not have assigned functions, suggesting novel molecular mechanisms for carbon partitioning traits. These results, combined with our characterization of phenotypic and genetic diversity and the public accessibility of each accession and genomic data, demonstrate the value of this resource and provide a foundation for future improvement of sorghum and related grasses for bioenergy production.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-6731	1943-2631		WOS:000383998500005	27356613

It is an efficient technique for microfluidic applications with the ease of operation and integration. It, however, suffers from an intrinsic drawback of low throughput due to the linear dependence of the typically very low fluid permittivity. We demonstrate in this work a significantly enhanced throughput for electrokinetic manipulation of particles and cells by the use of multiple parallel microchannels in a two-layer stacked microfluidic device. The fabrication of this device is simple without the need of a precise alignment of the two layers. The number of layers and the number of microchannels in each layer can thus be further increased for a potentially high throughput electrokinetic particle and cell manipulations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2072-666X			WOS:000385483000011

We now see OM as a vibrant community and an ecosystem in steady state. Yet, there are many opportunities ahead to revitalize our field and to expand our influence. In the spirit of continuous improvement, we propose that we focus our major efforts on accelerating the following four developments: First, having greatly expanded the domain of operations management, we should continue to expand its boundaries. Second, after a visible increase in exploratory studies, our community should accelerate our pursuit of such research. Third, we encourage OM faculty to develop programs that enable Ph.D. students to carry out part of their work in actual organizational settings. Fourth, we should further strengthen our interactions with the business community and create mechanisms to systematically disseminate our research to its members.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1059-1478	1937-5956		WOS:000383695000001

Solar energy as an auxiliary power source of on-board fuel has not been extensively investigated. This study focuses on the energy and economic aspects of optimizing and hybridizing, the conventional energy path of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) using solar energy by means of on-board photovoltaic (PV) system as an auxiliary fuel source. This study is novel in that the authors (i) modeled the comprehensive on-board PV system for plug-in EV; (ii) optimized various design parameters for optimum well-to-tank efficiency (solar energy to battery bank); (iii) estimated hybrid solar plug-in EVs energy generation and consumption, as well as pure solar PV daily range extender; and (iv) estimated the economic return of investment (ROI) value of adding on-board PVs for plug-in EVs under different cost scenarios, driving locations, and vehicle specifications. For this study, two months in two US cities were selected, which represent the extremities in terms of available solar energy; June in Phoenix, Arizona and December in Boston, Massachusetts to represent the driving conditions in all the US states at any time followed by assessment of the results worldwide.The results show that, by adding on-board PVs to cover less than 50% (around 3.2m2) of the projected horizontal surface area of a typical passenger EV, the daily driving range could be extended from 3.0 miles to 62.5 miles by solar energy based on vehicle specifications, locations, season, and total time the EV remains at Sun. In addition, the ROI of adding PVs on-board with EV over its lifetime shows only small negative values (larger than -45%) when the price of electricity remains below $0.18/kWh and the vehicle is driven in low-solar energy area (e.g. Massachusetts in the US and majority of Europe countries). The ROI is more than 148% if the vehicle is driven in high-solar energy area (e.g. Arizona in the US, most Africa countries, Middle East, and Mumbai in India), even if the electricity price remains low. For high electricity price regions ($0.35/kWh), the ROI is positive and high under all driving scenarios (above 560%). Also, the reported system has the potential to reduce electricity consumption from grid by around 4.5 to 21.0 MWh per EV lifetime. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out, in order to study the impacts of the car parked in the shade on the results.

J	Mayerl, Christopher J.; Brainerd, Elizabeth L.; Blob, Richard W.								Pelvic girdle mobility of cryptodire and pleurodire turtles during walking and swimming								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				219	17			2650	2658		10.1242/jeb.141622			SEP 1 2016	2016	Movements of the pelvic girdle facilitate terrestrial locomotor performance in a wide range of vertebrates by increasing hind limb excursion and stride length. The extent to which pelvic movements contribute to limb excursion in turtles is unclear because the bony shell surrounding the body presents a major obstacle to their visualization. In the Cryptodira, which are one of the two major lineages of turtles, pelvic anatomy indicates the potential for rotation inside the shell. However, in the Pleurodira, the other major suborder, the pelvis shows a derived fusion to the shell, preventing pelvic motion. In addition, most turtles use their hind limbs for propulsion during swimming as well as walking, and the different locomotor demands between water and land could lead to differences in the contributions of pelvic rotation to limb excursion in each habitat. To test these possibilities, we used X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM) to compare pelvic mobility and femoral motion during walking and swimming between representative species of cryptodire (Pseudemys concinna) and pleurodire (Emydura subglobosa) turtles. We found that the pelvis yawed substantially in cryptodires during walking and, to a lesser extent, during swimming. These movements contributed to greater femoral protraction during both walking and swimming in cryptodires when compared with pleurodires. Although factors related to the origin of pelvic-shell fusion in pleurodires are debated, its implications for their locomotor function may contribute to the restriction of this group to primarily aquatic habits.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000384249800015	27340204

Current wrinkling processes are based On contraction of the entire substrate and do not produce confined or directed wrinkles. Here we show that selective desiccation of a bacterium under impermeable and flexible graphene via a flap-valve operation produces axially aligned graphene wrinkles of wavelength 32.4-34.3 nm, consistent with modified Foppl-von Karman mechanics (confinement similar to 0.7 x 4 mu m(2)). Further, an electrophoretically oriented-bacterial device with confined wrinkles aligned with van der Pauw electrodes was fabricated and exhibited an anisotropic transport barrier (Delta E = 1.69 meV). Theoretical models were developed to describe the wrinkle formation mechanism. The results obtained show bio-induced production of confined, well-oriented, and electrically anisotropic graphene wrinkles, which can be applied in electronics, bioelectromechanics, and strain patterning.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000384399300031	27391776

We evaluate opportunities and challenges to conserving our biodiversity by completing a national habitat conservation system, which could stem losses of natural resources and ecosystem services and proactively prepare for climate-change impacts. Lessons learned from two international conservation systems and the infrastructure of national bird conservation partnerships provide examples for completing a national habitat conservation system. One option is to convene a national forum of interested public and private parties to undertake four key actions; develop a common conservation vision and set measureable goals, complete a conservation assessment, use an adaptive management framework to monitor progress toward this vision, and implement strategies to complete a national habitat conservation system. Completing a national habitat conservation system is key to meeting the challenges of conserving habitats and biodiversity of the United States.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-3568	1525-3244		WOS:000384602800010

Alfred; Borzendowski, Stephanie Whetsel; Sewall, Ashley Stafford								The conspicuity of pedestrians at night: a review								CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPTOMETRY				99	5	SI		425	434		10.1111/cxo.12447			SEP 2016	2016	Drivers' visual limitations are a leading contributor to night-time traffic crashes involving pedestrians. This paper reviews the basic changes in vision that occur at night for young and old visually healthy drivers, as well as those with common ocular pathology. To maximise their safety at night, pedestrians should be conspicuous. That is, beyond being simply visible (detectable as an ambiguous object), they should attract the attention of drivers and be readily perceivable as pedestrians. Research has established that the conspicuity of pedestrians can be optimised by attaching retroreflective markings to the pedestrian's extremities. Doing so highlights the pedestrian's biological motion,' which facilitates the accurate perception of a person; however, retroreflective markings on the torso (for example, vests) are less effective. Importantly, behavioural evidence indicates that most road users - drivers and pedestrians alike - are not aware of the limitations of night vision. For example, drivers typically overdrive' the useful range of their headlight beams and under-use their high beam headlight setting. Further, pedestrians overestimate their own conspicuity at night and fail to appreciate the extent to which their own conspicuity depends on their clothing. The widespread misunderstanding of the challenges associated with night driving reflects a lack of awareness of the fundamental limitations of night vision. Educational interventions are needed to ameliorate these dangerous misunderstandings and to improve the safety of all road users at night.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0816-4622	1444-0938		WOS:000383620100005	27523959

Then, a position control and two force control algorithms are derived using the weight-prediction-based dynamics so that the inclusion of weight prediction in the controls can mitigate the effects of the erroneous feedforward input force programming of the human. In the second step, a variable-inertia-based empirical predictive control strategy is proposed to augment the performance of the controls. The control algorithms are tested using a 1-DOF PARS for lifting lightweight objects. A novel scheme is proposed to evaluate and optimize the performance of the controls. The experimental results show that weight-prediction-based predictive controls help optimize human-robot interaction (HRI) and manipulation performance. The results show that the position control produces better HRI and performance than the force controls, and the force control designed with force feedback performs better than the force control designed with acceleration feedback. The results seem to be very useful to design predictive controls of power assist robots for handling heavy objects in industries.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-0046	1557-9948		WOS:000384641600067

Sustaining the Commons: The Coercive to Cooperative, Resilient, and Adaptive Nature of State Comprehensive Water Planning Legislation								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION				82	4			327	349		10.1080/01944363.2016.1214537			FAL 2016	2016	Problem, research strategy, and findings: States need guidance to adopt comprehensive water planning legislation that can affect urban planning and built form. Current state legislation, however, may not yet incorporate emerging water resource paradigms that promote sustainable water management at the state and substate levels. Planners can improve existing state legislation, but need guidance on incorporating the latest thinking on resilience, adaptive capacity, and sustainable commons management. I identify the 26 states with comprehensive water planning legislation, and analyze that legislation using a new assessment tool that builds on the coercive versus cooperative metric (CvCA). I determine where each state's water planning legislation falls on a coercive versus cooperative spectrum, and the extent to which each state's legislation incorporates sustainable commons management (SCM) and social-ecological resilience (SER) mechanisms and attributes. Most of the 26 states with comprehensive water planning legislation balance coercive and cooperative approaches to achieve state and substate water plans, although research suggests that planning is most effective when legislation is more cooperative. Moreover, most have not codified SCM and SER mechanisms into state water planning legislation, suggesting that the plans that follow may lack the adaptive capacity to increase the resilience of the water system. Research limitations include the single data source and potential interpretive coding bias.Takeaway for practice: Planners can advocate for new or improved state water legislation that incorporates integral adaptive and resiliency concepts, encouraging states to include the fundamental features of the social-ecological system that lead to better water management.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0194-4363	1939-0130		WOS:000384640700004

Sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia, the most common forms of hemoglobinopathies, are typically treated using transfusions and pharmacological agents. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative therapy, but has limited clinical applicability. Although gene therapy approaches have been proposed based on the insertion and forced expression of wildtype or anti-sickling beta-globin variants, safety concerns may impede their clinical application. A novel curative approach is nuclease-based gene correction, which involves the application of precision genome-editing tools to correct the disease-causing mutation. This review describes the development and potential application of gene therapy and precision genome-editing approaches for treating SCD and beta-thalassemia. The opportunities and challenges in advancing a curative therapy for hemoglobinopathies are also discussed.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0340-6717	1432-1203		WOS:000384223800005	27314256	
J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Zhuozhao								New Bandwidth Sharing and Pricing Policies to Achieve a Win-Win Situation for Cloud Provider and Tenants								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				27	9			2682	2697		10.1109/TPDS.2015.2497701			SEP 1 2016	2016	For predictable application performance or fairness in network sharing in clouds, many bandwidth allocation policies have been proposed. However, with these policies, tenants are not incentivized to use idle bandwidth or prevent link congestion, and may even take advantage of the policies to gain unfair bandwidth allocation. Increasing network utilization while avoiding congestion not only benefits cloud provider but also the tenants by improving application performance. In this paper, we propose a new pricing model that sets different unit prices for reserved bandwidth, the bandwidth on congested links and on uncongested links, and makes the unit price for congested links proportional to their congestion degrees. We use game theory model to analyze tenants' behaviors in our model and the current pricing models, which shows the effectiveness of our model in providing the incentives. With the pricing model, we propose a network sharing policy to achieve both min-guarantee and proportionality, while prevent tenants from earning unfair bandwidth. We further propose methods for each virtual machine to arrange its traffic to reduce its unsatisfied demand and maximize its utility, while increase network utilization. As a result, our solution creates a win-win situation, where tenants strive to increase their benefits in bandwidth sharing, which also concurrently increases the utilities of cloud provider and other tenants. Our simulation and trace-driven experimental results show the effectiveness of our solutions in creating the win-win situation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000384238000016		
J	Li, Ailin; Li, Jing; Bao, Yuhua; Yuan, Dingshan; Huang, Zhongwei								Xuebijing injection alleviates cytokine-induced inflammatory liver injury in CLP-induced septic rats through induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1								EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE				12	3			1531	1536		10.3892/etm.2016.3476			SEP 2016	2016	Dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines and liver injury are associated with the pathogenesis of sepsis. Xuebijing injection, a Chinese herbal medicine, has been used in the treatment of sepsis and can contribute to the improvement of patients' health. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet clearly illuminated. In the present study, a septic rat model with liver injury was established by the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method. Histological alterations to the liver, activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), levels of inflammatory cytokine secretion and the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) in the CLP model rats with and without Xuebijing treatment were determined. The results showed that Xuebijing injection ameliorated the pathological changes in liver tissues caused by sepsis, and reduced the sepsis-induced elevation in serum ALT and AST levels. Furthermore, Xuebijing injection markedly downregulated the expression of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-6, and upregulated the expression of IL-10. More importantly, SOCS1 expression levels at the protein and mRNA levels were further increased by Xuebijing. These findings demonstrate that Xuebijing injection can significantly alleviate liver injury in CLP-induced septic rats via the regulation of inflammatory cytokine secretion and the promotion of SOCS1 expression. The protective effects of Xuebijing injection suggest its therapeutic potential in the treatment of CLP-induced liver injury.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1792-0981	1792-1015		WOS:000382446000045

The title compounds can be grown as single crystals in sizes exceeding 2 mm for most of the rare earths using 30 M KOH at temperatures of 700 degrees C and pressures of 2 kbar. Single crystal X-ray diffraction shows that they all form in the fergusonite structure type, and the structures were solved in space group C2/c. Examples based on the largest and smallest rare earth ions in the present study include LaNbO4: a = 7.3576(15) angstrom, b = 11.538(2) angstrom, c = 5.2128(10) angstrom, beta = 130.900(3)degrees, Z = 4, R-1 = 0.0162, wR(2) = 0.0405, and LuNbO4: a = 6.9805(6) angstrom, b = 10.8271(8) angstrom, c = 5.0406(4) angstrom, beta = 131.676(3)degrees, Z = 4, R-1 = 0.0178, wR(2) = 0.0489. Although domain structures are clearly present in the bulk crystals, the domains are much larger than normally reported from high temperature growth methods, and individual single domain crystals on the order of 0.1-1 mm in size can be selected. Rocking curves of these crystals have narrow fwhm and are Gaussian shaped. Several new phases were also isolated as part of the development of the crystal growth chemistry and were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction including such examples as K3YNb2O7(OH)(2): P63/mmc, a = 5.9770(12) angstrom, c = 14.901(2) angstrom, Z = 2, R-1 = 0.0303, wR(2) = 0.0765 and CsNb2O3(OH): Fd (3) over barm, a = 10.5869(14) angstrom, Z = 8, R-1 = 0.0336, wR(2) = 0.0741.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000382902400017		
J	Russell, Brook T.; Cooley, Daniel S.; Porter, William C.; Heald, Colette L.								Modeling the spatial behavior of the meteorological drivers' effects on extreme ozone								ENVIRONMETRICS				27	6			334	344		10.1002/env.2406			SEP 2016	2016	At its most extreme levels, ground-level ozone is most harmful to human health, and meteorological conditions play a critical role in such episodes. In this work, our aim is to better understand how the primary meteorological drivers' effects on extreme ozone vary over the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic region of the USA. We employ a model based on a bivariate extreme value framework that finds the linear combination of a set of meteorological covariates that has the strongest tail dependence with ground-level ozone. In order to gain knowledge about the spatial behavior of the meteorological drivers, we spatially model the coefficients, which relate the covariates to extreme ozone. Because inference for our extreme value model is not likelihood based, we utilize a two-stage modeling procedure: first, estimating the coefficients in our extreme value model and their associated uncertainties and then using these to fit a multivariate spatial process. We analyze data from 160 air quality stations located in the Environmental Protection Agency Regions 3 and 4, producing estimated spatial surfaces via the fitted spatial process and co-kriging. We find that the relative contribution of the driving meteorological variables to extreme ozone differs between the northern and southern portions of the study region. For instance, we find that air temperature is more important in the northern portion of the region, while low humidity is more influential in the southern portion of the region.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1180-4009	1099-095X		WOS:000383765900002

While known that Ge addition to binary As-Se glasses enhances the mean coordination number (MCN) of the network and results in increased T-g and decreased CTE, this work highlights the impact on optical properties, specifically mid-wave ( = 4.515 m) index and thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT). Trends in property changes were correlated with an excess or deficiency of chalcogen content in the glassy network as compared to stoichiometric compositions. Transitions in key optical properties were observed with the disappearance of Se-Se homopolar bonds and creation of As-As homopolar bonds which are associated with the Se-rich and Se-deficient regions near the stoichiometry, respectively. A second transition was observed with the creation of GeSe ethane-like structures, which are only present in strongly Se-deficient networks. Fitting dn/dT values with a simplified version of the thermal Lorentz-Lorenz formulation yielded a linear relation between the quantity (n(-3).dn/dT) and the CTE, which can be used to predict compositions with the near-zero dn/dT required for athermal optical systems.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2041-1286	2041-1294		WOS:000383761100014		
J	Thavarajah, Dil; Thavarajah, Pushparajah; Abare, Alex; Basnagala, Suranga; Lacher, Craig; Smith, Powell; Combs, Gerald F., Jr.								Mineral micronutrient and prebiotic carbohydrate profiles of USA -grown kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala)								JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS				52				9	15		10.1016/j.jfca.2016.07.003			SEP 2016	2016	Kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala.) is a leafy green brassica vegetable, the production levels of which have increased over the past 10 years due to increased demand by North American consumers. Kale is perceived to be highly nutritious leafy green vegetable even though its nutrient profile has not been well characterized to date. The objective of this study was to determine the nutritional composition (energy, protein, mineral, and prebiotic carbohydrate concentrations) of 25 different kale genotypes grown in Pelion, South Carolina, USA, and assess its potential as a whole food source of daily essential minerals and dietary fiber. The results of this study show a single 100 g serving of fresh kale can provide a significant percentage of the recommended daily intake of mineral micronutrients (188-873 mg K; 35-300 mg Ca; 20-100 mg Mg) identified by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee as being underconsumed by Americans. This serving of kale can also provide approximately 0.4-6.7 g of prebiotic carbohydrates, including sugar alcohols (45.4-59.8 mg), simple sugars (0.4-3348 mg), and hemicellulose (245-703 mg). Fresh kale is a low calorie food (36-98 kcal/100 g) with moderate levels of protein (1.6-5.9 g/100 g). Among the genotypes studied, 'Frizzy Lizzy', 'Dauro' and 'Fizz' have significantly high levels of essential minerals and prebiotic carbohydrates, moderate protein content, and low caloric value. These data confirm that kale is a whole food that can provide significant quantities of daily essential minerals and prebiotic carbohydrates. By genetic and location sourcing, the nutritional quality of kale could be further enhanced to benefit North American consumers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the abundant waste heat in the mid-temperature range poses a challenge; namely, how and to what extent the service temperature of Bi2Te3-based alloys can be upshifted to the mid-temperature regime. We report herein a synergistic optimization procedure for Indium doping and hot deformation that combines intrinsic point defect engineering, band structure engineering and multiscale microstructuring. Indium doping modulated the intrinsic point defects, broadened the band gap and thus suppressed the detrimental bipolar effect in the mid-temperature regime; in addition, hot deformation treatment rendered a multiscale microstructure favorable for phonon scattering and the donor-like effect helped optimize the carrier concentration. As a result, a peak value of zT of similar to 1.4 was attained at 500 K, with a state-of-the-art average zT(av) of similar to 1.3 between 400 and 600 K in Bi0.3Sb1.625In0.075Te3. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multiple synergies that can also be applied to optimize other thermoelectric materials.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000383415300001

Bullying and Harassment of Students With Disabilities in Schools: Legal Considerations and Policy Formation								REMEDIAL AND SPECIAL EDUCATION				37	5			274	284		10.1177/0741932515614967			SEP-OCT 2016	2016	Bullying is a common occurrence in U.S.'s schools and is currently at the forefront of national attention. Unfortunately, students with disabilities are frequently the targets of peer-on-peer bullying. The purpose of this article is to examine the legal ramifications when students with disabilities are bullied in school settings. We address court cases, state educational agency decisions, Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) guidance, and Office of Civil Rights (OCR) rulings that have held that bullying may violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. School personnel must address the bullying of students with disabilities in a quick and efficient manner. In fact, these decisions show that when bullying is not stopped, school district officials and personnel may be subjecting their school districts to legal risks. We end by proposing how school district officials can develop legally sound policies for identifying, investigating, and responding to incidences of bullying of students with disabilities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0741-9325	1538-4756		WOS:000383389800002

Using controlled parameters, we aim to examine the sensitivity of specific biomechanical, electrical, and biological tests in detecting mild damage to collagen. Fresh porcine pulmonary heart valves were treated with an enzyme, collagenase, and incubated using various times. Controls received no incubation. All valves were cryopreserved and stored at -135 A degrees C until being rewarmed for evaluation using biomechanical, permeability, and cell viability tests. Statistically significant time dependent changes in leaflet ultimate stress, (p = 0.006), permeability (p = 0.01), and viability (p aecurrency sign 0.02, four different days of culture) were found between heart valves subjected to 0-15 min of collagenase treatment (ANOVA). However, no statistical significance was found between the tensile modulus of treated and untreated valves (p = 0.07). Furthermore, the trends of decreasing and increasing ultimate stress and viability, respectively, were somewhat inconsistent across treatment times. These results suggest that permeability tests may offer a sensitive, quantitative assay to complement traditional biomechanical and viability tests in evaluating processing methods used for soft tissue allografts, or when making changes to current validated methods. Multiple test evaluation may also offer insight into the mechanism of potential tissue damage such as, as is the case here, reduced collagen content and increased tissue porosity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1389-9333	1573-6814		WOS:000382848000018	27130199

Patterns of population structure and dispersal in the long-lived "redwood" of the coral reef, the giant barrel sponge (Xestospongia muta)								CORAL REEFS				35	3			1097	1107		10.1007/s00338-016-1435-y			SEP 2016	2016	Sponges are one of the dominant fauna on Florida and Caribbean coral reefs, with species diversity often exceeding that of scleractinian corals. Despite the key role of sponges as structural components, habitat providers, and nutrient recyclers in reef ecosystems, their dispersal dynamics are little understood. We used ten microsatellite markers to study the population structure and dispersal patterns of a prominent reef species, the giant barrel sponge (Xestospongia muta), the long-lived "redwood" of the reef, throughout Florida and the Caribbean. F-statistics, exact tests of population differentiation, and Bayesian multi-locus genotype analyses revealed high levels of overall genetic partitioning (F (ST) = 0.12, P = 0.001) and grouped 363 individuals collected from the Bahamas, Honduras, US Virgin Islands, Key Largo (Florida), and the remainder of the Florida reef tract into at minimum five genetic clusters (K = 5). Exact tests, however, revealed further differentiation, grouping sponges sampled from five locations across the Florida reef tract (similar to 250 km) into three populations, suggesting a total of six genetic populations across the eight locations sampled. Assignment tests showed dispersal over ecological timescales to be limited to relatively short distances, as the only migration detected among populations was within the Florida reef tract. Consequently, populations of this major coral reef benthic constituent appear largely self-recruiting. A combination of levels of genetic differentiation, genetic distance, and assignment tests support the important role of the Caribbean and Florida currents in shaping patterns of contemporary and historical gene flow in this widespread coral reef species.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0722-4028	1432-0975		WOS:000382019400038		
J	Khoshkbar-Sadigh, Arash; Dargahi, Vahid; Corzine, Keith								New Flying-Capacitor-Based Multilevel Converter With Optimized Number of Switches and Capacitors for Renewable Energy Integration								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION				31	3			846	859		10.1109/TEC.2015.2508481			SEP 2016	2016	The flying-capacitor-based multilevel converter is one of the well-known breeds of the multilevel power converters. This paper proposes a new flying-capacitor-based multilevel converter to minimize the number of flying capacitors (FCs) and power switches. The advantage of the proposed FC-based multilevel converter in comparison with the conventional flying-capacitor multicell converter is that it needs fewer FCs. Also, in comparison with the stacked multicell converter, the proposed multilevel converter requires fewer semiconductor switches. In order to balance the voltage of the FCs in proposed multilevel converter, a new active voltage balancing method which is fully implemented using logic-form equations is presented. The proposed voltage balancing method measures output current and FC voltages to generate switching states to produce the required output voltage level, as well as balance the FCs voltages at their reference values. The output voltage of the proposed multilevel converter controlled with suggested active voltage balancing method can be modulated with any pulse-width-modulation (PWM) method, such as phase-shifted-carrier PWM or level-shifted-carrier PWM. Simulation results and experimental measurements of proposed FC-based multilevel converter are presented to verify the performance of the proposed converter, and its novel switching and modulation strategy, which is based on the active voltage balancing method.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0885-8969	1558-0059		WOS:000383177100003		
J	Shealy, Tripp; Klotz, Leidy; Weber, Elke U.; Johnson, Eric J.; Bell, Ruth Greenspan								Using Framing Effects to Inform More Sustainable Infrastructure Design Decisions								JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT				142	9						10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001152			SEP 2016	2016	Decision aids, ranging from rating systems to design software to regulatory standards, guide the design and evaluation of infrastructure projects. To present the information in these decision aids, there must first be some options such as, attributes are or are not presented, and, just as in other domains, these factors are likely to influence decisions in infrastructure development. The authors of this paper seek to better understand how choice structures influence engineering decisions. Prospect theory, which is well established in the behavioral sciences, asserts that people tend to think of possible outcomes relative to their starting point, not the resulting end point. For instance, framing a decision outcome as a loss in value (rather than a gain) can reduce the decision makers' acceptance of risk and, in turn, lead to more conservative outcomes. To measure framing effects in engineering decisions, this paper uses the Envision rating system for sustainable infrastructure, which aims to help civil engineers achieve the highest feasible sustainability performance in their projects. The hypothesis is that Envision's framework inadvertently limits the likelihood that engineers will set the highest achievable goals for sustainability. In the current framework, engineers start with zero points and achieve points when design considerations move beyond conventional construction standards. In this modified experimental version, a higher benchmark is set. Engineers are endowed points and can lose them for not maintaining high goals for sustainability. Engineering professionals (n=65) used Envision to make tradeoffs about site programming and functionality for a rural redevelopment project. Participants were randomly assigned the standard version (n=33) or the experimental version (n=32). The experimental group achieved 66% of points compared with the standard group's 51% (p<0.01). These results indicate that a choice posed as a loss rather than a gain significantly improved engineers' consideration for sustainability achievement. The findings suggest the need for more thoughtfully designed decision aids, with guidance from established behavioral science. This type of interdisciplinary research holds the potential to yield relatively low-cost solutions that support greater sustainability in infrastructure development.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0733-9364	1943-7862		WOS:000383131000011

Specifically, it examines qualitative case study research findings and student examples from a dance artist-in-residence that explored curricular content using dance as its primary mode of enquiry and expression. Throughout the residency, students constructed meaning through their dance experiences in dynamic and autonomous ways, exhibiting complex literacy practices of enquiry and communication. Focusing on the kindergarten student participants' experiences, the authors highlight three themes in their dance literacy practices: (a) artistic autonomy, (b) embodied knowledge and (c) multimodality. As embodied knowledge, dance innately allowed for integrative literacy possibilities in the dance residency. The dance experiences observed and referenced in this research illustrate the complexities of dance as literacy, as both a unique literacy and in meaning making across literacies. Drawing on the findings of this study, the authors seek to inspire teachers to foster similar experiences to develop transformative literacy practices individually in their classrooms and collaboratively in their schools.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1468-7984	1741-2919		WOS:000382959000003		
J	Rahman, S. M. Mizanoor; Ikeura, Ryojun								Cognition-Based Control and Optimization Algorithms for Optimizing Human-Robot Interactions in Power-Assisted Object Manipulation								JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				32	5			1325	1344					SEP 2016	2016	This article investigates the necessity of inclusion of cognitive information regarding weight perception in the control algorithm of a power assist robotic system (PARS) for object manipulation, and presents optimization algorithms to determine optimum human-robot interactions (HRI) and manipulation performance for the system. Two dynamics models for lifting objects with the system are derived. One model does not include weight perception, but another model does include it. Two different admittance control algorithms based on two dynamics models are derived. A comprehensive evaluation scheme is derived to evaluate the system for HRI and manipulation performance, and optimization algorithms are derived to determine optimum HRI and performance. A test-bed PARS is developed to verify the control and optimization algorithms. During the experiments, the human subjects lift an object with the system for each control algorithm separately. Results show that the system characteristics are unsatisfactory, power assistance is unclear and optimum HRI is not achievable for the control that does not include weight perception. However, power assistance is quantified clearly and optimum HRI is achieved with satisfactory manipulation performance when the control includes weight perception. We then propose to use the results to develop control algorithms of power assist robots to assist humans manipulating heavy objects in industries that may provide optimum HRI and performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1016-2364			WOS:000383218900011		
J	Dunning, Anne; Dey, Kakan Chandra; Chowdhury, Mashrur								Review of State DOTs Policies for Overweight Truck Fees and Relevant Stakeholders' Perspectives								JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS				22	3					05016002	10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000295			SEP 2016	2016	Of all roadway vehicles, trucks inflict the greatest deterioration to pavements and bridges owing to their heavy gross weights and axle loads. States issue permits to trucks beyond legal weight limits and collect fees to compensate for additional damage. To study the extent to which state departments of transportation (DOTs) have allowed passage of overweight loads, the first objective of this paper was to characterize overweight load permit practices among all U.S. states, and the second objective was to identify stakeholders' perspectives on how to modernize current overweight permit practices. Through an analysis of existing fee policies, this research has characterized the state of the practice in permit fees for overweight loads on public roadways, and evaluated these practices. The subsequent data showed a wide array of policies on overweight permitting, such that a single interstate overweight freight trip might encounter several diverse overweight permitting policies. Although the range of weights permitted with overweight permits can lead to substantial infrastructure damage, the median user-fee for a flat-rate annual overweight permit was only $250 without any limit on maximum allowable number of trips. In this paper, the authors discuss permitting structures, the prevalence of each type of structure in the United States, and the values assigned to permits. In practice, policymakers, rather than engineering and economic studies, have usually set fees. Several interviews were conducted in South Carolina as a case study to assess stakeholders' perspectives on overweight truck fee policies in the state. South Carolina charged $30 for a single-trip permit and $100 for an annual permit at the time of the study. Overweight policies among all states showed no clear or consistent relationship between the cost of an annual permit and the fee imposed for a single trip. For example, the South Carolina annual permit fee equated to 3.33 times the single-trip permit fee, whereas an Ohio study found that annual permit holders made an average of 24.8 trips with annual permits. Policy makers should evaluate the number of trips and miles that annual-permit holders incur before establishing annual permit fees. A recent study in South Carolina found that damage costs for loads exceeding highway standards were higher than overweight fees covered. Interviews with stakeholders showed that, fundamentally, South Carolina's trucking stakeholders did not hold common ideas on the objective of overweight permits and fee structures. South Carolina will not likely find fee revisions and increases politically viable until a consensus develops around the objective of overweight permitting and fees. The South Carolina DOT and trucking industry representatives should work together in an ongoing focus group to develop common understanding of issues, consensus around objectives, and provisions for fairness that will address industry concerns. This paper's findings on South Carolina stakeholders' perspectives will provide input to other regions in the country that are considering revising overweight trucking fees.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-0342	1943-555X		WOS:000383159300007

Nevertheless, spindle whorls may have much more to contribute to archaeological interpretations of production, status, and exchange patterns than previously acknowledged. The case study presented here examines the spindle whorl collection from the site of El Purgatorio, Peru, the capital city of the Casma polity (ca. A.D. 700-1400). Spindle whorls were not only expertly crafted utilitarian tools for spinning yarn, but also items of personal adornment, symbols of wealth or status, and possible indicators of intra-polity exchange patterns. The analysis of spindle whorls in regard to form and function provides insight into Casma social and economic organization. The spindle whorls discovered at El Purgatorio also reflect varying degrees of standardization and technical knowledge, suggesting that at least some may have been manufactured by specialists in metallurgical and ceramic workshops.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1045-6635			WOS:000383215100008

A review of the literature reveals different compositions reported with varying physical properties, which depend strongly on the exact composition as well as the processing conditions. We therefore initiated an approach whereby single crystals of two different (K, Ba)(16)(Ga, Sn)(136) compositions were first obtained, followed by grinding of the crystals into fine powder for low temperature spark plasma sintering consolidation into dense polycrystalline solids and subsequent high temperature transport measurements. Powder X-ray refinement results indicate that the hexakaidecahedra are empty, K and Ba occupying only the decahedra. Their electrical properties depend on composition and have very low thermal conductivities. The structural and transport properties of these materials are compared to that of other Sn clathrate-II compositions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1996-1944			WOS:000382262000022

The article concludes by claiming that narrative tends to explain by ordering particulars in recognizable ways while the new archaeological approach intervenes in that process of explanation to put it in question and remind us of the ways in which narrative cannot but distort the past.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-696X	1751-6978		WOS:000383110500006

Then we show that the pairs (inv, Bt-max), (sor, Cyc), and (maj, Cbt-max) are equidistributed. Our results extend the result of Bjorner and Wachs and generalize results for permutations. We also introduce analogous statistics for signed labeled forests and show equidistribution results which generalize results for signed permutations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, why do only some identify superordinately? I argue that personality is an important determinant. I test this using an original survey in the United Kingdom, where European Union integration has increased the salience and feasibility of the European identity option in addition to a national one. Several Big Five traits matter: openness and extraversion increase identification with Europe while agreeableness decreases it. Mediation analysis subsequently shows that personality's effects also travel through the mechanisms of risk aversion, knowledge, and ideology.

Precision-feeding dairy heifers a high rumen-degradable protein diet with different proportions of dietary fiber and forage-to-concentrate ratios								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				99	9			7175	7190		10.3168/jds.2016-11190			SEP 2016	2016	The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of feeding a high-rumen-degradable protein (RDP) diet when dietary fiber content is manipulated within differing forage-to-concentrate ratio (F:C) on nutrient utilization of precision-fed dairy heifers. Six cannulated Holstein heifers (486.98 +/- 15.07 kg of body weight) were randomly assigned to 2 F:C, low- (45% forage; LF) and high-forage (90% forage; HF) diets and to a fiber proportion sequence [33% grass hay and wheat straw (HS), 67% corn silage (CS; low fiber); 50% HS, 50% CS (medium fiber); and 67% HS, 33% CS (high fiber)] within forage proportion administered according to a split-plot, 3 x 3 Latin square design (16-d periods). Heifers fed LF had greater apparent total tract organic matter digestibility coefficients (dC), neutral detergent fiber, and cellulose than those fed LC diets. Substituting CS with HS resulted in a linear reduction in dry matter, organic matter, and cellulose dC. Nitrogen dC was not different between F:C or with increasing proportions of HS in diets, but N retention tended to decrease linearly as HS was increased in the diets. Predicted microbial protein flow to the duodenum decreased linearly with HS addition and protozoa numbers HS interacted linearly, exhibiting a decrease as HS increased for LF, whereas no effects were observed for HF. Blood urea N increased linearly as HS was incorporated. The LF-fed heifers had a greater ruminal volatile fatty acids concentration. We noted a tendency for a greater dry matter, and a significantly higher liquid fraction turnover rate for HF diets. There was a linear numerical increase in the liquid and solid fraction turnover rate as fiber was added to the diets. Rumen fermentation parameters and fractional passages (solid and liquid) rates support the reduction in dC, N retention, and microbial protein synthesis observed as more dietary fiber is added to the rations of dairy heifers precision-fed a constant proportion of rumen degradable protein.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000381326400030	27372585

This study (a) utilized latent profile modeling to classify students into three different strategic developmental levels in solving fraction comparison problems and (b) accordingly provided differentiated strategic training for students starting from two different strategic developmental levels. In Study 1 we assessed 49 middle school students' performance on fraction comparison problems and categorized students into three clusters of strategic developmental clusters: a cross-multiplication cluster with the highest accuracy, a representation strategy cluster with medium accuracy, and a whole-number strategy cluster with the lowest accuracy. Based on the strategic developmental levels identified in Study 1, in Study 2 we selected three students from the whole-number strategy cluster and another three students from the representation strategy cluster and implemented a differentiated strategic training intervention within a multiple-baseline design. Results showed that both groups of students transitioned from less advanced to more advanced strategies and improved their problem-solving accuracy during the posttest, the maintenance test, and the generalization test.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2194	1538-4780		WOS:000382435800005	25510800	
J	Kruis, Anne-Marie; Spekle, Roland F.; Widener, Sally K.								The Levers of Control Framework: An exploratory analysis of balance								MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING RESEARCH				32				27	44		10.1016/j.mar.2015.12.002			SEP 2016	2016	The impact of the Levers of Control (LOC) framework on the accounting literature is undeniably large. The framework, however, has also been criticized for being vague and ambiguous. One of the central, but unclear, concepts in the LOC framework is the notion of balance. That is, the framework holds that control systems must be in balance in order to manage competing tensions such as that found between predictable goal achievement on the one hand and innovation on the other. The goal of our study is to examine the concept of balance and to provide empirically informed insights on different balancing arrangements that exist in a cross-section of business units. We develop a survey and administer it in person to a convenience sample of business unit managers. Using responses from 217 managers, cluster analysis reveals a stable solution with four distinct patterns of balance, which we interpret using configurational thinking. We label the clusters strategic vigilance, strategic exploitation, strategic responsiveness, and strategic stability respectively, and examine organizational and contextual factors that validate and help explain the observed patterns of balance. By identifying empirical manifestations of balance, our study sheds light on one of the key concepts in the LOC framework, providing an empirically informed starting point for future theoretical analysis and interpretation.

J	Kothari, Anmol; Chauhan, Vishal S.; Misra, Ashok; Abbas, Syed; Kumar, Rajeev								Effect of strain hardening on the electromagnetic radiation during plastic deformation of metals and alloys beyond yield point								NONLINEAR DYNAMICS				85	4			2687	2704		10.1007/s11071-016-2855-5			SEP 2016	2016	This paper presents a theoretical model to analyze and predict the electromagnetic radiation (EMR) during the strain hardening of metals with negligible Peierls stress. The model developed is validated by comparing it with the experimental results on the ASTM B265 grade 2 titanium reported earlier. It is observed that inclusion of time-varying stress is essential to studying EMR occurring during strain hardening. The model confirms the observation that the amplitude of oscillatory EMR is generally much larger than the amplitude of exponential EMR. Further, the variation in viscous damping as a function of strain during strain hardening too has been incorporated in the model. The nature as well as amplitude of the EMR calculated by this model matches well with the earlier reported results on titanium. The model is thus suitable for studying the EMR during plastic deformation of metals and alloys with negligible Peierls stress.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0924-090X	1573-269X		WOS:000382399000040

Fitness and Competitive Ability of Botrytis cinerea Isolates with Resistance to Multiple Chemical Classes of Fungicides								PHYTOPATHOLOGY				106	9			997	1005		10.1094/PHYTO-02-16-0061-R			SEP 2016	2016	Resistance to multiple chemical classes of fungicides in Botrytis cinerea isolates from eastern United States strawberry fields is common and strategies to control them are needed. In this study, we compared fitness and competitive ability of eight sensitive isolates (S), eight isolates resistant to five or six chemical classes of fungicides but not to phenylpyrroles (5CCR), and eight isolates resistant to six or seven chemical classes including phenylpyrroles (6CCR/MDR1h). The latter included the MDR1h phenotype due to overexpression of atrB based on Delta 497V/L in mrr1. The 6CCR/MDR1h isolates grew more slowly at 4 degrees C on potato dextrose agar, and both 5CCR and 6CCR/MDR1h isolates were hypersensitive to osmotic stress compared with S isolates. In contrast, no differences were found in oxidative sensitivity, aggressiveness, and spore production in vivo, and sclerotia production and viability in vitro. In competition experiments, the 5CCR and 6CCR/MDR1h isolates were both outcompeted by S isolates and 6CCR/MDR1h isolates were outcompeted by 5CCR isolates in the absence of fungicide pressure. Under selective pressure of a fiudioxonil/pyraclostrobin rotation, the 6CCR/MDR1h isolates dominated after coinoculation with 5CCR and S isolates. The competitive disadvantage of 5CCR and especially 6CCR/MDR1h isolates suggest that, in the absence of fungicide selection pressure, S isolates may reduce inoculum potential of multifungicide-resistant isolates under field conditions.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0031-949X	1943-7684		WOS:000381246400007	27161219	
J	Parmar, Dhaval; Bertrand, Jeffrey; Babu, Sabarish V.; Madathil, Kapil; Zelaya, Melissa; Wang, Tianwei; Wagner, John; Gramopadhye, Anand K.; Frady, Kristin								A comparative evaluation of viewing metaphors on psychophysical skills education in an interactive virtual environment								VIRTUAL REALITY				20	3			141	157		10.1007/s10055-016-0287-7			SEP 2016	2016	In an empirical evaluation, we examined the effect of viewing condition on psychophysical skills education in an interactive 3D simulation to train users in electrical circuitry. We compared an immersive head-mounted display (HMD)-based viewing metaphor versus a limited, desktop-based virtual reality (DVR) viewing metaphor with interaction using a spatial user interface. Psychophysical skills education involves the association of cognitive functions with motor functions to make the task autonomous with repeated practice. In electrical circuitry, this is demonstrated by the fine movements involved in handling and manipulating components on the electrical circuit, particularly while measuring electrical parameters. We created an interactive circuitry simulation (IBAS) where participants could learn about electrical measurement instruments such as the ammeter, voltmeter and multimeter, in a simulated breadboard VR system. Twenty-four participants utilized the simulation (12 in each condition), and the quantitative and qualitative aspects of psychophysical skills education with respect to the viewing metaphor were examined. Each viewing condition in IBAS was head-tracked and non-stereoscopic. Perspective correction was coupled with head-tracking in the DVR condition. The key quantitative measures were cognitive questionnaires addressing different levels of Bloom's cognitive taxonomy and a real-world psychophysical task addressing various levels of Dave's psychomotor taxonomy. The qualitative measures were the Witmer-Singer sense of presence questionnaire and self-report. Results suggest that there was a significant increase in cognition post-experiment in both DVR and HMD viewing conditions in levels of knowledge, application, analysis and evaluation. Results also revealed a significant learning benefit with respect to the higher level concepts pertaining to evaluation in the HMD condition as compared to DVR. Participants seem to have enjoyed a greater level of affordance in task performance and spent a larger amount of time to complete the simulated exercises as well as manually maneuvered to further distances in the HMD viewing condition as compared to DVR viewing.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-4338	1434-9957		WOS:000382645300001

Crystal structure of BaMnB2O5 containing structurally isolated manganese oxide sheets								ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION E-CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC COMMUNICATIONS				72				1315	+		10.1107/S2056989016013074			SEP 2016	2016	In an attempt to search for mixed alkaline-earth and transition metal pyroborates, the title compound, barium manganese(II) pyroborate, has been synthesized by employing a flux method. The structure of BaMnB2O5 is composed of MnO5 square pyramids that form Mn2O8 dimers by edge-sharing and of pyroborate units ([B2O5](4-)) that are composed of two corner-sharing trigonal-planar BO3 units. These building blocks share corners to form infinity(2)[MnB2O5](2-) layers extending parallel to (100). The Ba2+ cations reside in the gap between two manganese pyroborate slabs with a coordination number of nine. The title compound forms an interesting spiral framework propagating along the 2(1) screw axis. The structure is characterized by two alternating layers, which is relatively rare among known transition-metal-based pyroborate compounds.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2056-9890			WOS:000382301000022	27920925	
J	Dang, Viet D.; Walters, David M.; Leey, Cindy M.								ASSESSING ATMOSPHERIC CONCENTRATION OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS BY EVERGREEN RHODODENDRON MAXIMUM NEXT TO A CONTAMINATED STREAM								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				35	9			2192	2198		10.1002/etc.3404			SEP 2016	2016	Conifers are often used as an air passive sampler, but few studies have focused on the implication of broadleaf evergreens to monitor atmospheric semivolatile organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In the present study, the authors used Rhododendron maximum (rhododendron) growing next to a contaminated stream to assess atmospheric PCB concentrations. The present study area was located in a rural setting and approximately 2 km downstream of a former capacitor plant. Leaves from the same mature shrubs were collected in late fall 2010 and winter and spring 2011. Polychlorinated biphenyls were detected in the collected leaves, suggesting that rhododendron can be used as air passive samplers in rural areas where active sampling is impractical. Estimated SPCB (47 congeners) concentrations in the atmosphere decreased from fall 2010 to spring 2011 with concentration means at 3990 pgm(-3), 2850 pgm(-3), and 931 pgm(-3) in fall 2010, winter 2011, and spring 2011, respectively. These results indicate that the atmospheric concentrations at this location continue to be high despite termination of active discharge from the former industrial source. Leaves had a consistent pattern of high concentrations of tetra-CBs and penta-CBs similar to the congener distribution in polyethylene passive samplers deployed in the water column, suggesting that volatilized PCBs from the stream were the primary source of contaminants in rhododendron leaves.

J	Wang, Yue								Regret-Based Automated Decision-Making Aids for Domain Search Tasks Using Human-Agent Collaborative Teams								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY				24	5			1680	1695		10.1109/TCST.2015.2508963			SEP 2016	2016	In this paper, we consider domain search tasks using a human-agent collaborative team. An automated Bayesian sequential decision-making strategy is first proposed for the optimal allocation of manual and autonomous sensing modes in the presence of sensing uncertainty. An agent will generate a request for human intervention whenever the manual mode is deemed optimal. However, this type of optimal strategy is not always the style of human decision making under uncertainty. In particular, regret has been shown to play a critical role in human's rational decision making. Humans experience regret when they perceive that they are better off with another option and tend to make choices to avoid such experience. Furthermore, it has been shown that team members who share the same mental model perform better than teams with a more accurate but less similar mental model. Therefore, to enable more effective humanagent collaboration (HAC) and improve joint performance, we embed regret analysis into the proposed decision-making framework to provide suboptimal but more humanlike automated decision aids. We will reconcile the dominant Bayesian methods with the analysis of human behaviors during decision making. We provide the simulation results to compare the decision-making strategies with and without regret analysis and show that regret-based decision making can integrate human tendency in risk averse and risk seeking for better HAC.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6536	1558-0865		WOS:000381506100012		
J	Fu, Chenyi; Zhu, Ning; Ling, Shuai; Ma, Shoufeng; Huang, Yongxi								Heterogeneous sensor location model for path reconstruction								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL				91				77	97		10.1016/j.trb.2016.04.013			SEP 2016	2016	A new traffic sensor location problem is developed and solved by strategically placing both passive and active sensors in a transportation network for path reconstruction. Passive sensors simply count vehicles, while active sensors can recognize vehicle plates but are more expensive. We developed a two-stage heterogeneous sensor location model to determine the most cost-effective strategies for sensor deployment. The first stage of the model adopts the path reconstruction model defined by Castillo et al. (2008b) to determine the optimal locations of active sensors in the network. In the second stage, an algebraic framework is developed to strategically replace active sensors so that the total installation cost can be reduced while maintaining path flow observation quality. Within the algebraic framework, a scalar product operator is introduced to calculate path flows. An extension matrix is generated and used to determine if a replacement scheme is able to reconstruct all path flows. A graph model is then constructed to determine feasible replacement schemes. The problem of finding the optimal replacement scheme is addressed by utilizing the theory of maximum clique to obtain the upper bound of the number of replaced sensors and then revising this upper bound to generate the optimal replacement scheme. A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed to solve the maximum clique problem, and the optimal replacement scheme can be obtained accordingly. Three numerical experiments show that our proposed two-stage method can reduce the total costs of transportation surveillance systems without affecting the system monitor quality. The locations of the active sensors play a more critical role than the locations of the passive sensors in the number of reconstructed paths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Photobiological transformation of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) using Rhodobacter sphaeroides								CHEMOSPHERE				159				138	144		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.05.056			SEP 2016	2016	Pump-and-treat strategies for groundwater containing explosives may be necessary when the contaminated water approaches sensitive receptors. This project investigated bacterial photosynthesis as a strategy for ex situ treatment, using light as the primary energy source to facilitate RDX transformation. The objective was to characterize the ability of photosynthetic Rhodobacter sphaeroides (strain ATCC (R) 17023 (TM)) to transform the high-energy explosive RDX. R. sphaeroides transformed 30 mu M RDX within 40 h under light conditions; RDX was not fully transformed in the dark (non-photosynthetic conditions), suggesting that photosynthetic electron transfer was the primary mechanism. Experiments with RDX demonstrated that succinate and malate were the most effective electron donors for photosynthesis, but glycerol was also utilized as a photosynthetic electron donor. RDX was transformed irrespective of the presence of carbon dioxide. The electron shuttling compound anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) increased transformation kinetics in the absence of CO2, when the cells had excess NADPH that needed to be re-oxidized because there was limited CO2 for carbon fixation. When CO2 was added, the cells generated more biomass, and AQDS had no stimulatory effect. End products indicated that RDX carbon became CO2, biomass, and a soluble, uncharacterized aqueous metabolite, determined using C-14-labeled RDX. These data are the first to suggest that photobiological explosives transformation is possible and will provide a framework for which phototrophy can be used in environmental restoration of explosives contaminated water.

While wastewater provides a concentrated source of nutrients, the presence of biological contaminants and the expense of heat treatment are challenging for large-scale production. The goal of this study was to use ultrafiltration to purify wastewater for use in the cultivation of microalgae. Swine waste was filtered, and the resulting permeate was utilized in a Porphyridium cruentum culture. Fluxes remained relatively constant during operation, and the complete rejection of bacteria was observed. The permeate contained high concentrations of total nitrogen (695.6 mg L-1) and total phosphorus (69.1 mg L-1). Higher biomass productivity and lipid contents were observed in the microalgae cultivated in the waste medium compared to that of a control medium. This suggests that, by using ultrafiltration as an alternative to heat treatment, agricultural wastewaters could be utilized as a nutrient source for microalgae. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Ephemeral wetlands have important ecological functions but information about their water quality over its flooding periods is relatively limited. In this study, the water chemistry and physical parameters of three ephemeral wetlands and their nearby water bodies, including first order and second order streams and groundwater in the Piedmont ecoregion of South Carolina, were closely monitored during their flooding periods from January to June 2012. Nutrient and water quality analyses demonstrated the chemistries of wetlands, stream, and groundwater were different from each other in spite of their proximity. Greater concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen with a major portion in humic-acid-like and fulvic-acid-like fractions were generally found in wetland waters. In contrast, significantly lower DOC concentrations with a greater portion of inorganic nitrogen were observed in stream and groundwater. Electrical conductivity at 25 degrees C (EC25) and temperature measurements showed a greater fluctuation in wetlands, indicating their poor buffering capacity against environmental changes. Results of this field study suggested that these small ephemeral wetlands in the Piedmont Ecoregion have relatively unique biogeochemistry in comparing their adjacent water bodies.

However, inequitable distribution of costs and benefits in communities surrounding protected areas can negatively impact livelihoods, increase wealth disparities and create conflict. To examine the potential for conflict between host communities involved in a community-based conservation program and neighbouring (non-host) communities, we explored local residents' attitudes towards conservation at Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary (TIWS) in Sierra Leone. Intercept surveys (n = 368) were conducted in 18 villages (eight host, ten non-host) within 8 km of TIWS during 2010. Results revealed significant differences between residents of the host and non-host villages with respect to attitudes towards resource use and overall support for site protection. The most substantial discrepancies centred on perceived benefits associated with TIWS, and these drastically different perspectives generated a high potential for conflict. To minimize conflict and foster broader community support for conservation, managers must carefully consider how benefits associated with protected areas are communicated and distributed across protected area-proximate landscapes.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0376-8929	1469-4387		WOS:000381271600005

We examined the effects of wireless sensor networks to precisely control irrigation based on substrate moisture in a 0.15-ha greenhouse producing cut-flower snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus). We calculated changes in yield, production time, quality, cost, revenue and profit using grower data on production, expenditures and sales, which included 3 years of data before and after implementation of sensor irrigation networks. Sensor-based irrigation was associated with a 62 % ($65,173 or $434,487 ha(-1)) increase in revenue and a 65 % ($35,327 or $325,513 ha(-1)) increase in profit per year. Sensor-based irrigation was also associated with increases in the quality and the number of stems harvested per crop. The time to first harvest and time to last harvest were reduced for all cultivar groups, indicating that the plants grew faster using sensor networks. Production time per crop was decreased, allowing 2.5 additional crops per year. Electricity usage was also reduced, likely due to less frequent irrigation using sensor networks. These results are in line with other benefits we have seen by installing sensor networks in other types of ornamental operations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0342-7188	1432-1319		WOS:000380670500005

A descriptive study of 26 LTCFs in South Carolina was conducted to determine the presence of environmental factors associated with transmission of human noroviruses. Sanitary conditions in one common area, one staff/visitor bathroom, and the main kitchen were assessed using two audit forms. While surfaces in all kitchens were in good sanitary condition, 23 LTCFs used quaternary ammonium-based sanitizers and three LTCFs used chlorine bleach for kitchen sanitization. All common areas were also dean and in good condition; however, 20 LTCFs had upholstered chairs, and five LTCFs had carpeted floors. Seven facilities used quaternary ammonium-based disinfectants exclusively, whereas six LTCFs used chlorine bleach exclusively, and eight LTCFs used both to disinfect common areas.

Understanding Disparities in Service Seeking Following Forcible Versus Drug- or Alcohol-Facilitated/Incapacitated Rape								JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE				31	14			2475	2491		10.1177/0886260515576968			SEP 2016	2016	Victims of drug- or alcohol-facilitated/incapacitated rape (DAFR/IR) are substantially less likely to seek medical, rape crisis, or police services compared with victims of forcible rape (FR); however, reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. The current study examined explanatory mechanisms in the pathway from rape type (FR vs. DAFR/IR) to disparities in post-rape service seeking (medical, rape crisis, criminal justice). Participants were 445 adult women from a nationally representative household probability sample who had experienced FR, DAFR/IR, or both since age 14. Personal characteristics (age, race, income, prior rape history), rape characteristics (fear, injury, loss of consciousness), and post-rape acknowledgment, medical concerns, and service seeking were collected. An indirect effects model using bootstrapped standard errors was estimated to examine pathways from rape type to service seeking. DAFR/IR-only victims were less likely to seek services compared with FR victims despite similar post-rape medical concerns. FR victims were more likely to report fear during the rape and a prior rape history, and to acknowledge the incident as rape; each of these characteristics was positively associated with service seeking. However, only prior rape history and acknowledgment served as indirect paths to service seeking; acknowledgment was the strongest predictor of service seeking. Diminished acknowledgment of the incident as rape may be especially important to explaining why DAFR/IR victims are less likely than FR victims to seek services. Public service campaigns designed to increase awareness of rape definitions, particularly around DAFR/IR, are important to reducing disparities in rape-related service seeking.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0886-2605	1552-6518		WOS:000380985700005	25846758

Single crystal X-ray diffraction and powder X-ray diffraction were utilized to characterize the structures, which both possess MnO4F2 building blocks. The A(2)Mn(2)V(2)O(7)F2 series crystallizes as a new structure type in space group Pbcn (No. 60), Z=4 (Rb(2)Mn(2)V(2)O(7)F2: a=7.4389 (17) angstrom, b=11.574(3) angstrom, c=10.914(2) angstrom; Cs2Mn2V2O7F2: a=7.5615(15) angstrom, b= 11.745(2) angstrom, c= 11.127(2) angstrom). The structure is composed of zigzag chains of edge-sharing MnO4F2 units running along the a-axis, and interconnected through V2O7 pyrovanadate groups. Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements on this interesting one-dimensional structural feature based on Mn2+ indicated that Cs2Mn2V2O7F2 is antiferromagnetic with a Neel temperature, T-N= similar to 3 K and a Weiss constant, theta, of -11.7 (1) K. Raman and infrared spectra were also analyzed to identify the fundamental V-O vibrational modes in Cs2Mn2V2O7F2. Mn-2(VO4)F crystalizes in the monoclinic space group of C2/c (no. 15), Z=8 with unit cell parameters of a=13.559(2) angstrom, b=6.8036(7) angstrom, c=10.1408(13) A and beta=116.16(3)degrees. The structure is associated with those of triplite and wagnerite. Dynamic fluorine disorder gives rise to complex alternating chains of five-and six-coordinate Mn2+. These interpenetrating chains are additionally connected through isolated VO4 tetrahedra to form the condensed structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Suppression of Bacterial Blight on Mustard Greens with Host Plant Resistance and Acibenzolar-S-Methyl								PLANT DISEASE				100	9			1921	1926		10.1094/PDIS-02-16-0202-RE			SEP 2016	2016	Bacterial blight, caused by Pseudomonas cannabina pv. alisalensis, attacks the leaves of most brassica vegetables, including mustard greens (Brassica juncea). 'Carolina Broadleaf,' a new mustard cultivar, is resistant to bacterial blight, whereas 'Florida Broadleaf,' a commonly grown cultivar, is susceptible. Acibenzolar-S-methyl (trade name Actigard) has been used to manage bacterial diseases caused by P. syringae on a variety of crops. The objective of this study was to evaluate host plant resistance and acibenzolar-S-methyl alone and in combination to manage bacterial blight. Three field experiments were done in spring and fall 2011 and fall 2014. In each experiment, acibenzolar-S-methyl was applied twice as a foliar spray, once before and once after plants were inoculated. Severity of bacterial blight was 81% less on nontreated Carolina Broadleaf than on nontreated Florida Broadleaf (P <= 0.0003). Acibenzolar-S-methyl applications reduced severity of bacterial blight by 55% compared with the water control treatment on susceptible Florida Broadleaf. Mean weight of diseased leaves, averaged across acibenzolar-S-methyl treatments, was 53% less with Carolina Broadleaf than with Florida Broadleaf (P < 0.0001). However, acibenzolar-S-methyl applied at the recommended rate (14.2 g/ha) significantly injured leaves of Carolina Broadleaf in two experiments and injured leaves of Florida Broadleaf in one experiment. Overall, host plant resistance was more effective than acibenzolar-S-methyl for managing bacterial blight on mustard greens.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000381658700014

Run-off-road and recovery - state estimation and vehicle control strategies								VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS				54	9			1317	1343		10.1080/00423114.2016.1200728			SEP 2016	2016	Despite many advances in vehicle safety technology, traffic fatalities remain a devastating burden on society. With over two-thirds of all fatal single-vehicle crashes occurring off the roadway, run-off-road (ROR) crashes have become the focus of much roadway safety research. Current countermeasures, including roadway infrastructure modifications and some on-board vehicle safety systems, remain limited in their approach as they do not directly address the critical factor of driver behaviour. It has been shown that ROR crashes are often the result of poor driver performance leading up to the crash. In this study, the performance of two control algorithms, sliding control and linear quadratic control, was investigated for use in an autonomous ROR vehicle recovery system. The two controllers were simulated amongst a variety of ROR conditions where typical driver performance was inadequate to safely operate the vehicle. The sliding controller recovered the fastest within the nominal conditions but exhibited large variability in performance amongst the more extreme ROR scenarios. Despite some small sacrifices in lateral error and yaw rate, the linear quadratic controller demonstrated a higher level of consistency and stability amongst the various conditions examined. Overall, the linear quadratic controller recovered the vehicle 25% faster than the sliding controller while using 70% less steering, which combined with its robust performance, indicates its high potential as an autonomous ROR countermeasure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0042-3114	1744-5159		WOS:000380156800007

In this work, Yb-filled CoSb3 (bulk matrix/host)-Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 (secondary inclusion) thermoelectric nanocomposites have been synthesized via an ex situ process. Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 inclusions are mainly distributed at the grain boundaries of Yb0.2Co4Sb12 matrix in the composites. In particular, Te diffuses in situ from Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 through Yb0.2Co4Sb12 matrix during the hot pressing process. This, combined with the grain boundary effect, results in favorable changes in the carrier concentration, carrier mobility, electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity. Such synergistic changes are notably absent in the stand-alone Te-doped Yb-filled CoSb3, suggesting the key role of diffusion and grain boundaries. As a result, a maximum ZT value of 0.96 has been attained for Yb0.2Co4Sb12-2 wt Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 at 650 K. The present work opens a new avenue towards high performance thermoelectric composites via controlled inter-constituent diffusion and grain boundary effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Nguyen, Minh-Hiep; Nguyen, Thi-Huynh-Nga; Hwang, In-Cheon; Bui, Chi-Bao; Park, Huyn-Lin								Effects of the physical state of nanocarriers on their penetration into the root and upward transportation to the stem of soybean plants using confocal laser scanning microscopy								CROP PROTECTION				87				25	30		10.1016/j.cropro.2016.04.012			SEP 2016	2016	We determined whether nanocarriers can penetrate into plant roots and be transported upward, from the root to stem, as well as studied the effect of the physical state of the lipid matrix of the nanocarriers on their penetration and transportation in plants. Firstly, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), and lipid-based nanoemulsions (NE) with similar characteristics (particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential) were successfully prepared by the combined method of hot homogenization and sonication, with beeswax as a solid lipid, corn oil as a liquid lipid, and Nile Red as a fluorescent active-ingredient. Penetration of nanocarriers into the roots and their transportation to the stem were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The images of vertical sections illustrated that NE penetrated into the root and was transported upward at a rate faster than did NLC and SLN, because of its relatively higher flexibility. While it took only 1 day for NE to penetrate into the center of the root and be transported upward to up to 4 cm of the stem, it took 3 and 6 days, respectively, for NLC and SLN to achieve the same. This study provides an important basic background required to generate a new generation of pesticide formulations, where pesticides will be encapsulated in nanocarriers, which in turn will be embedded into a patch that will be stuck on the root or stem. This would minimize pesticide loss, resulting in higher commercial profit and better environmental protection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TRANSPORT REVIEWS				36	5			558	584		10.1080/01441647.2016.1197337			SEP 2016	2016	Millennials, defined in this study as those born between 1979 and 2000, became the largest population segment in the United States in 2015. Compared to recent previous generations, they have been found to travel less, own fewer cars, have lower driver's licensure rates, and use alternative modes more. But to what extent will these differences in behaviour persist as millennials move through various phases of the lifecycle? To address this question, this paper presents the results of a longitudinal analysis of the 2003-2013 American Time Use Survey data series. In early adulthood, younger millennials (born 1988-1994) are found to spend significantly more time in-home than older millennials (born 1979-1985), which indicates that there are substantial differences in activity-time use patterns across generations in early adulthood. Older millennials are, however, showing activity-time use patterns similar to their prior generation counterparts as they age, although some differences - particularly in time spent as a car driver - persist. Millennials appear to exhibit a lag in adopting the activity patterns of predecessor generations due to delayed lifecycle milestones (e.g. completing their education, getting jobs, marrying, and having children) and lingering effects of the economic recession, suggesting that travel demand will resume growth in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0144-1647	1464-5327		WOS:000379945100002

System boundary was set as cradle-to-gate and functional unit was selected as 1 ton of final steel product. Among the processes, steel making process exhibited the highest total environmental impact, which was followed by sintering. The highest impacts were in the categories of human health and climate change. Coke production process showed the highest impact on depletion of non-renewable energy sources while it was with a negative contribution in the climate change category because of the avoided external energy consumption due to the production of coke oven gas within the facility. The comparison of the impacts for different final products revealed that hot rolled coil causes the highest total environmental impact followed by hot rolled wire rod, billet and slab. In an attempt to evaluate the effect of having different production scenarios implemented in the facility, three different scenarios representing three different production ratios of semi-finished (billet and slab) and finished (wire rod and coil) products were considered and it was found that the highest impact would come out if all the products were the finished ones and the hot rolling of casting products covers approximately 24% of the total environmental impacts of the full production cycle of one ton of product. Based on the assessment results, suggestions for sustainable production were made. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									1	1	0	0	0	2			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000379371200020		
J	Li, Gang; Zheng, Xuefei								Thermal energy storage system integration forms for a sustainable future								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				62				736	757		10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.076			SEP 2016	2016	There is an increasing awareness that there are limits to the availability of non-renewable resources, while there is an increasing energy demand throughout the world. This demand is expected to be satisfied through the efficient renewable energy in the near future. However, the world is facing the challenge of variable renewable energy outputs due to a stochastic feature of the energy sources. Thermal energy storage (TES) can be a good option for mitigating the effects of intermittent renewable resources on the networks. It can not only allow the increased renewable energy and night time low price electricity utilization, but also provide flexibility and ancillary services for managing future electricity supply/demand challenges. In this paper, various TES forms, including sensible, latent and sorption are explained and summarized for their performance enhancement. More importantly, from the perspective of sustainability, various integration forms for different applications are systematically introduced, such as TES integration with hot water supply, air conditioners and heat pumps, TES integration with building construction systems, and TES integration with power production cycles, cogeneration, food transport, solar cookers and vehicle systems for thermal comfort. Therefore, this study is beneficial to designing more sustainable thermal systems by the researchers and engineers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, a version of PAC called superfine PAC (S-PAC) has been under development. S-PAC has a smaller particle size and thus faster adsorption kinetics than conventionally sized PAC. Membrane coating performance of various S-PAC samples was evaluated by measuring adsorption of atrazine, a model micropollutant. S-PACs were created in-house from PACs of three different materials: coal, wood, and coconut shell. Milling time was varied to produce S-PACs pulverized with different amounts of energy. These had different particles sizes, but other properties (e.g. oxygen content), also differed. In pure water the coal based S-PACs showed superior atrazine adsorption; all milled carbons had over 90% removal while the PAC had only 45% removal. With addition of calcium and/or NOM, removal rates decreased, but milled carbons still removed more atrazine than PAC. Oxygen content and specific external surface area (both of which increased with longer milling times) were the most significant predictors of atrazine removal. S-PAC coatings resulted in loss of filtration flux compared to an uncoated membrane and smaller particles caused more flux decline than larger particles; however, the data suggest that NOM fouling is still more of a concern than S-PAC fouling. The addition of calcium improved the flux, especially for the longer-milled carbons. Overall the data show that when milling S-PAC with different levels of energy there is a tradeoff: smaller particles adsorb contaminants better, but cause greater flux decline. Fortunately, an acceptable balance may be possible; for example, in these experiments the coal-based S-PAC after 30 min of milling achieved a fairly high atrazine removal (overall 80%) with a fairly low flux reduction (under 30%) even in the presence of NOM. This suggests that relatively short duration (low energy) milling is viable for creating useful S-PAC materials applied in tandem with microfiltration.

Evolution of anisotropy in hierarchical porous ceramics during sinter-forging								JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN CERAMIC SOCIETY				36	12	SI		2937	2945		10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.12.042			SEP 2016	2016	When a body is sintered under non-hydrostatic stress (or strain) fields, anisotropic microstructures may develop which would have an impact on the performance of sintered products. In this study, we focus on the development of pore shape anisotropy during sintering forging. Several parameters were used to characterize the anisotropy of both intrinsic (small inter-particle pores) and extrinsic (large pores from the burnout of pore-formers). The effect of applied stress on grain growth was also investigated. As expected during sinter forging, the pore shape becomes anisotropic and the pores orient preferentially. The intrinsic pores preferentially align parallel while the extrinsic pores align perpendicular to the applied stress. For both intrinsic and extrinsic pores, the degree of anisotropy increases with applied stress, reaches a maximum and then decreases with further increase in stress. Applied stress leads to finer grain microstructures at a particular density. Possible explanations are proposed to explain these observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Underwater oil jet: Hydrodynamics and droplet size distribution								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				299				292	303		10.1016/j.cej.2016.04.061			SEP 1 2016	2016	We conducted a large scale experiment of underwater oil release of 6.3 L/s through a 25.4 mm (one inch) horizontal pipe. Detailed measurements of plume trajectory, velocity, oil droplet size distribution, and oil holdup were obtained. The obtained experimental data were used for the validation of the models JETLAG and VDROP-J. Key findings include: (1) formation of two plumes, one due to momentum and subsequently plume buoyancy, and another due mostly to the buoyancy of individual oil droplets that separate upward from the first plume; (2) modeling results indicated that the traditional miscible plume models matched the momentum and buoyancy plume, but were not able to simulate the upward motion plume induced by individual oil droplets; (3) high resolution images in the jet primary breakup region showed the formation of ligaments and drops in a process known as "primary breakup". These threads re-entered the plume to re-break in a process known as "secondary breakup"; (4) the plume velocity was highly heterogeneous with regions of high velocity surrounded by stagnant regions for various durations. The results from this study revealed that the primary breakup is a key factor for quantifying the droplet size distribution which plays a crucial role in determining the ultimate fate and transport of the released oil in the marine environment. The observed spatial heterogeneity in the oil plume implies that the effectiveness of applied dispersants may vary greatly when applying directly in the discharged oil flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, three week-old soil grown cucumber seedlings were foliar-exposed to nCeO(2), nCuO, and corresponding bulk counterparts at 50, 100, and 200 mg/L. Respective suspensions/solutions were sprayed to experimental units in a volume of 250 ml. Net photosynthesis rate (Po), stomatal conductance (Gs), and transpiration rate (E) were measured 15 days after treatment application and in 74 day-old plants. Yield, fruit characteristics (size, weight, and firmness), Ce, Cu, and nutritional elements were also measured. Results showed a nano-specific decrement on Pn (22% and 30%) and E (11% and 17%) in seedling leaves exposed to nCeO(2) and nCuO at 200 mg/L, respectively, compared with control, nCeO(2) at 50 mg/L, bCeO(2) at 200 mg/L, and all Cu treatments, except nCuO at 100 mg/L, significantly reduced fruit firmness (p <= 0.05), compared with control. However, nCuO at 200 mg/L and bCuO at 50 mg/L significantly increased fruit fresh weight (p <= 0.05). At 200 mg/L, nCeO(2) and bCeO(2) reduced fruit Zn by 25%, while nCuO and bCuO reduced fruit Mo by 51% and 44%, respectively, compared with control. This study has shown that when the route of exposure is the foliage, differences in particle size are less significant, compared to root-based exposure. To the authors knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of foliar application of nCeO(2) and nCuO upon yield and nutritional quality of cucumber. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A line and groove nano-pattern was applied by thermal embossing directly onto a commercial polyamide thin-film composite nanofiltration membrane. Poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDE) was reacted onto the patterned membrane surfaces by an epoxide ring opening reaction with unreacted carboxyl groups on the polyamide selective layer. Membrane performance was evaluated by measuring flux and salt rejection using a magnesium sulfate solution and by measuring flux reduction using an alginate solution. Surface characterization showed successful patterning and chemical modification of the membrane surface. Flux and salt rejection properties were unaffected by patterning the polyamide membrane surface directly. The fouling results show that combining line and groove nano-patterning with PEGDE chemical modification yields a membrane that is more resistant to fouling than either method alone.

Arabidopsis Kunitz-protease inhibitor 1 (Kunitz-PI;1), as we dubbed this protein here, is operative as cysteine Pl. Activity measurements revealed that despite the presence of the conserved Kunitz-motif the bacterially expressed Kunitz-PI;1 was unable to inhibit serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, but very efficiently inhibited the cysteine protease RESPONSIVE TO DESICCATION 21. Western blotting and cytolocalization studies using mono-specific antibodies recalled Kunitz-PI;1 protein expression in flowers, young siliques and etiolated seedlings. In dark-grown seedlings, maximum Kunitz-PI;1 promoter activity was detected in the apical hook region and apical parts of the hypocotyls. Immunolocalization confirmed Kunitz-PI;1 expression in these organs and tissues. No transmitting tract (NTT) and HECATE 1 (HEC1), two transcription factors previously implicated in the formation of the female reproductive tract in flowers of Arabidopsis, were identified to regulate Kunitz-PI;1 expression in the dark and during greening, with NTT acting negatively and HEC1 acting positively. Laboratory feeding experiments with isopod crustaceans such as Porcellio scaber (woodlouse) and Arrnadillidium vulgare (pillbug) pinpointed the apical hook as ethylene protected Achilles' heel of etiolated seedlings. Because exogenous application of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and mechanical stress (wounding) strongly up regulated HEC1 dependent Kunitz-PI;1 gene expression, our results identify a new circuit controlling herbivore deterrence of etiolated plants in which Kunitz-PI;1 is involved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-462X			WOS:000382121500001	27625656

To improve its potential application, fourteen 2,4-DAPG analogous were synthesized through the Friedel-Crafts reaction using acyl chlorides and phloroglucinol. Of the 2,4-DAPG derivatives, MP4 exhibited much higher antifungal activity against Penicillium digitatum and P. italicum, the major pathogenic fungi in citrus fruit, than 2, 4-DAPG in vitro, and significantly inhibited the development of decay in harvested mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco cv. Shatang.) fruit in vivo. It was found that MP4 resulted in the wrinkle of the hyphae in both fungi with serious folds and breakage. In addition, the expression of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes were also modified in both fungi by MP4, which might be associated with the disorder of cell membrane formation. Furthermore, the toxicology of MP4 by evaluating the cell proliferation effect on human normal lung epithelial (16HBE) and kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, was significantly lower than that of albesilate, a widely used fungicide in harvested citrus fruit. In summary, the synthesized MP4 has shown a great potential as a novel fungicide that might be useful for control of postharvest decay in citrus fruit.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000381968700002	27562341

Active parental care, reproductive performance, and a novel egg predator affecting reproductive investment in the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus								BMC Zoology				1							10.1186/s40850-016-0006-6			AUG 23 2016	2016	Background: We used the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus, one of the largest brooding invertebrates in the Western Atlantic, to test for the presence/absence of active parental care and to explore reproductive performance in large brooding marine organisms. Given [i] the compact and large embryo masses produced by P. argus, [ii] the expected disproportional increase in brooding costs with increasing embryo mass size, and [iii] the theoretical allometry of egg production with increasing body size, we predicted that parental females in this large species will engage in active brood care. We also predicted that larger broods from larger lobsters should suffer higher mortality and brood loss than smaller broods from smaller lobsters if parental care was minimal or absent. Lastly, we expected smaller females to allocate disproportionably more resources to egg production than larger females in the case of minimal parental care.Results: Females brooding early and late embryos were collected from different reefs in the Florida Keys Reef tract, transported to the laboratory, and maintained in separate aquaria to describe and quantify active parental care during day and night. A second set of females was retrieved from the field and their carapace length, fecundity, egg size, reproductive output and presence/absence of brood-dwelling pathogens was recorded. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that brooding females of P. argus engaged in active brood care. Females likely use some of the observed behaviors (e.g., abdominal flapping, pleopod beating) to provide oxygen to their brood mass. In Panulirus argus, females did not suffer brood loss during embryo development. Also, reproductive output increased more than proportionally with a unit increase in lobster body weight.Conclusions: Our results agree with the view that large brooding marine invertebrates can produce large embryo masses if they engage in active parental care and that the latter behavior greatly diminishes reproductive performance costs associated with producing large embryo masses. Lastly, we report on a nemertean worm that, we show, negatively impacts female reproductive performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2056-3132	2056-3132		BCI:BCI201700132236		
J	Wang, Xiaoxia; Cao, Min; Dong, Yuqing								Royal jelly promotes DAF-16-mediated proteostasis to tolerate beta-amyloid toxicity in C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease								ONCOTARGET				7	34			54183	54193		10.18632/oncotarget.10857			AUG 23 2016	2016	Numerous studies have demonstrated that dietary intervention may promote health and help prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently reported that bee products of royal jelly (RJ) and enzyme-treated royal jelly (eRJ) were potent to promote healthy aging in C. elegans. Here, we examined whether RJ/eRJ consumption may benefit to mitigate the AD symptom in the disease model of C. elegans. Our results showed that RJ/eRJ supplementation significantly delayed the body paralysis in AD worms, suggesting the beta-amyloid (A beta) toxicity attenuation effects of RJ/eRJ. Genetic analyses suggested that RJ/eRJ-mediated alleviation of A beta toxicity in AD worms required DAF-16, rather than HSF-1 and SKN-1, in an insulin/IGF signaling dependent manner. Moreover, RJ/eRJ modulated the transactivity of DAF-16 and dramatically improved the protein solubility in aged worms. Given protein solubility is a hallmark of healthy proteostasis, our findings demonstrated that RJ/eRJ supplementation improved proteostasis, and this promotion depended on the transactivity of DAF-16. Collectively, the present study not only elucidated the possible anti-AD mechanism of RJ/eRJ, but also provided evidence from a practical point of view to shed light on the extensive correlation of proteostasis and the prevention of neurodegenerative disorders.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1949-2553			WOS:000385435000008	27472466

In this paper, a CPT-based liquefaction model is adopted to estimate the liquefaction-induced settlement at individual sounding locations. The model is then integrated with multiscale random field models to account for spatial variability of soil properties. One important advantage of the proposed framework is its ability to consistently refine and provide settlement estimations across different scales, from regional and geologic unit scales down to a local, site-specific scale. The proposed methodology is then applied to the Alameda County, California, an earthquake-prone region, to illustrate the procedure for probabilistic and spatial assessment of liquefaction-induced settlements at different scales.

Although thermal lensing is well known qualitatively, there is a general lack of a simple method for quantitative analysis. In this work, we first conduct a study of thermal lensing in optical fibers based on a perturbation technique. The perturbation technique becomes increasingly inaccurate as thermal lensing gets stronger. It, however, provides a basis for determining a normalization factor to use in a more accurate numerical study. A simple thermal lensing threshold condition is developed. The impact of thermal lensing on transverse mode instability is also studied. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America									1	0	0	0	0	1			1094-4087			WOS:000385227100095	27557260

A particularly challenging part of that question is the creation of the so-called p-nuclei, which are believed to be mainly produced in some types of supernovae. The lack of needed nuclear data presents an obstacle in nailing down the precise site and astrophysical conditions. In this work, we present for the first time measurements on the nuclear level density and average gamma strength function of Mo-92. State-of-the-art p-process calculations systematically underestimate the observed solar abundance of this isotope. Our data provide stringent constraints on the Nb-91(p,gamma)Mo-92 reaction rate, which is the last unmeasured reaction in the nucleosynthesis puzzle of Mo-92. Based on our results, we conclude that the Mo-92 abundance anomaly is not due to the nuclear physics input to astrophysical model calculations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000381892200009		
J	Bedre, Renesh; Mangu, Venkata Ramanarao; Srivastava, Subodh; Eduardo Sanchez, Luis; Baisakh, Niranjan								Transcriptome analysis of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel), a monocot halophyte, reveals candidate genes involved in its adaptation to salinity								BMC GENOMICS				17						657	10.1186/s12864-016-3017-3			AUG 19 2016	2016	Background: Soil salinity affects growth and yield of crop plants. Plants respond to salinity by physiological and biochemical adjustments through a coordinated regulation and expression of a cascade of genes. Recently, halophytes have attracted attention of the biologists to understand their salt adaptation mechanisms. Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) is a Louisiana native monocot halophyte that can withstand salinity up to double the strength of sea water. To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying its salinity adaptation, leaf and root transcriptome of S. alterniflora was sequenced using 454/GS-FLX.Results: Altogether, 770,690 high quality reads with an average length 324-bp were assembled de novo into 73,131 contigs (average 577-bp long) with 5.9X sequence coverage. Most unigenes (95 %) annotated to proteins with known functions, and had more than 90 % similarity to rice genes. About 28 % unigenes were considered specific to S. alterniflora. Digital expression profiles revealed significant enrichment (P < 0.01) of transporters, vacuolar proton pump members and transcription factors under salt stress, which suggested the role of ion homeostasis and transcriptional regulation in the salinity adaptation of this grass. Also, 10,805 SSRs markers from 9457 unigenes were generated and validated through genetic diversity analysis among 13 accessions of S. alterniflora.Conclusions: The present study explores the transcriptome of S. alterniflora to understand the gene regulation under salt stress in halophytes. The sequenced transcriptome (control and salt-regulated) of S. alterniflora provides a platform for further gene finding studies in grasses. This study and our previously published studies suggested that S. alterniflora is a rich reservoir of salt tolerance genes that can be used to develop salt tolerant cereal crops, especially rice, a major food crop of global importance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1471-2164			WOS:000384978800001	27542721

Dynein motility involves the coupling of microtubule binding and unbinding to a change in the configuration of the linker domain induced by ATP hydrolysis, which occur some 25 nm apart. This leaves the accuracy of dynein stepping relatively inaccurate and susceptible to thermal noise. Using multi-scale modeling with a computational focusing technique, we demonstrate that the microtubule forms an electrostatic funnel that guides the dynein's microtubule binding domain (MTBD) as it finally docks to the precise, keyed binding location on the microtubule. Furthermore, we demonstrate that electrostatic component of the MTBD's binding free energy is linearly correlated with the velocity and run length of dynein, and we use this linearity to predict the effect of mutating each glutamic and aspartic acid located in MTBD domain to alanine. Lastly, we show that the binding of dynein to the microtubule is associated with conformational changes involving several helices, and we localize flexible hinge points within the stalk helices. Taken all together, we demonstrate that long range electrostatic interactions bring a level of precision to an otherwise noisy dynein stepping process.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000381515000001	27531742

This work presents a continuous-flow sheathless diamagnetic particle separation in ferrofluids through U-shaped microchannels. Due to the action of a size-dependent magnetic force, diamagnetic particles are focused into a single stream in the inlet branch of the U-turn and then continuously separated into two streams in its outlet branch. A 3D numerical model is developed to predict and understand the diamagnetic particle transport during this separation process. The numerical predictions are found to agree well with the experimental observations in a systematic study of the effects of multiple parameters including ferrofluid flow rate, concentration and magnet-channel distance. Additional numerical studies of the geometric effects of the U-turn reveal that increasing the outlet-branch width of the U-turn can significantly enhance the diamagnetic particle separation in ferrofluids.

Numerical findings reveal that this device is able to realize dynamic transformation from double electromagnetically induced transparency like material to ultra-narrow band guided mode resonance (GMR) filter by controlling the optically excited free carriers in gallium arsenide pads inserted between the gold cut wires. During this reconfiguration process of resonance modes, high quality factors up to similar to 104 and similar to 118 for the two EIT-like peaks and up to similar to 578 for the GMR filter are obtained.

As already discussed in the literature, the variations in fluorescence performance among the fractions were attributed to the different levels and/or effectiveness of the surface functionalization passivation in the carbon dots. These fractions, as well as carbon nanoparticles without any deliberate surface functionalization, were dispersed into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for composite films. In the PVA film matrix, the carbon dots and nanoparticles exhibited much enhanced fluorescence emissions in comparison with their corresponding aqueous solutions. The increased fluorescence quantum yields in the films were determined quantitatively by using a specifically designed and constructed film sample holder in the emission spectrometer. The observed fluorescence decays of the EDA carbon dots in the films and in the solution were essentially the same, suggesting that the significant enhancement in fluorescence quantum yields from the solution to films is static in nature. Mechanistic implications of the results, including a rationalization in terms of the compression effect on the surface passivation layer (similar to a soft corona) in carbon dots when embedded in the more restrictive film environment resulting in more favorable radiative recombinations of the carbon particle surface-trapped electrons and holes, and also potential technological applications of the brightly fluorescent composite films are highlighted and discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000381329700004	28133537

For applications such as the interaction of a protein with a surface, the orientation of the protein relative to the surface is also an important clustering parameter because of its potential effect on adsorbed-state bioactivity. This study presents cluster analysis methods that are specifically designed for systems where both molecular orientation and conformation are important, and the methods are demonstrated using test cases of adsorbed proteins for validation. Additionally, because cluster analysis can be a very subjective process, an objective procedure for identifying both the optimal number of clusters and the best clustering algorithm to be applied to analyze a given dataset is presented. The method is demonstrated for several agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms used in conjunction with three cluster validation techniques.

However, it is unclear whether characteristicg.of thermally altered DOM (TA-DOM) are altered by biogeochemical processes (e.g., transformed by growing algae) before entering water treatment facilities. The freshwater green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and blue-green algae Microcystis aeruginosa were separately incubated in the.mixture of cultural medium and pine (Pinus palustris) litter-derived TA-DOMs (50 degrees C, 250 degrees C, and 400 degrees C) over 7 days to demonstrate the effects of algal growth on alterations in SDBP-FP. TA-DOM optical characteristics and SDBP-FP were quantified by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and chlorination-based DBP-FP experiments. After the inoculation with P. subcapitata, TA-DOM aromaticity (indicated by SUVA(254)) increased from 1.19 to 1.90 L/mg/m for 50 degrees C-extract but decreased from 4.95 to 3.75 L/mg/m for 400 degrees C-extract. The fraction of tyrosine-like components decreased from 25.9 to 9.3% for 50 degrees C-extract but increased from 0.9 to 1.3% for 400 degrees C-extract. Same patterns were also observed for M aeruginosa. Growing algae generally increased chlorine reactivities and formations of trihalornethanes, haloacetonitriles, chloral hydrate, and haloketones. Our data suggest that the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon in TA-DOM decreases as fire intensity (i.e., temperature) increases. Postfire algal blooms can increase chlorine reactivity of fire-affected terrestrial DOM for DBP formation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000381063200007	27366813

Two chalcogenide compositions are demonstrated: Ge23Sb7S70 and As40S60, which have both been studied extensively for planar mid-infrared (midIR) microphotonic devices. In this approach, uniform thickness films are fabricated through the use of computer numerical controlled (CNC) motion. Chalcogenide glass (ChG) is written over the substrate by a single nozzle along a serpentine path. Films were subjected to a series of heat treatments between 100 degrees C and 200 degrees C under vacuum to drive off residual solvent and densify the films. Based on transmission Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and surface roughness measurements, both compositions were found to be suitable for the fabrication of planar devices operating in the mid-IR region. Residual solvent removal was found to be much quicker for the As40S60 film as compared to Ge23Sb7S70. Based on the advantages of electrospray, direct printing of a gradient refractive index (GRIN) mid-IR transparent coating is envisioned, given the difference in refractive index of the two compositions in this study.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1940-087X			WOS:000391742700079

Resident cormorant colonies breeding in the southeastern United States are protected in some areas, so it is important to distinguish these from co-occurring but unprotected migratory cormorants. Migratory P. auritus are likely to contain helminthic parasite communities that differ from those of non-migratory, resident birds, because they will encounter a wider variety of habitats and intermediate host communities during migrations. Here, we document five distinct assemblages of helminth parasites collected from 218 P. auritus culled from 11 sites in Alabama, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Vermont. The assemblages of P. auritus parasites are distinct among many sampling locations and can be used to correctly predict where a host cormorant has been feeding. We provide evidence for mixing of cormorants at a regional scale using discriminant analysis, which suggests there is a single population of migratory cormorants. Furthermore, our models strongly differentiate between migratory and resident P. auritus in the southeastern United States. In conjunction with species-by species latitudinal and longitudinal trends, our models could serve as effective tools for managers interested in both the population control of migratory cormorants and the conservation of non-migratory, resident birds. Finally, parasite counts per host are notoriously variable with many zeros and a few large numbers, leading many researchers to use simple prevalence in their analyses.

In this study, new case histories with the shear wave velocity measurements and the liquefaction phenomenon observations are compiled from the 22 February 2011 Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand. The new case histories are combined with the existing Vs database for assessing and updating probabilistic models. The widely used logistic regression models, as well as other probabilistic models, are examined in the framework of generalized linear models (GLMs). To this end, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle is used to determine the model parameters. Then, the developed generalized linear models are ranked using three model assessment criteria. Based on the assessment criteria adopted, the log-log and logistic models are recommended for both the existing and the combined database. The updated log-log model and logistic model are recommended for shear wave velocity based liquefaction potential evaluation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1435-9529	1435-9537		WOS:000384816300022

Headspace volumes utilized for this study were 200 and 400cm(3). Retort pouches were fitted with an OxyDot (R) as a non-invasive measurement technique to monitor percent package headspace oxygen. The retort pouches were packaged inside regular slotted containers and subjected to laboratory simulated transportation performance tests for small parcel and unit load delivery systems. To evaluate the effects of the simulated transport tests, control retort pouches of each variable were used for comparison. Headspace oxygen levels were measured for all retort pouches (test and control) for 63days. Results indicated that there were significant differences in all variables when comparing the simulated transport samples to the control samples. Comparing headspace volumes, the 400cm(3) pouches yielded less oxygen ingress into the pouch as compared with the 200cm(3) pouches in the small parcel simulation (p<0.05). There were not significant differences for the two headspace volumes in the unit load simulation. Results from this study indicate packaged products being distributed through small parcel supply chains, which are handled more vigorously than those being shipped palletized, the increased headspace volume protected against oxygen ingress for certain distribution channels.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0894-3214	1099-1522		WOS:000382507700001

We consider the relationship between the elasticity of a domain R and the elasticity of its polynomial ring R[x]. For example, if R has at least one atom, a sufficient condition for the polynomial ring R[x] to have elasticity 1 is that every non-constant irreducible polynomial f is an element of R[x] be irreducible in K[x]. We will determine the integral domains R whose polynomial rings satisfy this condition.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-0915	1464-3839		WOS:000387657400004

Disease-Induced Disparities in Formation of the Nanoparticle-Biocorona and the Toxicological Consequences								TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES				152	2			406	416		10.1093/toxsci/kfw097			AUG 2016	2016	Nanoparticle (NP) association with macromolecules in a physiological environment forms a biocorona (BC), which alters NP distribution, activity, and toxicity. While BC formation is dependent on NP physicochemical properties, little information exists on the influence of the physiological environment. Obese individuals and those with cardiovascular disease exist with altered serum chemistry, which is expected to influence BC formation and NP toxicity. We hypothesize that a BC formed on NPs following incubation in hyperlipidemic serum will result in altered NP-BC protein content, cellular association, and toxicity compared to normal serum conditions. We utilized Fe3O4 NPs, which are being developed as MRI contrast and tumor targeting agents to test our hypothesis. We used rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) within a dynamic flow in vitro exposure system to more accurately depict the in vivo environment. A BC was formed on 20 nm PVP-suspended Fe3O4 NPs following incubation in water, 10% normal or hyperlipidemic rat serum. Addition of BCs resulted in increased hydrodynamic size and decreased surface charge. More cholesterol associated with Fe3O4 NPs after incubation in hyperlipidemic as compared with normal serum. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified unique differences in BC protein components between the 2 serum types. Under flow conditions, formation of a BC from both serum types reduced RAECs association of Fe3O4 NPs. Addition of BCs was found to exacerbate RAECs inflammatory gene responses to Fe3O4 NPs (Fe3O4-hyperlipidemic > Fe3O4-normal > Fe3O4) including increased expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha, Cxcl-2, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Overall, these findings demonstrate that disease-induced variations in physiological environments have a significant impact NP-BC formation, cellular association, and cell response.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1096-6080	1096-0929		WOS:000385300400016	27255384

A Functional Form for the Diurnal Variation of Lake Surface Temperature on Lake Hartwell, Northwestern South Carolina								IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING				9	8	SI		3564	3577		10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2555798			AUG 2016	2016	Satellite measurements of water surface temperature can benefit several environmental applications such as predictions of lake evaporation, meteorological forecasts, and predictions of lake overturning events, among others. Limitations on the temporal resolution of satellite measurements can restrict these improvements. A model of the diurnal variation in lake surface temperature could potentially increase the effective temporal resolution of satellite measurements of surface temperature, thereby enhancing the utility of these measurements in the above applications. As a step in this direction, herein a one-dimensional thermal model of a lake is used in combination with surface temperature measurements from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer instrument aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, along with ambient atmospheric conditions from local weather stations, to calculate the diurnal surface temperature variation for Lake Hartwell in South Carolina. The calculated solutions are used to obtain a functional form for the diurnal surface temperature variation of this lake, a result which has not been obtained heretofore. This functional form was obtained by averaging over several years worth of data and, therefore, represents the diurnal variation of surface temperature of the average day. Accordingly, attempts to use this averaged function to predict surface temperature in between satellite overpasses on any given day did not perform well due to day-to-day variations in cloud cover, wind speed, and other factors. It is possible that use of this averaged function combined with daily meteorological data may enable better performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1939-1404	2151-1535		WOS:000384907200021

However, these batteryless sensing platforms-that rely purely on energy harvesting-are rarely able to maintain a sense of time after a power failure. Thismakes working with sensor data that is time sensitive especially difficult. We propose two novel, zero-power timekeepers that use remanence decay to measure the time elapsed between power failures. Our approaches compute the elapsed time from the amount of decay of a capacitive device, either on-chip Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) or a dedicated capacitor. This enables hourglass-like timers that give intermittently powered sensing devices a persistent sense of time. Our evaluation shows that applications using either timekeeper can keep time accurately through power failures as long as 45s with low overhead.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1539-9087	1558-3465		WOS:000384247100016

The results showed that the criterion day and night temperatures were 12 degrees C and 4 degrees C for seed germination, and 14 degrees C and 6 degrees C for seedling growth, respectively. In the presence of water extract, the temperature rise of 2 degrees C significantly inhibited the germination vigor and rate of P. Schrenkiana seed, and a temperature rise of 4 degrees C significantly increased the inhibition to the seedling growth (P < 0.05). Among the three organic fractions, the low-polar fraction showed to be more phytotoxic than the other two fractions, causing significant inhibitory effects on the seed germination and growth even at low concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, and the inhibition effect was enhanced as temperature increased. The temperature rise significantly enhanced the promotion effect of DHAP, while the inhibition effect of temperature rise became less important with increasing concentration of DHAP. This investigation revealed that autotoxicity of P. schrenkiana was affected by the climate warming. As expected, it provided an insight into the mechanism and effectiveness of allelopathy in bridging the causal relationship between forest evolution and climate warming.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-7758			WOS:000381578400024	27547360

Thus, it is significant to realize distributed, real-time crack monitoring. To overcome the shortages of traditional crack detectors, such as the inconvenience of installation, vulnerability, and low measurement range, etc., an improved topology-based cable sensor with a shallow helical groove on the outside surface of a coaxial cable is proposed in this paper. The sensing mechanism, fabrication method, and performances are investigated both numerically and experimentally. Crack monitoring experiments of the reinforced beams are also presented in this paper, illustrating the utility of this sensor in practical applications. These studies show that the sensor can identify a minimum crack width of 0.02 mm and can measure multiple cracks with a spatial resolution of 3 mm. In addition, it is also proved that the sensor performs well to detect the initiation and development of cracks until structure failure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1424-8220			WOS:000382323200186		
J	Hu Xiaobo								Local Government Entrepreneurship: Public Goods, Public Risks and Public Administration								CHINA-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL				14	3			67	87					AUG 2016	2016	Decentralisation reform in China has provided a foundation that pitches local government officials against each other in their pursuit of individual career goals and tasks to meet their annual growth targets. To deliver public goods to their constituencies, local officials turn themselves into entrepreneurs and compete through entrepreneurial policies or innovative implementation of central policies. Different from corporatism's prediction, local government entrepreneurship does not necessarily provide long-term macroeconomic planning or improve long-term regional economic performance. Also, unlike federalism's prediction, local government entrepreneurship does not always improve responsible fiscal management, and neither are all local projects revenue-driven. Based on the choice-theoretic tradition, the perspective of administrative choice provides a fuller understanding of why and how local government entrepreneurship takes place in China.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0219-7472	0219-8614		WOS:000383155200005

To date, only a few reports exist on the deformation mechanisms that take place during high power ultrasonic spot welding. In this work, dynamic recrystallization and grain growth were examined using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). HPUSW causes extensive deformation within the weld zone where the temperature increases to 440 degrees C. An ultra-fine grain structure was observed in a thin band of flat weld interface within a short welding time of 0.10 s. With increasing welding time the interface was displaced and 'folds' or 'crests' appeared together with shear bands. The weld interface progressively changed from flat to sinusoidal and eventually to a convoluted wave-like pattern when the tool fully penetrated the workpiece, having a wavelength of similar to 1 mm after 0.40 s. Finally, the microstructure and texture varied significantly depending on the location within the weld. Although the texture near the weld interface was relatively weak, a shift was observed with increasing welding time from an initially Cube-dominated texture to one where the typical beta-fibre Brass component prevailed.

Using multigroup latent variable modeling, we examined differences in this model between the United States (n = 204) and the Philippines (n = 265). Machiavellianism was unrelated to any mediators or outcomes. Narcissism was positively related to independence in both countries, and narcissism was negatively related to interdependence and positively related to power distance in the Philippines. Psychopathy was negatively related to IF in the U.S. only and positive to ICWBs in both countries. Psychopathy was negatively related to interdependence in the US. but positively related to interdependence in the Philippines, and positively related to power distance in the U.S. Independent and interdependent self-construal were positively related to IF and negatively related to ICWB. Power distance was negatively related to IF and positively related to ICWB. Indirect mediation relationships were also found in both countries. The findings suggest that the Dark Triad traits operate differently across the countries due in part to differences in the cultural variables of self-construal and power distance. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-8869			WOS:000382794700012		
J	Wan, Nianfeng; Vahidi, Ardalan; Luckow, Andre								Optimal speed advisory for connected vehicles in arterial roads and the impact on mixed traffic								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES				69				548	563		10.1016/j.trc.2016.01.011			AUG 2016	2016	Connected Vehicles (CV) equipped with a Speed Advisory System (SAS) can obtain and utilize upcoming traffic signal information to manage their speed in advance, lower fuel consumption, and improve ride comfort by reducing idling at red lights. In this paper, a SAS for pre-timed traffic signals is proposed and the fuel minimal driving strategy is obtained as an analytical solution to a fuel consumption minimization problem. We show that the minimal fuel driving strategy may go against intuition of some people; in that it alternates between periods of maximum acceleration, engine shut down, and sometimes constant speed, known in optimal control as bang-singular-bang control. After presenting this analytical solution to the fuel minimization problem, we employ a sub-optimal solution such that drivability is not sacrificed and show fuel economy still improves significantly. Moreover this paper evaluates the influence of vehicles with SAS on the entire arterial traffic in micro-simulations. The results show that SAS-equipped vehicles not only improve their own fuel economy, but also benefit other conventional vehicles and the fleet fuel consumption decreases with the increment of percentage of SAS-equipped vehicles. We show that this improvement in fuel economy is achieved with a little compromise in average traffic flow and travel time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of cell passage number on osteogenic and adipogenic characteristics of D1 cells								CYTOTECHNOLOGY				68	4			1661	1667		10.1007/s10616-015-9883-8			AUG 2016	2016	Cell line passage number is an important consideration when designing an experiment. At higher passages, it is generally understood that cell health begins to decline and, when this occurs, the result can be variable data. However, there are no specific guidelines regarding optimal passage range, and this information is dependent on cell type. To explore these variabilities, low passage D1 cells were thawed (passage 3) and passaged serially until a much higher number (passage 34). Samples were taken every five passages and analyzed for alkaline phosphatase and triglyceride; also, the gene expression of both adipogenic and osteogenic markers was tested. The results indicate that the growth rate of these cells did slow down after passage 30. However, expression of the osteogenic characteristics seemed to cycle, with the highest levels seen at passage 4 and 24. The adipocyte expression levels remained the same throughout the study.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-9069	1573-0778		WOS:000380265300098	26208915	
J	Ansar, Siyam M.; Kitchens, Christopher L.								Impact of Gold Nanoparticle Stabilizing Ligands on the Colloidal Catalytic Reduction of 4-Nitrophenol								ACS CATALYSIS				6	8			5553	5560		10.1021/acscatal.6b00635			AUG 2016	2016	Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have received considerable interest owing to their unique properties and applications in catalysis. One of the major challenges for colloidal nanoparticles in catalysis is the limited stability and resulting aggregation. Nanoparticle functionalization with ligands or polymers is a common strategy to improve the colloidal stability, which in turn blocks the reactive surface sites and eliminates catalytic activity. Here, we investigate thiolated polyethylene glycol (HS-PEG) as a stabilizing ligand during AuNP catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol. We show a direct relationship between the chain length and packing density of HS-PEG with respect to AuNP catalytic activity. High surface coverage of low molecular weight HS-PEG (1 kDa) completely inhibited the catalytic activity of AuNPs. Increasing HS-PEG molecular weight and decreasing surface coverage was found to correlate directly with increasing rate constants and decreasing induction time. Time-resolved UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (2-MIB) adsorption on AuNPs was used to study the ligand adsorption kinetics and to quantify the free active sites available for catalysis as a function of HS-PEG molecular weight and packing density. HS-PEG packing density and estimation of free active sites, coupled with the kinetics of 2-MBI adsorption onto AuNP ruled out the possibility of an educt diffusion barrier as the main cause of reduced catalytic activity and induction time for HS-PEG functionalized AuNPs (molecular weight >= 1 kDa). Instead, selective blocking of more active sites by adsorbed thiol functionality is attributed to the induction period and reduced catalytic activity. It is also noticed that H- induced desorption/mobility of thiols regenerates the catalytic activity.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000381236700084

AHR-related activities in a creosote-adapted population of adult atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, two decades post-EPA superfund status at the Atlantic Wood Site, Portsmouth, VA USA								AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY				177				74	85		10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.05.021			AUG 2016	2016	Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, are adapted to creosote-based PAHs at the US EPA Superfund site known as Atlantic Wood (AW) on the southern branch of the Elizabeth River, VA USA. Subsequent to the discovery of the AW population in the early 1990s, these fish were shown to be recalcitrant to CYP1A induction by PAHs under experimental conditions, and even to the time of this study, killifish embryos collected from the AW site are resistant to developmental deformities typically associated with exposure to PAHs in reference fish. Historically, however, 90 +% of the adult killifish at this site have proliferative hepatic lesions including cancer of varying severity. Several PAHs at this site are known to be ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). In this study, AHR-related activities in AW fish collected between 2011 and 2013 were re-examined nearly 2 decades after first discovery. This study shows that CYP1A mRNA expression is three-fold higher in intestines of AW killifish compared to a reference population. Using immunohistochemistry, CYP1A staining in intestines was uniformly positive compared to negative staining in reference fish. Livers of AW killifish were examined by IHC to show that CYP1A and AHR2 protein expression reflect lesions-specific patterns, probably representing differences in intrinsic cellular physiology of the spectrum of proliferative lesions comprising the hepatocarcinogenic process. We also found that COX2 mRNA expression levels were higher in AW fish livers compared to those in the reference population, suggesting a state of chronic inflammation. Overall, these findings suggest that adult AW fish are responsive to AHR signaling, and do express CYP1A and AHR2 proteins in intestines at a level above what was observed in the reference population.

J	Zheng, Yi; Zhang, Ruihong; Pan, Zhongli								Investigation of adsorption kinetics and isotherm of cellulase and beta-glucosidase on lignocellulosic substrates								BIOMASS & BIOENERGY				91				1	9		10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.04.014			AUG 2016	2016	Clear understanding of enzyme adsorption during enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is essential to enhance the cost-efficiency of hydrolysis. However, conclusions from literature often contradicted each other because enzyme adsorption is enzyme, biomass/pretreatment and experimental condition specific, which makes descriptions and modeling of enzyme-substrate interaction difficult and inconsistent from case to case. This study investigated adsorption kinetics and isotherm under actual hydrolysis conditions with commercial cellulase and beta-glucosidase on Avicel, dilute acid pretreated Creeping Wild Ryegrass (pCWR) and lignin residue of pCWR after enzymatic hydrolysis. It was found that b-glucosidase has little affinity to Avicel, but significant affinity to dilute acid pCWR and lignin with maximum adsorption capacity (E-max) of 161.57 and 173.50 mg protein/g-substrate, respectively. During hydrolysis, adsorption of cellulase on Avicel was productive and reversible (E-max = 22.86 mg protein/g-substrate); however, nonproductive and irreversible adsorption of cellulase on pCWR (E-max = 42.55 mg protein/g-substrate) and lignin (E-max = 86.07 mg protein/g-substrate) became significant and resulted in cellulase deactivation. Lignin is a key issue causing high cost of enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. The nonionic surfactant, Tween 20 was found to significantly overcome nonproductive adsorption of cellulase and b-glucosidase on lignin by reducing the adsorption affinity. All adsorption data including with and without Tween 20 were fit well to Langmuir isotherm. The results from this research will provide useful data for model development of enzymatic hydrolysis.

Survey of Apoptosis After Hypothermic Storage of a Pancreatic -Cell Line								BIOPRESERVATION AND BIOBANKING				14	4			271	278		10.1089/bio.2015.0060			AUG 2016	2016	Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of death world wide. Donor-derived pancreas and islet of Langerhans transplantation are potential cures, however, postmortem ischemia impacts islet quality. The murine t3 cell line was used as a model to study apoptosis after hypothermic storage by comparing Unisol with Belzer's machine perfusion solution (BMPS) and the University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. The objective was to determine which of these solutions provided the best support for t3 cells and which solution demonstrated the least amount of apoptotic activity. Several apoptosis markers were measured that included the translocation of phosphatidylserine, caspase activity, and the formation of DNA laddering. In addition, metabolic activity and membrane integrity were also measured. The results demonstrated that the three solutions behaved similarly during overnight cold storage at 4 degrees C. However, Unisol was consistently better than UW solution and BMPS, demonstrating better cell viability and recovery, and lower levels of apoptotic activity when all three parameters were measured. These results demonstrated that apoptosis plays an important role in the survival of cells and tissues during cold storage. Development of solutions to help prevent or decrease the levels of apoptosis after cold storage will likely improve overall cell and tissue recovery and survival in a clinical setting.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1947-5535	1947-5543		WOS:000382510300003	26937946	
J	Yingling, Marissa E.; Bell, Bethany A.								The role of parental involvement in trajectories of aggression in children from 24 months to Pre-Kindergarten using growth curve models								CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW				67				270	276		10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.01.019			AUG 2016	2016	The significant contribution of parental involvement in children's education to children's educational success is well supported. Yet less frequently studied is the influence of parental involvement on children's social emotional development Given that problem behaviors are negatively associated with child outcomes and that parental involvement is widely accepted as a conduit through which children's educational outcomes can be enhanced, it is important to examine this relationship.In this study, we examine the effect of early parental involvement on the social-emotional development of children. Using data from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation study (EHSRE), we examine the within individual and between-individual differences in trajectories of aggression among children (N = 1586) ages 24 months through Prekindergarten. Contrary to hypotheses, after controlling for significant covariates (i.e., race, gender, poverty, mother's education, and adult male in the household), parental involvement was not related to aggression at 24 months. In addition, change in aggression did not vary by level of parental involvement Implications and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A review of cost estimation models for determining assembly automation level								COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING				98				246	259		10.1016/j.cie.2016.06.007			AUG 2016	2016	The aim of this research is to support early phase cost estimation for assembly systems design and automation decision. During this phase, various alternatives of assembly systems with different automation levels can be generated. The alternatives generation is performed using available information on product design, assembly sequences, and planned production information. The issue is to assess given alternatives, identify, and opt for the most appropriate one. Several criteria have to be considered in this decision. The economic aspect represents one of the most preponderant, including cost and profitability prediction. The importance and challenges of this complex issue are highlighted in this paper with feedbacks from manufacturers and the literature. The literature in the field is reviewed, presented, and analyzed. For this sake, a selection of cost models is performed covering a wide chronological range, journals, and fields including assembly and manufacturing models. Classification techniques of cost estimation works are presented and exploited in the proposed review. It is used to filter and discuss models suitability for the defined assembly automation decision issue. The most appropriate models are more thoroughly reviewed and discussed. Useful literature costing techniques, features, and relevant cost drivers are also identified. They cover multiple aspects as production information, resources features or performances. Finally, the review findings are illustrated by a cost estimation outline proposal to support early phase cost prediction for assembly systems design and automation decision. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Peng, Zhenyang; Tian, Fuqiang; Hu, Hongchang; Zhao, Sihan; Tie, Qiang; Sheng, Hao; Darnault, Christophe; Lu, Hui								Spatial Variability of Soil Moisture in a Forest Catchment: Temporal Trend and Contributors								FORESTS				7	8					154	10.3390/f7080154			AUG 2016	2016	Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamic of soil moisture is critical in hydrological and other land surface related studies. Until recently, however, there have been controversies about the relationship between spatial mean and spatial variance of soil moisture and the contributions of each of these factors to spatial variability. Therefore, in this study, spatial variability of soil moisture in a 7 km(2) forest catchment is analyzed by time-series data on soil moisture obtained at a total of 12 observation sites. Results showed that soil moisture spatial mean and spatial variance varied almost synchronously and in three cyclic patterns during the monitoring period from 1 April 2015 to 31 October 2015. The spatial mean-variance relationship during the ascending and descending periods of spatial mean could be well-fitted by upward and downward convex quadratic curves, respectively, indicating possible clockwise hysteresis of this relationship. It was found that all through the monitoring period, contributions of time-invariant factors on total spatial variance increased from 68.9% to 88.2% with depth, and temporally stable ranking of sites was obtained. Because of the high spatial variation of soil moisture in our study area, it should be noted that a large number of sample plots would be needed to adequately estimate the spatial variability of soil moisture.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1999-4907			WOS:000382470000003		
J	Polo-Garzon, Felipe; Scott, Joseph K.; Bruce, David A.								Microkinetic model for the dry reforming of methane on Rh doped pyrochlore catalysts								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				340				196	204		10.1016/j.jcat.2016.05.019			AUG 2016	2016	Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a promising gateway technology for energy and fuels production that utilizes methane and CO2, a common contaminant in natural gas deposits, as feed. Previous experimental work has shown that Rh-substituted lanthanum zirconate pyrochlores (LRhZ) are catalytically active and stable at the high temperatures needed for DRM. Although experimental and ab initio computational approaches have been used to study aspects of the DRM reaction mechanism on pyrochlores, this work is the first to describe a microkinetic model with variable reaction conditions and catalyst metal composition that uses parameters derived from DFT simulations for DRM over the (111) plane of an LRhZ pyrochlore catalyst. This model was used to gain insight into the favored reaction pathway for DRM and evaluate the time evolution of key intermediates (e.g., CH3, CH2, CH, OH, O) within the reactor at different reaction conditions and catalyst metal loading. Model predictions of reactant conversion and H-2/CO product ratio were compared to experimental reaction data, and predicted yields compared well with experimental results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Cross-sectional data for Hispanics with diabetes in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2010 were used. Achievements of the ADA recommendation for five nutrition components were examined (i.e., daily intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and fiber, and daily servings of alcohol). Acculturation measurement derived from language use, country of birth, and length of residence in the U.S. Logistic regressions were performed. Only 49% of Hispanics with diabetes met three or more recommended criteria. Male gender and younger age (<= 45) predicted poor recommendation adherence. More acculturated individuals had around 50% lower odds to achieve saturated fat [OR 0.5, CI 0.2-0.7], fiber [OR 0.5, CI 0.2-0.9], sodium [OR 0.5, CI 0.3-0.9] and cholesterol intake [OR 0.5, CI 0.3-0.8] recommendations than their less acculturated counterparts.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1049-2089	1548-6869		WOS:000381329000046	27524787

Numerical Model for the Hydraulic Performance of Perforated Pipe Underdrains Surrounded by Loose Aggregate								JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING				142	8					04016018	10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001134			AUG 2016	2016	This paper presents the results of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model study of the hydraulics of groundwater flow and porous pipe underdrains. The study was conducted using a three-dimensional CFD model built in ANSYS Fluent. The model was validated by replicating previous experimental results of saturated subsurface flow (water surface level above the aggregate) for a 10.2-cm perforated pipe shrouded in loose laid aggregate. The CFD model consistently overpredicted the flow rate for a given head and aggregate depth by an average of 11%. After considering the effect of pipe perforation blockage due to aggregate, the average overprediction decreased to only 6%. The discharge coefficient for the perforated pipe computed using the CFD model was 0.54 compared with 0.49 from experiments. It was also found that the discharge was quite small at the upstream end of the pipe, with the bulk of the water entering the pipe in the vicinity of the outlet. Finally, the computational results showed that, for saturated flow conditions, the flow was predominantly in the vertical direction within the aggregate whereas it was mainly horizontal when the water surface level was below the top of the aggregate level (unsaturated condition). The losses associated with the two flow scenarios were explored. The results obtained have practical applications in the design and analysis of porous pipe underdrains.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0733-9429	1943-7900		WOS:000381055400003		
J	Maleki, Farzam Safarzadeh; Khan, Abdul A.								1-D coupled non-equilibrium sediment transport modeling for unsteady flows in the discontinuous Galerkin framework								JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS				28	4			534	543		10.1016/S1001-6058(16)60658-3			AUG 2016	2016	A high-resolution, 1-D numerical model has been developed in the discontinuous Galerkin framework to simulate 1-D flow behavior, sediment transport, and morphological evaluation under unsteady flow conditions. The flow and sediment concentration variables are computed based on the one-dimensional shallow water flow equations, while empirical equations are used for entrainment and deposition processes. The sediment transport model includes the bed load and suspended load components. New formulations for Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) and Harten-Lax-van Contact (HLLC) are presented for shallow water flow equations that include the bed load and suspended load fluxes. The computational results for the flow and morphological changes after two dam break events are compared with the physical model tests. Results show that the modified HLL and HLLC formulations are robust and can accurately predict morphological changes in highly unsteady flows.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-6058	1878-0342		WOS:000382599400002

Yoon, Yeomin/C-3331-2012				A probabilistic approach for estimating water permeability in pressure-driven membranes								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING				22	8						10.1007/s00894-016-3049-2			AUG 2016	2016	A probabilistic approach is proposed to estimate water permeability in a cellulose triacetate (CTA) membrane. Water transport across the membrane is simulated in reverse osmosis mode by means of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Different membrane configurations obtained by an annealing MD simulation are considered and simulation results are analyzed by using a hierarchical Bayesian model to obtain the permeability of the different membranes. The estimated membrane permeability is used to predict full-scale water flux by means of a process-level Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the results, the parameters of the model are observed to converge within 5-ns total simulation time. The results also indicate that the use of unique structural configurations in MD simulations is essential to capture realistic membrane properties at the molecular scale. Furthermore, the predicted full-scale water flux based on the estimated permeability is within the same order of magnitude of bench-scale experimental measurement of 1.72 x 10(-5) m/s.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1610-2940	0948-5023		WOS:000381203500015	27444876

A multi-lake study of seasonal variation in lake surface evaporation using MODIS satellite-derived surface temperature								LIMNOLOGY				17	3			273	289		10.1007/s10201-016-0481-z			AUG 2016	2016	Knowledge of the evaporative loss from lakes and reservoirs is critical to water resources managers as well as to the overall understanding of the water balance in a given basin, geographical region, or continent. Existing methods for ascertaining evaporation from lakes and reservoirs include point measurements, water balance and mass transfer calculations, and proxy measurements using a pan. Point measurements using the eddy flux covariance method can be accurate, but are resource intensive and unsuited for determining spatial variation over a lake, or for obtaining measurements over many lakes. Mass balance methods cannot provide spatial variability and their accuracy depends on other portions of the water balance that can be challenging to obtain, such as leakage. Similarly, relatively recently deployed scintillation methods provide only an average for a strip across a lake and are also resource intensive and not suited for multi-lake studies. Evaporation pan measurements can also be used, though their accuracy is poor. Herein, we use a combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite measurements of water surface temperature, measurements of wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity from local NWS stations, and a mass transfer method, to demonstrate multi-lake evaporation measurements. Specifically, the seasonal variation in evaporation is obtained for the five major lakes in the Savannah River Basin (in South Carolina, USA): Lakes Jocassee, Keowee, Hartwell, Russell, and Thurmond. Since this approach requires only an existing satellite resource with global coverage and existing NWS stations, this method can potentially be ported to any lake where there is a nearby meteorology station. Hence, this method could be used by both water resource managers and limnologists alike. The possibility is discussed of extending this approach beyond a single basin to encompass an entire geographical region or continent.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1439-8621	1439-863X		WOS:000381204900007

The antioxidant capacities of BSE and four fractions on ABTS, DPPH, FRAP and total antioxidant capacity assays exhibited the following descending order: DF > n-butanol fraction (BF) > BSE approximate to ethyl acetate fraction (AF) > water fraction (WF). Among the identified phenolic compounds, caffeic acid exhibited the highest antioxidant capacities on DPPH, FRAP and total antioxidant capacity assays. An extremely significant positive correlation between the antioxidant activities with the contents of total flavonoids, total phenolic acids, or total phenolics was observed in this study. The result indicated that the bamboo shaving extract and its solvent fractions could act as natural antioxidants in light of their potent antioxidant activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1420-3049			WOS:000382334600035

J	Kholodenko, Arkady L.								Optical knots and contact geometry II. From Ranada dyons to transverse and cosmetic knots								ANNALS OF PHYSICS				371				77	124		10.1016/j.aop.2016.04.003			AUG 2016	2016	Some time ago Ranada (1989) obtained new nontrivial solutions of the Maxwellian gauge fields without sources. These were reinterpreted in Kholodenko (2015) [10] (part I) as particle-like (monopoles, dyons, etc.). They were obtained by the method of Abelian reduction of the non-Abelian Yang-Mills functional. The developed method uses instanton-type calculations normally employed for the non-Abelian gauge fields. By invoking the electric-magnetic duality it then becomes possible to replace all known charges/masses by the particle-like solutions of the source free Abelian gauge fields. To employ these results in high energy physics, it is essential to extend Ranada's results by carefully analyzing and classifying all dynamically generated knotted/linked structures in gauge fields, including those discovered by Ranada. This task is completed in this work. The study is facilitated by the recent progress made in solving the Moffatt conjecture. Its essence is stated as follows: in steady incompressible Euler-type fluids the streamlines could have knots/links of all types. By employing the correspondence between the ideal hydrodynamics and electrodynamics discussed in part I and by superimposing it with the already mentioned method of Abelian reduction, it is demonstrated that in the absence of boundaries only the iterated torus knots and links could be dynamically generated. Obtained results allow to develop further particle-knot/link correspondence studied in Kholodenko (2015) [13]. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) can mitigate the deficiencies of interval-based inspection techniques and provide real-time diagnostic information regarding the bridge structural health. SHMis not flawless however; the variability in the vehicle characteristics and traffic operational conditions makes it prone to false diagnosis. Recent advancements in the integration of SHM with intelligent transportation systems (ITS) demonstrate the successful use of ITS devices (e.g., traffic cameras, traffic detectors) in the analysis of bridge responses to multimodal traffic with varying loads or during the critical events that cause excess vibration beyond the normal limit. In an ITS-informed SHM system, the ITS device collected data can be integrated with SHM to increase the reliability and accuracy of the SHM system. This integration would reduce the possibility of false diagnosis of damages detected by the SHM system (e.g., vibrations caused by heavy vehicles on a bridge could be read by a SHM sensor as a structural health problem of the bridge), which would eventually decrease the bridge maintenance costs. Similarly, in SHM-informed ITS system, SHM sensors can provide data on bridge health condition for ITS applications, where ITS uses this bridge health condition information for real-time traffic management. In this paper, literature related to both ITS-informed SHM and SHM-informed ITS is reviewed. Based on the literature review, potential challenges and future research directions associated with ITS-SHM integration are also discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000381456400002

Investment in early American art: the impact of transaction costs and no-sales on returns								JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMICS				40	3			335	357		10.1007/s10824-015-9252-7			AUG 2016	2016	Art, along with other "treasure assets," has become a central object for investment opportunities. Investment return studies using hedonic and resale price regressions on different artistic periods and styles produce estimates of varying rates of return, predominately low rates with high standard deviations. The present study employs a new sample of American art sold at auction between 1987 and 2011-art created before 1950 by 33 artists born prior to 1900. Our study, unlike those that preceded it, considers works that are no-sales (those "bought-in" for failing to sell at auction at or above a predetermined and negotiated minimum price), in addition to full transaction costs-buyers and sellers premia on hammer prices. We conclude that investment return calculations are biased upward and may be negative when these factors are considered and that the "consumption utility" of art may be higher than previously thought. However, using a variant of the capital asset pricing model, we find that investment in early American art may still be desirable in a diversified portfolio of assets for when the price of stock assets falls, the price of art does not fall in the same proportion.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0885-2545	1573-6997		WOS:000381194400005

Impact of Lepidoptera (Crambidae, Noctuidae, and Pyralidae) Pests on Corn Containing Pyramided Bt Traits and a Blended Refuge in the Southern United States								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				109	4			1859	1871		10.1093/jee/tow109			AUG 2016	2016	Blended refuge for transgenic plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins has been approved in the northern United States as a resistance management strategy alternative to a structured refuge. A three-year study (2012-2014) was conducted with 54 trials across nine states in the southern United States to evaluate plant injury from lepidopteran pests of corn and yield in a corn hybrid expressing Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Pioneer Brand Optimum Leptra) planted as a pure stand and in refuge blends of 5, 10, and 20% in both early and late plantings. Injury by corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), was generally proportional to the percentage of non-Bt corn within each refuge blend. Across locations, ear injury in plots with 100% Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Optimum Leptra) corn ranged from no injury to a maximum of 0.42 cm(2) per ear in Mississippi in 2013. Leaf injury ratings in 100% non-Bt plots in early and late planted trials in 2014 were 86- and 70-fold greater than in 100% Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Optimum Leptra) plots. Plants in plots with blended refuges had significantly greater leaf injury in 2012 (5, 10, and 20% refuge blends), in the early-planted corn in 2013 (10 and 20% only), and in both early-and late-planted corn in 2014 (20% only) as compared with leaf injury in a pure stand of Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Optimum Leptra) seen during these years. Corn ears in plots with blended refuges also had significantly greater area of kernels injured in 2012 (5, 10, and 20%), in early-and late-planted corn in 2013 (5, 10, and 20%), and in early (10 and 20% only)and late-planted corn (5, 10, and 20%) in 2014 as compared with ear injury in a pure stand of Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Optimum Leptra) seen during these years. Infestations of southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), were also significantly reduced by Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Optimum Leptra). Despite these differences in injury, yield averaged across locations varied among refuge blends only in the late-planted trials in 2013, with greater yields in the 0% refuge blend than in the 20% blend; however, when examining yield separately by location, only two of nine locations had higher yields in the 100% Bt plots than in any of the blended refuge plots. As a complement to studying the contribution of blended refuge to delaying resistance, quantifying injury and yield in a range of refuge blends is a necessary step to provide management information on the range of lepidopteran pests that occur in the southern United States.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000381916900048	27329627

This study investigated the influence of galvanic coupling between a nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti)-based SMA and a low-carbon steel on their corrosion performance in simulated concrete pore solution. Three measurement cells were considered: SMA alone, low-carbon steel alone, and one with the coupled SMA and carbon steel. The specimens were immersed in the chloride-free pore solution for 20days and then 3% by weight of NaCl was added to the solution. The specimens were then kept in the chloride-contaminated solution for 70days. The corrosion resistances of the specimens were assessed by different electrochemical measurement techniques. The results of the electrochemical experiments showed a significant increase in corrosion activity of the coupled specimens compared with that for other measurement cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0899-1561	1943-5533		WOS:000381052200019

However, the time to corrosion of steel immersed in pore solution is different from that in actual concrete. The objective of this work was to study the impact of the presence of the steel and the distance between coarse aggregates and steel bars on the corrosion of the steel bars. Three distances between steel and the coarse aggregates were investigated in this study. Results clearly showed that the presence and the position of coarse aggregates with respect to the steel bars can significantly affect the access of steel to chloride ions and consequently, corrosion initiation on the surface of steel. It was determined that decreasing the distance between the coarse aggregates and steel had adverse impact on the corrosion initiation on the steel.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0899-1561	1943-5533		WOS:000381052200021

This simple structure obviates the need for complex designs deemed necessary for realizing large-mode-area fibers. Modes ranging from HE1,(12) to HE1,(22) were found to propagate stably over 15 m in this fiber. The index step is approximately 4 times larger than that obtained with fluorine down doping; thus the fiber supports even higher-order modes, which may have implications for building rare-earth-doped fiber lasers or achieving enhanced dispersion tunability for high-energy fiber nonlinear phenomena.

The objective of this study was to compare accumulation of biohydrogenation intermediates causing milk fat depression, including conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), when corn with low or high K-d were fed to continuous cultures. Diets contained (dry matter basis) 50% forage (alfalfa pellets and grass hay) and 50% concentrate, with either no added fat (LF) or 3.3% added soybean oil (HF). Within both the LF and HF diets, 3 starch degradability treatments were obtained by varying the ratio of processed (heat and pressure treatments) and unprocessed corn sources, giving a total of 6 dietary treatments. Each diet was fed to dual-flow continuous fermenters 3 times a day at 0800, 1600, and 2400 h. Diets were fed for four 10-d periods, with 7 d for adaptation and 3 d for sample collection. Orthogonal contrasts were used in the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS to test the effects of fat, starch degradability, and their interaction. Acetate and acetate: propionate were lower for HF than for LF but daily production of trans-10 18:1 and trans-10, cis-12 CLA were higher for HF than for LF. Increasing starch K-d from low to high increased culture pH, acetate, and valerate but decreased butyrate and isobutyrate. Changes in biohydrogenation intermediates (expressed as % of total isomers) from low to high starch K-d included reductions in trans-11 18:1 and cis-9, trans-11 CLA but increases in trans-10 18:1 and trans-10, cis-12 CLA. The results show that increasing the starch K-d in continuous cultures while holding starch level constant causes elevation of biohydrogenation intermediates linked to milk fat depression.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000381642500034	27265165

Explaining Changes in Organizational Form: The Case of Professional Baseball								JOURNAL OF SPORTS ECONOMICS				17	6			523	557		10.1177/1527002514531789			AUG 2016	2016	In this article, we investigate changes over time in the organization of the relationship between Major League Baseball and minor league baseball teams. We develop a model in which a minor league team serves two functions: talent development and local entertainment. The model predicts different modes of organizing the relationship between majors and minors based on the value of these parameters. We then develop a discursive history. Consistent with the model's predictions, we find that when the value of minor league baseball's training function was low but the value of its entertainment function was high, major and minor league franchises operated independently, engaging in arms'-length transactions. However, as the training function became more important and the local entertainment function less important, formal agreements ceded control of minor league functions to major league franchises. Finally, as the value of local entertainment rose once again in the late 20th century, the two roles were split, with control of local functions accruing to local ownership and training functions to major league teams. This analysis helps shed light on factors that influence the boundaries of the firm.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1527-0025	1552-7794		WOS:000380980000001

Money Matters: Recommendations for Financial Stress Research in Occupational Health Psychology								STRESS AND HEALTH				32	3			181	193		10.1002/smi.2688			AUG 2016	2016	Money is arguably the most important resource derived from work and the most important source of stress for contemporary employees. A substantial body of research supports the relationship between access to financial resources and health and well-being, both at individual and aggregated (e.g. national) levels of analysis. Yet, surprisingly little occupational health psychology research has paid attention to financial issues experienced specifically by those in the labour force. With these issues in mind, the overarching goal of the present paper was to address conceptual and measurement issues in the study of objective and subjective aspects of financial stress and review several assessment options available to occupational health psychology researchers for both aspects of financial stress. Where appropriate, we offer guidance to researchers about choices among various financial stress measures and identify issues that require further research attention.

We used metagenomics to investigate sulfur metabolic pathways from microbial mat communities in two subterranean sulfidic streams in Lower Kane Cave, WY, USA and from Glenwood Hot Springs, CO, USA. Both unassembled and targeted recA gene assembly analyses revealed that these streams were dominated by Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, including groups related to Sulfurovum, Sulfurospirillum, Thiothrix and an epsilonproteobacterial group with no close cultured relatives. Genes encoding sulfide: quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) were abundant at all sites, but the specific SQR type and the taxonomic affiliation of each type differed between sites. The abundance of thiosulfate oxidation pathway genes (Sox) was not consistent between sites, although overall they were less abundant than SQR genes. Furthermore, the Sox pathway appeared to be incomplete in all samples. This work reveals both variations in sulfur metabolism within and between taxonomic groups found in these systems, and the presence of novel epsilonproteobacterial groups.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-1097	1574-6968		WOS:000380762500002

Breastfeeding and Growth of Children in the Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twins Study (PETS): Theoretical Epigenetic Mechanisms								JOURNAL OF HUMAN LACTATION				32	3			481	488		10.1177/0890334416637594			AUG 2016	2016	Background: The prevalence of overweight infants and toddlers has increased by 60% in the past 30 years and is a significant contributor to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and early morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization's updated meta-analysis in 2013 observed an association between breastfeeding and a lower prevalence of obesity later in life. The purpose of this study was to assess the growth of children in a cohort of Australian twins to examine associations between duration of breastfeeding and growth at 18 months of age. Our hypothesis is that the anthropometric measurements of the participants will be greater with shorter duration of breastfeeding.Methods: Methods include using cross-sectional data from a cohort at the 18-month visit (n = 179) in the Peri/postnatal Epigenetics Twins Study (PETS) to assess the relationship between duration of breastfeeding and infant size at 18 months of age. Inclusion criteria were birth weight of more than 2000 grams and breastfed for less than 1 month, 1 to 3 months, or 4 to 6 months.Results: The analysis suggested that infants breastfed for 1 to 3 months were significantly larger than infants breastfed for 4 to 6 months in terms of mean body mass index (BMI) (0.61 kg/m(2); P = .02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-1.05), arm circumference (0.66 cm; P = .006; 95% CI, 0.26-1.06), and abdominal circumference (1.16 cm; P = .03; 95% CI, 0.26-2.06). The analysis also suggested that infants breastfed for less than 1 month were significantly larger than infants breastfed for 4 to 6 months in terms of mean arm circumference (0.72 cm; P = .009; 95% CI, 0.26-1.17).Conclusion: Results suggest that supplementing with non-breast milk before 4 months of age was associated with an increased BMI, arm circumference, and abdominal circumference at 18 months of age. The mean BMI decreased from 85% to 65% when infants were breastfeeding for 4 to 6 months as compared to breastfeeding for 1 to 3 months. Breastfeeding for 4 to 6 months appeared to protect against the risk of obesity for the children in the PETS.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0890-3344	1552-5732		WOS:000380275800018	27009979

A reputation system computes and publishes reputation score for each node based on a collection of opinions from others about the node. However, collusion behaviors impair the effectiveness of reputation systems in trustworthy node selection. Though many reputation calculation methods have been proposed to mitigate collusion's influence, little effort has been devoted to specifically tackling collusion. Based on the important collusion behavior characteristics in reputation evaluation and influence on reputation values, we propose a basic collusion detection method to specifically detect suspicious collusion behaviors in pairs. We further optimize the method by reducing the computing overhead. We also propose two pre-processing methods to firstly identify partial reputation raters of a node that are more likely to be colluders before applying the collusion detection method on them, thus reducing the collusion detection overhead. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed methods can significantly enhance the capability of existing reputation systems to detect collusion with low overhead. Also, the pre-processing methods are effective in reducing the collusion detection overhead without affecting the collusion detection accuracy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000380060500009

In Facebook, each datacenter has a full copy of all data, and the master datacenter updates all other datacenters, generating tremendous load in this new model. Distributed data storage, which only stores a user's data to his/her geographically closest datacenters mitigates the problem. However, frequent interactions between distant users lead to frequent inter-datacenter communication and hence long service latencies. In this paper, we aim to reduce inter-datacenter communications while still achieving low service latency. We first verify the benefits of the new model and present OSN typical properties that underlie the basis of our design. We then propose Selective Data replication mechanism in Distributed Datacenters (SD3). Since replicas need inter-datacenter data updates, datacenters in SD3 jointly consider update rates and visit rates to select user data for replication; furthermore, SD3 atomizes users' different types of data (e.g., status update, friend post, music) for replication, ensuring that a replica always reduces inter-datacenter communication. SD3 also incorporates three strategies to further enhance its performance: locality-aware multicast update tree, replica deactivation, and datacenter congestion control. The results of trace-driven experiments on the real-world PlanetLab testbed demonstrate the higher efficiency and effectiveness of SD3 in comparison to other replication methods and the effectiveness of its three schemes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000380060500017

Studies have delineated information about its life history and the influences of various stressors on its reproduction. Due to the bald eagle's position at the top of the food web, it is susceptible to biomagnification of xenobiotics. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality implemented a program in 1999 to monitor persistent chemicals including polychlorinated biphenols (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDE). The objectives of the present study were to evaluate spatial and temporal trends of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides in nestling bald eagles of Michigan. The authors' study found that concentrations of PCBs and DDE were higher in Great Lakes areas with Lakes Michigan and Lake Huron having the highest concentrations of DDE and Lake Erie having the highest concentrations of PCBs. Temporally (1987-1992, 1999-2003, and 2004-2008) the present study found declines in PCB and DDE concentrations with a few exceptions. Continued monitoring of Michigan bald eagle populations is suggested for a couple of reasons. First, nestling blood contaminant levels are an appropriate method to monitor ecosystem contaminant levels. Second, from 1999 to 2008 PCB and DDE concentrations for 30% and 40%, respectively, of the nestling eagles sampled were above the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) for bald eagles. Lastly, with the continued development and deployment of new chemistries a continuous long term monitoring program is an invaluable resource. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:1995-2002.

The effects of bupropion on hybrid striped bass brain chemistry and predatory behavior								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				35	8			2058	2065		10.1002/etc.3350			AUG 2016	2016	Increased use of antidepressants has led to an increase in their detection in final treated wastewater effluents and receiving streams. Antidepressants are intended to modify human behavior by altering brain chemistry, and because of the high functional conservation of antidepressant target receptors in vertebrates, aquatic organisms may be at risk. The antidepressant bupropion is designed to alter brain norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations in humans. The objective of the present study was to understand if alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations in the hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilisxMorone chrysops) brain by bupropion would alter this predator's ability to capture prey. The authors exposed hybrid striped bass to bupropion in a static system for 6d, followed by a 6-d recovery period. During the present study's 12-d experiment, each hybrid striped bass was fed 4 unexposed fathead minnows every 3d, and the time it took the hybrid striped bass to consume each of those 4 fathead minnows was quantified. After each feeding event, hybrid striped bass brains were harvested and analyzed for changes in several brain neurotransmitter concentrations, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and many of their metabolites. Although bupropion altered the concentration of dopamine and many of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter metabolite concentrations in the brains on day 3 of the exposure, it did not alter the time to capture prey. This suggests that alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations in the hybrid striped bass brain does not alter a predator's ability to capture prey.

J	Leone, Cortney M.; Tang, Chaoyi; Sharp, Julia; Jiang, Xiuping; Fraser, Angela								Presence of human noroviruses on bathroom surfaces: a review of the literature								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH				26	4			420	432		10.1080/09603123.2015.1135312			AUG 2016	2016	Enteric viruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide with most cases of illness attributed to caliciviruses, such as human noroviruses (HuNoV). While environmental transmission of HuNoV is reported to be low, environmental surfaces could be a source of secondary transmission. As many vomiting/fecal episodes occur in bathrooms, bathroom surfaces could be an important vehicle for transmitting HuNoV. We systematically reviewed the literature to determine the presence of HuNoV on bathroom surfaces. Our review included 22 eligible studies conducted in commercial and institutional settings. Under outbreak conditions, 11 studies reported detection rates of 20-100%. Six studies implicated bathroom surfaces as primary sources of HuNoV infection while three reported HuNoV present on bathroom surfaces but indicated different primary sources. Under non-outbreak conditions, five studies reported detection rates of 2-17%. Factors associated with HuNoV presence in bathrooms included population density, setting type, employee numbers, food handler knowledge, awareness, and behaviours, and cleaning/disinfecting procedures. Our review suggests bathrooms could be vehicles that transmit HuNoV under both outbreak and non-outbreak conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0960-3123	1369-1619		WOS:000380056000005	26786956

An evolutionary adaptive dynamic programming and reinforcement learning framework is introduced for evolving the I-DEMS online. The I-DEMS is an optimal or near-optimal DEMS capable of performing grid-connected and islanded microgrid operations. The primary sources of energy are sustainable, green, and environmentally friendly renewable energy systems (RESs), e.g., wind and solar; however, these forms of energy are uncertain and nondispatchable. Backup battery energy storage and thermal generation were used to overcome these challenges. Using the I-DEMS to schedule dispatches allowed the RESs and energy storage devices to be utilized to their maximum in order to supply the critical load at all times. Based on the microgrid's system states, the I-DEMS generates energy dispatch control signals, while a forward-looking network evaluates the dispatched control signals over time. Typical results are presented for varying generation and load profiles, and the performance of I-DEMS is compared with that of a decision tree approach-based DEMS (D-DEMS). The robust performance of the I-DEMS was illustrated by examining microgrid operations under different battery energy storage conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2162-237X	2162-2388		WOS:000379976800005	26800554	
J	Valamanesh, Vahid; Myers, Andrew T.; Arwade, Sanjay R.; Hajjar, Jerome F.; Hines, Eric; Pang, Weichiang								Wind-wave prediction equations for probabilistic offshore hurricane hazard analysis								NATURAL HAZARDS				83	1			541	562		10.1007/s11069-016-2331-z			AUG 2016	2016	The evaluation of natural catastrophe risk to structures often includes consideration of uncertainty in predictions of some measure of the intensity of the hazard caused by the catastrophe. For example, in the well-established method of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, uncertainty in the intensity measure for the ground motion is considered through so-called ground motion prediction equations, which predict ground motion intensity and uncertainty as a function of earthquake characteristics. An analogous method for evaluating hurricane risk to offshore structures, referred to herein as probabilistic offshore hurricane hazard analysis, has not been studied extensively, and analogous equations do not exist to predict offshore hurricane wind and wave intensity and uncertainty as a function of hurricane characteristics. Such equations, termed here as wind and wave prediction equations (WWPEs), are developed in this paper by comparing wind and wave estimates from parametric models with corresponding measurements during historical hurricanes from 22 offshore buoys maintained as part of the National Data Buoy Center and located near the US Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The considered buoys include observations from 27 historical hurricanes spanning from 1999 to 2012. The 27 hurricanes are characterized by their eye position, translation speed, central pressure, radius to maximum winds, maximum wind speed, Holland B parameter and direction. Most of these parameters are provided for historical hurricanes by the National Hurricane Center's H*Wind program. The exception is the Holland B parameter, which is calculated using a best-fit procedure based on H*Wind's surface wind reanalyses. The formulation of the WWPEs is based on two parametric models: the Holland model to estimate hurricane winds and Young's model to estimate hurricane-induced waves. Model predictions are made for the 27 considered historical hurricanes, and bias and uncertainty of these predictions are characterized by comparing predictions with measurements from buoys. The significance of including uncertainty in the WWPEs is evaluated by applying the WWPEs to a 100,000-year stochastic catalog of synthetic hurricanes at three locations near the US Atlantic coast. The limitations of this approach and remaining work are also discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0921-030X	1573-0840		WOS:000379501000027

Comparison of BIAS correction techniques for GPCC rainfall data in semi-arid climate								STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT				30	6			1659	1675		10.1007/s00477-015-1155-9			AUG 2016	2016	Long-term historical precipitation data are important in developing metrics for studying the impacts of past hydrologic events (e.g., droughts) on water resources management. Many geographical regions around the world often witness lack of long term historical observation and to overcome this challenge, Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) datasets are found to be useful. However, the GPCC data are available at coarser scale (0.5A degrees resolution), therefore bias correction techniques are often applied to generate local scale information before it can be applied for decision making activities. The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare five different bias correction techniques (BCT's) to correct the GPCC data with respect to rain gauges in Iraq, which is located in a semi-arid climatic zone. The BCT's included in this study are: Mean Bias-remove (B) technique, Multiplicative Shift (M), Standardized-Reconstruction (S), Linear Regression (R), and Quantile Mapping (Q). It was observed that the Performance Index (PI) of BCT's differs in space (i.e., precipitation pattern) and temporal scale (i.e., seasonal and monthly). In general, the PI for the Q and B were better compared to other three (M, S and R) bias correction techniques. Comparatively, Q performs better than B during wet season. However, both these techniques performed equally well during average rainy season. This study suggests that instead of using a single bias correction technique at different climatic regimes, multiple BCT's needs to be evaluated for identifying appropriate methodology that suits local climatology.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1436-3240	1436-3259		WOS:000379753200008		
J	Zhang, Hui; Guo, Weihong; Wang, G.

Understanding how environment and genetics regulate plant stoichiometry would help us to better understand stoichiometric homeostasis. Recent studies quantified the effect of environment and genetics on plant stoichiometry for multispecies over a large scale, but few studied the effect within a given species. Provenance tests are best suited to study the effect of environment (site) and genetics (provenance) on stoichiometry and assess the homeostasis for a given species. We determined leaf N and P concentrations for 29 Quercus acutissima provenances, from across the distribution in China, grown in three common gardens with different environments. Compared to the statistically insignificant provenance effect, site effect was large and statistically significant for leaf N and P stoichiometry (P < 0.05), with 43.47, 44.04, and 59.38 % of the total variations accounted for leaf N and P concentrations and N/P ratio, respectively. Meanwhile, the slopes of SMA (Standardized Major Axis) for leaf N concentration and N/P ratio, and leaf P concentration and N/P ratio, remained similar among the sites. Our results suggest that leaf N and P stoichiometry is mainly impacted by environment for a given species, and relative stability of leaf stoichiometric relationships is found independent of site environment, which supports stoichiometric homeostasis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1612-4669	1612-4677		WOS:000379524900016

One key set of attributes that await validation deals with the performance characteristics relative to isotope ratio precision and accuracy. Owing to its availability and prior experience with this research team, the initial evaluation of isotope ratio (IR) performance was performed on a Thermo Scientific Exactive Orbitrap instrument. While the mass accuracy and resolution performance for Orbitrap analyzers are well-documented, no detailed evaluations of the IR performance have been published. Efforts described here involve two variables: the inherent IR precision and accuracy delivered by the LS-APGD microplasma and the inherent IR measurement qualities of Orbitrap analyzers. Important to the IR performance, the various operating parameters of the Orbitrap sampling interface, high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) stage, and ion injection/data acquisition have been evaluated. The IR performance for a range of other elements, including natural, depleted, and enriched uranium isotopes was determined. In all cases, the precision and accuracy are degraded when measuring low abundance (< 0.1% isotope fractions). In the best case, IR precision on the order of 0.1% RSD can be achieved, with values of 1%-3% RSD observed for low-abundance species. The results suggest that the LS-APGD is a promising candidate for field deployable MS analysis and that the high resolving powers of the Orbitrap may be complemented with a here-to-fore unknown capacity to deliver high-precision IRs.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1044-0305	1879-1123		WOS:000379767300012	27080006

Proposal for a unified nomenclature for target-site mutations associated with resistance to fungicides								PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				72	8			1449	1459		10.1002/ps.4301			AUG 2016	2016	Evolved resistance to fungicides is a major problem limiting our ability to control agricultural, medical and veterinary pathogens and is frequently associated with substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the target protein. The convention for describing amino acid substitutions is to cite the wild-type amino acid, the codon number and the new amino acid, using the one-letter amino acid code. It has frequently been observed that orthologous amino acid mutations have been selected in different species by fungicides from the same mode of action class, but the amino acids have different numbers. These differences in numbering arise from the different lengths of the proteins in each species. The purpose of the present paper is to propose a system for unifying the labelling of amino acids in fungicide target proteins. To do this we have produced alignments between fungicide target proteins of relevant species fitted to a well-studied archetype' species. Orthologous amino acids in all species are then assigned numerical labels' based on the position of the amino acid in the archetype protein. (c) 2016 The Authors.

In recent years, carbon nanomaterials of surface and/or structural defects have been found to exhibit similar properties after functionalization in various schemes. Among these carbon-based QDs are carbon dots, which are generally defined as small carbon nanoparticles with surface passivation. In fact, carbon dots now represent a rapidly advancing and expanding research field. As measured by the optical properties of carbon dots, the most effective passivation has been the surface functionalization of carbon nanoparticles with organic or polymeric molecules, corresponding to much brighter fluorescence emissions across the visible spectrum and extending into the near-IR. Therefore, carbon dots have been pursued extensively for potential bioimaging and other biomedical applications. The mechanistic framework for carbon dots includes photoinduced redox processes, similar to those found in conventional semiconductor QDs. As a result, carbon dots have also been pursued for their photocatalytic functions. In this article on surface-functionalized carbon nanoparticles or carbon dots, their representative syntheses and demonstrated properties and their potential uses as high-performance yet nontoxic fluorescence probes for bioimaging in vitro and in vivo are highlighted, so is their serving as potent photocatalysts in energy conversion applications.

J	Childers, Carl C.; Ebert, Timothy A.; Rogers, Michael E.; Shepard, Merle								The occurrence and distribution of Tuckerella japonica (Acari: Tuckerellidae) on tea bushes, Camellia sinensis and C-assamica, in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, USA								EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY				69	4			479	486		10.1007/s10493-016-0055-0			AUG 2016	2016	Adults, immatures and eggs of Tuckerella japonica (Ehara) were collected from unknown clones or varieties of Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze tea bushes in the Clemson University Farm, Coastal Research and Education Center, Charleston, South Carolina; from Assam hybrids in The Caw Caw Nature Preserve in Ravenel, SC; from C. sinensis and C. assamica (Masters) in the Charleston Tea Plantation on Wadmalaw Island, SC; C. sinensis in the Fairhope Tea Plantation in Fairhope, Alabama; and from C. sinensis 'Rosea' and a C. sinensis and C. assamica hybrid in Savannah and Ellabell, Georgia, between 1994 and 2015. This mite was consistently collected from 1-, 2- and 3+-year-old wood of tea plants with significantly greater numbers collected from 2-year-old wood. All stages of the mite were found within longitudinally split areas of the wood where underlying green bark tissues were exposed. As 1-year-old wood matured, there was increased splitting of the bark with increased mite presence. Mature green fruit (= developing seed pods) of tea were also frequented by T. japonica between June-July and October and their numbers were no greater than those on 1- or 3+-year wood. When the fruit were small (March-May) or as they hardened in late fall, they were not suitable feeding sites for this mite. Very few T. japonica were collected from 50 mature, inner or outer leaf samples with none usually found. Tuckerella japonica has multiple, overlapping generations and occurs on tea throughout the year in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, USA.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0168-8162	1572-9702		WOS:000379010100009	27294360

Here, we present the feasibility to produce recombinant proteins in transgenic tobacco Nicotiana tabacum with sequences representing spider silk protein building blocks . Recombinant mini-spidroins contain native N- and C-terminal domains of major ampullate spidroin 1 (rMaSp1) or rMaSp2 flanking an abbreviated number (8, 16 or 32) of consensus repeat domains. Two different expression plasmid vectors were tested and a downstream chitin binding domain and self-cleavable intein were included to facilitate protein purification. We confirmed gene insertion and RNA transcription by PCR and reverse-transcriptase PCR, respectively. Mini-spidroin production was detected by N-terminus specific antibodies. Purification of mini-spidroins was performed through chitin affinity chromatography and subsequent intein activation with reducing reagent. Mini-spidroins, when dialyzed and freeze-dried, formed viscous gelatin-like fluids.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0962-8819	1573-9368		WOS:000379028300011	27026165

The fire consumed 104,131 ha of forested watersheds that were the drinking water source for 2.6 million residents in the San Francisco Bay area. To understand temporal variations in dissolved organic matter (DOM) after the wildfire and its potential impacts on disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation in source water supply, we collected the 0-5 cm ash/soil layer with surface deposits of white ash (high burn severity) and black ash (moderate burn severity) within the Rim Fire perimeter in Oct 2013 (pre-rainfall) for five sequential extractions, and in Dec 2013 (similar to 87 mm cumulative precipitation) and Aug 2014 (similar to 617 mm cumulative precipitation) for a single water extraction. Water-extractable DOM was characterized by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and DBP formation tests. Both increasing cumulative precipitation in the field or number of extractions in the lab resulted in a significant decrease in specific conductivity, dissolved organic carbon, and DBP formation potential, but an increase in DOM aromaticity (reflected by specific UV absorbance). However, the lab sequential leaching failed to capture the increase of the NO(x)(-)7-N/NH4+N ratio and the decrease in pH and dissolved organic carbon/nitrogen ratio of ash/soil extracts from Oct 2013 to Aug 2014. Increasing cumulative precipitation, inferring an increase in leaching after fire, led to an increase in DOM reactivity to form trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, and chloral hydrate, but not for haloketones, haloacetonitrile, or N-nitrosodimethylamine, which were more related to the original burn severity. This study highlights that fire-affected DBP precursors for different DBP species have distinct temporal variation possibly due to their various sensitivity to biogeochemical alterations.

Also, the synergistic influence of using combinations of glass powder with crushed glass aggregate or natural mineral aggregate on the properties of concrete were investigated. The properties of concrete evaluated in this study include slump (workability), density, air content, compressive and splitting tensile strengths of concrete.Results from this investigation showed that the workability of concrete was significantly affected depending on whether the glass powder was used as cement or aggregate replacement material, however, air content and density of concrete were affected only when glass powder was used as cement replacement material. In terms of mechanical properties, in the absence of glass powder in concrete, the compressive and splitting tensile strength values of the concrete specimens containing crushed glass aggregate were significantly lower than that of the concrete containing natural mineral aggregate. When glass powder was used as a cement replacement material in concrete, the compressive strength of concrete decreased regardless of the aggregate type. However, when glass powder was used as an aggregate replacement material, the compressive strength of concrete depended on the type containing crushed glass aggregate increased while the compressive strength of concrete containing natural mineral aggregate decreased.

Energy management system for enhanced resiliency of microgrids during islanded operation								ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				137				133	141		10.1016/j.epsr.2016.04.006			AUG 2016	2016	This paper proposes a method to enhance resiliency of microgrids through survivability. Survivability in this context is to minimize load shed for the duration the microgrid is in islanded mode following a disturbance event. During islanded operation, microgrid loads are prioritized as critical and non-critical loads. The key decision is to ascertain whether to provide energy to non-critical loads after supplying the critical loads or to store excess energy for future dispatches. This task is formulated as a non-linear programming problem. The objective is to minimize the amount of critical load shed while maximizing the amount of non-critical load served for a projected restoration time while adhering to relevant operational and physical constraints. For this extended time-scale problem, uncertainty of renewable generation and load forecast is quantified with probability distribution and confidence levels are used to establish likelihood of forecast error. Distributed generation such as solar and wind farm along with battery energy storage system are modeled. Demand response is implemented through adjustable loads and a fleet of plug in hybrid electric vehicles that can be operated in both grid to vehicle and vehicle to grid mode. Test cases are studied on a modified CIGRE microgrid benchmark test system and results are compared with a temporal decomposition scheme based energy management system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sivov, Oleg; Abdelsalam, Hany; Makram, Elham								Adaptive setting of distance relay for MOV-protected series compensated line considering wind power								ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				137				142	154		10.1016/j.epsr.2016.03.048			AUG 2016	2016	Series compensated lines are protected from overvoltage by metal-oxide-varistors (MOVs) connected in parallel with the capacitor bank. The nonlinear characteristics of MOV devices add complexity to fault analysis and distance protection operation. During faults, the impedance of the line is modified by an equivalent impedance of the parallel MOV/capacitor circuit, which affects the distance protection. The intermittent wind generation introduces additional complexity to the system performance and distance protection. Wind variation affects the fault current level and equivalent MOV/capacitor impedance during a fault, and hence the distance relay operation. This paper proposes an adaptive setting method for the mho relay distance protection of series compensated line considering effects of wind power variation and MOV operation. The distributed parameters of a transmission line are taken into account to avoid overreaching and underreaching of distance relays. A test system is simulated, and results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to resetting the distance relays to adapt to various system conditions, including three wind generation and different compensation levels.

The impact of public and semi-public information on cotton futures market								APPLIED ECONOMICS				48	36			3416	3431		10.1080/00036846.2016.1139677			AUG 2016	2016	This study estimated the impact of all major public and semi-public reports on the cotton futures market from 1995 through 2012. The estimation was based on the event study approach with the events measured by the release of five major reports: Export Sales, Crop Progress, World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) and Prospective Plantings (public reports from US Department of Agriculture) and Cotton This Month (semi-public report from International Cotton Advisory Committee). The best-fitting IGARCH(1,1)-t model that accounted for the day-of-week, seasonality and stock levels was used to measure the report effects on daily nearby cotton close-to-close futures returns. Prospective Plantings and WASDE reports appeared to be the most important sources of information in the cotton markets moving the conditional standard deviation of returns by an average of 14.4 and 9.6 percentage points, respectively. However, significant market reaction was not found for the other three reports. Our analysis revealed that, in the presence of clustering, ignoring the impact of other reports would have resulted in about 18% overestimation of WASDE impact.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-6846	1466-4283		WOS:000375932800003		
J	Sadigh, Arash Khoshkbar; Dargahi, Vahid; Corzine, Keith A.								Analytical Determination of Conduction and Switching Power Losses in Flying-Capacitor-Based Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Multilevel Converter								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS				31	8			5473	5494		10.1109/TPEL.2015.2498107			AUG 2016	2016	Multilevel converters are mainly used in medium-voltage high-power applications. Active neutral-point-clamped (ANPC) flying capacitor multicell (FCM) converter is a well-known type of multilevel converters which is commercially available in high-power medium-voltage motor drive market. Since power loss investigation can be very advantageous in the design phase of multilevel converters, this paper presents an analytical approach to calculate and investigate the conduction and switching power loss in ANPC-FCM converter. First, the RMS and average currents of insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and antiparallel diodes are analytically calculated by considering the associated duty cycle of each IGBT and diode, converter modulation index, load current, and load power factor. Numerical results of the derived closed-form equations to calculate the RMS and average currents of IGBTs/diodes are compared with simulation results and experimental measurements. Numerical results match the simulation results and experimental measurements which validates the derived closed-form equations. Afterward, the obtained equations for RMS and average current computations are utilized to calculate the conduction power losses in a 12.1-MVA 6.6-kV nine-level (line-to-line) ANPC-FCM multilevel converter. For this purpose, a 4.5-kV 1.2-kA IGBT module from ABB is considered as a power switch and its parameters are employed in analytical computations and simulation of the ANPC-FCM multilevel converter for conduction power loss determination. Moreover, closed-form equations are derived for analytical determination of switching power losses for ANPC-FCM converter using Kapteyn (Fourier-Bessel) series. Based on the derived closed-form equations for conduction loss and switching loss calculation, a method is presented to determine the junction temperature in IGBTs and diodes for ANPC-FCM converter.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0885-8993	1941-0107		WOS:000372370000012

Assessing medical student cultural competence: what really matters								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION				7				248	254		10.5116/ijme.578b.687c			JUL 30 2016	2016	Objectives: The study aimed to explore medical students' attitudes and beliefs toward Latino patients, specifically: to assess students' levels of knowledge, cultural competence, and comfort with Latinos; to determine students' exposure to and previous experience with Latinos; and to evaluate whether factors such as study abroad, living abroad, previous clinical experience with Latinos, and language proficiency predict Latino knowledge, cultural competence, and comfort with Latinos.Methods: This study utilized a cross-sectional survey design. Participants were third and fourth year medical students at three medical schools in the Southeastern United States. Three composite measures: Latino knowledge, Cultural competence, and Comfort with Latino patients, were predicted in a multivariate regression model including individual sociodemographic characteristics and past clinical or social experience with Latinos.Results: A total of 170 medical students completed the survey (43% response rate). Spanish language proficiency was a statistically significant predictor (t(131)=2.72, p<0.05) of Latino knowledge. Social interaction with Latinos in the past year (t(126)=3.09, p<0.01), ever having lived in a Spanish-speaking country (t(126)=2.86, p<0.01), and Spanish language proficiency (t(126)=3.28, p<0.01) independently predicted cultural competence. Previous clinical experience with Latinos was not significantly associated with the three composite dependent variables, and comfort with Latino patients was not significantly predicted by any of the six Latino-related explanatory variables.Conclusions: Factors prior to medical school matriculation and during medical education may contribute to increased cultural competence and comfort with multicultural patients. Cultural patient-partner programs may be an effective way to increase cultural competence within the confines of medical school curricula.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2042-6372			WOS:000388426200001	27474895

Based on crystal structures, the mechanism of partial agonism at the glycine-binding site is thought to be mediated by a shift in the conformational equilibrium between an open clamshell and a closed clamshell-like structure of the bilobed ligand-binding domain (LBD). Using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and multiparameter fluorescence detection, which allows us to study the conformational states and dynamics in the submillisecond time scale, we show that there are atleast three conformational states explored by the LBD: the low FRET, medium FRET, and high FRET states. The distance of the medium and low FRET states corresponds to what has been observed in crystallography structures. We show that the high FRET state, which would represent a more closed clamshell conformation than that observed in the crystal structure, is most likely the state initiating activation, as evidenced by the fact that the fraction of the protein in this state correlates well with the extent of activation. Furthermore, full agonist bound LBDs show faster dynamic motions between the medium and high FRET states, whereas they show slower dynamics when bound to weaker agonists or to antagonists.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000380585400022	27226581

The experiment was performed by connecting a pair of branches while grounding the remaining one. Of the three branch combinations, only one combination is optically active which also shows a nonlinear semiconductor-like I V curve, while the other two branch combinations are optically inactive and show linear ohmic I V curves. The photoresponse includes a zero-bias photocurrent from the active branch combination. Responsivity of approximate to 1.6 mA/W has been observed from a single Y-CNT at a moderate bias of 150 mV with an illumination of wavelength 488 nm. The photoresponse experiment allows us to understand the nature of internal connections in the Y-CNT. Analysis of data locates the region of photoactivity at the junction of only two branches and only the combination of these two branches (and not individual branches) exhibits photoresponse upon illumination. A model calculation based on back-to-back Schottky-type junctions at the branch connection explains the I-V data in the dark and shows that under illumination the barriers at the contacts become lowered due to the presence of photogenerated carriers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			WOS:000380735500044	27379988

Recently, the metabolic engineering of this host has become increasingly popular due to its ability to accumulate lipids as well as improvements made toward developing new genetic tools. Y. lipolytica can robustly metabolize glucose, glycerol, and even different lipid classes. However, little is known about its xylose metabolizing capability. Given the desirability of having a robust xylose utilizing strain of Y. lipolytica, we performed a comprehensive investigation and elucidation of the existing components of its xylose metabolic pathway.Results: A quick and efficient means of determining functionality of the candidate xylose pathway genes (XYR, XDH, and XKS) from Y. lipolytica was desirable. We challenged Escherichia coli mutants lacking either the xylose isomerase (xylA) gene or the xylulose kinase (xylB) gene to grow on xylose minimal media by expressing the candidate genes from Y. lipolytica. We showed that the XKS of Y. lipolytica is able to rescue xylose growth of E. coli Delta xylB, and the XDH enabled growth on xylitol, but not on xylose, of E. coli Delta xylA. Overexpression of XKS and XDH in Y. lipolytica improved growth on xylitol, indicating that expression of the native enzymes was limiting. Overexpression of XKS and XDH in Y. lipolytica also enables robust growth on xylose under high nitrogen conditions without the need for adaptation. These results prove that a complete xylose pathway exists in Y. lipolytica, but the pathway is poorly expressed. To elucidate the XYR gene, we applied the E. coli Delta xylA xylose growth challenge with 14 candidate XYR genes and XDH. The XYR2 candidate was able to rescue growth of E. coli Delta xylA xylose on minimal media.Conclusions: While a native xylose pathway exists in Y. lipolytica, the microorganism's inability to grow robustly on xylose is an effect of cryptic genetic circuits that control expression of key enzymes in the metabolic pathway. We have characterized the key enzymes associated with xylose metabolism and demonstrated that gene regulatory issues can be overcome using strong hybrid promoters to attain robust growth on xylose without adaptation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-6834			WOS:000379902600001	27446238

A using 6.1 years of Pass. 8 data. After Centaurus. A, this is now the second example of an extended gamma-ray source attributed to a radio galaxy. Both an extended flat disk morphology and a morphology following the extended radio lobes were preferred over a point-source description, and the core contribution was constrained to be < 14% of the total gamma-ray flux. A preferred alignment of the gamma-ray elongation with the radio lobes was demonstrated by rotating the radio lobes template. We found no significant evidence for variability on similar to 0.5 year timescales. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a lobe origin for the gamma-rays. With the extended nature of the > 100 MeV gamma-ray emission established, we model the source broadband emission considering currently available total lobe radio and millimeter flux measurements, as well as X-ray detections attributed to inverse Compton (IC) emission off the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Unlike the Centaurus. A case, we find that a leptonic model involving IC scattering of CMB and extragalactic background light (EBL) photons underpredicts the gamma-ray fluxes by factors of about similar to 2-3, depending on the EBL model adopted. An additional gamma-ray spectral component is thus required, and could be due to hadronic emission arising from proton-proton collisions of cosmic rays with thermal plasma within the radio lobes.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000381962200001

Because of their extremely hard X-ray continua, these objects are best studied in the X-ray domain. Here, we report on the discovery by the Fermi Large Area Telescope and subsequent follow-up observations with NuSTAR, Swift, and GROND of a new member of the MeV blazar family: PMN J0641-0320. Our optical spectroscopy provides confirmation that this is a flat-spectrum radio quasar located at a redshift of z = 1.196. Its very hard NuSTAR spectrum (power-law photon index of similar to 1 up to similar to 80 keV) indicates that the emission is produced via inverse Compton scattering off of photons coming from outside the jet. The overall spectral energy distribution of PMN J0641-0320 is typical of powerful blazars and, using a simple one-zone leptonic emission model, we infer that the emission region is located either inside the broad line region or within the dusty torus.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000381962200076

Evaluating quantifiable metrics for hospital green checklists								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				127				134	142		10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.167			JUL 20 2016	2016	While hospitals, sustainable healthcare organizations, and recent peer-reviewed publications have assessed the sustainability of medical products and services, the healthcare industry lacks a framework to effectively inform environmental decision making and quantitatively assess the success of sustain ability initiatives for medical products and services. Several recent publications have even expressed a need for better ways to quantify sustainable healthcare practices. To address these needs, this research compared the cradle-to-grave environmental and economic impacts of some of the most common recommendations from checklists: reusable versus disposable medical products, and changes to common medical services. Salient results and conclusions from recent studies focusing on the environmental and economic impacts of various reusable versus disposable medical products and different medical services were synthesized and prioritized. All relevant results related to environmental and economic impacts of reusable versus disposable medical products and the analyzed medical services were also correlated with existing sustainable checklists. The results showed that reusable products were less expensive their single-use disposable alternatives. The dental bur also required the least amount of water for its associated cleaning processes, had the lowest total embodied energy, and had the lowest associated greenhouse gas emissions. These outcomes were likely due to the fact the burs were, by far, the smallest examined product. Based on the results derived from the study, healthcare checklists should be updated to include: optimizing the reusability of medical products; reduce products utilized in custom packs; and evaluating energy recovery potential of utilized products. The results of this study indicate that sustainable healthcare checklists be further validated with more environmental and economic life cycle analyses related to medical products and services. The primary aim of this paper is to assist hospital employees and administrators with making more informed decisions about the sustainability of their products and services. The scientific value of this paper is underscored by a novel aggregation of life cycle assessment studies pertaining to medical devices and services in order to draw conclusions regarding the overall sustainability of those medical devices and services.

We recently reported the reduction of radicals in buffered aqueous solution catalyzed by a ruthenium complex with biologically relevant non-tertiary alcohols as terminal reductants. Mechanistic evidence is presented, indicating that this catalytic radical reduction is achieved by a Ru-hydride intermediate formed by beta-hydride elimination from a Ru-alkoxide species. A similar mechanism and Ru-hydride intermediate was previously reported to kill cancer cells with catalytic pro-oxidant effects. Therefore, our demonstration of catalytic antioxidant effects by the same type of intermediate reveals new potential therapeutic strategies and applications for catalytic systems that form Ru-hydride intermediates.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000383253500009	27254303

A broadband bi-stable flow energy harvester based on the wake-galloping phenomenon								APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS				109	3					033904	10.1063/1.4959181			JUL 18 2016	2016	Linear wake-galloping flow energy harvesters have a narrow frequency bandwidth restricted to the lock-in region, where the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the harvester. As a result, their performance is very sensitive to variations in the flow speed around the nominal design value. This letter demonstrates that the lock-in region of a wake-galloping flow energy harvester can be improved by exploiting a bi-stable restoring force. To demonstrate the enhanced performance, the response behavior of a bi-stable piezoelectric cantilever harvester is evaluated in a wind tunnel. A Von Karman vortex street is generated by placing a rectangular rod in the windward direction of the harvester and the voltage response of the harvester is evaluated as a function of the wind speed. It is shown that, compared to the linear design, bi-stability can be used to improve the steady-state bandwidth considerably.

J	Horing, Bjoern; Newsome, Nathan D.; Enck, Paul; Babu, Sabarish V.; Muth, Eric R.								A virtual experimenter to increase standardization for the investigation of placebo effects								BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY				16						84	10.1186/s12874-016-0185-4			JUL 18 2016	2016	Background: Placebo effects are mediated by expectancy, which is highly influenced by psychosocial factors of a treatment context. These factors are difficult to standardize. Furthermore, dedicated placebo research often necessitates single-blind deceptive designs where biases are easily introduced. We propose a study protocol employing a virtual experimenter - a computer program designed to deliver treatment and instructions - for the purpose of standardization and reduction of biases when investigating placebo effects.Methods: To evaluate the virtual experimenter's efficacy in inducing placebo effects via expectancy manipulation, we suggest a partially blinded, deceptive design with a baseline/retest pain protocol (hand immersions in hot water bath). Between immersions, participants will receive an (actually inert) medication. Instructions pertaining to the medication will be delivered by one of three metaphors: The virtual experimenter, a human experimenter, and an audio/text presentation (predictor "Metaphor"). The second predictor includes falsely informing participants that the medication is an effective pain killer, or correctly informing them that it is, in fact, inert (predictor "Instruction"). Analysis will be performed with hierarchical linear modelling, with a sample size of N = 50. Results from two pilot studies are presented that indicate the viability of the pain protocol (N = 33), and of the virtual experimenter software and placebo manipulation (N = 48).Discussion: It will be challenging to establish full comparability between all metaphors used for instruction delivery, and to account for participant differences in acceptance of their virtual interaction partner. Once established, the presence of placebo effects would suggest that the virtual experimenter exhibits sufficient cues to be perceived as a social agent. He could consequently provide a convenient platform to investigate effects of experimenter behavior, or other experimenter characteristics, e.g., sex, age, race/ethnicity or professional status. More general applications are possible, for example in psychological research such as bias research, or virtual reality research. Potential applications also exist for standardizing clinical research by documenting and communicating instructions used in clinical trials.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1471-2288			WOS:000380232400002	27430476

An anthracene mono-derivative with a long alkyl tail and a molecule with a tethered pair of anthracene species (bis-anthracene) in a "molecular tweezers"-like configuration were synthesized and evaluated for the separation of SWNTs. While the mono-derivative was incapable of the noncovalent functionaliza tion-solubilization, the bis-anthracene was found to be very effective. The results suggest that molecular tweezers of a tethered pair of planar aromatic species can be coupled with the selection of a suitable solvent or solvent mixture for effective and efficient post-production separation of metallic and semiconducting SWNTs.

J	Zhang, Lingling; Bossert, Thomas; Mahal, Ajay; Hu, Guoqing; Guo, Qing; Liu, Yuanli								Attitudes towards primary care career in community health centers among medical students in China								BMC FAMILY PRACTICE				17						75	10.1186/s12875-016-0472-5			JUL 16 2016	2016	Background: Very few of the primary care doctors currently working in China's community health centers have a college degree (issued by 5-year medical schools). How to attract college graduates to community services in the future, therefore, has major policy relevance in the government's ongoing efforts to reform community health care and fill in the long-absent role of general physicians in China. This paper examined medical school students' attitudes towards working in communities and the factors that may affect their career choices in primary care to inform policy on this subject.Methods: A cross-sectional survey was designed upon the issuance of community health reform policy in 2006 by the Chinese government. The survey was conducted among 2714 medical students from three medical schools in representative regions in China. Binomial and multinomial regression analyses were carried out using a collection of plausible predictors such as place of rearing, income, etc. to assess their willingness to work in communities.Results: Of the 2402 valid responses, besides 5.7 % objection to working in communities, 19.1 % expressed definite willingness. However, the majority (41.5 %) of students only consider community job as a temporary transition, in addition to 33.7 % using it as their backup option. The survey analyses found that medical students who are more likely to be willing to work in communities tend to come from rural backgrounds, have more exposure to community health reform, and possess certain personally held value and fit.Conclusion: To attract more graduates from 5-year medical schools to work in communities, a targeted recruiting approach or admission policy stands a better chance of success. The findings on the influencing factors of medical students' career choice can help inform policymakers, medical educators, and community health managers to improve the willingness of swing students to enter primary care to strengthen basic health services.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1471-2296			WOS:000379800300002	27423474

Multitemporal phenological floristic analysis of the shores of Lake Issaqueena, South Carolina								Bartonia				68				60	85					JUL 15 2016	2016	Linking historic herbarium collections with current geospatial temporal floristic and phenological data is crucial for environmental change research and education. The floristic and phenological (flowering) study of Lake Issaqueena in Pickens County, SC, conducted by William Pamplin in 1970-1971 was reinvestigated in 2011-2012 using the Carolina Vegetative Survey (CVS) natural community sampling methods and photo documentation using a GPS-enabled camera to determine floristic and phenological changes for this site during the forty years separating these two studies. Phenological events (flowering) were recorded via photographs taken by a GPS-enabled camera on a monthly basis. Photographs were downloaded and organized by sampling date in Picasa 3 web albums and stored in a project Google website. Precipitation in 1970,2011 and 2012 was below the long-term average and this combined with higher than average air temperature impacted drought severity in the area. Comparison of phenologies indicated 269 plant species blooming in 1970-1971 compared to 203 plants blooming in 2011-2012, and 149 common plant species blooming in both study periods. The blooming period was 11 months in 2011-2012 compared to 8 months in 1970-1971. A majority of plants were blooming earlier and longer in 2011-2012 than in 1970-1971. Repeat photography and data storage using website have a great potential to enhance phenological research by linking it to historical herbarium collections.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0198-7356			BCI:BCI201600779336

The current geotechnical design of energy piles is merely realized through enlarging the factor of safety. The factor of safety used for energy piles is at least twice that used for traditional piles, which can lead to considerable additional costs and inconsistent levels of safety. Although the performance of existing energy pile technology is satisfactory and recent investigators have significantly advanced the understanding of the load-transfer mechanisms of energy piles, it is still necessary to quantify the uncertainty in the thermal-mechanical analysis and to develop reliability-based designs for energy piles. This paper presents a pioneering probabilistic study on the geotechnical design of energy piles. The critical soil parameters for ultimate limit state (ULS) and serviceability limit state (SLS) are identified through sensitivity study. The point estimate method is adopted to understand the uncertainty propagation and to estimate the probability of ULS failure and the probability of SLS failure. The adverse effects of thermal loading in the geotechnical design of energy piles are explicitly demonstrated through a case study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the fabrication of well-structured efficient multi-component Z-scheme photocatalysts is still a big challenge. We report here a facile one-pot method to synthesize graphene-based Z-scheme photocatalysts. The one-pot method guarantees good distribution of well-structured individual components on thin-layered rGO sheets with excellent connections. With inactive WO3 nanorods and inactive beta-In2S3 nanosheets attached to the surface of the rGO sheets, the synthesized In2S3/WO3/rGO tertiary nanocomposite shows excellent visible- light catalytic activity for hydrogen production at 1524 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), demonstrating unambiguously the Z-scheme catalytic mechanism. To prevent cross-reactions and interferences, our strategy was to choose no more than one ionic precipitation reaction for the one-pot process, as unwanted cross-reactions could become inevitable if many cations and anions were present. This fabrication strategy should be applicable generally to synthesize other multiple-component nanocomposites, as demonstrated also by the preliminary results of the successful synthesis of the BiVO4/WO3/rGO nanocomposite (one ionic precipitation reaction and one hydrolysis reaction) and WO3/TiO2/rGO nanocomposite (two hydrolysis reactions).									1	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000377503100017	27263498

Little is known, however, about the genetic basis of these convergent or parallel traits: are they mediated by identical or different mutations in the same genes, or unique mutations in different genes? Using a combination of candidate gene and reduced representation genomic sequencing approaches, we explore the genetic basis of and the evolutionary processes that mediate similar plumage colour shared by isolated populations of the Monarcha castaneiventris flycatcher of the Solomon Islands. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) that explicitly controlled for population structure revealed that mutations in known pigmentation genes are the best predictors of parallel plumage colour. That is, entirely black or melanic birds from one small island share an amino acid substitution in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), whereas similarly melanic birds from another small island over 100 km away share an amino acid substitution in a predicted binding site of agouti signalling protein (ASIP). A third larger island, which separates the two melanic populations, is inhabited by birds with chestnut bellies that lack the melanic MC1R and ASIP allelic variants. Formal F-STs outlier tests corroborated the results of the GWAS and suggested that strong, directional selection drives the near fixation of the MC1R and ASIP variants across islands. Our results, therefore, suggest that selection acting on different mutations with large phenotypic effects can drive the evolution of parallel melanism, despite the relatively small population size on islands.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000381652100007

We herein reported a case study of layer-structured oxychalcogenides Bi1-xPbxCuSeO (x = 0-10%) with emphases on the reaction mechanism of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) and the impact of SHS conditions on the thermoelectric properties. The combined results of X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and quenching experiments corroborated that the SHS process of BiCuSeO consisted two fast binary SHS reactions (2 Bi+3 Se -> Bi2Se3 and 2Cu+Se -> Cu2Se) intimately coupled with two relatively slow solid-state diffusion reactions (2 Bi2Se3+B2O3 -> 3 Bi2SeO2 and then Bi2SeO2+Cu2Se -> 2 BiCuSeO). The formation rate of the reaction intermediate Bi2SeO2 was the bottleneck in the SHS process of BiCuSeO. Importantly, we found that adding PbO in the starting materials has (i) facilitated the formation of Bi2SeO2 and thus significantly reduced the SHS reaction time; (ii) improved the phase purity and sample homogeneity; (iii) increased the power factor via increasing both carrier concentration and effective mass; and (iv) reduced the lattice thermal conductivity via more point defect phonon scattering. As a result, a state-of-the-art ZT value similar to 1.2 has been attained at 923 K for Bi0.94Pb0.06CuSeO. These results not only open a new avenue for mass production of single phased multinary thermoelectric materials but also inspire more investigation into the SHS mechanisms of multinary materials in diverse fields of material science and engineering.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000379704100014

The species is characterized by 11 fixed inversions, one nearly fixed inversion, and three common polymorphisms. The sister species of S. armoricanum is proposed as a formally undescribed species discovered in samples from Portugal. It shares one unique inversion with S. armoricanum, but otherwise differs by eight fixed or nearly fixed rearrangements. Simulium armoricanum and its newly discovered sister species, informally referred to as Simulium 'IL-8', are members of a larger clade of Palearctic species defined by a small pericentric inversion in chromosome III. Among the simuliid species occupying the same streams with S. armoricanum was the first record, chromosomally confirmed, of S. aureum Fries sensu stricto in Portugal. Successful chromosomal analysis of samples of S. armoricanum 17 years after initial fixation demonstrates the importance of storing cytologically fixed larvae at subzero temperatures.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1175-5326	1175-5334		WOS:000379219800003	27470716

The test structure in the hybrid simulation was a three-story woodframe building that was divided into a numerical substructure of the first story with various retrofits and a full-scale physical substructure of the upper two stories. Four long-stroke actuators, two at the second floor and two at the roof diaphragm, were attached to the physical substructure to impose the simulated seismic responses including both translation and in-plane rotation. Challenges associated with this first implementation of a full-scale hybrid simulation on a woodframe building were identified. This paper presents the development and validation of a scalable and robust hybrid simulation controller for efficient test site deployment. The development consisted of three incremental validation phases ranging from small-scale, mid-scale, to full-scale tests conducted at three laboratories. Experimental setup, procedure, and results of each phase of the controller development are discussed, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of the incremental controller development approach for large-scale hybrid simulation programs with complex test setup.

An ABC-Problem for location and consensus functions on graphs								DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS				207				15	28		10.1016/j.dam.2015.12.008			JUL 10 2016	2016	A location problem can often be phrased as a consensus problem. The median function Med is a location/consensus function on a connected graph G that has the finite sequences of vertices of G as input. For each such sequence pi, Med returns the set of vertices that minimize the distance sum to the elements of pi. The median function satisfies three intuitively clear axioms: (A) Anonymity, (B) Betweenness and (C) Consistency. Mulder and Novick showed in 2013 that on median graphs these three axioms actually characterize Med. This result raises a number of questions:(i) On what other classes of graphs is Med characterized by (A), (B) and (C)?(ii) If some class of graphs has other ABC-functions besides Med, can we determine additional axioms that are needed to characterize Med?(iii) In the latter case, can we find characterizations of other functions that satisfy (A), (B) and (C)?We call these questions, and related ones, the ABC-Problem for consensus functions on graphs. In this paper we present first results. We construct a non-trivial class different from the median graphs, on which the median function is the unique "ABC-function".

Tail use improves performance on soft substrates in models of early vertebrate land locomotors								SCIENCE				353	6295			154	158		10.1126/science.aaf0984			JUL 8 2016	2016	In the evolutionary transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment, early tetrapods faced the challenges of terrestrial locomotion on flowable substrates, such as sand and mud of variable stiffness and incline. The morphology and range of motion of appendages can be revealed in fossils; however, biological and robophysical studies of modern taxa have shown that movement on such substrates can be sensitive to small changes in appendage use. Using a biological model ( the mudskipper), a physical robot model, granular drag measurements, and theoretical tools from geometric mechanics, we demonstrate how tail use can improve robustness to variable limb use and substrate conditions. We hypothesize that properly coordinated tail movements could have provided a substantial benefit for the earliest vertebrates to move on land.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000379208400035	27387947	
J	Rahmani-andebili, Mehdi								Optimal power factor for optimally located and sized solar parking lots applying quantum annealing								IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION				10	10			2538	2547		10.1049/iet-gtd.2015.1553			JUL 7 2016	2016	Investigating optimal value of the power factor for the optimally allocated and sized solar parking lots of the plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) based on minimum total cost of the problem over the given planning period is the aim of this study. Covering a parking lot with photovoltaic (PV) panels can keep the PEVs cool, charge their batteries for free, and generate extra energy and deliver it to the grid. Moreover, the inverter installed in the charging station of a parking lot is capable of generating or absorbing reactive power by changing the operating mode of the inverter without any degradation of the PEV's battery. Therefore, the PEVs and the solar parking lots can be applied as the auxiliary sources of active and reactive powers by the local distribution company (DISCO). In this study, in order to achieve realistic results, the economic aspects and technical factors of the system, and also the behavioural model of the PEVs fleet are taken into consideration in the planning problem. Moreover, the stochastic nature of the PEVs behaviour and power of the installed PV panels are modelled in the problem. Herein, the planning problem is solved applying quantum annealing (QA).									0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-8687	1751-8695		WOS:000380259200027

Photoluminescence, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry were employed to investigate the nature of interactions and possible charge transfer between 2D materials and amino acids. Graphene and GO were found to interact strongly with aromatic amino acids through pi-pi stacking, charge transfer, and H-bonding. Particularly, it was observed that both physi and chemisorption are prominent in the interactions of GO/graphene with phenylalanine and tryptophan while tyrosine exhibited strong chemisorption on graphene and GO. In contrast, BN exhibited little or no interactions, which could be attributed to localized pi-electron clouds around N atoms in BN lattice. Lastly, the adsorption of amino acids on 2D materials was observed to considerably change their biological response in terms of reactive oxygen species generation. More importantly, these changes in the biological response followed the same trends observed in the physi and chemisorption measurements.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			WOS:000379456000009	27281436

Operating without any surface functionalization or treatment, these microcantilevers utilize the strong surface polarization of AlGaN, as well as the unique heater and sensor channel geometries, to perform selective detection of analytes based on their latent heat of evaporation and molecular dipole moment over a wide concentration range with sub-ppm detection limit. The dual-channel microcantilevers have demonstrated much superior sensing behavior compared to the single-channel ones, with the capability to not only identify individual VOCs with much higher specificity, but also uniquely detect them in a generic multi-component mixture of VOCs. In addition, utilizing two different dual channel configurations and sensing modalities, we have been able to quantitatively determine individual analyte concentration in a VOC mixture. An algorithm for complete mixture analysis, with unique identification of components and accurate determination of their concentration, has been presented based on simultaneous operation of an array of these microcantilever heaters in multiple sensing modalities.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000379147600001	27381318

Genetic Variation for Agronomic and Fiber Quality Traits in a Population Derived from High-Quality Cotton Germplasm								CROP SCIENCE				56	4			1689	1697		10.2135/cropsci2015.10.0657			JUL-AUG 2016	2016	Genetic improvement of fiber quality is necessary to meet the requirements of processors and users of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fiber. To foster genetic improvement of cotton fiber quality, adequate genetic variation for the quantitatively inherited physical properties of cotton is required. Additionally, knowledge of the genetic architecture of fiber quality is needed to design effective breeding strategies to further improve fiber quality. In this study, our objective was to estimate genetic variance components and predict genetic effects for agronomic and fiber quality traits in a population derived from four known genotypic sources of high fiber quality. The majority of genetic variation present in a half-diallel population derived from these four sources of high fiber quality was due to additive effects. Predicted genetic effects demonstrated that one of the four parents, MD 15, provides a unique genetic source of high fiber quality alleles that behave additively.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0011-183X	1435-0653		WOS:000384757700025

The purpose of this research was to identify alternative POST herbicides that control TSG. Two field experiments were conducted in bermudagrass golf course fairways in south and central Florida in 2014 and 2015. Several nonorganic arsenical herbicide treatments controlled TSG. In the first experiment, treatments containing amicarbazone alone and in combination with other herbicides provided. 97% TSG control 12 wk after initial treatment (WAIT) in 2014 and 2015. These included a single application of amicarbazone at 0.49 kg ai ha(-1), or sequential applications of amicarbazone at 0.25 kg ha(-1) in combination with foramsulfuron at 0.04 kg ai ha(-1), sulfentrazone+ imazethapyr at 0.25 kg ai ha(-1), thiencarbazone + foramsulfuron + halosulfuron at 0.14 kg ai ha(-1), and thiencarbazone + iodosulfuron + dicamba at 0.18 kg ai/ae ha(-1). In the second experiment, sequential applications of thiencarbazone + foramsulfuron + halosulfuron at 0.14 kg ha(-1) in combination with either quinclorac at 0.84 kg ai ha(-1) or metribuzin at 0.28 kg ai ha(-1) provided >= 85% TSG control 12 WAIT in both years.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0890-037X	1550-2740		WOS:000384294100025

Genetic Analysis of Cottonseed Protein and Oil in a Diverse Cotton Germplasm								CROP SCIENCE				56	5			2457	2464		10.2135/cropsci2015.12.0742			SEP-OCT 2016	2016	Historically, the primary objective of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) breeding programs was to improve the quantity and quality of cotton fiber. Because of the added value of cottonseed and its many uses, including a feed and human food source, there is interest in developing cotton breeding programs that focus improvement efforts simultaneously on cotton fiber and seed. Genetic analysis of cottonseed traits, such as protein and oil, is a prerequisite to building new joint fiber and seed cotton breeding programs. In this study, we conducted a genetic analysis of a diverse set of elite upland cotton germplasm for cottonseed protein and oil. Environment was responsible for a sizeable portion of the total variation for protein and oil, and genetics accounted for a larger portion of variation for oil than protein. Genotype x environment (G x E) interactions significantly impacted oil but not protein. Genotypic correlation analysis found a strong, negative relationship between protein and oil. Positive genotypic correlations were found for protein and several agronomic traits including lint yield; whereas, negative correlations were found between oil and lint yield along with other agronomic traits. Overall, results showed very little association between protein, oil, and fiber quality traits. These findings indicate that altering protein and oil seed composition will impact yield and yield component traits. However, alterations in seed composition should not impact fiber quality.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0011-183X	1435-0653		WOS:000388509300032

J	Fine, Jeffrey A.; Williams, Margaret S.								Nuclear Fallout: The Senate's Cloture Threshold and Nomination Votes								FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS				14	2			191	203		10.1515/for-2016-0015			JUL 2016	2016	In November of 2013, Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Democratic colleagues employed a series of parliamentary steps to change the precedent for cloture with respect to presidential nominations. This so called "nuclear option" reduced the threshold for cloture on presidential nominations (except for those to the US Supreme Court) to a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes necessary in the past. The paper examines how this change affected senators' voting behavior on both cloture and confirmation of presidential nominations, using the 113th Senate as a natural experimental setting. We find that Republican senators are significantly more likely to vote against cloture in the wake of this change, presumably as symbolic votes of protest against the Democrats' reversal of longstanding precedent. On the whole, the Republican conference votes against cloture, even when they vote overwhelmingly in favor of the nominee on the final confirmation vote. This suggests that cloture may not represent a sincere objection to the nominee in the post-nuclear Senate.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-6183	1540-8884		WOS:000387531000005

Human-wildlife Conflict, Conservation Attitudes, and a Potential Role for Citizen Science in Sierra Leone, Africa								CONSERVATION & SOCIETY				14	3			205	217		10.4103/0972-4923.191159			JUL-SEP 2016	2016	Protection of tropical biodiversity is often difficult due to persistent gaps in ecological data and complex conflicts between wildlife conservation and human livelihoods. To better understand the nature and extent of these conflicts, we conducted intercept surveys (n = 522) with local villagers around the Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary in Sierra Leone (August - December, 2010). Results revealed high levels of crop depredation, retaliatory killing, and bushmeat harvesting in villages surrounding the protected area. We also found that pro-conservation attitudes were less prevalent among younger adults and immigrants to the region. Efforts to mitigate human-wildlife conflict could emphasise an enhanced awareness and appreciation of wildlife resources among these particular socio-demographic groups. In the second part of our study (May 2012), we interviewed a subset of local residents (n = 14) to explore the feasibility and utility of expanding our initial survey effort to create a more comprehensive and sustainable framework for monitoring human-wildlife interactions based on Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR) principles. Findings highlighted the challenges of implementing a PPSR-type model in this difficult management context and the potential benefits of using "citizen science" to improve data collection capacity, increase local empowerment, and influence wildlife conservation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0972-4923	0975-3133		WOS:000385931200004

Powerpack Optimal Design Methodology with Embedded Configuration Benchmarking								SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE POWERTRAINS				5	2			223	227		10.4271/2016-01-0313			JUL 2016	2016	Design of military vehicle needs to meet often conflicting requirements such as high mobility, excellent fuel efficiency and survivability, with acceptable cost. In order to reduce the development cost, time and associated risk, as many of the design questions as possible need to be addressed with advanced simulation tools. This paper describes a methodology to design a fuel efficient powerpack unit for a series hybrid electric military vehicle, with emphasis on the e-machine design. The proposed methodology builds on previously published Finite element based analysis to capture basic design features of the generator with three variables, and couples it with a model reduction technique to rapidly re-design the generator with desired fidelity. The generator is mated to an off the shelf engine to form a powerpack, which is subsequently evaluated over a representative military drive cycles. An iterative procedure is developed, in which the optimization of the supervisory controller is embedded into the design optimization framework. Therefore, for every combination of design parameters the Dynamic Programming routine develops a benchmark control for minimum fuel consumption. This ensures realistic numbers for every function call, and convergence on a true optimum. Results can then guide the development of the new generator for a selected production engine and SHEV configuration.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-4191	2167-4205		WOS:000386507800001		
J	Abdelhamid, Mahmoud; Haque, Imtiaz; Pilla, Srikanth; Filipi, Zoran S.; Singh, Rajendra								Impacts of Adding Photovoltaic Solar System On-Board to Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles Towards Meeting 2025 Fuel Economy CAFE Standards								SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE POWERTRAINS				5	2			237	248		10.4271/2016-01-1165			JUL 2016	2016	The challenge of meeting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards of 2025 has led to major developments in the transportation sector, among which is the attempt to utilize clean energy sources. To date, use of solar energy as an auxiliary source of on-board fuel has not been extensively investigated. This paper is the first study at undertaking a comprehensive analysis of using solar energy on-board by means of photovoltaic (PV) technologies to enhance automotive fuel economies, extend driving ranges, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and ensure better economic value of internal combustion engine (ICE) -based vehicles to meet CAFE standards though 2025. This paper details and compares various aspects of hybrid solar electric vehicles with conventional ICE vehicles. Different driving locations, vehicle sizes, various driving patterns and different cost scenarios are used in order to enhance the current understanding of the applicability and effectiveness of using on-board PV modules in individual automobiles and ensure an accurate representation of driving conditions in all U.S states at any time. These times and location-dependent results obtained over a year show an increase in the combined mile per gallon (MPG) at noon in the range of 2.9-9.5% for a vehicle similar to a Tesla S, and a significant increase in the range of 10.7-42.2% for lightweight and aerodynamic efficient vehicles. In addition, by adding on-board PVs to cover less than 50% of the projected horizontal surface area of a typical mid-size vehicle (e.g., Toyota Camry or Nissan Leaf), up to 50% of total daily miles traveled by an average U. S. person could be driven by solar energy. Also, the return on investment (ROI) of adding PVs on-board with ICE vehicle over its lifetime shows only negative values when the price of gasoline remains below $4.0 per gallon and the vehicle is driven in low-solar energy area (e.g., Boston, MA). The same ROI is more than 250% if the vehicle is driven in high-solar energy area (e.g., Arizona), even if the gasoline price remains low. For future price scenarios, this ROI is much higher-nearly 10 times the investment cost under some scenarios, with the assumption of an eventual decline in battery costs. With regard to environmental impacts, significant gasoline gallons savings (similar to 500-3400) and CO2 emission reduction (similar to 5.0 to 34.0 short tons) are achieved.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2167-4191	2167-4205		WOS:000386507800003

Impacts of Real-World Driving and Driver Aggressiveness on Fuel Consumption of 48V Mild Hybrid Vehicle								SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE POWERTRAINS				5	2			249	258		10.4271/2016-01-1166			JUL 2016	2016	The 48V mild hybrid technology is emerging as a very attractive option for high-volume vehicle electrification. Compared to high-voltage hybrids, the 48V system has a potential of achieving competitive fuel economy with significantly lower incremental costs. While previous studies of 48V mild hybrid systems discussed vehicle configuration, power management strategy and electric machine design, quantitative assessment of fuel economy under real-world conditions remains an open topic. Objectives of this paper are to propose a methodology for categorizing real-world cycles based on driver aggressiveness, and to subsequently analyze the impact of driving patterns on fuel saving potentials with a 48V mild hybrid system. Instead of using the certification test cycles to evaluate the fuel economy, real-world cycles are extracted from 2001-2003 Southern California Household Travel Survey. Subsequently, a consistent energy management strategy is implemented into the vehicle simulation and the real-world fuel consumption reductions are quantified for different levels of driver aggressiveness.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-4191	2167-4205		WOS:000386507800004

Electrochemistrybased battery aging model is integrated into vehicle model. The side reaction, reductive electrolyte decomposition, is modeled to determine battery aging rate, and the thermal effect on this reaction rate is considered by Arrhenius Law. The resulting capacity and power fading is included in the system-level study. Sensitivity analysis shows that battery aging could cause fuel economy loss by 5.9%, and increasing temperature could improve fuel economy at any given state-of-health, while accelerating battery aging. Stochastic dynamic programming algorithm is applied to a modeled system to handle the tradeoff between two objectives: maximizing fuel economy and minimizing battery aging. The strategy developed by the stochastic dynamic programming improves fuel economy by 8%, and reduces the lithium ion loss by 17% after 9e3 cycles.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-4191	2167-4205		WOS:000386507800010

At the top level, the driver's input such as pedal position or steering wheel position are interpreted into desired global state responses based on a reference model. Then, a locally linearized rigid body model is used to design a linear quadratic regulator that generates the desired global control efforts, i.e., the total tire forces and moments required track the desired state responses. At the lower level, an optimal control allocation algorithm coordinates the motor torques in such a manner that the forces generated at tire-road contacts produce the desired global control efforts under some physical constraints of the actuation and the tire/wheel dynamics. The performance of the proposed control system design is verified via simulation analysis of a 3-axle heavy vehicle with independent hub-motor drives.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-4191	2167-4205		WOS:000386507800013

The World Wide Web is an accessible source of information about how to prevent a norovirus infection but the accuracy and readability of information targeting consumers is unknown. The aim of the study was to evaluate the alignment and readability of web-based norovirus education materials targeting consumers using CDC evidence-based guidelines and Microsoft Word readability formulas. The search yielded 60 artifacts. Most did not address duration of handwashing (83%), use of hand sanitizers (83%), type of drying devices (92%), or avoidance of bare-hand contact with ready-to-eat foods (97%). Less than half (n = 29) recommended minimizing contact with sick persons. Two-thirds of the artifacts (n = 40) also did not mention the recommended concentration of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution to be used to disinfect surfaces contaminated with noroviruses. The mean Flesch Reading Ease score was 47.75 (score of >70 is easy to read), and the mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level was 10.36 so documents were written at a 10th grade level. The alignment and readability of web-based educational materials about noroviruses must be improved as knowledge is a prerequisite to application of behaviors that can prevent one from becoming infected with noroviruses.

Genotype x Environment Interaction and Stability Analysis for Watermelon Fruit Yield in the United States								CROP SCIENCE				56	4			1645	1661		10.2135/cropsci2015.10.0625			JUL-AUG 2016	2016	One of the major breeding objectives for watermelon (Citrullus lanatus [Thumb.] Matsum & Nakai) is improved fruit yield. High yielding genotypes have been identified, so we measured their stability for fruit yield and yield components over diverse environments. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the yield of watermelon genotypes over years and locations, (ii) identify genotypes with high stability for yield, and (iii) measure the correlations among univariate and multivariate stability statistics. A diverse set of 40 genotypes was evaluated over 3 yr (2009, 2010, and 2011) and eight locations across the southern United States in replicated trials. Yield traits were evaluated over multiple harvests, and measured as marketable yield, fruit count, percentage cull fruit, percentage early fruit, and fruit size. There were strong effects of environment as well as genotype x environment interaction (G x E) on watermelon yield traits. Based on multiple stability measures, genotypes were classified as stable or unstable for yield. There was an advantage of hybrids over inbreds for yield components in both performance and responsiveness to favorable environments. Cultivars Big Crimson and Legacy are inbred lines with high yield and stability. A significant (P < 0.001) and positive correlation was measured for Shukla's stability variance (sigma(2)(i)), Shukla's squared hat ((s) over cap (2)(i)), Wricke's ecovalence (W-i), and deviation from regression (S-d(2)) for all the traits evaluated in this study.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0011-183X	1435-0653		WOS:000384757700022		
J	Dia, Mahendra; Wehner, Todd C.; Hassell, Richard; Price, Daniel S.; Boyhan, George E.; Olson, Stephen; King, Stephen; Davis, Angela R.; Tolla, Gregory E.; Bernier, Jerome; Juarez, Benito								Value of Locations for Representing Mega-Environments and for Discriminating Yield of Watermelon in the US								CROP SCIENCE				56	4			1726	1735		10.2135/cropsci2015.11.0698			JUL-AUG 2016	2016	In a crop breeding program, multiple-location trials can be used to define target regions and mega-environments that, in turn, will help the breeder develop stable cultivars. In addition, locations can be chosen that are efficient for distinguishing among cultivars (genotypes) and that are good representatives of the target regions. The objectives of this study were to study mega-environments and identify test locations that were both discriminating and representative of target regions. Watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai] fruit yield and yield components were evaluated in 3 yr and eight locations using replicated, multipleharvest trials. Data were analyzed using genotype main effect and genotype 'environment interaction (GGE) biplot model as well as other methods for stability analysis. Marketable yield and percentage early fruit had a nonrepeatable crossover pattern and thus, formed a single and complex mega-environment. Two key locations, (Kinston, NC, and Charleston, SC) were efficient representatives of two mega-environments for fruit count. Locations at Woodland, CA, and College Station, TX, can be used interchangeably for identifying genotypes with high percentage cull fruit. There was only one mega-environment for fruit size. Identification of mega-environments for watermelon in the southern United States has implications for future breeding and genotype evaluation in the United States including the use of specialized genotypes for high performance in specific locations.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0011-183X	1435-0653		WOS:000384757700029

Mandibular condyle cartilage (MCC) has a unique structure among articular cartilages; however, little is known about its nanoscale collagen network architecture, hampering design of regeneration therapies and rigorous evaluation of regeneration experiment outcomes in preclinical research. Helium ion microscopy is a novel technology with a long depth of field that is uniquely suited to imaging open 3D collagen networks at multiple scales without obscuring conductive coatings. Objective. The objective of this research was to image, at the micro-and nanoscales, the depth-dependent MCC collagen network architecture. Design. MCC was collected from New Zealand white rabbits. Images of MCC zones were acquired using helium ion, transmission electron, and light microscopy. Network fibril and canal diameters were measured. Results. For the first time, the MCC was visualized as a 3D collagen fibril structure at the nanoscale, the length scale of network assembly. Fibril diameters ranged from 7 to 110 nm and varied by zone. The articular surface was composed of a fine mesh that was woven through thin layers of larger fibrils. The fibrous zone was composed of approximately orthogonal lamellae of aligned fibrils. Fibrocyte processes surrounded collagen bundles forming extracellular compartments. The proliferative, mature, and hypertrophic zones were composed of a branched network that was progressively remodeled to accommodate chondrocyte hypertrophy. Osteoid fibrils were woven around osteoblast cytoplasmic processes to create numerous canals similar in size to canaliculi of mature bone. Conclusion. This multiscale investigation advances our foundational understanding of the complex, layered 3D architecture of the MCC collagen network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1947-6035	1947-6043		WOS:000384334800008

On Precision Bound of Distributed Fault-Tolerant Sensor Fusion Algorithms								ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS				49	1					5	10.1145/2898984			JUL 2016	2016	Sensors have limited precision and accuracy. They extract data from the physical environment, which contains noise. The goal of sensor fusion is to make the final decision robust, minimizing the influence of noise and system errors. One problem that has not been adequately addressed is establishing the bounds of fusion result precision. Precision is the maximum range of disagreement that can be introduced by one or more faulty inputs. This definition of precision is consistent both with Lamport's Byzantine Generals problem and the mini-max criteria commonly found in game theory. This article considers the precision bounds of several fault-tolerant information fusion approaches, including Byzantine agreement, Marzullo's interval-based approach, and the Brooks-Iyengar fusion algorithm. We derive precision bounds for these fusion algorithms. The analysis provides insight into the limits imposed by fault tolerance and guidance for applying fusion approaches to applications.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0360-0300	1557-7341		WOS:000382136100005

Testing Hypotheses in Nonparametric Models ofProduction								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & ECONOMIC STATISTICS				34	3			435	456		10.1080/07350015.2015.1049747			JUL 2016	2016	Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and free disposal hull (FDH) estimators are widely used to estimate efficiency of production. Practitioners use DEA estimators far more frequently than FDH estimators, implicitly assuming that production sets are convex. Moreover, use of the constant returns to scale (CRS) version of the DEA estimator requires an assumption of CRS. Although bootstrap methods have been developed for making inference about the efficiencies of individual units, until now no methods exist for making consistent inference about differences in mean efficiency across groups of producers or for testing hypotheses about model structure such as returns to scale or convexity of the production set. We use central limit theorem results from our previous work to develop additional theoretical results permitting consistent tests of model structure and provide Monte Carlo evidence on the performance of the tests in terms of size and power. In addition, the variable returns to scale version of the DEA estimator is proved to attain the faster convergence rate of the CRS-DEA estimator under CRS. Using a sample of U.S. commercial banks, we test and reject convexity of the production set, calling into question results from numerous banking studies that have imposed convexity assumptions.

J	Ebrahimi, Elham; Babu, Sabarish V.; Pagano, Christopher C.; Jorg, Sophie								An Empirical Evaluation of Visuo-Haptic Feedback on Physical Reaching Behaviors During 3D Interaction in Real and Immersive Virtual Environments								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED PERCEPTION				13	4	SI				19	10.1145/2947617			JUL 2016	2016	In an initial study, we characterized the properties of human reach motion in the presence or absence of visuo-haptic feedback in real and Immersive Virtual Environments (IVEs) or virtual reality within a participant's maximum arm reach. Our goal is to understand how physical reaching actions to the perceived location of targets in the presence or absence of visuo-haptic feedback are different between real and virtual viewing conditions. Typically, participants reach to the perceived location of objects in the three-dimensional (3D) environment to perform selection and manipulation actions during 3D interaction in applications such as virtual assembly or rehabilitation. In these tasks, participants typically have distorted perceptual information in the IVE as compared to the real world, in part due to technological limitations such as minimal visual field of view, resolution, latency, and jitter. In an empirical evaluation, we asked the following questions: (i) how do the perceptual differences between virtual and real world affect our ability to accurately reach to the locations of 3D objects, and (ii) how do the motor responses of participants differ between the presence or absence of visual and haptic feedback? We examined factors such as velocity and distance of physical reaching behavior between the real world and IVE, both in the presence or absence of visuo-haptic information. The results suggest that physical reach responses vary systematically between real and virtual environments, especially in situations involving the presence or absence of visuo-haptic feedback. The implications of our study provide a methodological framework for the analysis of reaching motions for selection and manipulation with novel 3D interaction metaphors and to successfully characterize visuo-haptic versus non-visuo-haptic physical reaches in virtual and real-world situations.					13th ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Applied Perception (SAP)13th ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Applied Perception (SAP)	JUL, 2016JUL, 2016	ACM SIGGRAPHACM SIGGRAPH	Anaheim, CAAnaheim, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1544-3558	1544-3965		WOS:000382876600002

Other than 3FGL J1656.2-3303, none of the sources were known as gamma-ray emitters, and our analysis of similar to 7.5 yr of LAT data reveals the first time detection of statistically significant gamma-ray emission from CGRaBS J0225+1846. We generate the broadband spectral energy distributions (SED) of all the objects, centering at the epoch of NuSTAR observations and reproduce them using a one-zone leptonic emission model. The optical-UV emission in all the objects can be explained by radiation from the accretion disk, whereas the X-ray to gamma-ray windows of the SEDs are found to be dominated by inverse Compton scattering off the broad line region photons. All of them host black holes that are billions of solar masses. Comparing the accretion disk luminosity and the jet power of these sources with a large sample of blazars, we find them to occupy a high disk luminosity-jet power regime. We also investigate the X-ray spectral properties of the sources in detail with a major focus on studying the causes of soft X-ray deficit, a feature generally seen in high redshift radio-loud quasars. We summarize that this feature could be explained based on the intrinsic curvature in the jet emission rather than being due to the external effects predicted in earlier studies, such as host galaxy and/or warm absorption.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000381930000074

We examined the performance of eight such indices, including statistical significance tests, ad hoc practical tests proposed by the courts, and effect size measures. The power of these indices was examined under various levels of adverse impact, applicant pool sizes, and selection ratios. Although no index performed well in all circumstances, typically, Fisher's exact test and the Z test for proportions (with correction for continuity) performed adequately most often. However, in some conditions, these indices were outperformed by some of the practical tests.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0895-9285	1532-7043		WOS:000382246800001

Pressure transients to characterize cavities dissolved for natural gas storage								JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				33				611	623		10.1016/j.jngse.2016.03.082			JUL 2016	2016	This paper describes an analysis of pressure transients in conduits that includes effects of variable conduit diameter and contrasts in fluid material properties. The analysis considers pressure applied to the outside of a submerged conduit, as well as that transmitted along the submerged conduit's interior with potential applications such as analysis of submerged pipelines or tubing in oil wells or in wells used in solution mining.In this work, we present a method for monitoring the dissolution of carbonate rock with acid to create a cavern for storing natural gas. This process includes an acid injection pipe and a brine production pipe submerged in the fluid-filled cavern. The motivation is to characterize the geometry of the cavern by analyzing pressure transients traveling down the acid injection pipe, interacting with the walls of the cavern and compressing the brine pipe, and traveling to a pressure transducer in the brine pipe. The conventional water-hammer equations were modified to include the pressure applied to the outside of a submerged conduit, and the resulting boundary value problems were solved with perturbation analysis. The results show that peak pressure at an observation point decreases more than one order of magnitude when the cavern diameter increases one order of magnitude. This suggests that the proposed approach is sensitive to cavern diameter. Consideration of the external loading provides a potential mechanism for locating an interface between fluids of different properties, such as the interface between acid/CO2 mixture and underlying brine.

Elastic membranes in confinement								JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE				13	120					20160408	10.1098/rsif.2016.0408			JUL 2016	2016	An elastic membrane stretched between two walls takes a shape defined by its length and the volume of fluid it encloses. Many biological structures, such as cells, mitochondria and coiled DNA, have fine internal structure in which a membrane (or elastic member) is geometrically 'confined' by another object. Here, the two-dimensional shape of an elastic membrane in a 'confining' box is studied by introducing a repulsive confinement pressure that prevents the membrane from intersecting the wall. The stage is set by contrasting confined and unconfined solutions. Continuation methods are then used to compute response diagrams, from which we identify the particular membrane mechanics that generate mitochondria-like shapes. Large confinement pressures yield complex response diagrams with secondary bifurcations and multiple turning points where modal identities may change. Regions in parameter space where such behaviour occurs are then mapped.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-5689	1742-5662		WOS:000382353200006

This paper presents an analysis of different state-of-the-art techniques for reducing the power of off-chip memory bus interface, with proposing an approach overcoming some limitations existing in the state-of-art methods. More precisely, the paper introduces a serialization (S) method combined with cache-based encoding scheme, aiming at saving the optimal possible power for off-chip memory bus. Bus serialization reduces the number of transmission wires, while a Serialization-Widening (SW) approach reduces the bus capacitance and the number of transmission wires. Experimental results show that, for off-chip data bus, the serialization approach with cache-based encoding achieves 31% and 52% power reduction for single-core and multi-core applications, respectively, when using fixed voltage and frequency with 128 bits data bus.

Harvesting energy from the sloshing motion of ferrofluids in an externally excited container: Analytical modeling and experimental validation								PHYSICS OF FLUIDS				28	7					077101	10.1063/1.4954787			JUL 2016	2016	When a container carrying a magnetized ferrofluid is subjected to external mechanical stimuli, the sloshing motion of the magnetized ferrofluid generates a time-varying magnetic flux, which can be used to induce an electromotive force in a coil placed adjacent to the container. This process generates an electric current in the coil, and therewith, can be used to transduce external vibrations into electric energy. In this article, we develop a nonlinear analytical model, which governs the electro-magneto-hydrodynamics of an electromagnetic ferrofluid-based vibratory energy harvester. Using perturbation methods, we obtain an approximate analytical solution of the model for a case involving primary resonance excitation of the first mode and a two-to-one internal resonance between the first two modes. This occurs when the external excitation is harmonic with a frequency close to the fundamental sloshing frequency and when the second modal frequency is nearly twice the first modal frequency. Theoretical results are compared to experimental findings illustrating very good qualitative agreement. Published by AIP Publishing.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1070-6631	1089-7666		WOS:000382446200039

However, this important issue has not been examined so far. Methods: Data came from the first health service household interview of Hunan province, China, in 2013. A Rao-Scott chi-square test was performed to examine the difference in prevalence rates between subgroups. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) was calculated using the PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure of SAS9.1 statistical software. Results: In total, 24,282 residents of 8400 households were surveyed. A higher proportion of elderly adults had undergone a medical examination within the prior 12 months compared with young adults (>= 65 years, 60%; 45-64 years, 46%; 18-44 years, 37%). After controlling for location, sex, and household income per capita, undergoing a medical examination was significantly associated with high prevalence rates of hypertension (adjusted OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.5) and of diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.7-6.5) for young adults aged 18-44 years. The associations were not statistically significant for age groups 45-64 years and 65 years or older. Conclusion: The prevalence rates of hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be seriously underestimated for young adults not undergoing a routine medical examination in a health household interview survey.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1660-4601			WOS:000380759800004

The first U.S. records of this smiliine membracid of the tribe Micrutalini are reported from Arizona (Cochise County) and New Mexico (Grant County) in natural populations and ornamental plantings of Thurber's desert honeysuckle (Anisacanthus thurberi [Torr.] A. Gray; Acanthaceae). A diagnosis and color photographs of the lectotype female and an adult male and female from the current study are included to facilitate recognition of M. pallens in the Nearctic fauna. The adult male is described for the first time and the adult female is redescribed. The aedeagus of M. pallens is illustrated and compared with the aedeagi of M. calva (Say), M. dorsalis (Fitch), and M. malleifera Fowler.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000380834800003

In Florida scrubs and other xeric plant communities in the southeastern United States, N. bilobata was found frequently, but irregularly, on female plants of Florida rosemary, Ceratiola ericoides (Ericaceae), from 2007 to 2016. This dioecious shrub flowers mainly in autumn and produces fleshy fruits and smaller, dry fruits that have been attributed to lack of pollination. Nymphs and adults of N. bilobata were collected from rosemary (31 sites) in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina. All nymphal instars were observed from mid-October to late April, suggesting that nymphs develop on the plant. The bug's seasonality on rosemary in the coastal plain of Georgia and peninsular scrubs of Florida varied from year to year and between nearby sites sampled the same day. A second rhyparochromid, the little-known ozophorine Ozophora trinotata Barber, was found at 13 sites in peninsular Florida and was syntopic with N. bilobata at 10 sites. Regardless of the presence of N. bilobata, nymphs (all instars) and adults of O. trinotata were found mainly on rosemary plants growing in the shade of oaks; in contrast, N. bilobata was found on plants in full sun. In the laboratory, nymphs of N. bilobata, when provided with both fruit types, fed mainly on fleshy fruits, whereas nymphs of O. trinotata fed mainly on dry fruits.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000380834800011

Previously thought to develop only on black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), both membracids were found to use granite dome locust (R. hartwigii) as a host; nymphs of V. arquata also developed on bristly locust (R. hispida). Neither membracid became entrapped on the sticky stems of R. hartwigii, but only adults, trapped in glandular exudate, were observed on clammy locust (R. viscosa), whose more viscid stems apparently are unsuitable for treehopper colonization. Both treehoppers typically were positioned on black locust as described in the literature, but nymphs, particularly those of T. bimaculata, also were observed to occupy old (abandoned) burrows (tunnels) of the locust twig borer (Ecdytolopha insiticiana Zeller; Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Ants (Crematogaster lineolata [ Say], Formica subsericea Say, and other species) tended membracid nymphs inside excavated stems and also were found around exit holes of locust twig borer larvae. The southern Appalachians represent the center of diversity for Robinia, but nearly all previous field studies of the treehoppers were conducted outside the original range of black locust and probably also that of the tortricid twig borer. The membracids' behavior and host range might be expected to differ between the southern Appalachians, where the ant-treehopper system on locust presumably has a long evolutionary history, and regions where members of the system are not native.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000380834800012

Investigations in subsurface damage when machining -strengthened nickel-based superalloy								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE				230	7			1221	1233		10.1177/0954405415577055			JUL 2016	2016	-strengthened nickel-based superalloys are developed for high-performance systems such as jet engines, internal combustion engines, and gas turbines. Their excellent properties are given by specifically designed microstructure. Unfortunately, the structure is deformed during machining. Too much deformation generated results in components with low mechanical integrity and reduced in-service life. Experimental investigations indicated that the machining affected zone or subsurface damage formation for nickel-based superalloys is an atypical phenomenon; its dependence on the process parameters is fundamentally different from the conventional materials. This research investigates subsurface damage formation in orthogonal cutting tests performed on nickel-based superalloys, followed by empirical and numerical modeling. The simulations are used to estimate the depth of the subsurface damage and are compared with the experimental results. The knowledge can then be applied to select optimum cutting parameters for an acceptable depth of subsurface damage.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4054	2041-2975		WOS:000380962000005

Samples were analyzed for cell proliferation, percent apoptosis, cellular hypertrophy, and expression levels of smooth muscle contractile state-associated markers with 0.05 level of significance.Results: Concomitant application of cyclic strain and flow shear resulted in an overall increase in proliferation of VSMCs under both acute and chronic high glucose conditions as compared with normal glucose control ( P < 0.0001). Application of both cyclic strain and cyclic strain shear resulted in a significant increase in percent apoptosis with chronic high glucose treatment in comparison with both normal glucose controls ( P < 0.0001) and acute high glucose ( P < 0.0001). Cellular hypertrophy as estimated by measuring cell area and aspect ratio revealed a significantly altered morphology due to concomitant loading under chronic high glucose conditions with significantly higher cell area ( P < 0.0001) and lower aspect ratio ( P < 0.0001) indicative of a relatively rounded morphology as compared with normal glucose controls. Western blot analysis demonstrated reduced expression of SM alpha-actin ( P < 0.0001), calponin ( P < 0.0001), and SM22 alpha ( P = 0.0008) for concomitant loading under chronic high glucose treatment as compared with normal glucose controls.Conclusions: Concomitant application of cyclic strain and low wall shear stress resulted in greater phenotypic modulation of VSMCs due to chronic high glucose treatment as compared with normal glucose controls, thus implicating cellular-response differences which may impact progression of in-stent restenosis in diabetic patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia. Similarity of VSMC response from our study to existing preclinical models of diabetes and reports of altered phenotype of VSMCs isolated from diabetic patients substantiate the relevance of our dynamic disease test model.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0890-5096	1615-5947		WOS:000381685700023	27126714

Effects of Panax ginseng, zearalenol, and estradiol on sperm function								JOURNAL OF GINSENG RESEARCH				40	3			251	259		10.1016/j.jgr.2015.08.004			JUL 2016	2016	Background: Estrogen signaling pathways are modulated by exogenous factors. Panax ginseng exerts multiple activities in biological systems and is classified as an adaptogen. Zearalenol is a potent mycoestrogen that may be present in herbs and crops arising from contamination or endophytic association. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of P. ginseng, zearalenol and estradiol in tests on spermatozoal function.Methods: The affinity of these compounds for estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and beta (ER alpha and ER beta)- was assessed in receptor binding assays. Functional tests on boar spermatozoa motility, movement and kinematic parameters were conducted using a computer-assisted sperm analyzer. Tests for capacitation, acrosome reaction (AR), and chromatin decondensation in spermatozoa were performed using microscopic analysis.Results: Zearalenoldbut not estradiol (E-2)- or ginseng-treated spermatozoa-decreased the percentage of overall, progressive, and rapid motile cells. Zearalenol also decreased spontaneous AR and increased chromatin decondensation. Ginseng decreased chromatin decondensation in response to calcium ionophore and decreased AR in response to progesterone (P-4) and ionophore.Conclusion: Zearalenol has adverse effects on sperm motility and function by targeting multiple signaling cascades, including P4, E2, and calcium pathways. Ginseng protects against chromatin damage and thus may be beneficial to reproductive fitness.

The objective of the work reported here was a proof of concept of using a modified inkjet printer to have a more accessible and miniature cellomic anticancer drug-screening platform. The authors' previous findings have shown that inkjet-based screening can reliably create isolated arrays of spots of living cells and antibiotics at low volume (180 pl) and high throughput (213 spots/sec) [J. I. Rodriguez-Devora, B. Zhang, D. Reyna, Z D. Shi, and T. Xu, "High throughput miniature drug-screening platform using bioprinting technology" Biofabrication 4, 035001 (2012)]. The methodology of the work reported here included using a modified office inkjet printing device; the authors studied the inhibitory effects of dichloroacetate sodium (DCA) over hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and epithelial cells (EpC). A DCA drug concentration gradient was printed over cell cultures to evaluate the drug's cytotoxic effect. Half maximal and ninety percent inhibitory concentrations (IC50, IC90) were obtained from the dose response curves and compared with concentrations obtained using the traditional micropipetting technique. The resulting inhibitory concentration values obtained by both dispensing techniques fall within the millimolar range. The significance of these finding is that the proposed screening platform closely mimics the traditional screening outcome at a miniaturized volume rate, thus downsizing the screening process from traditional sub-microliter to nano-or even picoliter range. Inkjet technology shows promise in miniaturizing and expediting the drug-screening process. This platform can be used to asses a preliminary dose-response curve in order to improve the treatment modalities using the patient's limited supply of biopsied cells toward personalized medicine.

In this study, the IgE-binding activity and allergenicity of cross-linked thermal polymerized arginine kinase (CL-pAK) were investigated.Methods and resultsThe IgE-binding activity and stability of CL-pAK were analyzed by immunological and proteomics methods. The sensitization and potency to induce oral tolerance of CL-pAK were tested using in vivo assays and a cell model. According to the results of inhibition of ELISA, the half inhibitory concentration of AK after cross-linking changed from 1.13 to 228.36 g/mL. The results of in vitro digestion demonstrated that CL-pAK showed more resistance to gastrointestinal digestion than native AK. Low allergenicity and capacity to induce oral tolerance in mice were shown by the sera levels of AK-specific antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. Exposure of RBL-2H3 cells to CL-pAK compared with AK, resulted in lower levels of mast degranulation and histamine.ConclusionEnzymatic cross-linking with thermal polymerization of AK by tyrosinase and caffeic acid had high potential in mitigating IgE-binding activity and allergenicity, which were influenced by altering the molecular and immunological features of the shellfish protein.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1613-4125	1613-4133		WOS:000380331700017	26935337

Lower Sodium Intake and Risk of Headaches: Results From the Trial of Nonpharmacologic Interventions in the Elderly								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH				106	7			1270	1275		10.2105/AJPH.2016.303143			JUL 2016	2016	Objectives. To determine the effect of sodium (Na) reduction on occurrence of headaches.Methods. In the Trial of Nonpharmacologic Interventions in the Elderly, 975 men and woman (aged 60-80 years) with hypertension were randomized to a Na-reduction intervention or control group and were followed for up to 36 months. The study was conducted between 1992 and 1995 at 4 clinical centers (Johns Hopkins University, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and the University of Tennessee).Results. Mean difference in Na excretion between the Na-reduction intervention and control group was significant at each follow-up visit (P < .001) with an average difference of 38.8 millimoles per 24 hours. The occurrence of headaches was significantly lower in the Na-reduction intervention group (10.5%) compared with control (14.3%) with a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% confidence interval = 0.40, 0.88; P = .009). The risk of headaches was significantly associated with average level of Na excretion during follow-up, independent of most recent blood pressure. The relationship appeared to be nonlinear with a spline relationship and a knot at 150 millimoles per 24 hours.Conclusions. Reduced sodium intake, currently recommended for blood pressure control, may also reduce the occurrence of headaches in older persons with hypertension.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-0036	1541-0048		WOS:000377939700050	27077348

Based on characteristics associated with invasiveness in plants, it was hypothesized that introduced species that produce large amounts of litter with distinctive secondary compounds can a) alter the chemistry of both extractable and bulk carbon in the soil, b) shift microbial communities towards microbes better able to metabolize the compounds in the litter and c) cause soil carbon chemistry and microbial communities to shift to relatively uniform, novel states at multiple sites. Composition of phenolics in senescent tissues (leaves and roots) of Polygonum cuspidatum was compared to the composition of extractable phenolics and non-extractable bulk organic carbon in soils under and adjacent to large, long-established stands of P.cuspidatum at four sites in the eastern U.S. Rates of degradation of phenolics, activities of enzymes associated with the breakdown of phenolics and shifts in microbial community composition were also measured at the sites. Soils under P.cuspidatum stands contained twice as much phenolics as adjacent soils, but the composition of phenolics differed greatly between soils under stands and senescent tissues of P.cuspidatum. Flavonoids and proanthocyanidins constituted >90% of the identified phenolics in P.cuspidatum tissues, whereas monophenolic compounds accounted for >90% of the phenolics in soils under stands. Soils under and adjacent to stands also exhibited distinctive compositions of relatively persistent bulk organic carbon; composition differed less between soils under stands at different sites than between soils under and adjacent to stands at the same site. Soils under P.cuspidatum had 28 times greater abundance of fungi than soils adjacent to stands, and fungal markers showed clear separation of soils under and adjacent to P.cuspidatum. However, the potential activity of enzymes that degrade polyphenols was lower in soils under stands. Exogenously applied, chemically complex polyphenols persisted in both P.cuspidatum-invaded and adjacent non-invaded soils, whereas less complex compounds rapidly disappeared from both soils.Synthesis. Results suggest that interactions between plant inputs, abiotic reactions and biotic transformations may create and maintain new states in invaded soils that are chemically and biologically less diverse. In the case of polyphenol-rich, fast-growing invasive species, these interactions may alter the composition of bulk soil organic matter that has relatively slower turnover rates, resulting in legacy effects. Restoration could thus require, not just removal of the species, but also post-removal interventions such as soil amendments.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000379978100022

Often this process is stunted by high testing costs associated with evaluating new biomarkers. Traditionally, biomarker assessments are individually tested within a target population. Pooling has been proposed to help alleviate the testing costs, where pools are formed by combining several individual specimens. Methods for using pooled biomarker assessments to estimate discriminatory ability have been developed. However, all these procedures have failed to acknowledge confounding factors. In this paper, we propose a regression methodology based on pooled biomarker measurements that allow the assessment of the discriminatory ability of a biomarker of interest. In particular, we develop covariate-adjusted estimators of the receiver-operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve, and Youden's index. We establish the asymptotic properties of these estimators and develop inferential techniques that allow one to assess whether a biomarker is a good discriminator between cases and controls, while controlling for confounders. The finite sample performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated through simulation. We apply our methods to analyze myocardial infarction (MI) data, with the goal of determining whether the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 is a good predictor of MI after controlling for the subjects' cholesterol levels.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0323-3847	1521-4036		WOS:000379929300013	26927583

This can be a problem when attempting to analyse results within the framework of the general linear model, which relies on assumptions that residuals in the data are normally distributed. One frequently used method for handling violations of this assumption is to transform variables to bring residuals into closer alignment with assumptions (as residuals are not directly manipulated). This is often attempted through ad hoc traditional transformations such as square root, log and inverse. However, Box and Cox (Box & Cox, ) observed that these are all special cases of power transformations and proposed a more flexible method of transformation for researchers to optimise alignment with assumptions. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the benefits of the infinitely flexible Box-Cox transformation on neuroendocrine data using syntax in spss. When applied to positively skewed data typical of neuroendocrine data, the majority (similar to 2/3) of cases were brought into strict alignment with Gaussian distribution (i.e. a non-significant Shapiro-Wilks test). Those unable to meet this challenge showed substantial improvement in distributional properties. The biggest challenge was distributions with a high ratio of kurtosis to skewness. We discuss how these cases might be handled, and we highlight some of the broader issues associated with transformation.

Detection of damage precursors with embedded magnetostrictive particles								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES				27	12			1567	1576		10.1177/1045389X15596628			JUL 2016	2016	Polymer composites subjected to cyclic loading would exhibit damage precursors, such as crazes and microcracks, during the first few load cycles. However, damage precursors are not readily detectable with existing sensing techniques, and as such current service life prediction methods depend on macroscopic damage measures. For critical airframe structures, information on macroscopic damage does not provide adequate warning time for corrective actions. This article explores the feasibility of embedding particulate magnetostrictive particles for sensing damage precursors during the early stage of fatigue damage. The sensing is based on the notion that magnetostrictive particles undergo irreversible changes in magnetization intensity when subjected to cyclic loading, and that this change can be captured with an induction coil sensor. In the sequel, Terfenol-D particles are embedded between layers of pre-preg AS4/3501-6 material system. The specimen is then subjected to fatigue loading while monitoring the change in the strength of the magnetic flux density using pickup coil. Results show that the embedded system exhibits a change in magnetic state, in tens to hundreds of millivolts of pickup coil, starting from the first few load cycles. Scanning electron microscopy and acoustic emission data were used to validate the observed results.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1045-389X	1530-8138		WOS:000379962600001

In this review, we examined the extent and nature of replication of intervention research in special education using an article progeny approach and a three-pronged definition of replication (direct, conceptual, intervention overlap). In this approach, original articles (i.e., parent studies) were selected via a stratified, random sampling procedure. Next, we examined all articles that referenced the parent articles (i.e., child studies) to determine the extent and nature of the replication of the original studies. Seventy-five percent of the parent studies were replicated by at least one child study. Across all parent studies, there were 39 replication child studies. Although there was a high overall replication rate, there were a limited number of conceptual replications, and no direct replication studies were identified.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0741-9325	1538-4756		WOS:000380097900005

The 60-year history of V2VI3 thermoelectric materials is a prime example of how a class of semiconductor material, considered mature several times, can be rejuvenated by better understanding and manipulation of defects. This review aims to provide a systematic account of the underexplored intrinsic point defects in V2VI3 compounds, with regard to (i) their formation and control, and (ii) their interplay with other types of defects towards higher thermoelectric performance. We herein present a convincing case that intrinsic point defects can be actively controlled by extrinsic doping and also via compositional, mechanical, and thermal control at various stages of material synthesis. An up-to-date understanding of intrinsic point defects in V2VI3 compounds is summarized in a (, r)-model and applied to elucidating the donor-like effect. These new insights not only enable more innovative defect engineering in other thermoelectric materials but also, in a broad context, contribute to rational defect design in advanced functional materials at large.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2198-3844			WOS:000379935500006	27818905

Characterizing relationship between optical microangiography signals and capillary flow using microfluidic channels								BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS				7	7			2709	2728		10.1364/BOE.7.002709			JUL 1 2016	2016	Optical microangiography (OMAG) is a powerful optical angiographic tool to visualize micro-vascular flow in vivo. Despite numerous demonstrations for the past several years of the qualitative relationship between OMAG and flow, no convincing quantitative relationship has been proven. In this paper, we attempt to quantitatively correlate the OMAG signal with flow. Specifically, we develop a simplified analytical model of the complex OMAG, suggesting that the OMAG signal is a product of the number of particles in an imaging voxel and the decorrelation of OCT (optical coherence tomography) signal, determined by flow velocity, interframe time interval, and wavelength of the light source. Numerical simulation with the proposed model reveals that if the OCT amplitudes are correlated, the OMAG signal is related to a total number of particles across the imaging voxel cross-section per unit time (flux); otherwise it would be saturated but its strength is proportional to the number of particles in the imaging voxel (concentration). The relationship is validated using microfluidic flow phantoms with various preset flow metrics. This work suggests OMAG is a promising quantitative tool for the assessment of vascular flow.

J	Barrett, Kyle; Guyer, Craig; Samoray, Stephen T.; Kanno, Yoichiro								Stream and Riparian Habitat Use by Anurans along a Forested Gradient in Western Georgia, USA								COPEIA				104	2			570	576		10.1643/CE-15-318			JUL 2016	2016	Urban development is known to alter the structure, chemistry, and biota associated with stream systems; however, little is known about the dynamics of anurans that breed in and around streams. We used automated devices to record breeding anurans for one year across a forested gradient in an effort to identify species-specific sensitivities to urbanization. Six of 13 total species found during the study were present in surveyed streams that were representative of a gradient ranging from heavily urbanized to largely forested, and maximum species richness occurred in watersheds with rapid urban development but low values of impervious surfaces such as pavement and roof tops. The best landscape-scale predictor of assemblage metrics such as species richness, total species activity, and species diversity was generally percent forest cover at the watershed scale (or in very large buffers around the sample point). We used Bayesian inference to estimate detection probability and occupancy for 11 species. While detection probability varied across sampling occasions, there was no evidence that occupancy was a function of forest loss for any species. Urban streams and riparian areas are often severely altered when compared to similar habitats in forested areas. Anuran richness and diversity from urban areas was not altered to the same extent as caudates, which have been sampled from these same streams in previous studies. Increased vagility of anurans, coupled with different breeding strategies, may help to explain this discrepancy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0045-8511	1938-5110		WOS:000379626200021

J	Thwala, Melusi; Klaine, Stephen J.; Musee, Ndeke								Interactions of metal-based engineered nanoparticles with aquatic higher plants: A review of the state of current knowledge								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				35	7			1677	1694		10.1002/etc.3364			JUL 2016	2016	The rising potential for the release of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) into aquatic environments requires evaluation of risks to protect ecological health. The present review examines knowledge pertaining to the interactions of metal-based ENPs with aquatic higher plants, identifies information gaps, and raises considerations for future research to advance knowledge on the subject. The discussion focuses on ENPs' bioaccessibility; uptake, adsorption, translocation, and bioaccumulation; and toxicity effects on aquatic higher plants. An information deficit surrounds the uptake of ENPs and associated dynamics, because the influence of ENP characteristics and water quality conditions has not been well documented. Dissolution appears to be a key mechanism driving bioaccumulation of ENPs, whereas nanoparticulates often adsorb to plant surfaces with minimal internalization. However, few reports document the internalization of ENPs by plants; thus, the role of nanoparticulates' internalization in bioaccumulation and toxicity remains unclear, requiring further investigation. The toxicities of metal-based ENPs mainly have been associated with dissolution as a predominant mechanism, although nano toxicity has also been reported. To advance knowledge in this domain, future investigations need to integrate the influence of ENP characteristics and water physicochemical parameters, as their interplay determines ENP bioaccessibility and influences their risk to health of aquatic higher plants. Furthermore, harmonization of test protocols is recommended for fast tracking the generation of comparable data. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:1677-1694.

This has generated a debate on why tighter alignment may or may not lead to higher levels of firm performance. To further understand the alignment-performance relationship, we used meta-analytic structural equation modeling techniques to probe the inter-relationships found in 78 independent data sets drawn from the literature. We find intellectual alignment influences operational alignment, identify a more nuanced understanding of the performance constructs, and offer insight into how governance structure and social alignment influence intellectual and operational alignment.

Organisms, however, do not experience climate at such large scales. The climate heterogeneity over a landscape and how much of that landscape an organism can sample will determine ultimately the microclimates experienced by organisms. This past few decades has seen an important increase in the number of studies reporting microclimatic patterns at small scales. This synthesis intends to unify studies reporting microclimatic heterogeneity (mostly temperature) at various spatial scales, to infer any emerging trends, and to discuss the causes and consequences of such heterogeneity for organismal performance and with respect to changing land use patterns and climate. First, we identify the environmental drivers of heterogeneity across the various spatial scales that are pertinent to ectotherms. The thermal heterogeneity at the local and micro-scales is mostly generated by the architecture or the geometrical features of the microhabitat. Then, the thermal heterogeneity experienced by individuals is modulated by behavior. Second, we survey the literature to quantify thermal heterogeneity from the micro-scale up to the scale of a landscape in natural habitats. Despite difficulties in compiling studies that differ much in their design and aims, we found that there is as much thermal heterogeneity across micro-, local and landscape scales, and that the temperature range is large in general (>9 degrees C on average, and up to 26 degrees C). Third, we examine the extent to which urban habitats can be used to infer the microclimatic patterns of the future. Urban areas generate globally drier and warmer microclimatic patterns and recent evidence suggest that thermal traits of ectotherms are adapted to them. Fourth, we explore the interplay between microclimate heterogeneity and the behavioral thermoregulatory abilities of ectotherms in setting their overall performance. We used a random walk framework to show that the thermal heterogeneity allows a more precise behavioral thermoregulation and a narrower temperature distribution of the ectotherm compared to less heterogeneous microhabitats. Finally, we discuss the potential impacts of global change on the fine scale mosaics of microclimates. The amplitude of change may differ between spatial scales. In heterogeneous microhabitats, the amplitude of change at micro-scale, caused by atmospheric warming, can be substantial while it can be limited at the local and landscape scales. We suggest that the warming signal will influence species performance and biotic interactions by modulating the mosaic of microclimates.

Investigating wildlife and grazing perspectives of Kenyan university students								JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION				32				44	52		10.1016/j.jnc.2016.04.003			JUL 2016	2016	Recent conservation efforts recognize that human needs cannot be ignored. One way to understand the social components of resource management is to evaluate stakeholder perspectives. Stakeholder perspectives are an important component of developing effective natural resource management plans, specifically in the developing world. However, most stakeholder research in Africa focuses on local communities in locales adjacent to protected areas. This research expands the stakeholder population by looking at university students' perspectives regarding the Maasai Mara region of Kenya in relation to two complex and high profile issues: wildlife and grazing. Increased understanding of these topics in a diverse and urbanizing nation like Kenya can lead to better outcomes for conservation efforts. Using Photovoice, a qualitative research method, participants shared their perspective and built upon others' ideas about wildlife and grazing. Results suggest that there was a wide array of perspective regarding wildlife and grazing. Economics played a large part in both wildlife and grazing perspectives. However, there was also concern for the aesthetic and cultural value of wildlife and grazing in Kenya, which is contrary to some previous findings. Due to the varying perspective and multiple stakeholder groups, research should continue to explore the social aspects of natural resource management regarding wildlife and grazing in the Maasai Mara region of Kenya.

A group of neurotypical control participants and ten participants with ASD completed 18 interactive steering and pedal exercises with the goal to achieve error-free performance. Most participants were able to achieve this goal within five trials for all exercises except for the two most difficult ones. Minimal performance differences were observed between the two groups. Participants with ASD needed more time to complete the tasks. Overall, the interactive exercises and the process used worked well to address motor related aspects of pre-driving skills in young adults with ASD.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0162-3257	1573-3432		WOS:000379547700013	27055416

Despite the progress, the unspecific, underdeveloped phenotype of hiPSC-CMs has shown arrhythmogenic risk and limited functional improvements after transplantation. To address this, tissue engineering strategies have utilized both exogenous and endogenous stimuli to accelerate the development of hiPSC-CMs. Exogenous electrical stimulation provides a biomimetic pacemaker-like stimuli that has been shown to advance the electrical properties of tissue engineered cardiac constructs. Recently, we demonstrated that the incorporation of electrically conductive silicon nanowires to hiPSC cardiac spheroids led to advanced structural and functional development of hiPSC-CMs by improving the endogenous electrical microenvironment. Here, we reasoned that the enhanced endogenous electrical microenvironment of nanowired hiPSC cardiac spheroids would synergize with exogenous electrical stimulation to further advance the functional development of nanowired hiPSC cardiac spheroids. For the first time, we report that the combination of nanowires and electrical stimulation enhanced cell cell junction formation, improved development of contractile machinery, and led to a significant decrease in the spontaneous beat rate of hiPSC cardiac spheroids. The advancements made here address critical challenges for the use of hiPSC-CMs in cardiac developmental and translational research and provide an advanced cell delivery vehicle for the next generation of cardiac repair.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000379794200101	27328393

Characterization of grain yield per primary panicle (YPP), grain number per primary panicle (GNP), and 1000-grain weight (TGW) in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], a hardy C-4 cereal with a genome size of similar to 730 Mb, was implemented in a diversity panel containing 390 accessions. These accessions were genotyped to obtain 268,830 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed to identify loci associated with each grain yield component and understand the genetic interactions between these traits. Genome-wide association studies identified associations across the genome with YPP, GNP, and TGW that were located within previously mapped sorghum QTL for panicle weight, grain yield, and seed size, respectively. There were no significant associations between GNP and TGW that were within 100 kb, much greater than the average linkage disequilibrium (LD) in sorghum. The identification of nonoverlapping loci for grain number and weight suggests these traits may be manipulated independently to increase the grain yield of sorghum. Following GWAS, genomic regions surrounding each associated SNP were mined for candidate genes. Previously published expression data indicated several TGW candidate genes, including an ethylene receptor homolog, were primarily expressed within developing seed tissues to support GWAS. Furthermore, maize (Zea mays L.) homologs of identified TGW candidates were differentially expressed within the seed between small- and large-kernel lines from a segregating maize population.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1940-3372			WOS:000379368700020		
J	Tsai, Kuo-Pei								Management of Target Algae by Using Copper-Based Algaecides: Effects of Algal Cell Density and Sensitivity to Copper								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				227	7					238	10.1007/s11270-016-2926-8			JUL 2016	2016	Public concerns regarding the use of copper-based algaecide for controlling problematic algae may arise due to the risks it creates to non-target algae. To examine this concern, a series of comparative algal toxicity experiments were conducted to study effects of prokaryotic and eukaryotic algal cell densities on their responses to exposures of copper sulfate and copper-ethanolamine (Cu-EA). Microcystis aeruginosa and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were cultured separately in BG 11 medium to three initial cell densities (5 x 10(4), 5 x 10(5), and 5x10(6) cells/mL). The 96-h EC50 values of copper sulfate for M. aeruginosa at the three cell densities were 9, 63, and 112 mu g Cu/L, respectively; and were 192, 1873, and 4619 mu g Cu/L for P. subcapitata. The 96-h EC50 values of Cu-EA were 101 and 2579 mu g Cu/L for M. aeruginosa and P. subcapitata at 10(6) cells/mL. The margin of safety (MOS) for P. subcapitata at 10(4) cells/mL was 1.3, 0.9, and 0.8 when M. aeruginosa cell density was 10(4), 10(5), and 10(6) cells/mL. This laboratory study suggests that applying copper-based algaecides to control problematic algae at a relatively low cell density would inhibit their growth with minimum impacts on non-target algae; risks to non-target algae would increase with increases of problematic algal cell density.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000379240400020		
J	Bostwick, J B; Miksis, M J; Davis, S H				Miksis, Michael/B-7373-2009				Elastic membranes in confinement.								Journal of the Royal Society, Interface				13	120						10.1098/rsif.2016.0408			2016-Jul	2016	An elastic membrane stretched between two walls takes a shape defined by its length and the volume of fluid it encloses. Many biological structures, such as cells, mitochondria and coiled DNA, have fine internal structure in which a membrane (or elastic member) is geometrically 'confined' by another object. Here, the two-dimensional shape of an elastic membrane in a 'confining' box is studied by introducing a repulsive confinement pressure that prevents the membrane from intersecting the wall. The stage is set by contrasting confined and unconfined solutions. Continuation methods are then used to compute response diagrams, from which we identify the particular membrane mechanics that generate mitochondria-like shapes. Large confinement pressures yield complex response diagrams with secondary bifurcations and multiple turning points where modal identities may change. Regions in parameter space where such behaviour occurs are then mapped.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1742-5662		MEDLINE:27440257	27440257

However, most fabrication protocols require long processing times and expensive facilities. As a convenient alternative, polymeric materials have been extensively used due their lower cost and versatility. Although CO2 laser ablation has been used for fast prototyping on polymeric materials, it cannot be applied to glass devices because the local heating causes thermal stress and results in extensive cracking. A few papers have shown the ablation of channels or thin holes (used as reservoirs) on glass but the process is still far away from yielding functional glass microfluidic devices. To address these shortcomings, this communication describes a simple method to engrave glass-based capillary electrophoresis devices using standard (1 mm-thick) microscope glass slides. The process uses a sacrificial layer of wax as heat sink and enables the development of both channels (with semicircular shape) and pass-through reservoirs. Although microscope images showed some small cracks around the channels (that became irrelevant after sealing the engraved glass layer to PDMS) the proposed strategy is a leap forward in the application of the technology to glass. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, the separation of dopamine, catechol and uric acid was accomplished in less than 100 s.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0173-0835	1522-2683		WOS:000379132300011	27028724

However, statistical rigor and factor structure are not definitive. To date, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) has not examined whether the factor structure generalizes across different groups (e.g., WAD versus non-WAD). This study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the NDI in these population groups.This study used CFA to analyze NDI baseline-data for WAD (n = 804; 69 % females) and non-WAD (n = 963; 67 % females), each for the full sample and separate genders. Invariance analyses examined the NDI structure across the four groups.Across both populations and gender subgroups the one-factor solutions consistently showed better model fit over two-factor solutions. The NDI was best characterized as one-dimensional and invariant across multiple sub-groups.The NDI remains a valid PRO in WAD populations that provides acceptable measurement of neck status that is appropriate for basic functional assessment across genders. However, it is recommended that both clinicians and researchers initiate the transition toward more rigorous and less ambiguous PRO measurement tools for WAD patients and research. This future graduated movement toward other PROs should consider both regional PROs and computerized decision support systems, initially measured concurrently with the NDI to establish ways to convert existing scored data prior to their singular use.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0940-6719	1432-0932		WOS:000378945800008	27040281	
J	Dalton, Christina Marsh; Warren, Patrick L.								Cost versus control: Understanding ownership through outsourcing in hospitals								JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS				48				1	15		10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.02.003			JUL 2016	2016	For-profit hospitals in California contract out services much more intensely than either private nonprofit or public hospitals. To explain why, we build a model in which the outsourcing decision is a trade-off between cost and control. Since nonprofit firms are more restricted in how they consume net revenues, they experience more rapidly diminishing value of a dollar saved, and they are less attracted to a low-cost but low-control outsourcing opportunity than a for-profit firm is. This difference is exaggerated in services where the benefits of controlling the details of production are particularly important but minimized when a fixed-cost shock raises the marginal value of a dollar of cost savings. We test these predictions in a panel of California hospitals, finding evidence for each and that the set of services that private non-profits are particularly interested in controlling (physician-intensive services) is very different from those than public hospitals are particularly interested in (labor-intensive services). These results suggest that a model of public or nonprofit make-or-buy decisions should be more than a simple relabeling of a model derived in the for-profit context. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Lineage A is composed of a population from Sabah, East Malaysia (Borneo); lineage B represents the type population from Java, Indonesia; and lineage C includes populations from the mainland of Southeast Asia (Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand). The genetic variation of lineage C on the mainland is greater than that of lineages A and B on the islands of Borneo and Java.

Evaluating the performance of different network options for V2V and V2I communication that ensure optimal utilization of resources is a prerequisite when designing and developing robust wireless networks for CVT applications. Though dedicated short range communication (DSRC) has been considered as the primary communication option for CVT safety applications, the use of other wireless technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, WiMAX) allow longer range communications and throughput requirements that could not be supported by DSRC alone. Further, the use of other wireless technology potentially reduces the need for costly DSRC infrastructure. In this research, the authors evaluated the performance of Het-Net consisting of Wi-Fi, DSRC and LTE technologies for V2V and V2I communications. An application layer handoff method was developed to enable Het-Net communication for two CVT applications: traffic data collection, and forward collision warning. The handoff method ensures the optimal utilization of available communication options (i.e., eliminate the need of using multiple communication options at the same time) and corresponding backhaul communication infrastructure depending on the connected vehicle application requirements. Field studies conducted in this research demonstrated that the use of Het-Net broadened the range and coverage of V2V and V2I communications. The use of the application layer handoff technique to maintain seamless connectivity for CVT applications was also successfully demonstrated and can be adopted in future Het-Net supported connected vehicle applications. A long handoff time was observed when the application switches from LTE to Wi-Fi. The delay is largely due to the time required to activate the 802.11 link and the time required for the vehicle to associate with the RSU (i.e., access point). Modifying the application to implement a soft handoff where a new network is seamlessly connected before breaking from the existing network can greatly reduce (or eliminate) the interruption of network service observed by the application. However, the use of a Het-Net did not compromise the performance of the traffic data collection application as this application does not require very low latency, unlike connected vehicle safety applications. Field tests revealed that the handoff between networks in Het-Net required several seconds (i.e., higher than 200 ms required for safety applications). Thus, Het-Net could not be used to support safety applications that require communication latency less than 200 ms. However, Het-Net could provide additional supplementary connectivity for safety applications to warn vehicles upstream to take proactive actions to avoid problem locations. To validate and establish the findings from field tests that included a limited number of connected vehicles, ns-3 simulation experiments with a larger number of connected vehicles were conducted involving a DSRC and LTE Het-Net scenario. The latency and packet delivery error trend obtained from ns-3 simulation were found to be similar to the field experiment results.

J	Kinsella, Amelia; Mattfeld, Ryan; Muth, Eric; Hoover, Adam								Frequency, Not Amplitude, of Latency Affects Subjective Sickness in a Head-Mounted Display								AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE				87	7			604	609		10.3357/AMHP.4351.2016			JUL 2016	2016	BACKGROUND: Interactions between frequency and amplitude of latency in head-mounted displays (HMDs) are thought to affect simulator sickness. Many studies have linked system latency to subjective sickness, but recent research has found that at least with the case of inertia-based head tracking technology, latency is not a constant; rather it varies systematically over time due to sensor errors and clock asynchronization.The purpose of this experiment was to further explore the relationship between frequency and amplitude of latency as they relate to subjective sickness experienced in an HMD.METHODS: In a 2 (frequency) X 2 (amplitude) design, 120 subjects were randomly assigned to 4 latency conditions. Frequency of latency was either 0.2 Hz or 1.0 Hz. Amplitude of latency was either 100 ms fixed or 20-100 ms varying.RESULTS: A main effect of frequency of latency was found. Subjects reported greater sickness in the 0.2-Hz frequency conditions (39.0 +/- 27.8) compared to the 1-Hz conditions (30.3 +/- 17.0). Additionally, 18 subjects withdrew their participation early in the 0.2-Hz conditions compared to 7 in the 1.0-Hz conditions.DISCUSSION: In conclusion, frequency of latency appears to play a role in the experience of sickness in HMDs in both subjective reporting of symptoms and subject performance. The current study confirms results of earlier studies, finding that real motion around a frequency of 0.2 Hz is more sickening than other frequencies. Future work should continue to parse the effects of frequency and amplitude of latency in head-tracked HMDs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2375-6314	2375-6322		WOS:000378466300003	27503039

In our study, we focused on the geochemistry and mineralogy of Lake Orr and Lake Whurr. While both lakes are poor in organic carbon (<1%), the sediments' pH values differ and range from 3.8 to 4.8 in Lake Orr and from 5.4 to 6.3 in Lake Whurr sediments. Lake Whurr sediments were dominated by orange and red sediment zones in which the main Fe minerals were identified as hematite, goethite, and tentatively jarosite and pyrite. Lake Orr was dominated by brownish and blackish sediments where the main Fe minerals were goethite and another paramagnetic Fe(III)-phase that could not be identified. Furthermore, a likely secondary Fe(II)-phase was observed in Lake Orr sediments. The mineralogy of these two salt lakes in the sampling area is strongly influenced by events such as flooding, evaporation, and desiccation, processes that explain at least to some extent the observed differences between Lake Orr and Lake Whurr. The iron mineralogy of Lake Whurr sediments and the high salinity make this lake a suitable analogue for Meridiani Planum on Mars, and in particular the tentative identification of pyrite in Lake Whurr sediments has implications for the interpretation of the Fe mineralogy of Meridiani Planum sediments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000378901800004	27258848

We quantified the effects of four canopy treatments (uncut Control; MedBA, harvest to 9 m(2).ha(-1); LowBA, harvest to 5 m(2).ha(-1); and Clearcut) and three cultural treatments (NT, no treatment; H, herbicide release of longleaf pine seedlings; and H+F, herbicide release plus fertilization) on resource availability and growing conditions in relation to longleaf pine seedling response for 3 years. Harvesting treatments reduced competition from canopy trees but resulted in greater abundance of understory vegetation. Harvesting shifted the interception of light from the canopy to the subcanopy vegetation layer; however, total light availability at the forest floor increased with the intensity of canopy removal. Soil moisture was not affected by harvesting or by the cultural treatments. Foliar nutrient concentrations (N, P, and K) of longleaf pine seedlings generally increased with the intensity of the harvest treatment. Of the plant resources measured, we found that light was most strongly correlated with longleaf pine seedling growth and that incorporating the interception of light by subcanopy vegetation improved the relationship over that of canopy light transmittance alone.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0045-5067	1208-6037		WOS:000378783800002

The experimental portion of the work comprised (a) identification of the weld zones within the FSW joints, through the use of optical-microscopy characterization of a transverse section; (b) validation of the weld zones identified in (a) via the generation of a micro-hardness field over the same transverse section; (c) extracting and subsequently testing miniature tensile specimens from different weld zones; and (d) extracting and testing a larger-size tensile specimen spanning transversely the FSW weld. The computational portion of the work comprised (i) validation of the mechanical properties, as determined experimentally using the miniature tensile specimens, of the material residing within different zones of the FSW joint; and (ii) clarification of the benefits yielded by the knowledge of the local material properties within the FSW joint. These benefits arise from the fact that (a) joint mechanical properties are generally inferior to those of the base metal; (b) the width of the weld in thick metallic-armor is often comparable to the armor thickness, and therefore may represent a significant portion of the armor exposed-surface area; and (c) modeling of the weld-material structural response under loading requires the availability of high-fidelity/validated material constitutive models, and the development of such models requires knowledge of the local weld-material mechanical properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000378869400015

Specific Factors Influence Postconcussion Symptom Duration among Youth Referred to a Sports Concussion Clinic								JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS				174				33	+		10.1016/j.jpeds.2016.03.014			JUL 2016	2016	Objective To identify the clinical factors that influence the duration of postconcussion symptoms among youth referred to a sports concussion clinic.Study design A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate several potential predictors of symptom duration via a Cox proportional hazards analyses. The individual postconcussion symptom scores were highly correlated, so these symptoms were analyzed in the statistical model as coefficients derived from principal component analyses.Results Among 1953 youth with concussion, 1755 (89.9%) had dates of reported symptom resolution. The remainder (10.1%) were lost to follow-up and censored. The median time to recovery was 18 days (range 1-353 days). By 30 days, 72.6% had recovered; by 60 days, 91.4% had recovered; and by 90 days, 96.8% had recovered. Several variables in a multivariate Cox model predicted postconcussion symptom duration: female sex (P < .001, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28), continued activity participation (P = .02, HR = 1.13), loss of consciousness (P = .03, HR = 1.18), anterograde amnesia (P = .04, HR = 1.15), premorbid headaches (P = .03, HR = 1.15), symptom components from the day of concussion (emotion, P = .03, HR = 1.08), and the day of clinic evaluation (cognitive-fatigue, P < .001, HR = 1.22; cephalalgic, P < .001, HR = 1.27; emotional, P = .05, HR = 1.08; arousal-stimulation, P = .003, HR = 1.1). In univariate analyses, greater symptom scores generally predicted longer symptom durations. Worsening of symptoms from the day of concussion to the day of clinic evaluation also predicted longer recovery (P < .001, HR = 1.59).Conclusions Several factors help to predict protracted postconcussion symptom durations among youth referred to a sports concussion clinic.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0022-3476	1097-6833		WOS:000378620800009	27056449

Multiple weak reflectors are implemented on a coaxial cable so that any two consecutive reflectors can form a Fabry-Perot cavity. By fixing the cable sensor in a helical form on a shaft, the distributed torsion of the shaft can be measured by the cascaded Fabry-Perot cavities. A test on a single section shows that the sensor has a linear response with a sensitivity of 1.834 MHz (rad/m)(-1) in the range of twisted rate from 0 to 8.726 rad m(-1). The distributed torsion sensing capability is useful in drilling process monitoring, structure health monitoring and machine failure detection.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-0233	1361-6501		WOS:000378821600025

A multi-factor approach to optimizing nutrient ions in media for subsequent ex vitro growth has not been studied. A response surface method was designed to test in vitro plant density (50-250 buds/L), (6.25-10.25 mM), Ca2+ (2-10 mM), and KNO3 (18-100 mM) in low on medium as it affected subsequent growth in a 21 days acclimatization period with Curcuma longa genotypes (L35-1 and L22-5). The treatment media were compared with the MS medium. Plants grown on treatment media had higher relative fresh biomass (3.3 +/- 0.5 fold from high-density with 42 mM KNO3; 3.7 +/- 0.5 fold from low-density with 18 mM KNO3) than MS plants (2.6 +/- 0.5 fold) regardless of plant density. Leaf area index from the treatments (67.0 +/- 16.4 cm(2)/bud from high-density with 70.4 mM KNO3; 78.4 +/- 16.4 cm(2)/bud from low-density with 50.7 mM KNO3) was higher than MS plants (22.0 +/- 8 cm(2)/bud from high-density and 36.0 +/- 8 cm(2)/bud from low-density). Shoots from treatment plants receiving 64 mM KNO3, elongated to 8.6 +/- 0.9 cm from high-density and 10.9 +/- 0.9 cm from low-density. Genotype L22-5 elongated to 6.0 +/- 0.6 cm regardless of density, and L35-1 elongated to 6.0 +/- 0.6 cm from low-density and to 4.0 +/- 0.6 cm from high-density. Raising phosphate 5x to 10x the MS concentration in the pre-hardening media did not influence ex vitro responses. Plants grown on modified low ammonium media can grow faster and larger during acclimatization with increased KNO3, especially from high-density culture that would be preferred in commercial applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-6857	1573-5044		WOS:000378411300003

In such networks, nodes often present certain social network properties of their holders in terms of contents (i.e., interests) and contacts. However, current methods in DTNs only consider either content or contact for file searching or dissemination, which limits the file sharing efficiency. In this paper, we first analyze real traces to confirm the importance and necessity of considering both content and contact in file search. We then propose Cont(2), a social-aware file search method that exploits both node contents and contact patterns. First, considering people with common interests tend to share files and gather together, Cont(2) virtually groups common-interest nodes into a community to direct file search. Second, considering human mobility follows a certain pattern, Cont(2) exploits nodes' contact frequencies with a community to expedite file searching. To further improve the searching efficiency, Cont(2) also integrates sub-communities and parallel forwarding as optional components for file searching. Trace-driven experiments on the GENI testbed and NS-2 simulator show that Cont(2) can effectively improve the search efficiency compared to current methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000378263800010		
J	Liu, Guoxin; Shen, Haiying; Chandler, Harrison; Li, Jin								Measuring and Evaluating Live Content Consistency in a Large-Scale CDN								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				27	7			2074	2090		10.1109/TPDS.2015.2479222			JUL 2016	2016	Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) play a central role in today's Internet infrastructure and have seen a sharp increase in scale. More and more internet sites are armed with live contents, such as live sports game statistics, e-commerce, and online auctions, and they rely on CDNs to deliver such contents freshly at scale. However, the problem of maintaining consistency for live (dynamic) contents while achieving high scalability is non-trivial in CDNs. The large number of widely scattered replicas guarantees the QoS of end-users while substantially increasing the complexity of consistency maintenance under frequent updates. Current consistency maintenance infrastructures and methods cannot simultaneously satisfy both scalability and consistency. In this paper, we first analyze our crawled trace data of cached sports game content on thousands of content servers of a major CDN. We analyze the content consistency from different perspectives, from which we break down the reasons for inconsistency among content servers. We verify that the CDN uses unicast instead of multicast trees as the update infrastructure, which may not scale effectively. Then, we further evaluate the performance in consistency, scalability and overhead for different infrastructures with different update methods. We itemize the advantages and disadvantages of different methods and infrastructures in different scenarios through the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, we propose our hybrid and self-adaptive update method to reduce network load and improve scalability under the conditions recorded in the trace and prove its effectiveness through trace-driven experiments. We aim to give guidance for appropriate selections of consistency maintenance infrastructures and methods for a CDN, and for choosing a CDN service with different considerations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000378263800017

Multiple experiments are conducted in a data rich environment to construct and validate the SVM model and to explore the effectiveness and robustness of the EnKF technique. It was observed that the performance of SVM relies more on the initial length of training set than other factors (e.g., cost function, regularization parameter, and kernel parameters). The dual EnKF technique proved to be efficient to improve SVM with observed data either at each time step or at a flexible time steps. The EnKF technique can reach its maximum efficiency when the updating ensemble size approaches a certain threshold. It was observed that the SVM model performance for the multi-layer soil moisture estimation can be influenced by the rainfall magnitude (e.g., dry and wet spells). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Observers' Judgments of the Effects of Glare on Their Visual Acuity for High and Low Contrast Stimuli								PERCEPTION				45	7			755	767		10.1177/0301006616633591			JUL 2016	2016	Disability glare refers to a reduction in the ability to discern a stimulus that is positioned near another stimulus that has a much higher luminance. While it is common for drivers to report that they have been "blinded" by oncoming headlights, it is unclear whether observers can accurately judge when they are visually disabled by glare. This experiment sought to quantify the accuracy with which observers can judge when a glare source reduces their visual acuity. Seventeen observers estimated their disability glare threshold (DGT)-the luminance of a glare source that would be just sufficient to impair their ability to discern the orientation of a Landolt C that was surrounded by the glare source. These estimated DGTs were compared to the participant's actual DGTs. Participants consistently underestimated the intensity of glare that was required to impair their acuity. On average, estimates of glare threshold were 88% lower than actual glare threshold intensities. Participants' judgments were affected by stimulus size but not stimulus contrast. These results suggest that observers can exaggerate the debilitating effects of glare and that they can fail to appreciate that high contrast stimuli are more robust to glare. A driver who believes that even the lowest intensities of headlight glare can visually impair an oncoming driver may be reluctant to use high beam headlamps, despite their significant visibility advantages.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0301-0066	1468-4233		WOS:000378280300003	26908566

The numerical representation of these sets is sufficient to describe arbitrary convex polytopes when the complexity of the representation is not limited. At the same time, this representation permits the computation of exact projections, intersections, and Minkowski sums using very simple identities. Efficient and accurate methods for computing an enclosure of one constrained zonotope by another of lower complexity are provided. The advantages and disadvantages of these sets are discussed in comparison to ellipsoids, parallelotopes, zonotopes, and convex polytopes in halfspace and vertex representations. Moreover, extensive numerical comparisons demonstrate significant advantages over other classes of sets in the context of set-based state estimation and fault detection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Cartilage				7	3			274	83		10.1177/1947603515611948			2016-Jul	2016	BACKGROUND: Mandibular condyle cartilage (MCC) has a unique structure among articular cartilages; however, little is known about its nanoscale collagen network architecture, hampering design of regeneration therapies and rigorous evaluation of regeneration experiment outcomes in preclinical research. Helium ion microscopy is a novel technology with a long depth of field that is uniquely suited to imaging open 3D collagen networks at multiple scales without obscuring conductive coatings.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to image, at the micro- and nanoscales, the depth-dependent MCC collagen network architecture.DESIGN: MCC was collected from New Zealand white rabbits. Images of MCC zones were acquired using helium ion, transmission electron, and light microscopy. Network fibril and canal diameters were measured.RESULTS: For the first time, the MCC was visualized as a 3D collagen fibril structure at the nanoscale, the length scale of network assembly. Fibril diameters ranged from 7 to 110 nm and varied by zone. The articular surface was composed of a fine mesh that was woven through thin layers of larger fibrils. The fibrous zone was composed of approximately orthogonal lamellae of aligned fibrils. Fibrocyte processes surrounded collagen bundles forming extracellular compartments. The proliferative, mature, and hypertrophic zones were composed of a branched network that was progressively remodeled to accommodate chondrocyte hypertrophy. Osteoid fibrils were woven around osteoblast cytoplasmic processes to create numerous canals similar in size to canaliculi of mature bone.CONCLUSION: This multiscale investigation advances our foundational understanding of the complex, layered 3D architecture of the MCC collagen network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1947-6035			MEDLINE:27375843	27375843	
J	Wu, Bo; Shen, Haiying								Mining connected global and local dense subgraphs for bigdata								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C				27	7					1650072	10.1142/S0129183116500728			JUL 2016	2016	The problem of discovering connected dense subgraphs of natural graphs is important in data analysis. Discovering dense subgraphs that do not contain denser subgraphs or are not contained in denser subgraphs (called significant dense subgraphs) is also critical for wide-ranging applications. In spite of many works on discovering dense subgraphs, there are no algorithms that can guarantee the connectivity of the returned subgraphs or discover significant dense subgraphs. Hence, in this paper, we define two subgraph discovery problems to discover connected and significant dense subgraphs, propose polynomial-time algorithms and theoretically prove their validity. We also propose an algorithm to further improve the time and space efficiency of our basic algorithm for discovering significant dense subgraphs in big data by taking advantage of the unique features of large natural graphs. In the experiments, we use massive natural graphs to evaluate our algorithms in comparison with previous algorithms. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our algorithms for the two problems and their efficiency. This work is also the first that reveals the physical significance of significant dense subgraphs in natural graphs from different domains.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000377675300002

Evaluation of liquid aerosol transport through porous media								JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY				190				15	28		10.1016/j.jconhyd.2016.03.003			JUL 2016	2016	Application of remediation methods in contaminated vadose zones has been hindered by an inability to effectively distribute liquid- or solid-phase amendments. Injection as aerosols in a carrier gas could be a viable method for achieving useful distributions of amendments in unsaturated materials. The objectives of this work were to characterize radial transport of aerosols in unsaturated porous media, and to develop capabilities for predicting results of aerosol injection scenarios at the field-scale. Transport processes were investigated by conducting lab-scale injection experiments with radial flow geometry, and predictive capabilities were obtained by developing and validating a numerical model for simulating coupled aerosol transport, deposition, and multi-phase flow in porous media. Soybean oil was transported more than 2 m through sand by injecting it as micron-scale aerosol droplets. Oil saturation in the sand increased with time to a maximum of 0.25, and decreased with radial distance in the experiments. The numerical analysis predicted the distribution of oil saturation with only minor calibration. The results indicated that evolution of oil saturation was controlled by aerosol deposition and subsequent flow of the liquid oil, and simulation requires including these two coupled processes. The calibrated model was used to evaluate field applications. The results suggest that amendments can be delivered to the vadose zone as aerosols, and that gas injection rate and aerosol particle size will be important controls on the process.

A primal algorithm for the weighted minimum covering ball problem in								TOP				24	2			466	492		10.1007/s11750-015-0405-9			JUL 2016	2016	The nonlinear programming problem of finding the minimum covering ball of a finite set of points in , with a positive weight corresponding to each point, is solved by a directional search method. At each iteration, the search path is either a ray or the arc of a circle and is determined by bisectors of points. Each step size along the search path is determined explicitly. The primal algorithm is shown to search along the farthest point Voronoi diagram of the given points.

J	Ersan, Gamze; Apul, Onur G.; Karanfil, Tanju								Linear solvation energy relationships (LSER) for adsorption of organic compounds by carbon nanotubes								WATER RESEARCH				98				28	38		10.1016/j.watres.2016.03.067			JUL 1 2016	2016	The objective of this paper was to create a comprehensive database for the adsorption of organic compounds by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and to use the Linear Solvation Energy Relationship (LSER) technique for developing predictive adsorption models of organic compounds (OCs) by multi -walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and single -walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Adsorption data for 123 OCs by MWCNTs and 48 OCs by SWCNTs were compiled from the literature, including some experimental results obtained in our laboratory. The roles of selected OCs properties and CNT types were examined with LSER models. The results showed that the r(2) values of the LSER models displayed small variability for aromatic compounds smaller than 220 g/mol, after which a decreasing trend was observed. The data available for aliphatics was mainly for molecular weights smaller than 250 g/mol, which showed a similar trend to that of aromatics. The r(2) values for the LSER model on the adsorption of aromatic and aliphatic OCs by SWCNTs and MWCNTs were relatively similar indicating the linearity of LSER models did not depend on the CNT types. Among all LSER model descriptors, V term (molecular volume) for aromatic OCs and B term (basicity) for aliphatic OCs were the most predominant descriptors on both type of CNTs. The presence of R term (excess molar refractivity) in LSER model equations resulted in decreases for both V and P (polarizability) parameters without affecting the r(2) values. Overall, the results demonstrate that successful predictive models can be developed for the adsorption of OCs by MWCNTs and SWCNTs with LSER techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of seven studies that met criteria for the synthesis and provided sufficient data for the calculation of effect size were included. Science instruction has been examined using science intervention and vocabulary intervention with a focus on science. The overall mean effect size was moderate (0.66), suggesting that a focus on science increased young children's vocabulary outcomes. Science instruction appears to promote young children's domain-specific words. Educational implications of these findings suggest that there is support for using science instruction to increase the vocabulary performance of young children.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1082-3301	1573-1707		WOS:000376566500009		
J	Rothenberger, Megan B.; Calomeni, Alyssa J.								Complex interactions between nutrient enrichment and zooplankton in regulating estuarine phytoplankton assemblages: Microcosm experiments informed by an environmental dataset								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				480				62	73		10.1016/j.jembe.2016.03.015			JUL 2016	2016	The interactive effects of nutrients and zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton assemblage composition and bloom formation are not well understood, especially in coastal ecosystems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate phytoplankton assemblage responses to changing environmental conditions in Raritan Bay, an estuary between the states of New York and New Jersey with a long history of cultural eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (HABs). Environmental monitoring of water quality and plankton species composition (monthly data collected from April 2010-April 2013), multivariate ordination techniques, and microcosm experiments were integrated to achieve this objective. Multivariate analysis of the monitoring dataset led to the generation of a number of hypotheses regarding phytoplankton composition, individual nuisance species, environmental factors, and zooplankton composition. The field observations were then supplemented with a series of controlled microcosm experiments designed to test those hypotheses. In particular, the effects and interaction of varying mesozooplankton abundance (sieved, unsieved and enriched) and enrichment with two nutrients (nitrate and dissolved iron) on spring and summer phytoplanlcton assemblages were evaluated. The environmental monitoring data and the results of the microcosm experiments both indicate that Si:N ratios are important factors governing phytoplankton dynamics in Raritan Bay and that effects of nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton species composition are magnified when mesozooplankton abundance is low. The microcosm experiments, however, led to unexpected results regarding the influence of iron on phytoplankton assemblages. Iron did not emerge as one of the environmental parameters related to spring and summer phytoplankton species composition in the multivariate analysis of field data. Yet, enrichment with iron in microcosms resulted in significant increases in diatoms, and enrichment with both iron and nitrate resulted in significant increases in dinoflagellates and HAB taxa, including Heterocapsa triquetra (Ehrenberg) Stein and Dinophysis spp. This finding suggests that small pulses of iron, in combination with low Si:N ratios (<1) and low mesozooplankton abundance, would shift phytoplankton assemblages in Raritan Bay toward greater dinoflagellate dominance.

After DC electric field alignment of SbSI nanowires between the microelectrodes, the sample was irradiated with ultrasound using chromium copper alloy sonotrode ended with silicon carbide (SiC) single crystal. The SEM and AFM investigations have showed that the ends of SbSI nanowires have been well compacted and bonded with microelectrodes. Ultrasonic processing has caused 420% increase of DC electric conductance of the junctions between Au microelectrodes and SbSI nanowires. The fabricated structures of SbSI nanowires bonded to Au microelectrodes are useful e.g. as nitrous oxide (N2O) gas sensors. These low power devices can operate at room temperature and do not require heating system for recovery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A pressurized mixture consisting of ethanol and carbon dioxide (3:2 wt/wt) was used as a solvent for THC and PLLA with concentrations up to 2 wt%. The influences of pre-expansion conditions (temperature and pressure) and THC:PLLA weight ratio on the size and morphology of THC-loaded PLLA particles, as well as the loading capacity of THC, were systematically investigated. All the obtained particles were spherical in shape with average size and THC loading capacity ranges of similar to 80-110 nm and similar to 13-25%, respectively. The loading capacity increased with (i) increasing pre-expansion temperature and reducing pre-expansion pressure and (ii) increasing THC:PLLA weight ratio at high pre-expansion temperature and low pre-expansion pressure. The antioxidant activity of THC remained unchanged after rapid expansion process, and encapsulation in PLLA prolonged the release of THC. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using social exchange theory as a theoretical basis, this study hypothesized that safety climate would be related to employees' job satisfaction, engagement, and turnover rate, highlighting the beneficial effects of safety climate beyond typical safety outcomes. Survey data were collected from 6207 truck drivers from two U.S. trucking companies. The objective turnover rate was collected one year after the survey data collection. Results showed that employees' safety climate perceptions were linked to employees' level of job satisfaction, engagement, and objective turnover rate, thus supporting the application of social exchange theory. Job satisfaction was also a significant mediator between safety climate and the two human resource outcomes (i.e., employee engagement and turnover rate). This study is among the first to assess the impact of safety climate beyond safety outcomes among lone workers (using truck drivers as an exemplar). (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, source waters containing a significant level of bromide could have different chemical pathways during TiO2-UVA disinfection process because reactive bromine species could be formed. To illustrate the water safety from the Br-TiO2-UVA system, this study investigated bacterial inactivation efficiency and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation under different pH, TiO2 dosages and bromide concentrations in a laboratory setting. At a high bromide concentration (65 mg/L, equivalent to the concentration of natural sea water), the bacterial inactivation rate increased 2 times at pH 5 and more than 5 times at pH 8. However, a significant increase of brominated DBPs, which were considered more carcinogenic and toxic than chlorinated DBPs, was observed. The bacterial inactivation pattern was shifted from the "shoulder-log" to the "log-tail" under different bromide concentrations, suggesting the existence of bromide altered the bacterial inactivation mechanisms. We also observed that the inactivation kinetics of Br-TiO2-UVA system was greatly influenced by water pH. Our laboratory experiments demonstrated that bromide could improve the performance of photocatalytic inactivation, but it also could reduce the water safety by generating a higher level of brominated-DBPs in treated water. Water engineers should pay attention to the brominated DBP formation when applying TiO2-UVA photocatalysis on source waters with a significant level of bromide. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, Taotao; Jian, Qijie; Chen, Feng; Wang, Yong; Gong, Liang; Duan, Xuewu; Yang, Bao; Jiang, Yueming								Influence of Butylated Hydroxyanisole on the Growth, Hyphal Morphology, and the Biosynthesis of Fumonisins in Fusarium proliferaturn								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				7						1038	10.3389/fmicb.2016.01038			JUN 29 2016	2016	Fusarium proliferatum as a common fungus pathogen in foods can produce toxic fumonisins, which can cause animal diseases and increase risks of human cancers. On contrary, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) as a synthetic antioxidant offers a clue for preventing growth of fungal species and inhibiting production of mycotoxins. Unfortunately, information of the inhibitory mechanism of BHA on Fusarium species is still limited. In this study, influence of BHA treatment on growth and inhibition of fumonisin production in relation to the expression of the fumonisin biosynthesis-related genes of the F proliferatum ZYF was investigated, which revealed that BHA had a negative influence on growth and fumonisin production of E proliferatum. To further elucidate the mechanism of BHA on the growth of F proliferatum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to examine the F proliferatum hyphae. The BHA treatment induced the loss of cytoplasm and cellular constituents, as well as distortion of mycelia, but it did not directly degrade the fumonisin. Furthermore, the BHA treatment markedly inhibited the expressions of FUM1 (a polyketide synthase encoding gene) and FUM8 (an aminotransferase encoding gene) genes, which resulted in the depression of metabolic pathway of F proliferaturn. The transcriptional analyses of the FUM1 and FUM8 genes confirmed a correlation between the fumonisin production and its gene expression. This study provided some insights into mechanisms of production of fumonisin and feasible prevention to reduce fumonisin contamination in favor of human and animal health.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-302X			WOS:000378683300001	27468276

There is evidence that these reactions are microbially driven but the key enzymes and groups of microorganisms involved are largely unknown. Our aim was to uncover the diversity, abundance and distribution of genes encoding for halogenating and dehalogenating enzymes in a German forest soil by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Metagenomic libraries of three soil horizons revealed the presence of genera known to be involved in halogenation and dehalogenation processes such as Bradyrhizobium or Pseudomonas. We detected a so far unknown diversity of genes encoding for (de) halogenating enzymes in the soil metagenome including specific and unspecific halogenases as well as metabolic and cometabolic dehalogenases. Genes for non-heme, no-metal chloroperoxidases and haloalkane dehalogenases were the most abundant halogenase and dehalogenase genes, respectively. The high diversity and abundance of (de) halogenating enzymes suggests a strong microbial contribution to natural halogen cycling. This was also confirmed in microcosm experiments in which we quantified the biotic formation of chloroform and bromoform. Knowledge on microorganisms and genes that catalyze (de) halogenation reactions is critical because they are highly relevant to industrial biotechnologies and bioremediation applications.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000378813400001	27353292

Although there is no immune cultivar, field tolerance to HLB within citrus and citrus relatives has been observed at the USDA Picos farm at Ft. Pierce, Florida, where plants have been exposed to a very high level of HLB pressure since 2006. In this study, we used RNA-Seq to evaluate expression differences between two closely related cultivars after HLB infection: HLB-tolerant "Jackson" grapefruit -like -hybrid trees and HLB susceptible "Marsh" grapefruit trees. A total of 686 genes were differentially expressed (DE) between the two cultivars. Among them, 247 genes were up -expressed and 439 were down -expressed in tolerant citrus trees. We also identified a total of 619 genes with significant differential expression of alternative splicing isoforms between HLB tolerant and HLB susceptible citrus trees. We analyzed the functional categories of DE genes using two methods, and revealed that multiple pathways have been suppressed or activated in the HLB tolerant citrus trees, which lead to the activation of the basal resistance or immunity of citrus plants. We have experimentally verified the expressions of 14 up -expressed genes and 19 down -expressed genes on HLB-tolerant "Jackson" trees and H LB -susceptible "Marsh" trees using real time PCR. The results showed that the expression of most genes were in agreement with the RNA-Seq results. This study provided new insights into HLB-tolerance and useful guidance for breeding HLB-tolerant citrus in the future.									0	1	0	0	0	1			1664-462X			WOS:000378601300002	27446161

The most common source of sulfur in soil-SO42--is absorbed into root tissue and distributed into aerial part through vasculature system, where it is reduced into sulfite and finally sulfide within the subcellular organs such as chloroplasts and mitochondria and used for cysteine and methionine biosynthesis. MicroRNAs are involved in many regulation pathways by repressing the expression of their target genes. MiR395 family in Arabidopsis thaliana has been reported to be an important regulator involved in sulfate transport and assimilation, and a high-affinity sulphate transporter and three ATP sulfurylases (ATPS) were the target genes of AthmiR395 (Arabidopsis thaliana miR395). We have cloned a miR395 gene from rice (Oryza sativa) and studied its function in plant nutritional response. Our results indicated that in rice, transcript level of OsamiR395 (Oryza sativa miR395) increased under sulfate deficiency conditions, and the two predicted target genes of miR395 were down-regulated under the same conditions. Overexpression of OsamiR395h in tobacco impaired its sulfate homeostasis, and sulfate distribution was also slightly impacted among leaves of different ages. One sulfate transporter (SULTR) gene NtaSULTR2 was identified to be the target of miR395 in Nicotiana tobacum, which belongs to low affinity sulfate transporter group. Both miR395 and NtaSULTR2 respond to sulfate starvation in tobacco.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000378720600001	27350219	
J	Adler, Peter H.; Yadamsuren, Oyunchuluun; Procunier, William S.								Chromosomal Translocations in Black Flies (Diptera: Simuliidae)-Facilitators of Adaptive Radiation?								PLOS ONE				11	6					e0158272	10.1371/journal.pone.0158272			JUN 27 2016	2016	A macrogenomic investigation of a Holarctic clade of black flies-the Simulium cholodkovskii lineage-provided a platform to explore the implications of a unique, synapomorphic whole-arm interchange in the evolution of black flies. Nearly 60 structural rearrangements were discovered in the polytene complement of the lineage, including 15 common to all 138 analyzed individuals, relative to the central sequence for the entire subgenus Simulium. Three species were represented, of which two Palearctic entities (Simulium cholodkovskii and S. decimatum) were sympatric; an absence of hybrids confirmed their reproductive isolation. A third (Nearctic) entity had nonhomologous sex chromosomes, relative to the other species, and is considered a separate species, for which the name Simulium nigricoxum is revalidated. A cytophylogeny is inferred and indicates that the two Palearctic taxa are sister species and these, in turn, are the sister group of the Nearctic species. The rise of the S. cholodkovskii lineage encompassed complex chromosomal and genomic restructuring phenomena associated with speciation in black flies, viz. expression of one and the same rearrangement as polymorphic, fixed, or sex linked in different species; taxon-specific differentiation of sex chromosomes; and reciprocal translocation of chromosome arms. The translocation is hypothesized to have occurred early in male spermatogonia, with the translocated chromosomal complement being transmitted to the X- and Y-bearing sperm during spermatogenesis, resulting in alternate disjunction of viable F1 translocation heterozygotes and the eventual formation of more viable and selectable F2 translocation homozygous progeny. Of 11 or 12 independently derived whole-arm interchanges known in the family Simuliidae, at least six are associated with subsequent speciation events, suggesting a facilitating role of translocations in adaptive radiations. The findings are discussed in the context of potential structural and functional interactions for future genomic research.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000378801200056	27348428

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of transposons in the origin and evolution of supernumerary segments in the asexual fungal pathogen Fusarium virguliforme. We compared the genomes of 11 isolates comprising six Fusarium species that cause soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) or bean root rot (BRR), and identified significant levels of genetic variation in A+T-rich repeat blocks of the essential chromosomes and in A+T-neutral regions of the supernumerary segments. The A+T-rich repeat blocks in the essential chromosomes were highly variable between F. virguliforme and non-F. virguliforme isolates, but were scarcely variable between F. virguliforme isolates. The A+T-neutral regions in the supernumerary segments, however, were highly variable between F. virguliforme isolates, with a statistically significant number (21 standard deviations above the mean) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). And supernumerary sequence types and rearrangement patterns of some F. virguliforme isolates were present in an isolate of F. cuneirostrum but not in the other F. virguliforme isolates. The most variable and highly expressed region in the supernumerary segments contained an active DNA transposon that was a most conserved match between F. virguliforme and the unrelated fungus Tolypocladiuminflatum. This transposon was absent from two of the F. virguliforme isolates. Furthermore, transposons in the supernumerary segments of some F. virguliforme isolates were present in non-F. virguliforme isolates, but were absent from the other F. virguliforme isolates. Two supernumerary P450 enzymes were 43% and 57% identical to their essential counterparts. This study has raised the possibility that transposons generate genetic variation in supernumerary chromosome segments by frequent horizontal transfer within and between closely related species.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000378393600037	27341103

The result presented that a total of thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-four, and thirtysix odor-active compounds were identified by GC-O in the Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4, respectively. In addition, twenty-two, twenty-two, thirty, and twenty-seven quantified compounds were demonstrated as important odorants according to odor actiVity values (OAVs > 1). Among these compounds, hexanal (OAV: 27-60), pentanal (OAV: 31-51), (E)-2-heptenal (OAV: 17-66), (E)-2hexenal (OAV: 18-63), (E)-2-octenal (OAV: 10-28), (E)-2-nonenal (OAV: 8-77), ethyl 2-methylbutyrate (OAV: 10-33), beta-ionone (OAV: 8-73), 2-methylbutyric acid (OAV: 18-37), and octanal (OAV: 4-24) contributed greatly to the aroma of cranberry. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) was used to process the mean data accumulated from sensory evaluation by the panelists, odor-active aroma compounds (OAVs > 1), and samples. Sample Y3 was highly correlated with the sensory descriptors "floral" and "fruity". Sample Y4 was greatly related to the sensory descriptors "mellow" and "green and grass". Finally, an aroma reconstitution (Model A) was prepared by mixing the odor-active aroma compounds (OAVs > 1) based on their measured concentrations in the Yl sample, indicating that the aroma profile of the reconstitution was pretty similar to that of the original sample.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000378584300021	27265519

Nine aldehydes, i.e., octanal, nonanal, citronellal, decanal, trans-citral, cis-citral, perilla aldehyde, dodecanal, and dodecenal, were detected in WPEO. After treatment, the content of citronellal increased, but the concentrations of other aldehydes decreased. The aliphatic aldehydes were transformed to organic acids. Citral was transformed to neric acid, geranic acid, and cyclocitral. Aldehyde transformation caused a remarkable decrease in the minty, herbaceous, and lemon notes of WPEO. In fresh WPEO, beta-myrcene, d-limonene, octanal, decanal, cis-citral, trans-citral, and dodecenal had the highest odor dilution folds. After the treatment, the dilution folds of decanal, cis-citral, trans-citral, and dodecenal decreased dramatically. This result provides information for the production and storage of aldehyde-containing products.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000378584300022	27226192	
J	Chen, Yuan; Zeng, Ying; Luo, Feng; Yuan, Zheming								A New Algorithm to Optimize Maximal Information Coefficient								PLOS ONE				11	6					e0157567	10.1371/journal.pone.0157567			JUN 22 2016	2016	The maximal information coefficient (MIC) captures dependences between paired variables, including both functional and non-functional relationships. In this paper, we develop a new method, ChiMIC, to calculate the MIC values. The ChiMIC algorithm uses the chisquare test to terminate grid optimization and then removes the restriction of maximal grid size limitation of original ApproxMaxMI algorithm. Computational experiments show that ChiMIC algorithm can maintain same MIC values for noiseless functional relationships, but gives much smaller MIC values for independent variables. For noise functional relationship, the ChiMIC algorithm can reach the optimal partition much faster. Furthermore, the MCN values based on MIC calculated by ChiMIC can capture the complexity of functional relationships in a better way, and the statistical powers of MIC calculated by ChiMIC are higher than those calculated by ApproxMaxMI. Moreover, the computational costs of ChiMIC are much less than those of ApproxMaxMI. We apply the MIC values tofeature selection and obtain better classification accuracy using features selected by the MIC values from ChiMIC.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000378212800036	27333001

Task Performance and Meta-Cognitive Outcomes When Using Activity Workstations and Traditional Desks								FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				7						957	10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00957			JUN 21 2016	2016	The purpose of the current study is to compare the effects of light physical activity to sedentary behavior on cognitive task performance and meta-cognitive responses. Thirty-eight undergraduate students participated in the study. The participants used a stationary bicycle with a desk top and a traditional desk while completing two complex cognitive tasks and measures of affect, motivation, morale, and engagement. The participants pedaled the stationary bicycle at a slow pace (similar in exertion to a normal walking pace) while working. The results indicated that cognitive task performance did not change between the two workstations. However, positive affect, motivation, and morale improved when using the stationary bicycle. These results suggest that activity workstations could be implemented in the work place and in educational settings to help decrease sedentary behavior without negatively affecting performance. Furthermore, individuals could experience a positive emotional response when working on activity workstations which in turn could help encourage individuals to choose to be more physical active during daily activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-1078			WOS:000378297300001	27445921

This study reports a mini-cellulase gene tox-1 from Neurospora crassa. The gene tox-1 was cloned in Escherichia coli after chimerization with the YebF gene and substitutions of certain isoleucine and valine with leucine residues. The yeast transformants could grow on rice straw-agar medium. The 44-amino acid peptide and its two mutant variants displayed potent cellulase activities in Congo Red assay and enzymatic assays. Conservative replacements with leucine have substantially increased the stabilities and half-lives of the peptides at alkaline pH and low and high temperatures and also the tolerance to organic solvents and surfactants, on the basis of activities toward cellose. The small size of the mini-cellulase would allow for commercially viable automatic chemical peptide synthesis. This work suggests that conservative leucine replacements may serve as a general strategy in the engineering of more robust enzymes with special features with little loss of activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000378193900006	27229865

In these tests, multiaxial strain field data of the flat specimens were measured by the digital image correlation technique. In addition, the flow stress was measured using an X-ray diffractometer. The flat specimens in three different geometries were tested in order to achieve 1) balanced biaxial strain, and plane strain tests with zero strain in either 2) rolling direction or 3) transverse direction. The multiaxial stress and strain data were processed to obtain plastic work contours with reference to a uniaxial tension test along the rolling direction. The experimental results show that the mechanical behavior of the subjected specimen deviates significantly from isotropic behavior predicted by the von Mises yield criterion. The initial yield loci measured by a Marciniak tester is in good agreement with what is predicted by Hill's yield criterion. However, as deformation increases beyond the von Mises strain of 0.05, the shape of the work contour significantly deviates from that of Hill's yield locus. A prediction made by a viscoplastic self-consistent model is in better agreement with the experimental observation than the Hill yield locus with the isotropic work-hardening rule. However, none of the studied models matched the initial or evolving anisotropic behaviors of the interstitial-free steel measured by the augmented Marciniak experiment.

This method provides uniform deposition of ordered polyaniline nanotubes over the surface of graphene nanosheets. The synthesized graphene-polyaniline nanocomposite has the ability of complete removal of harmful dyes commonly used in industry: such as methyl orange, methylene blue, and rhoadmine B from the waste water under the exposure to natural sunlight. The system can be used as an efficient solar energy operated photocatalyst due to effective suppression of recombination of the charge carriers. The unique spatial structure of the graphene-polyaniline nanocomposite has high chemical stability, can be recycled after photolysis, and allows using in multiple cycles without reduction in its photocatalytic activity. In addition, the graphene-polyaniline nanocomposite exhibits strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption, good photothermal stability, as well as shows substantial thermal energy generation under exposure to 808 or 980 nm NIR lasers. The electrical conductivity of polyaniline nanotubes is improved as a result of their conjugation with graphene nanosheets in the nanocomposite. Owing to its outstanding photocatalytic activity and chemical stability, the reported graphene-polyaniline nanocomposite has a great potential in purification of industrially generated waste water.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Ferromagnetic Nanorods in Applications to Control of the In-Plane Anisotropy of Composite Films and for In Situ Characterization of the Film Rheology								ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS				26	22	SI		3796	3808		10.1002/adfm.201504205			JUN 14 2016	2016	Ferromagnetic nanorods play important roles as active fillers in multifunctional composite films. Many composite films used as inductors and antennae, as recording media, or electromagnetic (EM) filters and polarizers, require the nanorod alignment in a certain direction. The strategy for the in-plane alignment of nanorods has not been established yet. Since the composite assumes a multistep processing when the material rheological properties change in time, in situ characterization of the film is required. Magnetic rotational spectroscopy (MRS) with ferromagnetic nanorods offers flexibility and accuracy providing desired spatial and temporal resolution in characterization of submicron thick films. Herein, recent progress in understanding of the basic physical principles is presented guiding the nanorod alignment in thin films by external magnetic field and characterization of these films by MRS.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000379128700004

Magnetic-Field-Directed Self-Assembly of Programmable Mesoscale Shapes								ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS				26	22	SI		3983	3989		10.1002/adfm.201504749			JUN 14 2016	2016	User-programmed meso-to microscale 2D shapes using magnetic nanoparticles as building blocks with magnetic-field-directed self-assembly are created. The assembly templates are magnetically recorded using perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) media. The results demonstrate that PMR can template user-designed features in two dimensions down to 30 nm in size, i.e., the nanoparticle diameter. It has been also shown that the nanoparticles assemble onto transitions between oppositely magnetized regions in the medium. At these transitions, the magnetic field gradients are extremely large (25 MT m(-1) 2 nm above the medium) and change rapidly with height (approximate to 10(15) T/m/m within 20 nm of the surface). It is found that 30 nm diameter particles assemble into 1-2 layers with feature widths ranging from 30 to 350 nm. It is hypothesized that large lateral growth can occur because the magnetic forces parallel to the disk extend up to 150 nm on either side of a recorded transition, falling off more slowly with distance than the vertical magnetic forces. Once lateral growth saturates, a second layer of nanoparticles begins to assemble on top of the first layer, suggesting strong potential for controlling layer-by-layer assembly through appropriate design of the medium and its resulting field gradient profiles.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000379128700016

The separation is based on cell size difference, and conducted in a custom-made biocompatible ferrofluid that retains the viability of cells during and after the assay for downstream analysis. The scheme offers moderate-throughput (approximate to 10(6) cells h(-1) for a single channel device) and extremely high recovery rate (>99%) without the use of any label. It is envisioned that this separation scheme will have clinical applications in settings where rapid cell enrichment and removal of contaminating blood will improve efficiency of screening and diagnosis such as cervical cancer screening based on mixed populations in exfoliated samples.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000379128700017	27478429

Stover Composition in Maize and Sorghum Reveals Remarkable Genetic Variation and Plasticity for Carbohydrate Accumulation								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				7						822	10.3389/fpls.2016.00822			JUN 8 2016	2016	Carbohydrates stored in vegetative organs, particularly stems, of grasses are a very important source of energy. We examined carbohydrate accumulation in adult sorghum and maize hybrids with distinct phenology and different end uses (grain, silage, sucrose or sweetness in stalk juice, and biomass). Remarkable variation was observed for nonstructural carbohydrates and structural polysaccharides during three key developmental stages both between and within hybrids developed for distinct end use in both species. At the onset of the reproductive phase (average 65 days after planting, DAP), a wide range for accumulation of non-structural carbohydrates (free glucose and sucrose combined), was observed in internodes of maize (11-24%) and sorghum (7-36%) indicating substantial variation for transient storage of excess photosynthate during periods of low grain or vegetative sink strength. Remobilization of these reserves for supporting grain fill or vegetative growth was evident from lower amounts in maize (8-19%) and sorghum (9-27%) near the end of the reproductive period (average 95 DAP). At physiological maturity of grain hybrids (average 120 DAP), amounts of these carbohydrates were generally unchanged in maize (9-21%) and sorghum (16-27%) suggesting a loss of photosynthetic assimilation due to weakening sink demand. Nonetheless, high amounts of non-structural carbohydrates at maturity even in grain maize and sorghum (15-18%) highlight the potential for developing dual-purpose (grain/stover) crops. For both species, the amounts of structural polysaccharides in the cell wall, measured as monomeric components (glucose and pentose), decreased during grain fill but remained unchanged thereafter with maize biomass possessing slightly higher amounts than sorghum. Availability of carbohydrates in maize and sorghum highlights the potential for developing energy-rich dedicated biofuel or dual-purpose (grain/stover) crops.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-462X			WOS:000377259500001	27375668

Conceptual Demonstration of Ambient Desorption-Optical Emission Spectroscopy Using a Liquid Sampling-Atmospheric Pressure Glow Discharge Microplasma Source								ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				88	11			5579	5584		10.1021/acs.analchem.6b00751			JUN 7 2016	2016	The concept of ambient desorption-optical emission spectroscopy (AD-OES) is demonstrated using a liquid sampling atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) microplasma as the desorption/excitation source. The LS-APGD has previously been employed for elemental analysis of solution samples and particulates introduced via laser ablation in both the optical emission and mass spectrometries (OES, MS) modes. In addition, the device has been shown to be effective for the analysis of elemental and molecular species operating in an ambient desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (ADI-MS) mode. Proof-of-concept is presented here in the use of the LS-APGD to volatilize three very diverse sample forms (metallic thin films, dry solution residues, and bulk materials), with the liberated material excited within the microplasma and detected via OES, i.e., AD-OES. While the demonstration is principally qualitative at this point, it is believed that the basic approach may find application across a broad spectrum of analytical challenges requiring elemental analysis, including metals, soils, and volume-limited solutions, analogous to what has been seen in the development of the field of ADI-MS for molecular species determinations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000377631000004	27175512

X-ray single crystal structure analysis reveals that the material crystallizes in the acentric orthorhombic space group of P2(1)2(1)2(1) (no. 19), Z = 4. The structure exhibits a one-dimensional feature, with [MnO4](infinity) chains propagating along the a axis, which are interconnected by VO4 tetrahedra. Raman and infrared spectra were obtained to identify the fundamental vanadate and hydroxide vibrational modes. Magnetization data reveal a broad maximum at approximately 80 K, arising from one-dimensional magnetic correlations with intrachain exchange constant of J/k(B) = 9.97(3) K between nearest Mn neighbors and a canted antiferromagnetic behavior below T-N = 30 K. Single crystal neutron diffraction at 4 K yielded a magnetic structure solution in the lower symmetry of the magnetic space group P2(1) with two unique chains displaying antiferromagnetically ordered Mn moments oriented nearly perpendicular to the chain axis. The presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya antisymmetric exchange interaction leads to a slight canting of the spins and gives rise to a weak ferromagnetic component along the chain direction.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000377299700007

Late Quaternary development of the Croatan Beach Ridge Complex, Bogue Sound, Bogue Banks, NC, USA and implications for coastal evolution								ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE				174				49	64		10.1016/j.ecss.2016.03.016			JUN 5 2016	2016	Foraminiferal, sedimentological, geophysical, and geochronologic data were utilized to elucidate the late Quaternary geologic development of the Croatan Beach Ridge Complex (CBRC), Bogue Sound, and Bogue Banks, North Carolina, USA. The CBRC is a relict beach ridge feature located on the mainland. It is separated from the modern barrier island, Bogue Banks, by Bogue Sound. Seventeen cores along shore normal and shore-parallel transects provided material for sedimentologic and foraminiferal analysis and resulted in the recognition of seven depositional facies representing a variety of coastal depositional environments.Chronologic and depositional fades data suggest the CBRC was initiated during MIS 5a and rapid southward progradation produced a cape structure. Eolian reactivation of the upper sand of the CBRC occurred during the last glacial maximum (similar to 18 ka). The age of flood tide delta deposits in Bogue Sound suggests that the Holocene barrier island, Bogue Banks, had formed by similar to 6 ka. Shoreface ravinement resulted in a shoreface landward of the present shoreline by similar to 3.5 ka. Seaward and westward spit pro gradation of Bogue Banks began similar to 1.7 ka and continued to similar to 13 ka. Normal marine salinity conditions were present in Bogue Sound similar to 1.1 ka, suggesting removal of at least the narrowest parts of the barrier island, coeval with a previously documented segmentation of the southern Outer Banks barrier islands. Previous work has linked this segmentation to climate warming and increased tropical storm activity during the Medieval Climate Anomaly.This study illustrates the complex response of this coastal system to Pleistocene and Holocene sea level and climate change over two major sea-level cycles. In particular, the regional geomorphology during MIS5a and the Holocene sea-level highstand differ significantly and this, in large part, was controlled by the antecedent geologic framework, resulted in the contrasting more localized coastal geomorphic response.

In this work, the catalytic oxidation of As(III) to As(V) in an iron(III)/sulfite system and the removal of As(V) under visible light using sunlight or a light-emitting diode lamp were investigated. Our results show a significant enhancement of efficiency of As(III) oxidation at near-neutral pH, whereas 93% of As(III) was removed from solution by centrifugal treatment after 30min of irradiation. Mechanism investigations revealed that the pathways of As(III) oxidation at circumneutral pH involved free radicals (mainly HO center dot, SO4-center dot and SO5-center dot) and ligand-to-metal charge transfer between As(III) and colloidal ferric hydroxide particles. Sequential addition of sulfite could improve the oxidation efficiency for water having high concentrations of As(III) (i.e., 66.7 mu M). These results clearly show that the visible light/iron(III)/sulfite system significantly enhances As(III) oxidation. This finding may have promising implications in developing a new cost-effective technology for the treatment of arsenic-containing water using sunlight. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this report, we present synthetic pathways to a variety of SF5CF2-substituted compounds starting from vinyl ethers and SF5CF2C(O)Cl. In specific chemical environments and under particular reaction conditions, the SF5CF2 moiety is unstable in downstream products resulting in the elimination of the SF5- anion and its decomposition to SF4 and F-. Surprisingly, the formed F- can attack the intermediate difluorovinyl moiety to form trifluoromethyl substituted products. This appears to happen when an intermediate neighboring group participation involving a double bond is possible. Under slightly different conditions, the reaction stops at the stage of a difluorovinyl compound.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3263			WOS:000377319500004	27159371	
J	French, Jeffrey A.; Frye, Brett; Cavanaugh, Jon; Ren, Dongren; Mustoe, Aaryn C.; Rapaport, Lisa; Mickelberg, Jennifer								Gene changes may minimize masculinizing and defeminizing influences of exposure to male cotwins in female callitrichine primates								BIOLOGY OF SEX DIFFERENCES				7						28	10.1186/s13293-016-0081-y			JUN 2 2016	2016	Background: Sexual differentiation in female mammals can be altered by the proximity of male littermates in utero, a phenomenon known as the intrauterine position effect (IUP). Among simian primates, callitrichines (marmosets and tamarins) are likely candidates for IUP, since they exhibit obligate dizygotic twinning and fetuses share extensive vascularization in utero. In this paper, we determined whether female reproductive parameters are altered by gestating with a male twin and evaluated changes in genes associated with anti-Mullerian and steroid hormones in twinning callitrichine primates.Methods: We assessed the impact of gestation with male cotwins on reproductive performance and survivorship in female marmosets (Callithrix) and lion tamarins (Leontopithecus), contrasting measures for females gestated with one or more littermates (M+) or no male littermates (0M). We compared targeted coding regions for genes involved in steroidal and anti-Mullerian hormone mediation of sexual differentiation for representatives of twinning callitrichines (Callithrix, Saguinus, and Leontopithecus) with closely related New World primates that produce single births (Saimiri and Callimico).Results: IUP effects in females were absent in female callitrichine primates: age at first ovulation, average litter size, and the proportion of stillborn infants, and lifetime survivorship did not differ between M+ and 0M females. We documented multiple nonsynonymous substitutions in genes associated with steroid synthesis, transport, and cellular action (SRD5A2, CYP19A1, SHBG, and AR) and with anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH and AMHR2) in callitrichines. In the only callitrichine to produce single infants (Callimico), two genes contained nonsynonymous substitutions relative to twinning callitrichines (CYP19A1 and AMRHR2); these substitutions were identical with nontwinning Saimiri and humans, suggesting a reversion to an ancestral sequence.Conclusions: In spite of a shared placental vasculature with opposite-sex twins throughout embryonic and fetal development, female callitrichine primates gestated with a male cotwin exhibit no decrement in reproductive performance relative to females gestated with female cotwins. Hence, IUP effects on female reproduction in callitrichines are modest. We have identified mutations in candidate genes relevant for steroid hormone signaling and metabolism, and especially in AMH-related genes, that are likely to alter protein structure and function in the callitrichines. These mutations may confer protection for females from the masculinizing and defeminizing influences of gestating with a male cotwin.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2042-6410			WOS:000377154000002	27257473

Most of these tests consist of a careful measurement of the loss of interference due to decoherence. Here we consider, instead, the spread in position of a freely falling nanosphere. We study in depth the dependence of this spread on self-gravity in the presence of decoherence (exotic and nonexotic). We show that the influence of self-gravity is robust in the presence of weak decoherence, and quantify this robustness by introducing a parameter, the critical decoherence, aimed at estimating the critical value above which self-gravity is overwhelmed by decoherence. We also emphasize the crucial role played by the spread of the initial wave packet for the sensitivity of free-fall experiments to decoherence.									3	0	0	1	0	3			2469-9926	2469-9934		WOS:000376991500002		
J	Irisarri, Patricia; Zhebentyayeva, Tetyana; Errea, Pilar; Pina, Ana								Differential expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) genes implies distinct roles in development of graft incompatibility symptoms in Prunus								SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE				204				16	24		10.1016/j.scienta.2016.03.025			JUN 2 2016	2016	Biosynthesis of phenolic compounds occurs via the phenylpropanoid pathway, in which the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) acts as a key-control enzyme. In this study, two apricot PAL genes (ParPAL1 and ParPAL2) were isolated and characterized by screening an apricot genome library. The two full-length cDNAs encoding both isoforms were isolated using RACE-PCR. Amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis showed that apricot PALS were highly homologous with their orthologues in other plants. The expression patterns of the two genes were investigated in developing callus unions with different degree of compatibility at two time points after grafting (10 and 21 DAG). The results indicated that ParPAL1 and ParPAL2 transcripts were differentially expressed between compatible and incompatible unions throughout graft development. ParPAL1 transcripts were 3- fold more abundant in incompatible unions than those of compatible one at 10 and 21 DAG, whereas ParPAL2 transcripts were induced in graft incompatible unions at 21 DAG. The comparison of the level of the two transcripts between various tissues (bark, leaves and callus tissue) showed that ParPAL1 transcripts were 3-fold more abundant that those of ParPAL2 in callus tissue, suggesting the involvement of ParPAL1 in the synthesis of flavonoids.

Soft Robots and Kangaroo Tails: Modulating Compliance in Continuum Structures Through Mechanical Layer Jamming								SOFT ROBOTICS				3	2			54	63		10.1089/soro.2015.0021			JUN 2016	2016	We present a new approach to creating biologically inspired, variable compliance continuum robot sections. Variable compliance is used to great effect in natural continuum structures, such as the arms of octopuses and the tails of kangaroos. We introduce a new approach to variable compliance robots based on mechanical layer jamming. The new design actively tightens and loosens mesh coverings of interleaved surface layers. This mechanical approach to layer jamming avoids problems arising from previously proposed pressure (pneumatic)based layer jamming implementations. Experiments using a prototype of the new design demonstrate the potential of the approach to produce novel soft and compliant robots.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-5172	2169-5180		WOS:000394506400003

J	Britt, Thomas W.; Shen, Winny; Sinclair, Robert R.; Grossman, Matthew R.; Klieger, David M.								How Much Do We Really Know About Employee Resilience?								INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY-PERSPECTIVES ON SCIENCE AND PRACTICE				9	2			378	404		10.1017/iop.2015.107			JUN 2016	2016	Past research purporting to study employee resilience suffers from a lack of conceptual clarity about both the resilience construct and the methodological designs that examine resilience without ensuring the occurrence of significant adversity. The overall goal of this article is to address our contemporary understanding of employee resilience and identify pathways for the future advancement of resilience research in the workplace. We first address conceptual definitions of resilience both inside and outside of industrial and organizational psychology and make the case that researchers have generally failed to document the experience of significant adversity when studying resilience in working populations. Next, we discuss methods used to examine resilience, with an emphasis on distinguishing the capacity for resilience and the demonstration of resilience. Representative research is then reviewed by examining self-reports of resilience or resilience-related traits along with research on resilient and nonresilient trajectories following significant adversity. We then briefly address the issues involved in selecting resilient employees and building resilience in employees. The article concludes with recommendations for future research studying resilience in the workplace, including documenting significant adversity among employees, assessing multiple outcomes, using longitudinal designs with theoretically supported time lags, broadening the study of resilience to people in occupations outside the military who may face significant adversity, and addressing the potential dark side of an emphasis on resilience.									19	0	0	0	0	19			1754-9426	1754-9434		WOS:000382880800025

The probe was made by sealing a borosilicate glass microsphere into a thin-wall glass capillary pigtailed with a multimode optical fiber. The intensities of the resonant peaks were found decreasing exponentially (linearly in a log scale) with the increasing refractive index of the medium surrounding the capillary. The sensing capability of the integrated probe was tested using sucrose solutions of different concentrations and the resolution was estimated to be about 2.5 x 10(-5) in the index range of 1.3458 to 1.3847. The integrated sensor probe may prove useful in many chemical and biological sensing applications where highly sensitive refractive index monitoring is needed.

The objective is to create a fuzzy inference system (FIS) that is robust enough to operate in a multitude of vehicle conditions (load, tire wear, alignment), and road conditions while at the same time providing optimal vehicle stability by detecting and minimizing loss of traction. In this approach, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is generated using previously collected data to train and optimize the performance of the fuzzy logic VSC algorithm. This paper outlines the FIS detection algorithm and its benefits over a model-based approach. The performance of the FIS-based VSC is evaluated via a co-simulation of MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim model of the vehicle under various road and load conditions. The results showed that the proposed algorithm is capable of accurately indicating unstable vehicle behavior for two different types of vehicles (SUV and Sedan). The algorithm can do this without any significant parameter adjustment, illustrating its robustness against the considered uncertainty.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1946-3995	1946-4002		WOS:000383620800038

Breaking the spell of differentiated instruction through equity pedagogy and teacher community								CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION				11	2			335	347		10.1007/s11422-016-9766-0			JUN 2016	2016	Koomen's study of Wizard-an articulate, inquisitive, energetic seventh grader with a penchant for science-adversely juxtaposed his learning-centered identity with classroom experiences that marginalized him. I claim in my response that critical commentary about Wizard's race is germane to any analysis of his experiences, as participation in an inclusive science classroom can be conceptualized as a racialized form of experience. My paper contributes a counternarrative to deficit normalizations of African American children-including students identified with exceptionalities-by rendering the inequities of differentiated instruction visible and theorizing about how this approach restricted Wizard's learning and participation by positioning him as low status and less competent. I discuss four reasons why the strategy of differentiated instruction is ideologically opposed to goals for equitable classrooms and argue that this model invites reproductions of status orderings from the larger society into the classroom. I conclude with recommendations for an equity pedagogy through Complex Instruction developed inside teacher community as a viable alternative for this work.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1871-1502	1871-1510		WOS:000387959400008

In this study, we report the first time engineering of these novel nano 2D-materials as efficient spacer layer components in silver (Ag) based thin-film stacks that generated up to 17-fold enhancement in the emission intensity of rhodamine B (RhB) fluorophore molecules; based on the surface plasmon coupled emission (SPCE) platform. The exceptional mechanical, thermal, and chemical stability of these 2D-spacer layers enabled effective surface passivation of Ag thin-films. The superior signal enhancements observed from the different 2D-spacer substrates may be attributed to optimal changes in radiative decay rates of excited RhB states. In a manner not reported before, we demonstrate the tunability of SPCE signal enhancements, on choosing spacer materials of appropriate refractive index. In this work, we further present a detailed comparison between MoS2/WS2/BN, and also nanocarbon allotropes like graphene and C-60, which we have previously reported as high-performance spacers in biosensing applications. The low-cost fabrication of Ag-(MoS2/WS2/BN) thin- film architectures, synergistically coupled with superior fluorescence signals produced by SPCE, promises the application of these portable platforms for the detection of various biochemical analytes with very high levels of sensitivity.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2379-3694			WOS:000385464800028

We demonstrate the first viable approach for estimating legislator-specific scores from the entire speech corpus of a legislature, while also producing extensive information about the evolution of speech polarization and politically loaded language. In the Irish Dail, we show that the dominant dimension of speech variation is government-opposition, with ministers more extreme on this dimension than backbenchers, and a second dimension distinguishing between the establishment and anti-establishment opposition parties. In the U.S. Senate, we estimate a dimension that has moderate within-party correlations with scales based on roll-call votes and campaign donation patterns; however, we observe greater overlap across parties in speech positions than roll-call positions and partisan polarization in speeches varies more clearly in response to major political events.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1047-1987	1476-4989		WOS:000385853500005

A variety of graded and aligned microstructures were formed by applying external static magnetic fields oriented radially, axially, and transversely with respect to the solidification direction of freezing slurries containing micro/nanoparticles of ZrO2 and Fe3O4. The graded structures, formed by the radial and axial fields, resemble core-shell architectures composed of dense outer perimeters surrounding porous inner cores. The aligned structures, formed by transverse fields, exhibit two modes of microstructural alignment: lamellar walls aligned by the growing ice crystals and mineral bridges aligned by the magnetic fields. The alignment of mineral bridges that connect adjacent lamellae, provide these scaffolds enhanced strength and stiffness when compressed parallel to their orientation (parallel to the direction of the magnetic field).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000384993000016		
J	Sun, Heshan; Fang, Yulin; Zou, Haiyun (Melody)								Choosing a Fit Technology: Understanding Mindfulness in Technology Adoption and Continuance								JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS				17	6			377	412					JUN 2016	2016	Mindfulness is an important emerging concept in society. This research posits that a user's mindful state when adopting a technology is a crucial factor that determines how the technology will fit the task context at the post-adoption stage and, thus, has profound influence on user adoption and continued use of technology. Based on the mindfulness literature, we conceive of a new concept (mindfulness of technology adoption (MTA)) as a multi-faceted reflective high-order factor. We develop a MTA-TTF (task-technology fit) framework and integrate it into the cognitive change model to develop a research model that delineates the mechanisms through which MTA influences user adoption and continued use of technology. We examined the model via a longitudinal study of students' use of wiki systems. The results suggest that mindful adopters will more likely perceive a technology as useful and choose a technology that turns out to fit their tasks. Hence, mindful adopters are likely to have high disconfirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction at the post-adoption stage. The findings have significant implications for IS research and practices.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1536-9323	1558-3457		WOS:000384930300001		
J	Zhu, Qilun; Prucka, Robert; Wang, Shu; Prucka, Michael; Dourra, Hussein								Model-Based Optimal Combustion Phasing Control Strategy for Spark Ignition Engines								SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINES				9	2			1170	1179		10.4271/2016-01-0818			JUN 2016	2016	Combustion phasing of Spark Ignition (SI) engines is traditionally regulated with map-based spark timing (SPKT) control. The calibration time and effort of this feed forward SPKT control strategy becomes less favorable as the number of engine control actuators increases. This paper proposes a model based combustion phasing control frame work. The feed forward control law is obtained by real time numerical optimization utilizing a high-fidelity combustion model that is based on flame entrainment theory. An optimization routine identifies the SPKT which phases the combustion close to the target without violating combustion constraints of knock and excessive cycle-by-cycle covariance of indicated mean effective pressure (COV of IMEP). Cylinder pressure sensors are utilized to enable feedback control of combustion phasing. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is applied to reject sensor noise and combustion variation from the cylinder pressure signal. The proposed combustion phasing frame work is validated with real-time dynamometer tests using a rapid-prototype engine control system. Test results indicate the SPKT control system is able to track the combustion phasing target (CA50) with a RMSE of 3.8 crank angle degrees without violating combustion constraints under both steady state and transient operating conditions. Furthermore, the successful execution of this SPKT control strategy using a rapid-prototype engine controller demonstrates the computational efficiency of the proposed system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1946-3936	1946-3944		WOS:000384710600039		
J	Wang, Shu; Prucka, Robert; Zhu, Qilun; Prucka, Michael; Dourra, Hussein								A Real-Time Model for Spark Ignition Engine Combustion Phasing Prediction								SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINES				9	2			1180	1190		10.4271/2016-01-0819			JUN 2016	2016	As engines are equipped with an increased number of control actuators to meet fuel economy targets they become more difficult to control and calibrate. The large number of control actuators encourages the investigation of physics-based control strategies to reduce calibration time and complexity. Of particular interest is spark timing control and calibration since it has a significant influence on engine efficiency, emissions, vibration and durability. Spark timing determination to achieve a desired combustion phasing is currently an empirical process that occurs during the calibration phase of engine development. This process utilizes a large number of stored surfaces and corrections to account for the wide range of operating environments and conditions that a given engine will experience. An obstacle to realizing feedforward physics-based combustion phasing control is the requirement for an accurate and fast combustion model. In this research, a quasi-dimensional turbulent flame entrainment combustion model for the purpose of real-time combustion phasing prediction is proposed. The proposed algorithm utilizes existing engine sensors and calculates combustion phasing from a physics based model in real-time. Transient engine dynamometer results using a rapid-prototype engine controller demonstrate a prediction accuracy for the location of fifty percent mass fraction burned (CA50) within 3.6 crank angle degrees.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1946-3936	1946-3944		WOS:000384710600040

We obtained the simultaneous coherent beam combining and single transverse mode operation on a single chip through the integrated coupling regions and the transverse Bragg resonance (TBR) gratings, respectively. The proposed combining method can be easily extended to a zigzag-like laser array. We analyzed the scalability of the zigzag-like combining structure and compared it with other coherent combining methods. Two and six angled-grating broad-area lasers are fabricated and coherently combined by use of the proposed method. The high contrast interference fringes within an overall single lobe envelope in the measured far field prove that the emitters in the array are indeed coherently combined. By p-side-down bonding, we obtained over 1 Woutput power with over 90% combining efficiency in the two coherently combined lasers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-2759	2095-2767		WOS:000383202200016

Pleistocene benthic foraminifers in the Arctic Ocean: Implications for sea-ice and circulation history								MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY				126				19	30		10.1016/j.marmicro.2016.04.004			JUN 2016	2016	Three sediment cores from the Northwind, Mendeleev, and Lomonosov Ridges distributed across the western Arctic Ocean were investigated for foraminiferal composition with a focus on benthic assemblages. This investigation provides insights into middle to late Pleistocene history of paleoceanographic and sea-ice conditions on multi-millennial time scales. Calcareous foraminiferal abundances and assemblage composition show stratigraphically consistent development, including glacial-interglacial variability and long-term evolution of foraminiferal assemblages. Major long-term changes occurred at the end of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (estimated ca. 0.7-0.8 Ma) and later near the bottom of Marine Isotope Stage 7 (ca. 0.25 Ma) and near the top of MIS 5 (ca. 0.1 Ma). These changes include notably a diminishing role of phytodetritus-related species, such as Epistominella exigua, at the expense of oligotrophic species adapted to live under persistent sea ice, presumably indicating an overall expansion of year-round ice cover in the Arctic during the Pleistocene. The pronounced MPT shift from mostly seasonal to perennial sea ice was coeval, and possibly related to a growth of North American ice sheets and the beginning of glacially-controlled sedimentation in the western Arctic Ocean. The ca. 0.25 Ma transition, interpreted as another step in sea-ice expansion, also co-occurs with signs of ice-sheet expansion in both North America and, especially, Eurasia. The apparent synchronicity of major steps in sea-ice and glaciation histories necessitates a more in-depth investigation of feedbacks involved and broader linkages beyond the Arctic region. The ca. 0.1 Ma change in foraminiferal assemblages marks a consistent stratigraphic event, expressed notably in a proliferation of the cosmopolitan species Oridorsalis tener, although its paleoenvironmental significance is not yet fully understood.

A cloud-based spatial-temporal inventory for sustainable urban soil management								URBAN ECOSYSTEMS				19	2			811	822		10.1007/s11252-015-0512-2			JUN 2016	2016	Spatial and temporal databases that integrate urban tree inventories and soil quality information are needed for modern-day sustainable urban forest management. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of low-cost and widely-available technology, such as global positioning system (GPS)-enabled cameras to photo-document sites and cloud-based products and services (Google Picasa and Fusion Tables), to aid in developing sustainable street tree management programs. Google Fusion Tables provide a cloud platform to store, share and map urban tree and soil data over time using internet connected computers, tablets or mobile devices. Although indicators of urban soil quality and best methods to assess it are not yet standardized, we demonstrate here promising indicators that are both useful and easy to incorporate into spatial and temporal databases of trees managed in urban environments. By utilizing technology, we demonstrate that site-specific urban soil quality indicators can be used together with readily-available soil rating systems specific to different plant types as a means to better evaluate and manage conditions for optimal street tree growth and health.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1083-8155	1573-1642		WOS:000382671000018

The effects of transportation hazards on shelf life of packaged potato chips								FOOD PACKAGING AND SHELF LIFE				8				9	13		10.1016/j.fpsl.2016.02.003			JUN 2016	2016	Kettle cooked potato chips packaged inside metallized oriented polypropylene bags were used to evaluate the effects of simulated transportation on shelf life. While shelf life testing provides accurate results for shelf dating, the research project assessed whether or not subjecting packaged products to known transportation hazards can increase or accelerate the deteriorative factors that affect the shelf life of a produce. By stressing the packages through laboratory simulated transportation hazards, it created failures to the packages that would not have normally shown up during a traditional test protocol, such as accelerated shelf life testing (ASLT). Results showed packages evaluated through a simulated transport test reported an average oxygen transmission rate three times greater than samples having not been transport tested. Outcomes from this study showed the rate at which some properties of the food and package can increase as a result of the simulated transportation, versus standard ASLT with only increased temperature and humidity. Differences of significance were observed between the simulated transportation and the standard ASLT samples when comparing headspace composition, moisture content, and TBA testing (P < 0.05).

The engineered Ag-CNT SPCE substrates enabled the realization of up to similar to 10-fold enhancement in fluorescence signal intensity, of the rhodamine b dye. This study addresses the issue that, while many of the biochemical sensing strategies are based on fluorescence, they are all fundamentally limited by the isotropic nature of the phenomenon that results in low signal collection efficiency (<1%). Pursuant to the aim of realizing superior levels of signal sensitivity, we previously reported graphene and C-60 as novel spacer materials, and similarly project CNTs in this study as 'active' contributors for the amplification of fluorescence signals on the SPCE platform that generates highly directional emission, with very high signal to noise ratios and >50% signal collection efficiency. Considering the easy functionalization of these carbon nano-allotropes, and their high sensitivity; the economical Ag-CNT SPCE platforms can be effectively extended towards sensing applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2053-1591			WOS:000380799600035

Small HSPs (sHSPs) belong to the most ubiquitous HSP subgroup with molecular weights ranging from 12 to 42 kDa. We have cloned a new sHSP gene, AsHSP17 from creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) and studied its role in plant response to environmental stress. AsHSP17 encodes a protein of 17 kDa. Its expression was strongly induced by heat in both leaf and root tissues, and by salt and abscisic acid (ABA) in roots. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing AsHSP17 exhibited enhanced sensitivity to heat and salt stress accompanied by reduced leaf chlorophyll content and decreased photosynthesis under both normal and stressed conditions compared to wild type. Overexpression of AsHSP17 also led to hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA and salinity during germination and post-germinative growth. Gene expression analysis indicated that AsHSP17 modulates expression of photosynthesis-related genes and regulates ABA biosynthesis, metabolism and ABA signalling as well as ABA-independent stress signalling. Our results suggest that AsHSP17 may function as a protein chaperone to negatively regulate plant responses to adverse environmental stresses through modulating photosynthesis and ABA-dependent and independent signalling pathways.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000381495500013	26610288

In order to better apply CBE as an anti-AD agent efficiently, we sought to deterrmine whether preventive or therapeutic effect contributes more prominently toward CBE's anti-AD activity. As the level of A beta toxicity and memory health are two major pathological parameters in AD, in the present study, we compared the effects of CBE on A beta toxicity and memory health in the C. elegans AD model treated with preventive and therapeutic protocols. Our results revealed that CBE prominently showed the preventive efficacy, providing a basis for further investigation of these effects in mammals.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-6975	1875-5364		WOS:000380757400005	27473960	
J	Khamkanya, Anintaya; Cho, Byung Rae; Goethals, Paul L.								Integrating Customer Perception into Process Capability Measures								QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL				32	4			1331	1345		10.1002/qre.1833			JUN 2016	2016	Process capability indices provide a measure of the output of an in-control process that conforms to a set of specification limits. These measures, which assume that process output is approximately normally distributed, are intended for measuring process capability for manufacturing systems. When the performance of a system results in a product that fails to fall within a given specification range, however, the product is typically scrapped or reworked, and the actual distribution that the customer perceives after inspection is truncated. In this paper, the concept of a truncated measure for three types of quality characteristics is introduced as the key to linking customer perception to process capability. Subsequently, a set of customer-perceived process capability indices is presented as an extension of traditional manufacturer-based counterparts. Finally, data transformation-based process capability indices are also discussed. A comparative study and numerical example reveal considerable differences among the traditional and proposed process capability indices. It is believed that the proposed process capability index for various quality characteristics may more aptly lead to process improvement by facilitating a better understanding of the integrated effects found in engineering design problems.

Numerical experiments are conducted with a wind-forced isopycnal channel model. It is shown that, the eGM closure with eddy diffusivities derived from a high-resolution reference solution produces the best results compared to the reference solution in terms of the thickness, PV profiles and volume fluxes. The use of spatially varying eddy diffusivities also removes the unphysical reverse jets near the channel walls shown by the eGM with constant eddy diffusivities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Macauley, Matthew								Morphisms and Order Ideals of Toric Posets								MATHEMATICS				4	2					39	10.3390/math4020039			JUN 2016	2016	Toric posets are in some sense a natural cyclic version of finite posets in that they capture the fundamental features of a partial order but without the notion of minimal or maximal elements. They can be thought of combinatorially as equivalence classes of acyclic orientations under the equivalence relation generated by converting sources into sinks, or geometrically as chambers of toric graphic hyperplane arrangements. In this paper, we define toric intervals and toric order-preserving maps, which lead to toric analogues of poset morphisms and order ideals. We develop this theory, discuss some fundamental differences between the toric and ordinary cases, and outline some areas for future research. Additionally, we provide a connection to cyclic reducibility and conjugacy in Coxeter groups.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2227-7390			WOS:000380042600019

Hammon's hiring provided an impetus to examine how Twitter opened avenues for discussions around gender in sport culture to generate and permeate. Using Radian6 social media extraction software a sample of 1,434 tweets were obtained. A thematic analysis was conducted and revealed three themes: (a) opening the space for conversation; (b) offering evidence of sport cultural change; and (c) expressing resistance to sport cultural change. The results suggest that Twitter functions as a space where aspects of sport culture are disseminated and contested in ways that transcend traditional media's treatment of these topics. As people share content that is personally meaningful and relevant and participate in shared conversations about sport cultural issues, it invites them to engage in active citizenry through joining in these discussions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0741-1235	1543-2785		WOS:000380100000002

Six chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) (trnT(UGU)-trnL(UAA) 5'exon, trnL(UAA) 5'exon-3'exon, trnL(UAA) 3'exon-trnF(GAA), trnH(GUG)-trnK(UUU), psbC-trnS and rps12-rpl20) and five mitochondrial DNA regions (rrn5/rrn18-2, nad1/2-3, nad4/3-4, nad7/1-2 and nad7/2-3) were employed to investigate the nucleotide diversity and subspecies differentiation. The results showed that T. rupestris had high nucleotide diversity at the species level, and T. rupestris var. ciliate possessed higher levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity than did T rupestris var. rupestris. Cytoplasmic DNA revealed a phylogenetic pattern of individuals that was in disagreement with the patterns obtained from nuclear DNA. These results primarily reflect the past habitat fragmentation of the species and different modes of inheritance and spread of these genomes. Together, our results advance our understanding of plant speciation in this region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0305-1978	1873-2925		WOS:000379281300029

Multiscale approach for the construction of equilibrated all-atom models of a poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogel								BIOINTERPHASES				11	2					021002	10.1116/1.4944829			JUN 2016	2016	A multiscale modeling approach is presented for the efficient construction of an equilibrated allatom model of a cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogel using the all-atom polymer consistent force field (PCFF). The final equilibrated all-atom model was built with a systematic simulation toolset consisting of three consecutive parts: (1) building a global cross-linked PEG-chain network at experimentally determined cross-link density using an on-lattice Monte Carlo method based on the bond fluctuation model, (2) recovering the local molecular structure of the network by transitioning from the lattice model to an off-lattice coarse-grained (CG) model parameterized from PCFF, followed by equilibration using high performance molecular dynamics methods, and (3) recovering the atomistic structure of the network by reverse mapping from the equilibrated CG structure, hydrating the structure with explicitly represented water, followed by final equilibration using PCFF parameterization. The developed three-stage modeling approach has application to a wide range of other complex macromolecular hydrogel systems, including the integration of peptide, protein, and/or drug molecules as side-chains within the hydrogel network for the incorporation of bioactivity for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery applications.

Due to large amounts of claims submitted, estimated at 5 billion per day, review of individual claims or providers is a difficult task. This encourages the employment of automated pre-payment controls and better post-payment decision support tools to enable subject matter expert analysis. This paper presents how to apply unsupervised outlier techniques at post-payment stage to detect fraudulent patterns of received insurance claims. A special emphasis in this paper is put on the system architecture, the metrics designed for outlier detection and the flagging of suspicious providers which may support the fraud experts in evaluating providers and reveal fraud. The algorithms were tested on Medicaid data encompassing 650,000 health-care claims and 369 dentists of one state. Two health care fraud experts evaluated flagged cases and concluded that 12 of the top 17 providers (71%) submitted suspicious claim patterns and should be referred to officials for further investigation. The remaining 5 providers (29%) could be considered mis-classifications as their patterns could be explained by special characteristics of the provider. Selecting top flagged providers is demonstrated to be a valuable as an, targeting method, and individual provider analysis revealed some cases of potential fraud. The study concludes that, through outlier detection, new patterns Of potential fraud can be identified and possibly utilized in future automated detection mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Employing stakeholder identification and salience theory, we posit that institutional ownership positively influences corporate philanthropy, which varies for different types of institutional investors. We further argue that institutional ownership's influence is stronger when philanthropy is aligned with firm goals. Using data from Chinese publicly listed firms, we find a positive effect of institutional ownership on philanthropy, and this effect is stronger for domestic institutional owners when compared to foreign institutional owners, and long-term when compared to short-term institutional owners. We also find that the positive influence of institutional ownership is stronger in private firms and in regions with low institutional development - situations characterizing high alignment between philanthropy and firm goals. Our findings highlight the important role of institutional investors on corporate philanthropy decisions, which have implications for scholars studying and policy makers enacting corporate governance in emerging economies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1740-8776	1740-8784		WOS:000379753600008		
J	Mueller, Jim; Booth, J. Greg								Managing Excessive Methanogenesis During ERD/ISCR Remedial Action								REMEDIATION-THE JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP COSTS TECHNOLOGIES & TECHNIQUES				26	3			53	71		10.1002/rem.21469			SUM 2016	2016	Excessive production of methane has been observed at some remediation sites following the addition of organic hydrogen donors such as (emulsified) oils/lecithin, sugars, and conventional carbon +zero-valent iron (ZVI) amendments. This is due to the fact that methanogens are commonly the most ubiquitous indigenous microbes in anoxic aquifer settings, and, under enriched environmental conditions, methanogens replicate every one to two hours (whereas Dehalococcoides spp., e.g., double in 24-48 hr). Hence, methanogens often bloom and dominate themicrobial ecosystem following the addition of remedial amendments, thereby liberating large amounts of methane gas. There are at least three important consequences of this response:i. By utilizing hydrogen, the methanogens compete with dechlorinating microbes, thus making inefficient use of the remedial amendment (just 20 ppm methane in groundwater represents an approximate 30 percent "waste" of added fermentable substrate (i.e., hydrogen donor)-this is a common and tangible detriment);ii. Methanogens can methylate heavy metals and their rapid growth consumes alkalinity, while generating acidity, thereby facilitating multiple potential mechanisms for creating secondary contaminant issues (i.e., arsenic plumes); andiii. Elevated methane concentrations can exceed current and pending regulations of <10 to <28 ppm methane in groundwater and/or 0.5 percent by volume methane in soil gas (e.g., 10 percent of the lower explosive limit) and/or indoor air (methane is flammable between 5 percent and 15 percent by volume) and this will induce migration of contaminant vapors potentially causing indoor air issues.Considering the recent guidelines for indoor air published by the US Environmental Protection Agency, it is increasingly important to prevent excessive methanogenesis associated with remedial actions. From a regulatory perspective, public safety issues are paramount; from a property re-use or real estate (brownfield) developers' perspective, project delays are costly and can jeopardize an entire program. The use of antimethanogenic compounds as inhibitors of protein biosynthesis and the activity of enzyme systems unique to Archaea (i.e.,methanogens) during in situ remedial action can improve contaminant removal while offering safer, more efficacious treatment, simply by impeding the methanogenic bacteria's ability to proliferate and out compete desired bacterial communities (e.g., Dehalococcoides spp.).

Recent Detections of Spilogale putorius (Eastern Spotted Skunk) in South Carolina								SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST				15	2			269	274					JUN 2016	2016	Spilogale putorius (Eastern Spotted Skunk), once a fairly common furbearer across the eastern and mid-western US, is estimated to have undergone a >90% population decline across its range since the 1950s. In South Carolina, only 17 sightings of the Eastern Spotted Skunk have ever been reported, with the most recent sighting in 1998. The objective of our study was to investigate whether this species still occurs in South Carolina. We set camera traps at 56 locations on public land in the Appalachian region of South Carolina during January-March 2015, including sites of historic records. We detected 5 individual Eastern Spotted Skunks at 5 sites between the hours of 20:00 and 03:00 during 1326 trap nights in February and March. Our findings highlight the potential for Eastern Spotted Skunks to persist in other portions of their range despite a lack of recent records, and the need for future monitoring to address whether this species is cryptic or rare throughout portions of its historic range.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1528-7092	1938-5412		WOS:000379359000010

This work develops a new implementation of an existing bounding theory that exploits physical information to produce tight bounds. It is shown that the solution of a certain initial value problem in ordinary differential equations (ODEs) depending on parametric linear programs (LPs) (which are said to be 'embedded') yields componentwise bounds. To ensure the numerical tractability of such a formulation, some properties of the resulting system of ODEs with LPs embedded are discussed. Finally, the tightness of the bounds are demonstrated for models of reacting chemical systems with uncertain rate parameters.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0265-0754	1471-6887		WOS:000379359500021

Flight Activity of Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands(1) in Louisiana								SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST				41	2			313	319					JUN 2016	2016	Little is known of and no flight activity has been documented for the salvinia weevil, Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands, in the United States. A bucket-type blacklight was used to determine the flight activity of the salvinia weevil in Louisiana from 2013-2015. One trap was operated during summer and early fall 2013 at the LSU AgCenter weevil rearing facility at Houma, LA. Number of weevils captured in the trap ranged from 30 (18 July) to zero (11 September). Weevils per kilogram of salvinia from the adjacent pond ranged from 9.1 (15 August) to 41.5 (8 October). Another trap was run on Cross Lake at Shreveport, LA, during 2013-2015 in conjunction with weevil releases for biological control of giant salvinia, Salvinia molesta Mitchell. During 2013, nine and six weevils were captured in the light trap on 11 and 18 September, respectively. No weevils were captured in the light trap in 2014 because of the late release of weevils in August. During 2015, weevils captured in the trap ranged from eight (week ending 1 July) to a peak of 29 weevils for the week ending 30 July. Weevils per kilogram of salvinia increased from 7.2 (27 May) to 28.4 (2 September). Weevil flight activity might occur almost continuously when abundance and nighttime temperatures are sufficiently warm. Peak flight activity, as indicated by captures in light traps, occurred mid-to late-July. More research is needed on the factors influencing weevil flight activity, duration, and distance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0147-1724	2162-2647		WOS:000379227800002		
J	Ross, Beth E.; Haukos, David; Hagen, Christian; Pitman, James								The relative contribution of climate to changes in lesser prairie-chicken abundance								ECOSPHERE				7	6					e01323	10.1002/ecs2.1323			JUN 2016	2016	Managing for species using current weather patterns fails to incorporate the uncertainty associated with future climatic conditions; without incorporating potential changes in climate into conservation strategies, management and conservation efforts may fall short or waste valuable resources. Understanding the effects of climate change on species in the Great Plains of North America is especially important, as this region is projected to experience an increased magnitude of climate change. Of particular ecological and conservation interest is the lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), which was listed as "threatened" under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in May 2014. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effects of extreme climatic events (extreme values of the Palmer Drought Severity Index [PDSI]) relative to intermediate (changes in El Nino Southern Oscillation) and long-term climate variability (changes in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) on trends in lesser prairie-chicken abundance from 1981 to 2014. Our results indicate that lesser prairie-chicken abundance on leks responded to environmental conditions of the year previous by positively responding to wet springs (high PDSI) and negatively to years with hot, dry summers (low PDSI), but had little response to variation in the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Additionally, greater variation in abundance on leks was explained by variation in site relative to broad-scale climatic indices. Consequently, lesser prairie-chicken abundance on leks in Kansas is more strongly influenced by extreme drought events during summer than other climatic conditions, which may have negative consequences for the population as drought conditions intensify throughout the Great Plains.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2150-8925			WOS:000378523100013		
J	Hatcher, John E., Jr.; Straka, Thomas J.; Cushing, Tamara L.; Greene, John L.; Bridges, William C., Jr.								Socioeconomic Predictors of Family Forest Owner Awareness and Use of US Federal Income Tax Provisions								FORESTS				7	6					114	10.3390/f7060114			JUN 2016	2016	Family forest owners (FFOs) control a majority of private forestland in the United States and have widely diverse ownership and management objectives. Many FFOs manage their holdings for timber production and, thus, are concerned with issues such as reforestation incentives and tax treatment of timber revenues. Their actual knowledge of the tax aspects of timber management varies, with some owners even unaware of the federal income tax provisions that apply to timber. This research used econometric techniques to establish socioeconomic predictors of FFO awareness and use of federal income tax provisions. Socioeconomic factors (such as size of forest holding, ownership objective, education, age, and income) were evaluated in terms of association with awareness and use of income tax provisions. Data were obtained from a survey of 1350 South Carolina FFOs (472 useable responses). A two-step sample selection methodology revealed that membership in a landowner organization and size of forest holding positively influence landowner awareness of the seven tax provisions, while ownership objective and level of education exhibited varying degrees of influence. Overall, the findings suggest that size of forest holding is the key determinant that influences landowner use of the provisions. These tax incentives are one of the foundations of federal policies encouraging active forest management by FFOs and the effectiveness of the various incentives has crucial implications for forest policy analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1999-4907			WOS:000378852000005

In this study, the authors address this problem through an ant colony optimisation based multiobjective routing algorithm that is dedicated to accommodate EV trips. By using connectivity, EVs communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure components to transmit information in real time for finding the best route, and for intelligently recharging on the move using an inductively coupled power transfer system. Such connected EVs are capable of adapting each trip with the lowest travel time and/or the lowest recharge cost along with an optimal recharge plan to prevent a battery drain. As a case study, a real world roadway network in Charleston, South Carolina was simulated to examine the performance of the routing strategy. Simulation analysis revealed that connected EVs can reduce not only the total travel time and the energy consumption, but also the recharged volume of electricity and corresponding cost, thus significantly relieving the concerns of range anxiety of EV drivers. This routing approach potentially leads to a reduction in the EV battery capacity requirement, which in turn can reduce the cost of energy storage systems to a reasonable level.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-956X	1751-9578		WOS:000378801600010

We used the World Health Organization's data about 46 nations in Sub-Saharan Africa to test if under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) and life expectancy (LE) converged or diverged from 1990 to 2011. We explored whether the standard deviation of selected health indicators decreased over time (i.e., sigma convergence), and whether the less developed countries moved toward the average level in the group (i.e., beta convergence). The variation of U5MR between countries became smaller from 1990 to 2001. Yet this sigma convergence trend did not continue after 2002. Life expectancy in Africa from 1990-2011 demonstrated a consistent convergence trend, even after controlling for initial differences of country-level factors. The lack of consistent convergence in U5MR partially resulted from the fact that countries with higher U5MR in 1990 eventually performed better than those countries with lower U5MRs in 1990, constituting a reversal in between-country health inequity. Thus, international aid agencies might consider to reassess the funding priority about which countries to invest in, especially in the field of early childhood health.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1660-4601			WOS:000378860100099

In addition to the commonly used scoring approach with intermolecular interaction energies, we included the contribution of intramolecular energies changes upon binding in our flexible docking method, MedusaDock. In CSAR 2013-2014 binding prediction benchmark exercises, the new scoring function.MScomplex was found to better recapitulate experimental binding affinities and correctly identify ligand-binding sequences from decoy receptors. Our further analysis with the DUD data sets indicates significant improvement of virtual screening enrichment using the new scoring function when compared to the previous intermolecular energy based scoring method. Our postanalysis also suggests a new approach to select nativelike poses in the clustering-based pose ranking approach by MedusaDock. Since the calculation of intramolecular energy changes and clustering-based pose ranking and selection are not MedusaDock specific, we expect a broad application in force-field based estimation of binding affinities and pose ranking using flexible ligand receptor docking.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1549-9596	1549-960X		WOS:000378826800011	26252196

Role of Conservation Adoption Premiums on Participation in Water Quality Trading Programs								WATER				8	6					245	10.3390/w8060245			JUN 2016	2016	Over half of lakes, reservoirs, and ponds in the United States are threatened or impaired, mostly by nutrients. One policy to improve water quality is water quality trading (WQT). While the concept is appealing, adoption of conservation practices in these programs has been anemic at best. Using a case study in the newly-formed WQT market in Jordan Lake, North Carolina, we propose that part of the problem is a large adoption premium (AP) for this program. AP is the amount that farmers require over and above direct adoption costs to participate. In this study, farmers were asked at in-person interviews about their willingness to accept (WTA) a payment to adopt a particular conservation practice (riparian buffers) in order to generate and sell credits. We compared farmers' WTA to their direct cost of participation, which allowed us to estimate an AP. On average, the AP more than doubles the cost of purchasing credits. The AP sums all of the known indirect costs already cited in the literature, and more, into a single value and is relatively simple to estimate. Knowing the AP would improve the ability of policy makers to accurately estimate what is needed to boost adoption rates in WQT programs and other conservation programs as well.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2073-4441			WOS:000378851300029

Megacopta cribraria (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) Population Dynamics in Soybeans as Influenced by Planting Date, Maturity Group, and Insecticide Use								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				109	3			1141	1155		10.1093/jee/tow020			JUN 2016	2016	Since its unintentional introduction during 2009, Megacopta cribraria (F.) has spread rapidly throughout the southeastern United States, mainly feeding and reproducing on kudzu, Pueraria montana Loureiro (Merr.) variety lobata (Willdenow), and soybeans, Glycine max (L.) Merr. Megacopta cribraria has become a serious economic pest in soybeans, forcing growers to rely solely on insecticide applications to control this insect. The main objective of this study was to investigate if variation in planting date and maturity group of soybeans had an impact on management of M. cribraria populations. Three experimental fields were located in North Carolina (2) and South Carolina (1), and the tests replicated during 2012 and 2013. Treatments consisted of three planting dates, four maturity groups, and insecticide treated versus untreated, at each location. More M. cribraria were found in untreated early planted soybeans than late planted soybeans. Generally, maturity group did not influence population densities of M. cribraria. Yield was significantly influenced by the interaction between planting date and maturity group. There was a negative linear relationship between M. cribraria populations and soybean yield. Although early planted soybeans may avoid drought conditions and potentially large populations of defoliators, these fields may be at greater risk for infestation by M. cribraria.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000378041400022

While it readily feeds and develops on the invasive weed kudzu, Puereria montana (Loureiro) Merrill var. lobata (Willdenow), M. cribraria is an economic pest of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill. Differences in the susceptibility of soybean to M. cribraria-induced yield reductions based on plant phenology were assessed using two experimental protocols in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina from 2011 to 2013 in which soybeans were protected from M. cribraria using insecticides during different stages of plant phenology. In the first protocol, where insecticide applications were initiated at progressively later stages in soybean development depending on treatment, yields in the untreated plots were reduced by an average of 13% compared with plots that were protected beginning at full flowering (R2). Soybean plots that were protected beginning at 4wk after full flowering or earlier did not suffer yield reductions from M. cribraria. In the second protocol, where insecticide applications began at R2 and were discontinued at progressively later stages in soybean development depending on treatment, yields in the untreated plots were reduced by an average of 12% compared with plots that were protected until 8wk after R2. Plots in which protection was discontinued beginning at 4wk after full flowering or later did not suffer yield reductions. The period from two to 6 wk after R2 (generally coinciding with pod and seed development - stages R3- R5) was identified as critical for management of M. cribraria.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000378041400025

The computational speed of the model was improved by a factor of 24 when running the simulations for several strain paths in parallel. This speed-up enabled a comprehensive investigation of the forming limits of various BCC textures, such as gamma, sigma, alpha, eta and epsilon fibers and a uniform (random) texture. These simulations demonstrate that the crystallographic texture has significant (both positive and negative) effects on the resulting forming limit diagrams. For example, the gamma fiber texture, which is often sought through thermo-mechanical processing due to a high r-value, had the highest forming limit in the balanced biaxial strain path but the lowest forming limit under the plane strain path among the textures under consideration. A systematic investigation based on the results produced by the current model, referred to as 'VPSC-FLD', suggests that the r-value does not serve as a good measure of forming limit strain. However, model predictions show a degree of correlation between the r-value and the forming limit stress.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0965-0393	1361-651X		WOS:000378289000005

Cell-free culture supernatants were freeze-dried, and the resulting bacteriocin-containing powders were applied on the surface of hot dogs that were inoculated (similar to 4 log cfu/hot dog) with a five-strain Listeria monocytogenes cocktail. Hot dogs were vacuum-sealed and stored at 4 degrees C for 4 weeks. L. monocytogenes was enumerated, using both tryptic soy agar (TSA) and oxford listeria agar (OXA), on day 0 and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of the refrigerated storage. In hot dogs containing only the L. monocytogenes inoculum, L. monocytogenes counts increased from 4 up to 7 log cfu/hot dog. All samples containing freeze-dried bacteriocin-containing powders exhibited significantly lowered (P < 0.05) L. monocytogenes populations on the surface of hot dogs throughout the 4-week study except for bavaricin MN powder. Bacterial counts on hot dogs packed without any powder were statistically equal on day 0 when enumerated on OXA. Freeze-dried bacteriocin-containing powders from Lact. curvatus L442 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris ATCC 14365 decreased L. monocytogenes populations on the surface of hot dogs by greater than 2 log cfu/hot dog throughout the 4-week study. For the powdered bacteriocin preparations from L. lactis BFE 920, L. lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454, and Lact. curvatus LTH 1174, L. monocytogenes populations were determined to be approximately 3-log cfu/hot dog after 4 weeks of storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-1306	1867-1314		WOS:000378161900004	27094263

The indicator functions allow for local regularization, instead of global regularization which can over-smooth and dampen out important flow structures. The key to the analysis is the identification of the indicator function as a Nemyskii operator. After proving well-posedness, we provide a numerical study which includes proving optimal convergence of finite element method for the model, as well as several numerical experiments.

The evolution of power and the divergence of cooperative norms								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION				126				75	88		10.1016/j.jebo.2015.09.002			JUN 2016	2016	We consider a model of multilevel selection and the evolution of institutions that distribute power in the form of influence in a group's collective interactions with other groups. In the absence of direct group-level interactions, groups with the most cooperative members will outcompete less cooperative groups, while within any group the least cooperative members will be the most successful. Introducing group-level interactions, however, such as raiding or warfare, changes the selective landscape for groups. Our model suggests that as the global population becomes more integrated and the rate of intergroup conflict increases, selection increasingly favors unequally distributed power structures, where individual influence is weighted by acquired resources. The advantage to less democratic groups rests in their ability to facilitate selection for cooperative strategies-involving cooperation both among themselves and with outsiders-in order to produce the resources necessary to fuel their success in inter-group conflicts, while simultaneously selecting for leaders (and corresponding collective behavior) who are unburdened with those same prosocial norms. The coevolution of cooperative social norms and institutions of power facilitates the emergence of a leadership class of the selfish and has implications for theories of inequality, structures of governance, non-cooperative personality traits, and hierarchy. Our findings suggest an amendment to the well-known doctrine of multilevel selection that "Selfishness beats altruism within groups. Altruistic groups beat selfish groups." In an interconnected world, altruistic groups led by selfish individuals can beat them both. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-2681	1879-1751		WOS:000377836000005

A resilience-based prioritization scheme for water main rehabilitation								JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA				65	4			307	321		10.2166/aqua.2016.053			JUN 2016	2016	Water supply infrastructure in the United States is one lifeline system that is in dire need of huge financial investments to counter pipeline deterioration while keeping up with increasing demands and reliability goals. With decreasing financial resources available to state and local governments, effective decision-making tools for pipeline prioritization are becoming an increasingly integral part of the water utility industry. A majority of existing prioritization frameworks are merely based on the likelihood of the failure of pipelines and the resulting consequences, with little consideration given to the utility's response time to a water pipeline failure. This paper presents a novel resilience-based framework for effective prioritization of water distribution pipelines. The novelty lies in estimating the utility's response time to a pipeline failure. The proposed framework is demonstrated on a section of a real water distribution network in a coastal city of the United States. The pipeline priority results obtained are also compared with those from a more traditional risk-based prioritization scheme, and a reasonably significant difference has been observed. While availability of quality data is a challenge, this study brings to attention the importance of response time to water pipeline failures and demonstrates the merits of incorporating it in a prioritization scheme.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-7214	1365-2087		WOS:000377812800002

Among indirect search techniques, which look for stable products from the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles, or from axions coupling to high-energy photons, observations of the gamma-ray sky have come to prominence over the last few years, because of the excellent sensitivity of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission. The LAT energy range from 20 meV to above 300 GeV is particularly well suited for searching for products of the interactions of dark matter particles. In this report we describe methods used to search for evidence of dark matter with the LAT, and review the status of searches performed with up to six years of LAT data. We also discuss the factors that determine the sensitivities of these searches, including the magnitudes of the signals and the relevant backgrounds, considering both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We project the expected sensitivities of each search method for 10 and 15 years of LAT data taking. In particular, we find that the sensitivity of searches targeting dwarf galaxies, which provide the best limits currently, will improve faster than the square root of observing time. Current LAT limits for dwarf galaxies using six years of data reach the thermal relic level for masses up to 120 GeV for the b (b) over bar annihilation channel for reasonable dark matter density profiles. With projected discoveries of additional dwarfs, these limits could extend to about 250 GeV. With as much as 15 years of LAT data these searches would be sensitive to dark matter annihilations at the thermal relic cross section for masses to greater than 400 GeV (200 GeV) in the b (b) over bar(tau(+)tau(-)) annihilation channels.

I rely on data from the Public Religion Research Institute's 2009 surveys of individuals they identified as religious left activists and religious right activists. Do these activists actually say they identify with the movement with which pollsters assume them to affiliate? How potentially influential do they perceive their movements to be? Third, to what extent do activists support their movement's core social movement organizations? I conclude by arguing that the evidence is mixed that the American religious left lacks influence because its activists tend not to be unified.

Dry Reforming of Methane on Rh-Doped Pyrochlore Catalysts: A Steady-State Isotopic Transient Kinetic Study								ACS CATALYSIS				6	6			3826	3833		10.1021/acscatal.6b00666			JUN 2016	2016	Increases in worldwide methane production from biological and fossil sources have led to an increased level of interest in the dry reforming of methane (DRM) to produce syngas. Experimental efforts have shown that select pyrochlore materials, such as the Rh-substituted lanthanum zirconate pyrochlore (LRhZ), are catalytically active for DRM, exhibit long-term thermal stability, and resist deactivation. This work seeks to allow further catalyst improvements by elucidating surface reaction kinetics via steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) of dry reforming on the LRhZ pyrochlore. Isotopically labeled CH4 and CO2 were used in multiple SSITKA experiments to elucidate the migration of carbon atoms to product species. Short surface residence times at 650 and 800 degrees C (<0.6 s) were observed for DRM intermediates involved in reversible reactions, and the participation of all surface metal atoms as active sites for DRM, not only Rh, is suggested. Isotopic responses and kinetic isotope effects are explained using reaction mechanism details derived from density functional theory studies of the surface reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000377326700053

The model explicitly embraces the effect of Peierls stress and strain hardening to envisage the nature of EMR in materials with relatively large Peierls stress. The theoretical results were evaluated for 0.15% plain carbon steel and compared with experimental results. The signals obtained from the model were found to be exponential in shape and are in good agreement with the experimental observations. The results suggest that inclusion of strain hardening parameters in the earlier model is necessary for determining deformation induced EMR in bcc metals and alloys during progressive plastic deformation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1862-5282	2195-8556		WOS:000377623500001

The types of animal meals included poultry meal, pork and beef crax, meat meal, meat and bone meal, feather meal, blood meal, and fish meal from a variety of rendering operations (n = 65). Salmonella was positive in 731 (8.3%) of 8,783 analyzed samples, with contamination rates as 1.0, 33.2, and 21.3% from samples collected right after press, being loaded out, or unidentified, respectively. The randomly selected positive Salmonella samples (n = 100) representing 1.1% of the total samples tested were enumerated by the most-probable-number (MPN) method. The Salmonella contamination level ranged from <0.03 (below the detection limit) to 240 MPN/g with a median MPN per gram of 0.036. Among 102 Salmonella isolates from those 100 positive samples, a total of 42 Salmonella serotypes or groups were identified with Montevideo (13%), Senftenberg (11%), Mbandaka (7%), Orion (7%), Livingstone (6%), Tennessee (4%), Infantis (4%), Cerro (4%), and group Cl (4%) as the most predominant ones. Those Salmonella isolates were further analyzed for antimicrobial resistance to the 15 most common antibiotics by using the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System gram-negative plate. Most Salmonella isolates (n = 94) were sensitive to all antibiotics tested, with seven isolates resistant to one antibiotic and one resistant to seven antibiotics. Clearly, the prevalence of Salmonella in animal meals declined compared with previous surveys, and none of the Salmonella serotypes concerning target animal health were isolated. In addition, most Salmonella isolates remained susceptible to the majority of the 15 most commonly used antibiotics.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000377557500017	27296608

Gendering (Non)Religion: Politics, Education, and Gender Gaps in Secularity in the United States								SOCIAL FORCES				94	4			1623	1645		10.1093/sf/sov119			JUN 2016	2016	Gender gaps in religiosity among Western populations, such that women are more religious than men, are well documented. Previous explanations for these differences range from biological predispositions of risk aversion to patriarchal gender socialization, but all largely overlook the intersection of social statuses. Drawing on theories of intersectionality, we contribute to the cultural and empirical analysis of gender gaps in religiosity by documenting an interactive effect between gender, education, and political views for predicting religious nonaffiliation and infrequent attendance at religious services among Americans. For highly educated political liberals, gender gaps effectively disappear, such that men and women are almost equally likely to be secular (or religious). The results have implications for the long-standing disputes about the gendered "nature" of religiosity and highlight the importance of multiple intersecting statuses and modalities in shaping aggregate patterns of religiosity and secularity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0037-7732	1534-7605		WOS:000377430900038		
J	Kubick, Thomas R.; Lockhart, G. Brandon								Proximity to the SEC and Stock Price Crash Risk								FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT				45	2			341	367		10.1111/fima.12122			SUM 2016	2016	We explore the possibility that Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight influences disclosure practices in a manner that reduces the likelihood of individual stock price crashes. Firms located farther from the SEC have greater stock price crash risk and this result is more pronounced for firms with financial statements that are less readable (those with larger 10-K filings) and more pronounced when SEC budgets are relatively smaller. Similar results are obtained in response to SEC regional office location changes that are more likely to be exogenous. Our results suggest that SEC oversight induces disclosure practices that reduce the likelihood of large negative disclosures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0046-3892	1755-053X		WOS:000377222900004		
J	Qiu, Chenxi; Shen, Haiying; Yu, Lei; Soltani, Sohraab								Low-Latency Multi-Flow Cooperative Broadcast in Fading Wireless Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS				65	6			1802	1815		10.1109/TC.2015.2456011			JUN 2016	2016	Though a cooperative broadcast scheme has been proposed for fading environments, it has two defects: First, it only handles a packet flow from a single source node in the network, but does not consider the scenario of multiple packet flows simultaneously broadcasted from different source nodes. Second, it only allows a single relay node to forward a packet in each time slot, though multiple relay nodes forwarding in a time slot can significantly reduce broadcast latency. In this paper, we aim achieve low-latency multi-flow broadcast in wireless multi-hop networks with fading channels. To describe the interference among the transmission in different flows, we incorporate the Rayleigh fading model to the signal to noise ratio (SNR) model. Then, we introduce a cooperative diversity scheme which allows multiple relays forwarding in a time slot to reduce broadcast latency. We then formulate an interesting problem: In a fading environment, what is the optimal relay allocation schedule to minimize the broadcast latency? We propose a warm up heuristic algorithm for single-flow cooperative broadcast, based on which, we further propose a heuristic algorithm for multi-flow cooperative broadcast. Simulation results demonstrate that the two algorithms achieve lower broadcast latency than a previous method.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-9340	1557-9956		WOS:000376879300010

J	Yan, Yun; Zhang, Qiang; Wang, G. Geoff; Fang, Yan-Ming								Atmospheric deposition of heavy metals in Wuxi, China: estimation based on native moss analysis								ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT				188	6						10.1007/s10661-016-5315-2			JUN 2016	2016	We studied atmospheric deposition of heavy metals in Wuxi, China, using moss (Haplocladium microphyllum and H. angustifolium) as a biomonitoring agent. Moss samples were collected from 49 sites determined by a systematic sampling method. The top layer of soil on each site was also sampled. No significant correlation (P < 0.05) was observed between the moss and soil concentrations for any of the six heavy metal elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn), indicating that the soil substrate had little effect on the heavy metal concentrations in the moss materials. The metal enrichment capacity of the moss material, characterized by the concentration ratio between the moss and soil samples for each heavymetal, was topped by Cd and then followed by Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, and Ni, respectively. Significant (P<0.05) correlations were found among the six elements in mosses, suggesting potential anthropogenic inputs of these heavy metal pollutants. Based on concentrations of the heavy metals in mosses and the calculated contamination factors, we evaluated the contamination level of each heavy metal on the 49 sampling sites. Spatial distribution maps of heavy metal deposition for each element were interpolated using ArcGIS 9.0. A total pollution coefficient was calculated for each sampling site to identify the seriously polluted areas in the region.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-6369	1573-2959		WOS:000376684900044	27207630

Effects of dietary lysine and methionine supplementation on Ross 708 male broilers from 21 to 42 d of age (III): serum metabolites, hormones, and their relationship with growth performance								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POULTRY RESEARCH				25	2			223	231		10.3382/japr/pfw004			JUN 2016	2016	A previous study has shown that a limited increase of lysine (Lys) and methionine (Met) in broiler diets may improve feed conversion ratio (FCR), BW, carcass yield, and breastmeat yield. This study was conducted to determine the effects of dietary Lys and Met supplementation on various blood serum metabolites and hormones, and their relationship with growth performance and the meat yield of male Ross x Ross 708 broilers. Experimental diets, including 2 Lys levels (100 and 120% of recommended levels) and 4 Met levels (80, 100, 120, and 140% of recommended levels), were fed from 21 to 42 d of age. Blood serum metabolites were not affected by any of the dietary treatments. Uric acid concentration was negatively correlated with absolute weights of the whole body, carcass, pectoralis minor, wing, leg quarter, and front half parts. Cholesterol was negatively correlated with pectoralis major, wing, pectoralis major+minor, and front half. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) and testosterone concentrations were found to be positively related to BW. In addition, positive correlations occurred between concentrations of total protein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; uric acid and total cholesterol; and IGF1 and testosterone. In conclusion, dietary amino acid supplementation did not affect the blood serum metabolites investigated, which may be due to the fact that these metabolites are highly regulated in the blood. However, because the expression of genes for these metabolites may be unique to individual birds, growth and the deposition of specific muscles among birds can be quite variable. Even though Lys and Met supplementation improved growth performance, and BW was positively related to circulating IGF1 and testosterone concentrations, these 2 hormones were not affected by dietary Met supplementation. The increase in growth rate caused by dietary Lys or Met supplementation may be due to changes in various integral metabolic pathways as a result of polygenic and pleiotropic relationships, rather than by the isolated effects of individual hormones and metabolites.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1056-6171	1537-0437		WOS:000376435100010		
J	Alzboun, Nidal; Khawaldah, Hamzah; Backman, Kenneth; Moore, DeWayne								The effect of sustainability practices on financial leakage in the hotel industry in Jordan								JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT				27				18	26		10.1016/j.jhtm.2016.03.001			JUN 2016	2016	This study aims to assess the effect of sustainability practices on financial leakages in the hotel industry in Jordan. A self-administered survey was distributed to hotel managers in all 213 classified hotels in Amman, Aqaba, Petra, and the Dead Sea area. Of these, 163 questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 76.5%. Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling were used to test research hypotheses. Despite that many studies have predicted sustainability practices to have a negative effect on financial leakages, the results of this study indicated that sustainability practices didn't reduce the financial leakage level in Jordanian hotels. However, financial leakages are predicted to be reduced through sustainability practices over time. These results could help hotels to develop financial and conservation strategies benefiting their local economies, resources, and cultures. Future research may extend this work to other tourism businesses. (C) 2016 The Authors.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1447-6770	1839-5260		WOS:000376519500004
