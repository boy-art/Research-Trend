J	Zhao, Liang; Huang, Ting-Zhu; Zhu, Liu; Deng, Liang-Jian								Golub-Kahan-Lanczos based preconditioner for least squares problems in overdetermined and underdetermined cases								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS				23	1			11	30					JUL 2017	2017	We present an effective preconditioner for solving least squares problems in full ranked overdetermined and underdetermined cases. The preconditioner, generated from Golub-Kahan-Lanczos method, can approximately replace a few largest singular values by one without altering the rest. This property accelerates the convergence, thereby improves the efficiency of the algorithm for solving the least squares problems with ill-conditioned system matrix which is caused by large singular values. In this paper we focus on the overdetermined and the underdetermined cases.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1521-1398	1572-9206		WOS:000392908900001		
J	Iwinski, Kyla J; Rodgers, John H Jr; Kinley, Ciera M; Hendrikse, Maas; Calomeni, Alyssa J; McQueen, Andrew D; Geer, Tyler D; Liang, Jenny; Friesen, Vanessa; Haakensen, Monique								Influence of CuSO4 and chelated copper algaecide exposures on biodegradation of microcystin-LR.								Chemosphere				174				538	544		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.01.079			2017-May	2017	Copper exposures from algaecide applications in aquatic systems are hypothesized to impede bacterial degradation of microcystin (MC), a cyanobacterial produced hepatotoxin. Despite regulatory implications of this hypothesis, limited data exist on influences of copper-exposures on MC-degrading bacteria and consequent MC-degradation. In this study, influences of copper-algaecide concentrations and formulations on bacterial composition and microcystin-LR (MCLR) degradation were investigated. Microcystis aeruginosa was exposed to four concentrations (0-5.0mg CuL-1) of three copper-algaecide formulations, and rates and extents of MCLR degradation were measured. In untreated controls and following exposures of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0mg CuL-1, MCLR concentrations decreased at a rate of 41-53mug MCLR/Ld-1. Following exposure to 5.0mg CuL-1 MCLR degradation rates decreased an order of magnitude to 3-7mug MCLR/Ld-1. Bacterial diversity decreased following copper-exposures greater than 0.1mg CuL-1 for all formulations. Relative abundance of certain groups of MC-degrading bacteria identified in treatments increased with increasing copper concentration, suggesting they may be less sensitive to copper exposures than other, MCLR and non MC-degrading heterotrophic bacteria present in the assemblage. Results from this study revealed that copper concentration can influence degradation rates of MCLR, however this influence was not significant within copper concentrations currently registered for use (≤1.0mg CuL-1) of the tested algaecides. Copper formulation did not significantly alter degradation rates or bacterial composition. These data augment our understanding of the influences of copper algaecide-exposures on MCLR degradation, and can be used to inform more accurate risk evaluations and use of copper-algaecides for management of MCLR-producing cyanobacteria.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1879-1298		MEDLINE:28193586	28193586	
J	Chen, Chen; Apul, Onur Guven; Karanfil, Tanju								Removal of bromide from surface waters using silver impregnated activated carbon.								Water research				113				223	230		10.1016/j.watres.2017.01.019			2017-Apr-15	2017	The main objectives of this study were to develop an understanding of silver impregnated activated carbon (SIAC) preparation for enhanced bromide (Br-) removal from water, and to investigate the impact of aqueous background composition on the Br- removal. Several SIACs were produced using various combinations of oxidation and silver impregnation procedures and powdered activated carbons (ACs). Regardless of the preparation procedure, SIACs showed significantly Br- uptakes than the virgin ACs. The Br- removal efficiency was affected by (i) the background water composition (e.g. Cl- and NOM competition reduced the Br- uptake), (ii) silver impregnation process (e.g. silver content, pre-oxidation of virgin AC; silver impregnation largely increased the Br- removal, and the pre-oxidation of AC prior to silver impregnation was found to be important), and (iii) AC characteristics (e.g. surface area, oxygen content; SIACs with higher silver contents and larger surface areas exhibited higher degrees of Br- removal). The Br- removal by SIAC reduced the formation of brominated THMs. Jar test results showed that coagulation did not have an impact on Br- removal by SIAC.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1879-2448		MEDLINE:28226281	28226281	
J	Zhang, Yueyuan; Northcutt, Julie; Hanks, Tim; Miller, Ian; Pennington, Bill; Jelinek, Raz; Han, Inyee; Dawson, Paul								Polydiacetylene sensor interaction with food sanitizers and surfactants								FOOD CHEMISTRY				221				515	520		10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.168			APR 15 2017	2017	Polydiacetylene (PDA) vesicles are of interest as biosensors, particularly for pathogenic bacteria. As part of a food monitoring system, interaction with food sanitizers/surfactants was investigated. PDA vesicles were prepared by inkjet-printing, photopolymerized and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV/Vis spectroscopy. The optical response of PDA vesicles at various concentrations verses a fixed sanitizer/surfactant concentration was determined using a two variable factorial design. Sanitizer/surfactant response at various concentrations over time was also measured. Results indicated that only Vigilquat and TritonX-100 interacted with PDA vesicles giving visible colour change out of 8 sanitizers/surfactants tested. PDA vesicle concentration, sanitizer/surfactant concentration, and time all had a significant (P < 0.0001) effect on colour change. As they are highly sensitive to the presence of Vigilquat and TritonX-100, PDA sensors could be used to detect chemical residues as well as for detection of various contaminants in the food industry.

J	Zhu, JianCai; Chen, Feng; Wang, LingYing; Niu, YunWei; Xiao, ZuoBing								Evaluation of the synergism among volatile compounds in Oolong tea infusion by odour threshold with sensory analysis and E-nose								FOOD CHEMISTRY				221				1484	1490		10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.11.002			APR 15 2017	2017	Twenty-four kinds of representative aroma compounds in Oolong tea were selected to evaluate the interactions by the variation in the threshold values of these compounds before, and after, they were mixed. Result demonstrated that the ratios of the referenced threshold values of heptanal, beta-damascenone, and methional to their determined thresholds were larger, namely, 5, 3.85, and 2.5, respectively. On the other hand, the mixed compounds with similar structure and aroma mainly presented a synergistic effect and additive action. Moreover, a masking effect was found among compounds with different structures. (E)-2-hexenal was added to tea infusion at a concentration below its threshold level to investigate whether, or not, the sub-threshold compounds affected the overall odour sensation of Oolong tea by sensory analysis and electronic nose (E-nose). The result indicated that the aroma of the tea infusion with added (E)-2-hexenal had changed before, and after, they were mixed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, Lin; Chakravorty, Arghya; Alexov, Emil								DelPhiForce, a tool for electrostatic force calculations: Applications to macromolecular binding.								Journal of computational chemistry				38	9			584	593		10.1002/jcc.24715			2017-Apr-05	2017	Long-range electrostatic forces play an important role in molecular biology, particularly in macromolecular interactions. However, calculating the electrostatic forces for irregularly shaped molecules immersed in water is a difficult task. Here, we report a new tool, DelPhiForce, which is a tool in the DelPhi package that calculates and visualizes the electrostatic forces in biomolecular systems. In parallel, the DelPhi algorithm for modeling electrostatic potential at user-defined positions has been enhanced to include triquadratic and tricubic interpolation methods. The tricubic interpolation method has been tested against analytical solutions and it has been demonstrated that the corresponding errors are negligibly small at resolution 4 grids/A. The DelPhiForce is further applied in the study of forces acting between partners of three protein-protein complexes. It has been demonstrated that electrostatic forces play a dual role by steering binding partners (so that the partners recognize their native interfaces) and exerting an electrostatic torque (if the mutual orientations of the partners are not native-like). The output of DelPhiForce is in a format that VMD can read and visualize, and provides additional options for analysis of protein-protein binding. DelPhiForce is available for download from the DelPhi webpage at http://compbio.clemson.edu/downloadDir/delphiforce.tar.gz 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1096-987X		MEDLINE:28130775	28130775

Journal of hypertension				35	4			696	706		10.1097/HJH.0000000000001217			2017-Apr	2017	OBJECTIVES: We meta-analyzed the effect of meditation on blood pressure (BP), including both transcendental meditation and non-transcendental meditation interventions.METHODS: We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the BP responses to meditation interventions through a systematic literature search of the PubMed, ABI/INFORM, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases (from January 1980 to October 2015). We meta-analyzed the change in SBP and DBP, stratified by type of meditation (transcendental meditation vs. non-transcendental meditation intervention) and by type of BP measurement [ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) vs. non-ABPM measurement].RESULTS: Nineteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Among the studies using the ABPM measurement, the pooled SBP effect estimate was -2.49 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI): -7.51, 2.53] for transcendental meditation intervention (statistically insignificant) and -3.77 mmHg (95% CI: -5.33, -2.21) for non-transcendental meditation interventions, whereas the pooled DBP effect estimate was -4.26 mmHg (95% CI: -6.21, -2.31) for transcendental meditation interventions and -2.18 mmHg (95% CI: -4.28, -0.09) for non-transcendental meditation interventions. Among the studies using the non-ABPM measurement, the pooled SBP effect estimate from transcendental meditation interventions was -5.57 mmHg (95% CI: -7.41, -3.73) and was -5.09 mmHg with non-transcendental meditation intervention (95% CI: -6.34, -3.85), whereas the pooled effect size in DBP change for transcendental meditation interventions was -2.86 mmHg (95% CI: -4.27, -1.44) and was -2.57 mmHg (95% CI: -3.36, -1.79) for non-transcendental meditation interventions.CONCLUSION: Non-transcendental meditation may serve as a promising alternative approach for lowering both SBP and DBP. More ABPM-measured transcendental meditation interventions might be needed to examine the benefit of transcendental meditation intervention on SBP reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1473-5598		MEDLINE:28033127	28033127	
J	Bomarito, G. F.; Hochhalter, J. D.; Ruggles, T. J.; Cannon, A. H.								Increasing accuracy and precision of digital image correlation through pattern optimization								OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING				91				73	85		10.1016/j.optlaseng.2016.11.005			APR 2017	2017	The accuracy and precision of digital image correlation (DIC) is based on three primary components: image acquisition, image analysis, and the subject of the image. Focus on the third component, the image subject, has been relatively limited and primarily concerned with comparing pseudo-random surface patterns. In the current work, a strategy is proposed for the creation of optimal DIC patterns. In this strategy, a pattern quality metric is developed as a combination of quality metrics from the literature rather than optimization based on any single one of them. In this way, optimization produces a pattern which balances the benefits of multiple quality metrics. Specifically, sum of square of subset intensity gradients (SSSIG) was found to be the metric most strongly correlated to DIC accuracy and thus is the main component of the newly proposed pattern quality metric. A term related to the secondary auto-correlation peak height is also part of the proposed quality metric which effectively acts as a constraint upon SSSIG ensuring that a regular (e.g., checkerboard-type) pattern is not achieved. The combined pattern quality metric is used to generate a pattern that was on average 11.6% more accurate than a randomly generated pattern in a suite of numerical experiments. Furthermore, physical experiments were performed which confirm that there is indeed improvement of a similar magnitude in DIC measurements for the optimized pattern compared to a random pattern.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0143-8166	1873-0302		WOS:000393264300008		
J	Martinez, Nicole E								Contributions from Women to the Radiation Sciences: A Brief History.								Health physics				112	4			376	383		10.1097/HP.0000000000000646			2017-Apr	2017	Contributions from men to radiation science are well known, particularly the early contributions from such luminaries as William Roentgen, James Chadwick, Niels Bohr, Robert Oppenheimer, and the like. Although not ignored per se, beyond Marie Curie and Lise Meitner, the contributions of female nuclear scientists are not as widely recognized. This paper provides a concise historical summary of contributions to radiation science from the discovery of radiation through the current status of international leadership within the radiation protection community. Beyond lead scientists and academics, this paper also considers support personnel as well as the role women have played in the advancement of radiation epidemiology.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1538-5159		MEDLINE:28234697	28234697

Health physics				112	4			384	391		10.1097/HP.0000000000000640			2017-Apr	2017	The rapidly changing demographics of the United States workforce include a large number of women and members of minority groups that are currently underrepresented in science and engineering-related education and careers. Recent research indicates that while singular incidents of sexism do exist, gender bias more often affects women in various subtle ways. The effects of stereotype threat and the lack of appropriate mentoring and female role models are samples of the possible factors contributing to performance and longevity for women in math-intensive fields. To address how this issue affects those in radiation protection, the current status of women in the field is reviewed as a progression through the scientific pipeline, from education and employment to positions in scientific bodies and professional recognition, with primary focus on American women and institutions. Racial diversity demographics are reviewed where available. Findings indicate women and minority racial groups are underrepresented in multiple aspects of education, research, and leadership. While gender diversity across the field has not yet reached gender parity, trending indicates that the percentage of women earning degrees in radiation protection has consistently increased over the last four decades. Diversity of racial groups, however, has remained fairly consistent and is well below national averages. Diverse perspectives have been documented in collective problem-solving to lead to more innovative solutions.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1538-5159		MEDLINE:28234698	28234698	
J	Weathers, Danny; Siemens, Jennifer Christie; Kopp, Steven W								Tracking food intake as bites: Effects on cognitive resources, eating enjoyment, and self-control.								Appetite				111				23	31		10.1016/j.appet.2016.12.018			2017-Apr-01	2017	While monitoring food intake is critical for controlling eating, traditional tools designed for this purpose can be impractical when one desires real-time feedback. Further, the act of monitoring can deplete valuable cognitive resources. In response to these concerns, technologies have been developed to aid those wanting to control their food intake. Of note, devices can now track eating in number of bites taken as opposed to more traditional units such as pieces or volume. Through two studies, the current research investigates the effects of tracking food portions at the bite level on cognitive resources, enjoyment of the eating experience, and objective and subjective self-control. Results indicate that using wearable technology to track bite portions, as compared to doing so mentally, (1) reduces cognitive resource depletion, (2) is equally as effective for allowing users to successfully achieve eating goals, and (3) does not reduce enjoyment of the eating experience. These results support the viability of tracking food intake at the bite level, which holds a number of potential implications for eating and weight management.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-8304		MEDLINE:27989565	27989565

Chemosphere				173				340	350		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.01.072			2017-Apr	2017	Mining leases in the Athabasca Oil Sands (AOS) region produce large volumes of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) containing constituents that limit beneficial uses and discharge into receiving systems. The aim of this research is to identify constituents of concern (COCs) in OSPW sourced from an active settling basin with the goal of providing a sound rational for developing mitigation strategies for using constructed treatment wetlands for COCs contained in OSPW. COCs were identified through several lines of evidence: 1) chemical and physical characterization of OSPW and comparisons with numeric water quality guidelines and toxicity endpoints, 2) measuring toxicity of OSPW using a taxonomic range of sentinel organisms (i.e. fish, aquatic invertebrates, and a macrophyte), 3) conducting process-based manipulations (PBMs) of OSPW to alter toxicity and inform treatment processes, and 4) discerning potential treatment pathways to mitigate ecological risks of OSPW based on identification of COCs, toxicological analyses, and PBM results. COCs identified in OSPW included organics (naphthenic acids [NAs], oil and grease [O/G]), metals/metalloids, and suspended solids. In terms of species sensitivities to undiluted OSPW, fish≥aquatic invertebrates>macrophytes. Bench-scale manipulations of the organic fractions of OSPW via PBMs (i.e. H2O2+UV254 and granular activated charcoal treatments) eliminated toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia (7-8d), in terms of mortality and reproduction. Results from this study provide critical information to inform mitigation strategies using passive or semi-passive treatment processes (e.g., constructed treatment wetlands) to mitigate ecological risks of OSPW to aquatic organisms.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1879-1298		MEDLINE:28126568	28126568	
J	Chen, Sisi; Yang, Qingbo; Xiao, Hai; Shi, Honglan; Ma, Yinfa								Local pH monitoring of small cluster of cells using a fiber-optic dual-core micro-probe								SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL				241				398	405		10.1016/j.snb.2016.10.079			MAR 31 2017	2017	Biological studies of tissues and cells have enabled numerous discoveries, but these studies still bear potential risks of invalidation because of cell heterogeneity. Through high-accuracy techniques, recent studies have demonstrated that discrepancies do exist between the results from low-number-cell studies and cell-population-based results. Thus the urgent need to re-evaluate key principles on limited number of cells has been provoked. In this study, a novel designed dual-core fiber-optic pH micro-probe was fabricated and demonstrated for niche environment pH sensing with high spatial resolution. An organic modified silicate (OrMoSils) sol-gel thin layer was functionalized by entrapping a pH indicator, 2',7'-Bis (2-carbonylethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), on a similar to 70 mu m sized probe tip. Good linear correlation between fluorescence ratio of I(560)nm/I(640)nm and intercellular pH values was obtained within a biological relevant pH range from 6.20 to 7.92 (R-2 = 0.9834), and with a pH resolution of 0.035 +/- 0.005 pH units. The probe's horizontal spatial resolution was demonstrated to be less than 2 mm. Moreover, the probe was evaluated by measuring the localized extracellular pH changes of cultured human lung cancer cells (A549) when exposed to titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). Results showed that the probe has superior capability for fast, local, and continual monitoring of a small cluster of cells, which provides researchers a fast and accurate technique to conduct local pH measurements for cell heterogeneity-related studies.

The amine possesses a planar molecular structure of D-3 symmetry with an unusually long N-S bond of 1.829(6) angstrom. The long N-S bonds are in accordance with the small Arrhenius activation barrier for the decay into center dot N(SF5)(2) and center dot SF5 radicals of 6.9 kcal mol(-1), and its half-life at room temperature is only 50 min. The aminyl radical possesses C-2 symmetry with N-S = 1.692(4) angstrom and S-N-S = 135.1(5)degrees, and its structure is similar to that of FN(SF5)(2). This radical is much more stable than the amine (half-life at room temperature is 130 min). Dimerization and formation of the corresponding hydrazine, (SF5)(2)NN(SF5)(2), was not observed, nor was the nitrene:NSF5 or its isomer FN=SF4. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yang, Ruiwen; Li, Xingfang; Lin, Songyi; Zhang, Zuoming; Chen, Feng								Identification of novel peptides from 3 to 10 kDa pine nut (Pinus koraiensis) meal protein, with an exploration of the relationship between their antioxidant activities and secondary structure								FOOD CHEMISTRY				219				311	320		10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.163			MAR 15 2017	2017	In the present study, two novel peptides Lys-Trp-Phe-Cys-Thr (KWFCT) and Gln-Trp-Phe-Cys-Thr (QWFCT) were purified and identified from 3 to 10 kDa pine nut (Pinus koraiensis) meal protein. Their cytotoxicity and antioxidant activities in vitro were determined. Additionally, pulsed electric field technology, antioxidant activities, and circular dichroism were used together to investigate the relationship between antioxidant activities and secondary structure. The results showed that neither peptide demonstrated cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. KWFCT had higher values for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition (67.43% +/- 1.33%) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (67.86 +/- 1.03 mM Fe2+/mg), and Ac-QWFCT had higher values for 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) inhibition (74.9% +/- 1.19%) and cellular antioxidant activity (916.32 mu mol of QE/100g) (P < 0.05). The antioxidant activities reached their highest values when parameters of PEF were 5 kV/cm and 2400 Hz. An increase in antioxidant activities of Ac-QWFCT was correlated with a decrease in random coil content. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Biointerphases				12	2			02D402	02D402		10.1116/1.4977064			2017 Mar 07	2017	Upon introduction into a biological system, engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) rapidly associate with a variety of biomolecules such as proteins and lipids to form a biocorona. The presence of "biocorona" influences nano-bio interactions considerably, and could ultimately result in altered biological responses. Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), the major constituent of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), is one of the most prevalent proteins found in ENM-biocorona irrespective of ENM nature, size, and shape. Given the importance of ApoA-I in HDL and cholesterol transport, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of ApoA-I adsorption and the associated structural changes for assessing consequences of ENM exposure. Here, the authors used a comprehensive array of microscopic and spectroscopic tools to elucidate the interactions between ApoA-I and 100nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) with four different surface functional groups. The authors found that the protein adsorption and secondary structural changes are highly dependent on the surface functionality. Our electrochemical studies provided new evidence for charge transfer interactions that influence ApoA-I unfolding. While the unfolding of ApoA-I on AgNPs did not significantly change their uptake and short-term cytotoxicity, the authors observed that it strongly altered the ability of only some AgNPs to generate of reactive oxygen species. Our results shed new light on the importance of surface functionality and charge transfer interactions in biocorona formation.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1559-4106		MEDLINE:28269991	28269991

Environmental science & technology				51	5			2864	2870		10.1021/acs.est.6b04172			2017-Mar-07	2017	A dynamic 99mTc tracer experiment was performed to investigate the capabilities of combined preclinical single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) for investigating transport in a heterogeneous porous medium. The experiment was conducted by continuously injecting a 99mTc solution into a column packed with eight layers (i.e., soil, silica gel, and 0.2-4 mm glass beads). Within the imaging results it was possible to correlate observed features with objects as small as 2 mm for the SPECT and 0.2 mm for the CT. Time-lapse SPECT imaging results illustrated both local and global nonuniform transport phenomena and the high-resolution CT data were found to be useful for interpreting the cause of variations in the 99mTc concentration associated with structural features within the materials, such as macropores. The results of this study demonstrate SPECT/CT as a novel tool for 4D (i.e., transient three-dimensional) noninvasive imaging of fate and transport processes in porous media. Despite its small scale, an experiment with such high resolution data allows us to better understand the pore scale transport which can then be used to inform larger scale studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-5851		MEDLINE:28128544	28128544	
J	Chakravorty, Arghya; Jia, Zhe; Li, Lin; Alexov, Emil								A New DelPhi Feature for Modeling Electrostatic Potential around Proteins: Role of Bound Ions and Implications for Zeta-Potential.								Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids				33	9			2283	2295		10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b04430			2017-Mar-07	2017	A new feature of the popular software DelPhi is developed and reported, allowing for computing the surface averaged electrostatic potential (SAEP) of macromolecules. The user is given the option to specify the distance from the van der Waals surface where the electrostatic potential will be outputted. In conjunction with DelPhiPKa and the BION server, the user can adjust the charges of titratable groups according to specific pH values, and add explicit ions bound to the macromolecular surface. This approach is applied to a set of four proteins with "experimentally" delivered zeta (zeta)-potentials at different pH values and salt concentrations. It has been demonstrated that the protocol is capable of predicting zeta-potentials in the case of proteins with relatively large net charges. This protocol has been less successful for proteins with low net charges. The work demonstrates that in the case of proteins with large net charges, the electrostatic potential should be collected at distances about 4 A away from the vdW surface and explicit ions should be added at a binding energy cutoff larger than 1-2kT, in order to accurately predict zeta-potentials. The low salt conditions substantiate this effect of ions on SAEP.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-5827		MEDLINE:28181811	28181811

JMIR research protocols				6	3			e38	e38		10.2196/resprot.6993			2017 Mar 06	2017	BACKGROUND: The potential of mHealth technologies in the care of patients with diabetes and other chronic conditions has captured the attention of clinicians and researchers. Efforts to date have incorporated a variety of tools and techniques, including Web-based portals, short message service (SMS) text messaging, remote collection of biometric data, electronic coaching, electronic-based health education, secure email communication between visits, and electronic collection of lifestyle and quality-of-life surveys. Each of these tools, used alone or in combination, have demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness. Some of the more promising results have been demonstrated using regular collection of biometric devices, SMS text messaging, secure email communication with clinical teams, and regular reporting of quality-of-life variables. In this study, we seek to incorporate several of the most promising mHealth capabilities in a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) workflow.OBJECTIVE: We aim to address underlying technology needs and gaps related to the use of mHealth technology and the activation of patients living with type 2 diabetes. Stated differently, we enable supporting technologies while seeking to influence patient activation and self-care activities.METHODS: This is a multisite phased study, conducted within the US Military Health System, that includes a user-centered design phase and a PCMH-based feasibility trial. In phase 1, we will assess both patient and provider preferences regarding the enhancement of the enabling technology capabilities for type 2 diabetes chronic care management. Phase 2 research will be a single-blinded 12-month feasibility study that incorporates randomization principles. Phase 2 research will seek to improve patient activation and self-care activities through the use of the Mobile Health Care Environment with tailored behavioral messaging. The primary outcome measure is the Patient Activation Measure scores. Secondary outcome measures are Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities Measure scores, clinical measures, comorbid conditions, health services resource consumption, and technology system usage statistics.RESULTS: We have completed phase 1 data collection. Formal analysis of phase 1 data has not been completed. We have obtained institutional review board approval and began phase 1 research in late fall 2016.CONCLUSIONS: The study hypotheses suggest that patients can, and will, improve their activation in chronic care management. Improved activation should translate into improved diabetes self-care. Expected benefits of this research to the scientific community and health care services include improved understanding of how to leverage mHealth technology to activate patients living with type 2 diabetes in self-management behaviors. The research will shed light on implementation strategies in integrating mHealth into the clinical workflow of the PCMH setting.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02949037. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02949037.

J	Gil, Dmitry; Rex, James; Cobb, William; Reukov, Vladimir; Vertegel, Alexey								Anti-inflammatory coatings of hernia repair meshes: A pilot study.								Journal of biomedical materials research. Part B, Applied biomaterials											10.1002/jbm.b.33834			2017-Mar-06	2017	The current prevalence of postoperative chronic pain from hernioplasty procedures employing polymer mesh is close to 30%. Most of the researchers agree that oxidative stress, resulting from the release of oxidants and enzymes during acute inflammatory response, is a key factor in the development of posthernioplasty complications. This results in both the decrease of the biomechanical properties and stiffening of the polymer fibers of the mesh, leading to chronic pain. Moreover, enhanced activity of inflammatory cells can lead to an excessive deposition of connective tissue around the implant. In this study polypropylene hernia repair meshes coated with vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), a known antioxidant, were prepared and characterized. The absorption isotherm of vitamin E on the mesh was characterized and a release profile study yielded a promising results, showing sustained release of the drug over a 10-day period. An animal study was conducted, and histological analysis five weeks after implantation exhibited a reduced host tissue response for a modified mesh as compared to a plain mesh, as evidenced by a higher mature collagen to immature collagen ratio, as well as lower level of fatty infiltrates, neovascularization and fibrosis in the case of modified mesh. These results support the use of alpha-tocopherol as a potential coating in attempt to reduce the extent of postoperative inflammation, and thereby improve long-term outcomes of hernioplasty. 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Amoah, Emmanuel; Dieter, R Karl								Regioselective 1,4-Conjugate Addition of Grignard Reagents to alpha,beta-gamma,delta-Dienones and alpha,beta-gamma,delta-Dienyl Thiol Esters.								The Journal of organic chemistry											10.1021/acs.joc.6b02769			2017-Mar-03	2017	Alkyl Grignard reagents (Et, nBu, iPr, cyclohexyl), with the exception of tBuMgCl, undergo exclusive or exceptionally highly regioselective 1,4-addition reactions to alpha,beta-gamma,delta-unsaturated ketones, while aryl and heteroaryl Grignard reagents give mixed results ranging from exclusive 1,4-addition (1-naphthyl, 2-N-methylpyrrolyl) to regioselective 1,2-addition (2-furyl, 2:1). All alkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl Grignard reagents examined gave exclusive 1,4-addition reactions with alpha,beta-gamma,delta-unsaturated thiol esters, with the exception of tBuMgCl, which gave an 80:20 mixture of 1,4:1,6-addition products. The high chemo- and regioselectivity observed for these reactions is attributed to a radical or radical-like pathway for the alkyl Grignard reagents and possibly a carbanion pathway for aryl Grignard reagents. The alpha,gamma-dienyl thiol esters provide for a one-pot tandem 1,4-addition-nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction sequence to afford 3-substituted 4-enone moieties.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-6904		MEDLINE:28221034	28221034

Community mental health journal											10.1007/s10597-017-0115-x			2017-Mar-02	2017	The involuntary hospitalization law provides a means by which love ones, caregivers and healthcare professionals can intervene when a mentally ill patient is a danger to self or others. Our study assessed the knowledge of professionals in one of the Greenville Health System (GHS) emergency department (ED) about the involuntary hospitalization process of mental health patients in South Carolina (SC). An eight item survey on the South Carolina involuntary hospitalization and commitment process was developed and distributed to GHS ED staff including: physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers and technicians. Our findings indicated that the knowledge base is not consistent across healthcare discipline, nor is it sufficient given that most professionals achieved less than 50% correct response. This study has implications for ongoing education for ED healthcare workers which will be of significant importance to promote beneficence and to uphold the standards of patientcentered practice and compassionate medicine.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1573-2789		MEDLINE:28255637	28255637	
J	Anglea, Timothy; Wang, Yongqiang								Phase Desynchronization: A New Approach and Theory Using Pulse-Based Interaction								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING				65	5			1160	1171					MAR 1 2017	2017	In this paper, we present a novel approach for achieving phase desynchronization in a pulse-coupled oscillator network. Ensuring phase desynchronization is a difficult problem, and existing results are constrained to a completely interconnected network and a fixed number of nodes. Our approach is more robust than previous approaches, removing the constraint of a fixed number of nodes. The removal of this constraint is significant because it allows the network to receive and drop nodes freely without any change to the phase update strategy. Also, to our knowledge, our approach is the first to prove the convergence to the desynchronized state for a topology that is more general than the all-to-all topology. More specifically, our approach is applicable to any circulant, symmetric network topology, including the circulant symmetric ring topology. Rigorous mathematical proofs are provided to support the result that any circulant, symmetric network with ordered phases under our proposed algorithm will converge to uniform phase desynchronization. Simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the algorithm's performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1053-587X			CCC:000393753400005

Our long term goal is to develop cationic, amphiphilic copolymers (poly (lactide-co-glycolide)-g-polyethylenimine, PgP) for combinatorial delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids (TNAs) and drugs targeting these different barriers. In this study, we evaluated the ability of PgP to deliver siRNA targeting RhoA, a critical signaling pathway activated by multiple extracellular inhibitors of axonal regeneration. After generation of rat compression SCI model, PgP/siRhoA polyplexes were locally injected into the lesion site. Relative to untreated injury only, PgP/siRhoA polyplexes significantly reduced RhoA mRNA and protein expression for up to 4 weeks post-injury. Histological analysis at 4 weeks post-injury showed that RhoA knockdown was accompanied by reduced apoptosis, cavity size, and astrogliosis and increased axonal regeneration within the lesion site. These studies demonstrate that PgP is an efficient non-viral delivery carrier for therapeutic siRhoA to the injured spinal cord and may be a promising platform for the development of combinatorial TNA/drug therapy.

Electrophoresis				38	5			572	579		10.1002/elps.201600296			2017-Mar	2017	Electroosmotic flow is the transport method of choice in microfluidic devices over traditional pressure-driven flow. To date, however, studies on electroosmotic flow have been almost entirely limited to inside microchannels. This work presents the first experimental study of Joule heating effects on electroosmotic fluid entry from the inlet reservoir (i.e., the well that supplies fluids and samples) to the microchannel in a polymer-based microfluidic chip. Electrothermal fluid circulations are observed at the reservoir-microchannel junction, which grow in size and strength with the increasing alternating current to direct current voltage ratio. Moreover, a 2D depth-averaged numerical model is developed to understand the effects of Joule heating on fluid temperature and flow fields in electrokinetic microfluidic chips. This model overcomes the problems encountered in previous unrealistic 2D and costly 3D models, and is able to predict the observed electroosmotic entry flow patterns with a good agreement.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1522-2683		MEDLINE:27557612	27557612

Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society				34	2			168	173		10.1097/WNP.0000000000000344			2017-Mar	2017	PURPOSE: The goal of the project is to determine characteristics of academic neurophysiologist EEG interpreters (EEGers), which predict good interrater agreement (IRA) and to determine the number of EEGers needed to develop an ideal standardized testing and training data set for epileptiform transient (ET) detection algorithms.METHODS: A three-phase scoring method was used. In phase 1, 19 EEGers marked the location of ETs in two hundred 30-second segments of EEG from 200 different patients. In phase 2, EEG events marked by at least 2 EEGers were annotated by 18 EEGers on a 5-point scale to indicate whether they were ETs. In phase 3, a third opinion was obtained from EEGers on any inconsistencies between phase 1 and phase 2 scoring.RESULTS: The IRA for the 18 EEGers was only fair. A select group of the EEGers had good IRA and the other EEGers had low IRA. Board certification by the American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology was associated with better IRA performance but other board certifications, years of fellowship training, and years of practice were not. As the number of EEGers used for scoring is increased, the amount of change in the consensus opinion decreases steadily and is quite low as the group size approaches 10.CONCLUSIONS: The IRA among EEGers varies considerably. The EEGers must be tested before use as scorers for ET annotation research projects. The American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology certification is associated with improved performance. The optimal size for a group of experts scoring ETs in EEG is probably in the 6 to 10 range.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1537-1603		MEDLINE:27662336	27662336

This is especially true for members of multiple protected classes.CONCLUSIONS: We suggest organizations carefully consider both the type of program and the health factors incorporated into their wellness efforts and use incentives rather than disincentives to encourage health promotion.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1536-5948		MEDLINE:28267096	28267096	
J	Angele-Martinez, Carlos; Nguyen, Khanh Van T; Ameer, Fathima S; Anker, Jeffrey N; Brumaghim, Julia L								Reactive oxygen species generation by copper(II) oxide nanoparticles determined by DNA damage assays and EPR spectroscopy.								Nanotoxicology				11	2			278	288		10.1080/17435390.2017.1293750			2017-Mar	2017	Copper(II) oxide nanoparticles (NPCuO) have many industrial applications, but are highly cytotoxic because they generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is unknown whether the damaging ROS are generated primarily from copper leached from the nanoparticles, or whether the nanoparticle surface plays a significant role. To address this question, we separated nanoparticles from the supernatant containing dissolved copper, and measured their ability to damage plasmid DNA with addition of hydrogen peroxide, ascorbate, or both. While DNA damage from the supernatant (measured using an electrophoresis assay) can be explained solely by dissolved copper ions, damage by the nanoparticles in the presence of ascorbate is an order of magnitude higher than can be explained by dissolved copper and must, therefore, depend primarily upon the nanoparticle surface. DNA damage is time-dependent, with shorter incubation times resulting in higher EC50 values. Hydroxyl radical (OH) is the main ROS generated by NPCuO/hydrogen peroxide as determined by EPR measurements; NPCuO/hydrogen peroxide/ascorbate conditions generate ascorbyl, hydroxyl, and superoxide radicals. Thus, NPCuO generate ROS through several mechanisms, likely including Fenton-like and Haber-Weiss reactions from the surface or dissolved copper ions. The same radical species were observed when NPCuO suspensions were replaced with the supernatant containing leached copper, washed NPCuO, or dissolved copper solutions. Overall, NPCuO generate significantly more ROS and DNA damage in the presence of ascorbate than can be explained simply from dissolved copper, and the NPCuO surface must play a large role.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1743-5404		MEDLINE:28248593	28248593

Comparison of deficit irrigation management strategies on root, plant growth and biomass productivity of silage maize								AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT				182				126	138		10.1016/j.agwat.2016.12.014			MAR 1 2017	2017	Knowledge about biomass partitioning of maize grown in arid and semi-arid climates is scarce and yet essential to select a robust and effective deficit irrigation management (DIM) strategy for these regions. The objectives of this study were to: i) investigate the effects of different levels of water application under two DIM strategies on the root and aboveground characteristics, the response factor to water stress (K-y) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) of silage maize at different growth stages, and ii) determine the best DIM strategy that would maximize biomass productivity. Field pot experiments were conducted in Isfahan, Iran, during 2009 and 2010. The two DIM strategies were fixed irrigation interval-variable irrigation depth (M-1), and variable irrigation interval-fixed irrigation depth (M-2). Each DIM strategy was tested at four water-deficit levels, including: severe, moderate, mild, and a full-irrigation. In M-1, irrigation intervals were consistent for all irrigation treatments but Were varied over the growing season. Treatment effects were measured at the 10-leaf, 16-leaf, tasseling, milk, and silage harvest crop growth stages. There was significant effect of irrigation and growth stage on total aboveground biomass (TB), leaf area (LA), root biomass (RB), and root:shoot ratio (RSR) for both DIM strategies during the two years. For M-2, there was significant difference in TB, LA, RB, and RSR between all irrigation levels at all growth stages. TB production was on the average around 25% higher for M-1 compared to M-2, even though total applied irrigation water was only 6% higher for M-1. Comparing the two DIMs showed that RSR and K-y were both higher for M-2, indicating that the crop was more sensitive to this strategy. In conclusion, M-1 was selected as the best management practice since it had more favorable effects on improving the IWUE and also on the development of maize roots during the growing season.

A quasi-continuum thermomechanical model for phonon damping analysis of single crystal silicon nano-resonators								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER				106				491	502		10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.08.102			MAR 2017	2017	In this paper, we study phonon-mediated intrinsic damping in single crystal silicon nano-resonators where the phonon transport is of partial ballistic and partial diffusive nature. For this purpose, we present a quasi-continuum thermomechanical model that accounts for both thermoelastic and Akhiezer energy dissipation mechanisms. In the model, the linearized frequency-dependent phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is coupled with continuum elasticity equations via phonon modulation theory. The model is implemented numerically by using the finite element and finite volume methods for calculating the damping ratio and quality factor of nano-resonators under forced vibration. Both flexural and axial motions are considered for single crystal silicon nano-resonators with different sizes and frequencies. The numerical results obtained from the quasi-continuum thermomechanical model are compared with those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, Juan; Zhou, Jinxiang; Gowtham, Yogender K; Harcum, Sarah W; Husson, Scott M								Antibody Purification from CHO Cell Supernatant Using New Multimodal Membranes.								Biotechnology progress											10.1002/btpr.2454			2017-Mar-01	2017	This contribution describes strategies to purify monoclonal antibodies from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture supernatant using newly designed multimodal membranes (MMMs). The MMMs were used for the capture step purification of human IgG1 following a size-exclusion desalting column to remove chaotropic salts that interfere with IgG binding. The MMM column attained higher dynamic binding capacity than a Protein A resin column at an equivalent residence time of 1 min. The two step MMM chromatography process achieved high selectivity for capturing hIgG1 from the CHO cell culture supernatant, though the desalting step resulted in product dilution. Product purity and host cell protein (HCP) level in the elution pool were analyzed and compared to results from a commercial Protein A column. The product purity was >98% and HCP levels were<20 ppm for both purification methods. In addition, hIgG1 could be eluted from the MMM chromatography column at neutral pH, which is important for limiting the formation of aggregates; although slow elution dilutes the product. Overall, this paper shows that MMMs are highly effective for capture step purification of proteins and should be considered when Protein A cannot be used, e.g., for pH sensitive mAbs or proteins lacking an Fc binding domain.

J	Chen, Zhao; Jiang, Xiuping								Microbiological Safety of Animal Wastes Processed by Physical Heat Treatment: An Alternative To Eliminate Human Pathogens in Biological Soil Amendments as Recommended by the Food Safety Modernization Act.								Journal of food protection				80	3			392	405		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-181			2017-Mar	2017	Animal wastes have high nutritional value as biological soil amendments of animal origin for plant cultivation in sustainable agriculture; however, they can be sources of some human pathogens. Although composting is an effective way to reduce pathogen levels in animal wastes, pathogens may still survive under certain conditions and persist in the composted products, which potentially could lead to fresh produce contamination. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Food Safety Modernization Act, alternative treatments are recommended for reducing or eliminating human pathogens in raw animal manure. Physical heat treatments can be considered an effective method to inactivate pathogens in animal wastes. However, microbial inactivation in animal wastes can be affected by many factors, such as composition of animal wastes, type and physiological stage of the tested microorganism, and heat source. Following some current processing guidelines for physical heat treatments may not be adequate for completely eliminating pathogens from animal wastes. Therefore, this article primarily reviews the microbiological safety and economic value of physically heat-treated animal wastes as biological soil amendments.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-9097		MEDLINE:28199147	28199147

Our analytical study consists of establishing connections between rNS-alpha to some well-studied models, and determining the model's integral invariants, energy cascade, and energy dissipation rate. Numerical simulations of turbulent flows with coarse meshes are performed, and excellent results found, for forced homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, and for turbulent channel flow with friction Reynolds numbers Re-tau = 395, 590, and 1000.

J	Ray, Poulomi; Hughes, Ami J; Sharif, Misha; Chapman, Susan C								Lectins selectively label cartilage condensations and the otic neuroepithelium within the embryonic chicken head.								Journal of anatomy				230	3			424	434		10.1111/joa.12565			2017-Mar	2017	Cartilage morphogenesis during endochondral ossification follows a progression of conserved developmental events. Cells are specified towards a prechondrogenic fate and subsequently undergo condensation followed by overt differentiation. Currently available molecular markers of prechondrogenic and condensing mesenchyme rely on common regulators of the chondrogenic program that are not specific to the tissue type or location. Therefore tissue-specific condensations cannot be distinguished based on known molecular markers. Here, using the chick embryo model, we utilized lectin labeling on serial sections, demonstrating that differential labeling by peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) successfully separates adjacently located condensations in the proximal second pharyngeal arch. PNA selectively labels chick middle ear columella and basal plate condensation, whereas SNA specifically marks extracolumella and the ventro-lateral part of the otic capsule. We further extended our study to examine lectin-binding properties of the different parts of the inner ear epithelium, neural tube and notochord. Our results show that SNA labels the auditory and vestibular hair cells of the inner ear, whereas PNA specifically recognizes the statoacoustic ganglion. PNA is also highly specific for the floor plate of the neural tube. Additionally, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) labels the basement membrane of the notochord and is a marker of the apical-basal polarity of the cochlear duct. Overall, this study indicates that selective lectin labeling is a promising approach to differentiate between contiguously located mesenchymal condensations and subregions of epithelia globally during development.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1469-7580		MEDLINE:27861854	27861854

This study examined the relationship between two tools: the VISION COACH interactive light board and the Functional Object Detection (FOD) Advanced driving simulator scenario. Fifty-four healthy drivers, ages 21-66 yr, were divided into three age groups. Participants performed braking response and visual target (E) detection tasks of the FOD Advanced driving scenario, followed by two sets of three trials using the VISION COACH Full Field 60 task. Results showed no significant effect of age on FOD Advanced performance but a significant effect of age on VISION COACH performance. Correlations showed that participants' performance on both braking and E detection tasks were significantly positively correlated with performance on the VISION COACH (.37 < r < .40, p < .01).

J	Eggert, Julie								Genetics and Genomics in Oncology Nursing: What Does Every Nurse Need to Know?								The Nursing clinics of North America				52	1			1	25		10.1016/j.cnur.2016.11.001			2017-Mar	2017	In addition to the need for basic education about genetics/genomics, other approaches are suggested to include awareness campaigns, continuing education courses, policy review, and onsite clinical development. These alternative learning strategies encourage oncology nurses across the continuum of care, from the bedside/seatside to oncology nurse research, to integrate genomics into all levels of practice and research in the specialty of oncology nursing. All nurses are warriors in the fight against cancer. The goal of this article is to identify genomic information that oncology nurses, at all levels of care, need to know and use as tools in the war against cancer.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1558-1357		MEDLINE:28189157	28189157

Creating monodisperse polymer microspheres using membrane emulsification								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				134	11					44593	10.1002/APP.44593			MAR 2017	2017	This study used membrane emulsification (ME) as a pre-treatment step to suspension polymerization to produce polystyrene microspheres with diameters from 200 to 300 mm and coefficient of variation (CV) as low 20%. Limited scientific information is available on utilizing suspension polymerization to prepare monodisperse polystyrene microspheres with diameters greater than 100 mm. Microspheres were produced by pumping monomer solution through uniform pores of nickel membranes to form dispersed phase droplets that were transferred to a reactor for suspension polymerization. Systematic studies were done to understand the roles of continuous phase composition, ME unit process parameters, and polymerization reactor stir speed on microsphere size and CV. For a specific microsphere size, there were particular stir speeds in each unit that minimized CV. The methodology developed in this study is being used to prepare monodisperse polymer resin beads to improve detection efficiency and accuracy in flow-cell sensors for quantifying waterborne radioactivity.

J	Stone, Dianna L.; Rosopa, Patrick J.								The Advantages and Limitations of Using Meta-analysis in Human Resource Management Research								HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT REVIEW				27	1	SI		1	7		10.1016/j.hrmr.2016.09.001			MAR 2017	2017	This article provides an introduction to the special issue titled "Using meta-analysis to advance research in human resource management." It begins by defining meta-analysis and considering the advantages and limitations of using this method in HRM research. For instance, we argued that meta-analysis is a valuable tool because (a) it provides a better estimate of the relation that exists in the population than single studies, (b) the estimates are more precise because there is an increased amount of data and statistical power, (c) hypothesis testing and biases associated with publications can be examined, and (d) it helps resolve inconsistencies in research, and identifies potential moderating or mediating variables. However, we also maintained that there are a number of limitations associated with the method. For example, the results of meta-analysis may be limited by the (a) selection of an incomplete set of studies, (b) inclusion of studies that lack internal, external, construct, and statistical conclusion validity, (c) presence of studies with small sample sizes, and (d) heterogeneity of methods used in studies that may lead to erroneous inferences. Finally, the article presents a brief review of the studies included in the special issue. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	Rosopa, Patrick J.; Kim, Brian								Robustness of statistical inferences using linear models with meta-analytic correlation matrices								HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT REVIEW				27	1	SI		216	236		10.1016/j.hrmr.2016.09.012			MAR 2017	2017	To examine complex relationships among variables, researchers in human resource management, industrial-organizational psychology, organizational behavior, and related fields have increasingly used meta-analytic procedures to aggregate effect sizes across primary studies to form meta-analytic correlation matrices, which are then subjected to further analyses using linear models (e.g., multiple linear regression). Because missing effect sizes (i.e., correlation coefficients) and different sample sizes across primary studies can occur when constructing meta-analytic correlation matrices, the present study examined the effects of missingness under realistic conditions and various methods for estimating sample size (e.g., minimum sample size, arithmetic mean, harmonic mean, and geometric mean) on the estimated squared multiple correlation coefficient (R-2) and the power of the significance test on the overall R-2 in linear regression. Simulation results suggest that missing data had a more detrimental effect as the number of primary studies decreased and the number of predictor variables increased. It appears that using second-order sample sizes of at least 10 (i.e., independent effect sizes) can improve both statistical power and estimation of the overall R-2 considerably. Results also suggest that although the minimum sample size should not be used to estimate sample size, the other sample size estimates appear to perform similarly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	James, Kevin; Pollack, Paul								Extremal primes for elliptic curves with complex multiplication								JOURNAL OF NUMBER THEORY				172				383	391		10.1016/j.jnt.2016.09.033			MAR 2017	2017	Fix an elliptic curve E/Q. For each prime p of good reduction, let a(p) = p+1 - #E(F-p). A well-known theorem of Hasse asserts that vertical bar a(p)vertical bar <= 2 root P. We say that p is a champion prime for E if a(p) = - left perpendicular 2 root Pright perpendicular, that is, #E(F-p) is as large as allowed by the Hasse bound. Analogously, we call p a trailing prime if a(p) = left perpendicular 2 root P right perpendicular. In this note, we study the frequency of champion and trailing primes for CM elliptic curves. Our main theorem is that for CM curves, both the champion primes and trailing primes have counting functions similar to 2/3 pi x(3/4)/ log x, as x ->infinity. This confirms (in corrected form) a recent conjecture of James Tran Trinh Wertheimer Zantout. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America				114	9			2212	2217		10.1073/pnas.1621496114			2017-Feb-28	2017	Proteolytic enzymes (proteases) participate in a vast range of physiological processes, ranging from nutrient digestion to blood coagulation, thrombosis, and beyond. In plants, proteases are implicated in host recognition and pathogen infection, induced defense (immunity), and the deterrence of insect pests. Because proteases irreversibly cleave peptide bonds of protein substrates, their activity must be tightly controlled in time and space. Here, we report an example of how nature evolved alternative mechanisms to fine-tune the activity of a cysteine protease dubbed RD21 (RESPONSIVE TO DESICCATION-21). One mechanism in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana studied here comprises irreversible inhibition of RD21's activity by Serpin1, whereas the other mechanism is a result of the reversible inhibition of RD21 activity by a Kunitz protease inhibitor named water-soluble chlorophyll-binding protein (WSCP). Activity profiling, complex isolation, and homology modeling data revealed unique interactions of RD21 with Serpin1 and WSCP, respectively. Expression studies identified only partial overlaps in Serpin1 and WSCP accumulation that explain how RD21 contributes to the innate immunity of mature plants and arthropod deterrence of seedlings undergoing skotomorphogenesis and greening.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1091-6490		MEDLINE:28179567	28179567	
J	Chalil Madathil, Kapil; Greenstein, Joel S								An investigation of the efficacy of collaborative virtual reality systems for moderated remote usability testing.								Applied ergonomics											10.1016/j.apergo.2017.02.011			2017-Feb-27	2017	Collaborative virtual reality-based systems have integrated high fidelity voice-based communication, immersive audio and screen-sharing tools into virtual environments. Such three-dimensional collaborative virtual environments can mirror the collaboration among usability test participants and facilitators when they are physically collocated, potentially enabling moderated usability tests to be conducted effectively when the facilitator and participant are located in different places. We developed a virtual collaborative three-dimensional remote moderated usability testing laboratory and employed it in a controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of moderated usability testing in a collaborative virtual reality-based environment with two other moderated usability testing methods: the traditional lab approach and Cisco WebEx, a web-based conferencing and screen sharing approach. Using a mixed methods experimental design, 36 test participants and 12 test facilitators were asked to complete representative tasks on a simulated online shopping website. The dependent variables included the time taken to complete the tasks; the usability defects identified and their severity; and the subjective ratings on the workload index, presence and satisfaction questionnaires. Remote moderated usability testing methodology using a collaborative virtual reality system performed similarly in terms of the total number of defects identified, the number of high severity defects identified and the time taken to complete the tasks with the other two methodologies. The overall workload experienced by the test participants and facilitators was the least with the traditional lab condition. No significant differences were identified for the workload experienced with the virtual reality and the WebEx conditions. However, test participants experienced greater involvement and a more immersive experience in the virtual environment than in the WebEx condition. The ratings for the virtual environment condition were not significantly different from those for the traditional lab condition. The results of this study suggest that participants were productive and enjoyed the virtual lab condition, indicating the potential of a virtual world based approach as an alternative to conventional approaches for synchronous usability testing.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1872-9126		MEDLINE:28256209	28256209

Ga-substituted Li7La3Zr2O12: An investigation based on grain coarsening in garnet-type lithium ion conductors								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				695				3744	3752		10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.11.277			FEB 25 2017	2017	Gallium substituted garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 has been synthesized via a sol-gel (SG) and solid-state reaction (SSR) routes. The results of scanning electron spectroscopy measurements showed that the SG process produced statistically smaller powder particles than the SSR route. A structural transformation from tetragonal to cubic phase occurs at an elevated level of Gallium doping, resulting in a cubic structure for Li5.5La3Zr2Ga0.5O12 (0.5Ga-LLZO). To facilitate the comparison of sintering procedures, powders of Ga-doped LLZO were sintered by both a conventional sintering process and a spark plasma sintering (SPS) process. For pellets sintered by SPS at 950 degrees C for 5 min, grain coarsening was limited due to the short sintering duration. However, grain coarsening was observed in the SPS pellets sintered at 950 degrees C, 1000 degrees C, and 1100 degrees C for 5 h in air. The ionic conductivity was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at temperatures in the range of 20 degrees C-100 degrees C. The total ionic conductivity was found to increase with increased relative density and larger grain size. The highest total ionic conductivity at room temperature was found to be in the range of 5.81 x 10(-5) S/cm (Ea = 0.41 eV) in this work. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The eligible studies (N=19), published between 1996 and 2014, were summarized and the methodologic quality of each was assessed.RESULTS: Our review indicated evidence is available to show hand-hygiene interventions had an effect on reducing acute gastrointestinal illness-associated absenteeism but inadequate evidence is available to show an effect on respiratory illness-associated absenteeism.CONCLUSIONS: The methodologic quality assessment of eligible studies revealed common design flaws, such as lack of randomization, blinding, and attrition, which must be addressed in future studies to strengthen the evidence base on the effect of hand-hygiene interventions on school absenteeism.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1527-3296		MEDLINE:28242074	28242074	
J	Motallebi, Marzieh; Hoag, Dana L; Tasdighi, Ali; Arabi, Mazdak; Osmond, Deanna L								An economic inquisition of water quality trading programs, with a case study of Jordan Lake, NC.								Journal of environmental management											10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.02.039			2017-Feb-24	2017	A water quality trading (WQT) program was promulgated in North Carolina to address water quality issues related to nutrients in the highly urbanizing Jordan Lake Watershed. Although WQT programs are appealing in theory, the concept has not proved feasible in several attempts between point and nonpoint polluters in the United States. Many application hurdles that create wedges between success and failure have been evaluated in the literature. Most programs, however, face multiple hurdles; eliminating one may not clear a pathway to success. Therefore, we identify and evaluate the combined impact of four different wedges including baseline, transaction cost, trading ratio, and trading cost in the Jordan Lake Watershed program. Unfortunately, when applied to the Jordan Lake program, the analysis clearly shows that a traditional WQT program will not be feasible or address nutrient management needs in a meaningful way. The hurdles individually would be difficult to overcome, but together they appear to be unsurmountable. This analysis shows that there is enough information to pre-identify potential hurdles that could inform policy makers where, and how, the concept might work. It would have saved time, energy, and financial resources if North Carolina had done so before embarking to implement their program in the Jordan Lake Watershed.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-8630		MEDLINE:28242115	28242115	
J	Peng, Congyue Annie; Russo, Julia; Lyda, Todd A; Marcotte, William R Jr								Polyelectrolyte Fiber Assembly of Plant-Derived Spider Silk-like Proteins.								Biomacromolecules											10.1021/acs.biomac.6b01552			2017-Feb-24	2017	Spider dragline silk is a proteinaceous material that combines superior toughness and biocompatibility, which makes it a promising biomaterial. The distinct protein structure and the fiber formation process contribute to the superior toughness of dragline silk. Previously, we have produced recombinant spider silk-like proteins in transgenic tobacco that are readily purified from plant extracts. The plant-derived spidroin-like proteins consisted of native major ampullate spidroin 1 or spidroin 2 N- and C-termini flanking 8, 16, or 32 copies of their respective consensus block repeats (mini-spidroins). Here, we present the generation of fibers from mini-spidroins (rMaSp1R8 and rMaSp2R8) by polyelectrolyte complex formation using an anionic polyelectrolyte, gellan gum. Mini-spidroins, when treated with acetic acid and cross-linked by glutaraldehyde, formed a thin film at the interface when overlaid with a gellan gum solution. Immediate pulling of the film resulted in autofluorescent fibrous materials from either mini-spidroin alone or a combination of rMaSp1R8 and rMaSp2R8 (70:30). Addition of chitosan to the mini-spidroin solutions permitted continuous fiber production until the spinning dope supply was exhausted. When air-dried as-spun fibers were rehydrated and stretched in water, the fiber diameter decreased and the overall toughness improved. This study showed that spider silk-like fibers can be produced in large quantities through charge attraction that assembles chitosan, mini-spidroins, and gellan gum into fibrous complexes. We speculate that the spider silk self-assembly process in the duct may involve attraction of variously charged chitinous polymers, spidroins, and glycoproteins.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1526-4602		MEDLINE:28196414	28196414

ACS applied materials & interfaces				9	7			6488	6496		10.1021/acsami.6b16330			2017-Feb-22	2017	Lanthanide-based organometallic materials are well-known candidate triboluminescent (TL) materials that can show bright emission when a mechanical force is applied. These materials are usually in the form of crystalline powders, and it is often useful to integrate these samples into a polymer matrix in order to achieve processability, enabling coating from a solution/molten state or fabrication as a complex-shaped matrix. In this work, micrometer-sized europium tetrakis (dibenzoylmethide) triethylammonium (EuD4TEA) crystals were synthesized and integrated with various transparent polymers (PMMA, PS, PVDF, and PU) using two approaches: (i) blending and (ii) surface impregnation. In the former method, the crystalline particles were molecularly dissolved; therefore, a TL response cannot be achieved. More than 10 wt % TL crystals in the composite is needed to obtain TL signals. However, TL signal was achieved at 2.5 wt % when a composite was prepared by the latter approach. TL intensity shows exponential decay with consecutive mechanical action. The TL emission of PU-based surface impregnated composite expires with long-lived emission, and maximum TL response with respect to applied force was measured between 2.45 and 42.0 N.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:28125205	28125205	
J	Szymkowicz, Dana B; Sims, Kaleigh C; Castro, Noemi M; Bridges, William C; Bain, Lisa J								Embryonic-only arsenic exposure in killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) reduces growth and alters muscle IGF levels one year later.								Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)				186				1	10		10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.02.020			2017-Feb-20	2017	Arsenic is a contaminant of drinking water and crops in many parts of the world. Epidemiological studies have shown that arsenic exposure is linked to decreased birth weight, weight gain, and proper skeletal muscle function. The goal of this study was to use killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) as a model to determine the long-term effects of embryonic-only arsenic exposure on muscle growth and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway. Killifish embryos were exposed to 0, 50, 200 or 800ppb AsIII from fertilization until hatching. Juvenile fish were reared in clean water and muscle samples were collected at 16, 28, 40 and 52 weeks of age. There were significant reductions in condition factors, ranging from 12 to 17%, in the fish exposed to arsenic at 16, 28 and 40 weeks of age. However, by 52 weeks, no significant changes in condition factors were seen. Alterations in IGF-1R and IGF-1 levels were assessed as a potential mechanism by which growth was reduced. While there no changes in hepatic IGF-1 transcripts, skeletal muscle cells can also produce their own IGF-1 and/or alter IGF-1 receptor levels to help enhance growth. After a 200 and 800ppb embryonic exposure, fish grown in clean water for 16 weeks had IGF-1R transcripts that were 2.8-fold and 2-fold greater, respectively, than unexposed fish. Through 40 weeks of age, IGF1-R remained elevated in the 200ppb and 800ppb embryonic exposure groups by 1.8-3.9-fold, while at 52 weeks of age, IGF-1R levels were still significantly increased in the 800ppb exposure group. Skeletal muscle IGF-1 transcripts were also significantly increased by 1.9-5.1 fold through the 52 weeks of grow-out in clean by water in the 800ppb embryonic exposure group. Based on these results, embryonic arsenic exposure has long-term effects in that it reduces growth and increases both IGF-1 and IGF-1R levels in skeletal muscle even 1year after the exposure has ended.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1879-1514		MEDLINE:28237603	28237603

Journal of cardiovascular translational research											10.1007/s12265-017-9733-5			2017-Feb-17	2017	Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs), derived from glutaraldehyde crosslinked (GLUT) porcine aortic valve leaflets or bovine pericardium (BP), are used to replace defective heart valves. However, valve failure can occur within 12-15years due to calcification and/or progressive structural degeneration. We present a novel fabrication method that utilizes carbodiimide, neomycin trisulfate, and pentagalloyl glucose crosslinking chemistry (TRI) to better stabilize the extracellular matrix of BP. We demonstrate that TRI-treated BP is more compliant than GLUT-treated BP. GLUT-treated BP exhibited permanent geometric deformation and complete alteration of apparent mechanical properties when subjected to induced static strain. TRI BP, on the other hand, did not exhibit such permanent geometric deformations or significant alterations of apparent mechanical properties. TRI BP also exhibited better resistance to enzymatic degradation in vitro and calcification in vivo when implanted subcutaneously in juvenile rats for up to 30days.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1937-5395		MEDLINE:28213846	28213846	
J	Silva, Clodoaldo J.; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Nonlinear flexural response of a slender cantilever beam of constant thickness and linearly-varying width to a primary resonance excitation								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				389				438	453		10.1016/j.jsv.2016.11.029			FEB 17 2017	2017	Despite the shear amount of research studies on nonlinear flexural dynamics of cantilever beams, very few efforts address the practical geometry involving a constant thickness and linearly-varying width. This stems from the nature of the associated linear eigenvalue problem which cannot be easily solved in closed form. In this paper, we present a closed form solution to this particular linear eigenvalue problem in the form of a general Meijer-G differential equation for which a solution is readily available in the shape of the Meijer-G functions. Using this approach, the exact linear modal frequencies and shapes are obtained and used in the discretization of the nonlinear partial-differential equation describing the dynamics of the system. The discretized system of ordinary-differential equations is then solved using the method of multiple scales to obtain an approximate analytical solution describing the primary resonance behavior of a given vibration mode. An analytical expression for the modal effective nonlinearity is obtained and used to analyze the influence of the beam's tapering on the nonlinear primary resonance behavior of the response (softening/hardening). Results are then compared to a finite element (FE) solution of the linear eigenvalue problem in which the modal shapes obtained using the FE method are fit into a set of orthogonal polynomial functions and used to discretize the nonlinear problem. It is shown that, while the modal frequencies obtained using the FE method approximate those obtained analytically with negligible error (less than 1%), there is a substantial error in the resulting estimates of the modal effective nonlinearity. This indicates that, even negligible errors in the approximate solution of the linear problem, can propagate to become significant when analyzing the nonlinear problem further reinforcing the importance of the exact solution.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of applying microwave assisted grafting polymerization to affect nylon material for protein separation. The C-CP fiber surfaces were characterized by attenuated total reflection (ATR) infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The anticipated carbonyl peak at 1722.9 cm(-1) was found on the nylon-COOH fibers, but was not found on the native fiber, indicating the presence of the polyacrylic acid on nylon fibers after grafting. The nylon-COOH phase showed a similar to 12x increase in lysozyme dynamic binding capacity (similar to 12 mg mL(-1)) when compared to the native fiber phase (similar to 1 mg mL(-1)). The loading capacity of the nylon-COOH phase is nearly independent of the lysozyme loading concentration (0.05-1 mg mL(-1)) and the mobile phase linear velocity (7.3-73 mm s(-1)). The reproducibility of the lysozyme recovery from the nylon-COOH (RSD = 0.3%, n = 10) and the batch-to-batch variability in the functionalization (RSD = 3%, n = 5) were also investigated, revealing very high levels of consistency. Fast baseline separations of myoglobin, alpha-chymotrypsinogen A, cytochrome c and lysozyme were achieved using the nylon-COOH column. It was found that a 5x increase in the mobile phase linear velocity (7.3-to-36.5 mm s(-1)) had little effect on the separation resolution. The microwave-assisted grafting polymerization has great potential as a generalized surface modification methodology across the applications of C-CP fibers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters				27	4			755	758		10.1016/j.bmcl.2017.01.043			2017-Feb-15	2017	A sulfonamidebenzamide series was assessed for anti-kinetoplastid parasite activity based on structural similarity to the antiparasitic drug, nifurtimox. Through structure-activity optimization, derivatives with limited mammalian cell toxicity and increased potency toward African trypanosomes and Leishmania promastigotes were developed. Compound 22 had the best potency against the trypanosome (EC50=0.010muM) while several compounds showed 10-fold less potency against Leishmania promastigotes without impacting mammalian cells (EC50>25muM). While the chemotype originated from an unrelated optimization program aimed at selectively activating an apoptotic pathway in mammalian cancer cells, our preliminary results suggest that a distinct mechanism of action from that observed in mammalian cells is responsible for the promising activity observed in parasites.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1464-3405		MEDLINE:28119024	28119024

Determination and correlation of the partition coefficients of 48 volatile organic and environmentally relevant compounds between air and silicone oil								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				310				72	78		10.1016/j.cej.2016.10.086			FEB 15 2017	2017	Many emerging bioprocesses include a second, non-aqueous phase liquid in which the key substrate or product partitions for either enhanced interphase mass transfer, concentration dampening, or in-situ product extraction. Knowledge of the partition coefficient between air and the non-aqueous is relevant for process optimization and modeling. In here, experiments were conducted to determine the air-silicon oil partition coefficients (P) of 48 environmentally relevant compounds including many volatile organic compounds, chlorinated solvents, and aromatics compounds. A mass balance method gave reliable results, whereas the EPICS method did not. The value of the ratio of Henry's constant (H) divided by P which is the partition coefficient between silicone oil and water served as a parameter to distinguish which compound would most benefit from including silicon oil as a non-aqueous phase. P values decreased slightly with decreasing viscosity of silicon oil between 50 and 5 cSt, and a simple relationship was proposed to calculate P at 5 or 50 cSt based on values at 20 cSt. Lastly, a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model using the Wiener index as a single parameter could successfully fit P values within specific chemical groups. Overall, the mini-database of P values and models developed in this study provide new tools for the optimization and modeling of processes that include silicon oil as a second liquid phase.

Mechanistically-informed damage detection using dynamic measurements: Extended constitutive relation error								MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING				85				312	328		10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.08.013			FEB 15 2017	2017	Model-based damage detection entails the calibration of damage-indicative parameters in a physics-based computer model of an undamaged structural system against measurements collected from its damaged counterpart. The approach relies on the premise that changes identified in the damage-indicative parameters during calibration reveal the structural damage in the system. In model-based damage detection, model calibration has traditionally been treated as a process, solely operating on the model output without incorporating available knowledge regarding the underlying mechanistic behavior of the structural system. In this paper, the authors propose a novel approach for model-based damage detection by implementing the Extended Constitutive Relation Error (ECRE), a method developed for error localization in finite element models. The ECRE method was originally conceived to identify discrepancies between experimental measurements and model predictions for a structure in a given healthy state. Implementing ECRE for damage detection leads to the evaluation of a structure in varying healthy states and determination of discrepancy between model predictions and experiments due to damage. The authors developed an ECRE-based damage detection procedure in which the model error and structural damage are identified in two distinct steps and demonstrate feasibility of the procedure in identifying the presence, location and relative severity of damage on a scaled two-story steel frame for damage scenarios of varying type and severity.

Variation of the surface temperature allows the transition from a pure quantum regime, where single-phonon events are observed, to the classical regime, where multiphonon excitations are observed. The latter can be reproduced by classical calculations. Therefore, our data lie on the border between the coherent quantum regime and the incoherent classical regime.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2469-9950			CCC:000393742700004		
J	Zheng, Ting; Yu, Xiaoyan; Pilla, Srikanth								Mechanical and moisture sensitivity of fully bio-based dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose cross-linked soy protein isolate films								CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS				157				1333	1340		10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.11.011			FEB 10 2017	2017	Dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose (DCMC) crosslinked soy protein isolate (SPI) films were prepared by solvent casting method. Effect of DCMC treatment on mechanical properties, water sensitivity, light barrier properties and thermal stability were investigated. Significant increase in tensile strength (TS) was observed (up to 218%), suggesting occurrence of highly effective crosslinking between SPI and DCMC. Significant improvement in TS compared to other dialdehyde polysaccharide crosslinking agents such as dialdehyde starch is likely due to higher compatibility of DCMC with SPI, as was further confirmed by SEM images. Crosslinking also led to reduction in water vapor permeability and moisture content along with an increase of insoluble mass percentage, indicating improvement in water resistance of these bio-based protein films. Thermal stability of protein films also showed improvement post crosslinking of DCMC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal of biomechanics				52				48	54		10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.12.003			2017-Feb-08	2017	This study compares the physiological responses of systemic-to-pulmonary shunted single ventricle patients to pulsatile and continuous flow ventricular assist devices (VADs). Performance differences between pulsatile and continuous flow VADs have been clinically observed, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Six systemic-to-pulmonary shunted single ventricle patients (mean BSA=0.30m2) were computationally simulated using a lumped-parameter network tuned to match patient specific clinical data. A first set of simulations compared current clinical implementation of VADs in single ventricle patients. A second set modified pulsatile flow VAD settings with the goal to optimize cardiac output (CO). For all patients, the best-case continuous flow VAD CO was at least 0.99L/min greater than the optimized pulsatile flow VAD CO (p=0.001). The 25 and 50mL pulsatile flow VADs exhibited incomplete filling at higher heart rates that reduced CO as much as 9.7% and 37.3% below expectations respectively. Optimization of pulsatile flow VAD settings did not achieve statistically significant (p<0.05) improvement to CO. Results corroborate clinical experience that continuous flow VADs produce higher CO and superior ventricular unloading in single ventricle patients. Impaired filling leads to performance degradation of pulsatile flow VADs in the single ventricle circulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1873-2380		MEDLINE:28038771	28038771

Evaluating the Life Cycle Environmental Benefits and Trade-Offs of Water Reuse Systems for Net-Zero Buildings								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				51	3			1110	1119					FEB 7 2017	2017	Aging water infrastructure and increased water scarcity have resulted in higher interest in water reuse and decentralization. Rating systems for high-performance buildings implicitly promote the use of building-scale, decentralized water supply and treatment technologies. It is important to recognize the potential benefits and trade-offs of decentralized and centralized water systems in the context of high-performance buildings. For this reason and to fill a gap in the current literature, we completed a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the decentralized water system of a highperformance, net-zero energy, net-zero water building (NZB) that received multiple green building certifications and compared the results with two modeled buildings (conventional and water efficient) using centralized water systems. We investigated the NZB's impacts over varying lifetimes, conducted a break-even analysis, and included Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. The results show that, although the NZB performs better in most categories than the conventional building, the water efficient building generally outperforms the NZB. The lifetime of the NZB, septic tank aeration, and use of solar energy have been found to be important factors in the NZB's impacts. While these findings are specific to the case study building, location, and treatment technologies, the framework for comparison of water and wastewater impacts of various buildings can be applied during building design to aid decision making. As we design and operate high-performance buildings, the potential trade-offs of advanced decentralized water treatment systems should be considered.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X			CCC:000393738700015	28002664

Community mental health journal											10.1007/s10597-017-0104-0			2017-Feb-06	2017	Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) includes a continuum of disorders that occur in children as a result of their mothers' consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. The most severe of these disorders is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). FASD presents differently in every child, but all children with FASD have intellectual and/or behavioral impairments. There is no cure for FASD, but research shows that early intervention and life-long support help those born with FASD to manage the difficulties that come with it. This paper examines the characteristics, complications, and treatment for FASD.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1573-2789		MEDLINE:28168434	28168434

Puleo showed that alpha(1)(G) + tau(B)(G) <= 5n(2)/16 for every n-vertex graph G.

Novel gene-sequence markers for isolate tracking within Monilinia fructicola lesions. Pest Management Science xxx:xxx-xxx.BACKGROUND: Monilinia fructicola is a diverse pathogen of pome and stone fruits that causes severe economic losses each year. However, little is known about inoculum flow within or between orchards and pathogen establishment in an orchard, because few methods exist for detecting diversity or tracking isolates over time. SSR loci are an effective option, but may be confounded by a high degree of mutability and potential sensitivity to abiotic stress.RESULTS: Through transcriptome analysis, we identified novel markers mrr1, DHFR, and MfCYP01 and validated stability of these markers under fungicide stress in natural infection sites. Nucleotide variation within mrr1, DHFR, and MfCYP01 sequences differentiated isolates at all spatial scales: within the same infection site, between trees, and between two farms. Sequenced regions were also effective for matching isolates collected from blossoms at the beginning of the season to progeny in cankers obtained at the end of the season.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results show that mrr1, DHFR, and MfCYP01 are able to accurately differentiate M. fructicola isolates at the population level, can be used to track isolates over time, and are more stable than SSRs under external stresses. Either by themselves or combined with SSR markers, these gene-encoding regions are a much-needed tool for better understanding M. fructicola population dynamics.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1526-4998		MEDLINE:28160377	28160377	
J	Rowe, Paul; Eksioglu, Burak; Eksioglu, Sandra								Recycling procurement strategies with variable yield suppliers								ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH				249	1-2			215	234					FEB 2017	2017	This paper addresses a procurement issue facing a polystyrene packaging manufacturer considering its optimal purchasing strategies between two suppliers-one providing virgin material, the other offering recycled material. We model a single-period scenario where each supplier sells product with a known yield distribution at market pricing. The manufacturer must choose whether to sole-source or dual-source, as well as determine how much material to purchase from each supplier to meet deterministic demand. Our results indicate that there is a range of prices from the recycled material supplier where dual-sourcing will lead to higher manufacturer profits compared to sole-sourcing. We show, based on the procurement strategy, the optimal quantities to purchase to maximize manufacturer's expected profit.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-5330			CCC:000394151400013

A multi-objective, hub-and-spoke model to design and manage biofuel supply chains								ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH				249	1-2			351	380					FEB 2017	2017	In this paper we propose a multi-objective, mixed integer linear programming model to design and manage the supply chain for biofuels. This model captures the trade-offs that exist between costs, environmental and social impacts of delivering biofuels. The in-bound supply chain for biofuel plants relies on a hub-and-spoke structure which optimizes transportation costs of biomass. The model proposed optimizes the emissions due to transportation-related activities in the supply chain. The model also optimizes the social impact of biofuels. The social impacts are evaluated by the number of jobs created. The multi-objective optimization model is solved using an augmented -constraint method. The method provides a set of Pareto optimal solutions. We develop a case study using data from the Midwest region of the USA. The numerical analyses estimates the quantity and cost of cellulosic ethanol delivered under different scenarios generated. The insights we provide will help policy makers design policies which encourage and support renewable energy production.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-5330			CCC:000394151400018		
J	Gong, Chao; Jiang, Xiuping								Characterizing Salmonella Contamination in Two Rendering Processing Plants								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				80	2			265	270					FEB 2017	2017	A microbiological investigation on Salmonella contamination was conducted in two U.S. rendering plants to investigate the potential cross-contamination of Salmonella in the rendering processing environment. Sampling locations were predetermined at the areas where Salmonella contamination may potentially occur, including raw materials receiving, crax (rendered materials before grinding process) grinding, and finished meal loading-out areas. Salmonella was either enumerated directly on xylose lysine Tergitol 4 agar plates or enriched in Rappaport-Vassiliadis and tetrathionate broths. The presumptive Salmonella isolates were confirmed using CHROMagar plating and latex agglutination testing and then characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, serotyping, and biofilm-forming determination. Among 108 samples analyzed, 79 (73%) samples were Salmonella positive after enrichment. Selected Salmonella isolates (n = 65) were assigned to 31 unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, with 16 Salmonella serotypes, including Typhimurium and Mbandaka, identified as predominant serotypes and 10 Salmonella strains determined as strong biofilm formers. Our results indicated that the raw materials receiving area was the primary source of Salmonella and that the surfaces surrounding crax grinding and finished meal loading-out areas harbor Salmonella in biofilms that may recontaminate the finished meals. The same Salmonella serotypes found in both raw materials receiving and the finished meal loading-out areas suggested a potential of cross-contamination between different areas in the rendering processing environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0362-028X			CCC:000393724600010	28221971

Alpha richness and niche breadth of a widespread group of aquatic insects in Nearctic and Neotropical streams								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				62	2			329	339					FEB 2017	2017	The increase in species richness from the poles to the equator is one of the most consistent biogeographical patterns of species distributions. Using a globally distributed group of stream insects-black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae)-we addressed two questions: (i) How does -richness vary among streams of the New World? (ii) Does niche width, as measured by a proxy based on stream-habitat conditions, differ between the Nearctic and Neotropical regions? In our analyses of -richness, we consider the potential effects of area, elevation, sample size and season. Examining 296 streams in 12 regional collections, we found that -richness differed little among New World streams. Using stream variables to delineate a measure of niche breadth, we also found no difference in the mean niche breadth of species between North and South America. Our results are consistent with niche conservatism. In other words, as black flies expanded into the tropics, their mean niche breadth did not contract relative to that of their northern counterparts.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0046-5070			CCC:000393793100009		
J	Narman, Husnu S.; Hossain, Md. Shohrab; Atiquzzaman, Mohammed; Shen, Haiying								Scheduling internet of things applications in cloud computing								ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS				72	1-2			79	93					FEB 2017	2017	Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the greatest technology revolutions in the history. Due to IoT potential, daily objects will be consciously worked in harmony with optimized performances. However, today, technology is not ready to fully bring its power to our daily life because of huge data analysis requirements in instant time. On the other hand, the powerful data management of cloud computing gives IoT an opportunity to make the revolution in our life. However, the traditional cloud computing server schedulers are not ready to provide services to IoT because IoT consists of a number of heterogeneous devices and applications which are far away from standardization. Therefore, to meet the expectations of users, the traditional cloud computing server schedulers should be improved to efficiently schedule and allocate IoT requests. There are several proposed scheduling algorithms for cloud computing in the literature. However, these scheduling algorithms are limited because of considering neither heterogeneous servers nor dynamic scheduling approach for different priority requests. Our objective is to propose dynamic dedicated server scheduling for heterogeneous and homogeneous systems to efficiently provide desired services by considering priorities of requests. Results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm improves throughput up to 40 % in heterogeneous and homogeneous cloud computing systems for IoT requests. Our proposed scheduling algorithm and related analysis will help cloud service providers build efficient server schedulers which are adaptable to homogeneous and heterogeneous environments by considering system performance metrics, such as drop rate, throughput, and utilization in IoT.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-4347			CCC:000393759400008

One line of enquiry to probe this idea is to understand processes in our cosmological history in terms of York time. Following a review of the theoretical motivations, we focus on slow-roll inflation and the freezing and Hubble re-entry of cosmological perturbations. While the physics is, of course, observationally equivalent, we show how the mathematical account of these processes is distinct from the conventional account in terms of standard cosmological or conformal time. We also consider the cosmological York-timeline more broadly and contrast it with the conventional cosmological timeline.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-7701			CCC:000393650700001

Evaluation of substituted ebselen derivatives as potential trypanocidal agents								BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS				27	3			537	541		10.1016/j.bmcl.2016.12.021			FEB 1 2017	2017	Human African trypanosomiasis is a disease of sub-Saharan Africa, where millions are at risk for the illness. The disease, commonly referred to as African sleeping sickness, is caused by an infection by the eukaryotic pathogen, Trypanosoma brucei. Previously, a target-based high throughput screen revealed ebselen (EbSe), and its sulfur analog, EbS, to be potent in vitro inhibitors of the T. brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1). These molecules also exhibited potent trypanocidal activity in vivo. In this manuscript, we synthesized a series of sixteen EbSe and EbS derivatives bearing electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid and methyl ester functional groups, and evaluated the influence of these substituents on the biological efficacy of the parent scaffold. With the exception of one methyl ester derivative, these modifications ablated or blunted the potent TbHI1 inhibition of the parent scaffold. Nonetheless, a few of the methyl ester derivatives still exhibited trypanocidal effects with single-digit micromolar or high nanomolar EC50 values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Relative to politically conservative hedge funds, politically liberal hedge funds exhibit a preference for smaller stocks, less mature companies, volatile stocks, unprofitable companies, non-dividend paying companies, and lottery-type securities. Politically liberal hedge funds are also more likely to enter new positions or fully exit existing positions, and make larger adjustments to their U.S. equity market exposure. Our results suggest that psychological characteristics can influence the portfolio decisions of even those at the very top of the financial sophistication ladder. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This method is an adaptation and extension of the heat conduction method of Vinsome and Westerveld (1980) used to simulate heat losses during thermally enhanced oil recovery. The semi-analytical method is used in place of discretization of the low permeability materials, and it represents the concentration profile in the low permeability materials with a fitting function that is adjusted in each element at each time step. The resulting matrix diffusion fluxes are added to the numerical model as linear concentration-dependent source/sink terms. Since only the high permeability zones need to be discretized, the numerical formulation is extremely efficient compared to traditional approaches that require discretization of both the high and low permeability zones. The semi-analytical method compares favorably with the analytical solution for transient onedimensional diffusion with first order decay, with a two-layer aquifer/aquitard solution, with the solution for transport in a fracture with matrix diffusion and decay, and with a fully numerical solution for transport in a thin sand zone bounded by clay with variable decay rates.

J	Wei, Kai; Arwade, Sanjay R.; Myers, Andrew T.; Valamanesh, Vahid; Pang, Weichiang								Effect of wind and wave directionality on the structural performance of non-operational offshore wind turbines supported by jackets during hurricanes								WIND ENERGY				20	2			289	303					FEB 2017	2017	Risk of hurricane damage is an important factor in the development of the offshore wind energy industry in the United States. Hurricane loads on an offshore wind turbine (OWT), namely wind and wave loads, not only exert large structural demands, but also have temporally changing characteristics, especially with respect to their directions. Waves are less susceptible to rapid changes, whereas wind can change its properties over shorter time scales. Misalignment of local winds and ocean waves occurs regularly during a hurricane. The strength capacity of non-axisymmetric structures such as jackets is sensitive to loading direction and misalignment relative to structural orientation. As an example, this work examines the effect of these issues on the extreme loads and structural response of a non-operational OWT during hurricane conditions. The considered OWT is a 5MW turbine, supported by a jacket structure and located off the Massachusetts coast. A set of 1000 synthetic hurricane events, selected from a catalog simulating 100,000years of hurricane activity, is used to represent hurricane conditions, and the corresponding wind speeds, wave heights and directions are estimated using empirical, parametric models for each hurricane. The impact of wind and wave directions and structural orientation are quantified through a series of nonlinear static analyses under various assumptions for combining the directions of wind and wave and structural orientation for the considered example structure.

FEBS letters				591	4			603	612		10.1002/1873-3468.12573			2017-Feb	2017	ADP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACD) catalyzes the interconversion of acetyl-CoA and acetate. The related succinyl-CoA synthetase follows a three-step mechanism involving a single phosphoenzyme, but a novel four-step mechanism with two phosphoenzyme intermediates was proposed for Pyrococcus ACD. Characterization of enzyme variants of Entamoeba ACD in which the two proposed phosphorylated His residues were individually altered revealed that only His252 is essential for enzymatic activity. Analysis of variants altered at two residues proposed to interact with the phosphohistidine loop that swings between distinct parts of the active site are consistent with a mechanism involving a single phosphoenzyme intermediate. Our results suggest ACDs with different subunit structures may employ slightly different mechanisms to bridge the span between active sites I and II.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1873-3468		MEDLINE:28129670	28129670

Hypertension in pregnancy				36	1			70	76		10.1080/10641955.2016.1239733			2017-Feb	2017	OBJECTIVE: To assess whether poor geographic accessibility to prenatal care, as indicated by long distance trips to prenatal care, produced high blood pressure (HPB) during pregnancy.METHODS: Using the 2007 Los Angeles Mommy and Baby Study for women without hypertension prior to pregnancy (n = 3405), we compared self-reported HBP by travel distance to prenatal care controlling for age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, household income, weight status, and physical activity.RESULTS: Results of the multilevel logistic regression shows traveling more than 50 mi to prenatal care is associated with an increased odds for having HPB during pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] = 2.867, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.079,7.613), as compared with a travel distance shorter than 5 mi. Traveling 5-14 mi (OR = 0.917, 95% CI = 0.715-1.176), 15-29 mi (OR = 0.955, 95% CI = 0.634-1.438), or 30-50 mi (OR = 1.101, 95% CI = 0.485-2.499) were not significantly associated with more risk of HBP during pregnancy.CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the association between poor geographic accessibility to care and the possible harms of travel burdens for pregnant women. Future research that replicates these findings can assist in developing recommendations for pregnant women and health-care accessibility.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1525-6065		MEDLINE:27835033	27835033

Cellulose acetate nanofiber membranes were prepared by electrospinning, strengthened by thermal-mechanical annealing and then converted to cellulose nanofiber mats. Subsequent surface modification transformed the membranes into ion-exchange membranes. Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) was grafted to the surfaces of individual nanofibers that had been modified with poly(glycidyl methacrylate). Permeabilities and cadmium ion-exchange capacities were measured for membranes prepared using different molecular weights of PAA that were grafted from different solvents. Membrane permeabilities were found to depend strongly on PAA molecular weight as a result of chain swelling in water; whereas, Cd ion-exchange capacities were independent of PAA molecular weight. Solvents used for PAA grafting were found to be a primary factor for achieving high Cd binding capacities, which increased with increasing solvent quality. Uptake isotherms at constant pH were well described by the Langmuir model, with maximum capacities that exceeded 160 mg/g, comparable to traditional ion-exchange media. Competitive sorption measurements using representative concentrations of sodium and calcium ions were used to illustrate the selectivity of the membranes for Cd ions and demonstrate their potential for commercial application.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0376-7388	1873-3123		WOS:000392772900043		
J	Altenhoff, Bliss M; Pagano, Christopher C; Kil, Irfan; Burg, Timothy C								Learning to perceive haptic distance-to-break in the presence of friction.								Journal of experimental psychology. Human perception and performance				43	2			231	244		10.1037/xhp0000298			2017-Feb	2017	Two experiments employed attunement and calibration training to investigate whether observers are able to identify material break points in compliant materials through haptic force application. The task required participants to attune to a recently identified haptic invariant, distance-to-break (DTB), rather than haptic stimulation not related to the invariant, including friction. In the first experiment participants probed simulated force-displacement relationships (materials) under 3 levels of friction with the aim of pushing as far as possible into the materials without breaking them. In a second experiment a different set of participants pulled on the materials. Results revealed that participants are sensitive to DTB for both pushing and pulling, even in the presence of varying levels of friction, and this sensitivity can be improved through training. The results suggest that the simultaneous presence of friction may assist participants in perceiving DTB. Potential applications include the development of haptic training programs for minimally invasive (laparoscopic) surgery to reduce accidental tissue damage.

J	Evans, Jacquelyn M; Noorai, Rooksana E; Tsai, Kate L; Starr-Moss, Alison N; Hill, Cody M; Anderson, Kendall J; Famula, Thomas R; Clark, Leigh Anne								Beyond the MHC: A canine model of dermatomyositis shows a complex pattern of genetic risk involving novel loci.								PLoS genetics				13	2			e1006604	e1006604		10.1371/journal.pgen.1006604			2017-Feb	2017	Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a chronic inflammatory myopathy and vasculopathy driven by genetic and environmental influences. Here, we investigated the genetic underpinnings of an analogous, spontaneous disease of dogs also termed dermatomyositis (DMS). As in JDM, we observed a significant association with a haplotype of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (DLA-DRB1*002:01/-DQA1*009:01/-DQB1*001:01), particularly in homozygosity (P-val = 0.0001). However, the high incidence of the haplotype among healthy dogs indicated that additional genetic risk factors are likely involved in disease progression. We conducted genome-wide association studies in two modern breeds having common ancestry and detected strong associations with novel loci on canine chromosomes 10 (P-val = 2.3X10-12) and 31 (P-val = 3.95X10-8). Through whole genome resequencing, we identified primary candidate polymorphisms in conserved regions of PAN2 (encoding p.Arg492Cys) and MAP3K7CL (c.383_392ACTCCACAAA>GACT) on chromosomes 10 and 31, respectively. Analyses of these polymorphisms and the MHC haplotypes revealed that nine of 27 genotypic combinations confer high or moderate probability of disease and explain 93% of cases studied. The pattern of disease risk across PAN2 and MAP3K7CL genotypes provided clear evidence for a significant epistatic foundation for this disease, a risk further impacted by MHC haplotypes. We also observed a genotype-phenotype correlation wherein an earlier age of onset is correlated with an increased number of risk alleles at PAN2 and MAP3K7CL. High frequencies of multiple genetic risk factors are unique to affected breeds and likely arose coincident with artificial selection for desirable phenotypes. Described herein is the first three-locus association with a complex canine disease and two novel loci that provide targets for exploration in JDM and related immunological dysfunction.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1553-7404		MEDLINE:28158183	28158183	
J	Peng, Yunhui; Alexov, Emil								Computational investigation of proton transfer, pKa shifts and pH-optimum of protein-DNA and protein-RNA complexes.								Proteins				85	2			282	295		10.1002/prot.25221			2017-Feb	2017	Protein-nucleic acid interactions play a crucial role in many biological processes. This work investigates the changes of pKa values and protonation states of ionizable groups (including nucleic acid bases) that may occur at protein-nucleic acid binding. Taking advantage of the recently developed pKa calculation tool DelphiPka, we utilize the large protein-nucleic acid interaction database (NPIDB database) to model pKa shifts caused by binding. It has been found that the protein's interfacial basic residues experience favorable electrostatic interactions while the protein acidic residues undergo proton uptake to reduce the energy cost upon the binding. This is in contrast with observations made for protein-protein complexes. In terms of DNA/RNA, both base groups and phosphate groups of nucleotides are found to participate in binding. Some DNA/RNA bases undergo pKa shifts at complex formation, with the binding process tending to suppress charged states of nucleic acid bases. In addition, a weak correlation is found between the pH-optimum of protein-DNA/RNA binding free energy and the pH-optimum of protein folding free energy. Overall, the pH-dependence of protein-nucleic acid binding is not predicted to be as significant as that of protein-protein association.

J	Wang, Jin; Cao, Shuyang; Pang, Weichiang; Cao, Jinxin								Experimental Study on Effects of Ground Roughness on Flow Characteristics of Tornado-Like Vortices								BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY				162	2			319	339		10.1007/s10546-016-0201-6			FEB 2017	2017	The three-dimensional wind velocity and dynamic pressure for stationary tornado-like vortices that developed over ground of different roughness categories were investigated to clarify the effects of ground roughness. Measurements were performed for various roughness categories and two swirl ratios. Variations of the vertical and horizontal distributions of velocity and pressure with roughness are presented, with the results showing that the tangential, radial, and axial velocity components increase inside the vortex core near the ground under rough surface conditions. Meanwhile, clearly decreased tangential components are found outside the core radius at low elevations. The high axial velocity inside the vortex core over rough ground surface indicates that roughness produces an effect similar to a reduced swirl ratio. In addition, the pressure drop accompanying a tornado is more significant at elevations closer to the ground under rough compared with smooth surface conditions. We show that the variations of the flow characteristics with roughness are dependent on the vortex-generating mechanism, indicating the need for appropriate modelling of tornado-like vortices.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-8314	1573-1472		WOS:000392495200007

This behavior is quantified in terms of stored (DeltaS S ) entropic energy density, the maximum strain (epsilonmax ), and stress (sigmaSF at epsilonmax ). This concept allows quantitative assessments of the shape-memory effect (SME) and can be utilized in any material that exhibits a glass-transition temperature (T g ) and a rubbery plateau.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-4095		MEDLINE:27966797	27966797	
J	Yebi, Admu; Ayalew, Beshah; Pilla, Srikanth; Yu, Xiaoyan								Model-Based Robust Optimal Control for Layer-By-Layer Ultraviolet Processing of Composite Laminates								JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				139	2					021008	10.1115/1.4034782			FEB 2017	2017	This paper first discusses some experimental verification of proposed ultraviolet (UV) radiation curing process models and then it outlines a robust process optimization and control scheme for layer-by-layer UV processing of a thick composite laminate. The experiments include UV transmission, cure kinetics, and in situ temperature measurements for UV curing of a onedimensional (1D) composite material sample. The validated models are used to motivate how optimizing the layer-by-layer curing process can help address the challenge of maintaining through-cure due to the in-domain attenuation of the UV input during thick-part fabrication. The key insight offered is to model the layer-by-layer deposition and curing process as a multimode hybrid dynamic system with a growing spatial domain, where the interlayer hold times and the UV intensity at each layer addition can be taken as the augmented control variables to be selected optimally. Specifically, the control input is set to have feed forward and output feedback components, which act on the UV intensity at each layer and are constructed to track a reference surface temperature trajectory. The feedback gains at each layer addition are designed by posing a robust optimization problem that penalizes the sensitivity of the objective function to process uncertainties. It is illustrated using simulation analyses that augmented control with robust optimal static feedback of UV intensity at each layer and nominal optimization of the interlayer hold times gives very close tracking of a desired final cure level distribution in the presence of parametric uncertainty.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0434	1528-9028		WOS:000391561400008

These motions are achieved without muscles and they have inspired a wide spectrum of engineered materials and structures. This review summarizes the recent developments of plant-inspired adaptive structures and materials for morphing and actuation. We begin with a brief overview of the actuation strategies and physiological features associated to these plant movements, showing that different combinations of these strategies and features can lead to motions with different deformation characteristics and response speeds. Then we offer a comprehensive survey of the plant-inspired morphing and actuation systems, including pressurized cellular structures, osmotic actuation, anisotropic hygroscopic materials, and bistable systems for rapid movements. Although these engineered systems are vastly different in terms of their size scales and intended applications, their working principles are all related to the actuation strategies and physiological features in plants. This review is to promote future cross-disciplinary studies between plant biology and engineering, which can foster new solutions for many applications such as morphing airframes, soft robotics and kinetic architectures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1748-3182	1748-3190		WOS:000391689400001

We demonstrate that SNS users instead adhere to one of a small set of distinct privacy management strategies that are partially related to their level of privacy feature awareness. Using advanced Factor Analysis methods on the self-reported privacy behaviors and feature awareness of 308 Facebook users, we extrapolate six distinct privacy management strategies, including: Privacy Maximizers, Selective Sharers, Privacy Balancers, Self-Censors, Time Savers/Consumers, and Privacy Minimalists and six classes of privacy proficiency based on feature awareness, ranging from Novices to Experts. We then cluster users on these dimensions to form six distinct behavioral profiles of privacy management strategies and six awareness profiles for privacy proficiency. We further analyze these privacy profiles to suggest opportunities for training and education, interface redesign, and new approaches for personalized privacy recommendations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1071-5819	1095-9300		WOS:000390628800009

Many sport heritages involve playing particular sports, which may enhance physical activity aims of the healthy stadia agenda, while stadium tours - a staple of sport heritage industry - may also incorporate healthy stadia narratives. Similarly, sport heritage and the healthy stadia agenda are potential partners in public education, both through informal stadia-based public programmes and venue displays as well as more formal curriculum-based programming at sporting venues. However, the relationship between sport heritage and the healthy stadia agenda may also have some issues and challenges as well, as many sport heritages involve health risks and unhealthy behaviour. Ultimately, managers and researchers alike may wish to further consider the relationship between sport heritage and the healthy stadia agenda.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-0437	1743-0445		WOS:000390700000004		
J	Corzine, Keith A.								A New-Coupled-Inductor Circuit Breaker for DC Applications								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS				32	2			1411	1418		10.1109/TPEL.2016.2540930			FEB 2017	2017	In order to eliminate power conversion steps, future microgrids with renewable energy sources are being visualized as dc power systems. System components such as sources (solar panels, fuels cells, etc.) loads, and power conversion have been identified and are readily available. However, when it comes to dc circuit breakers, many designs are still in the experimental phase. The main limitation is that interrupting a current which does not have a zero crossing will sustain an arc. This paper introduces a new type of dc circuit breaker. It uses a short conduction path between the breaker and load as well as mutual coupling to automatically and rapidly switch OFF in response to a fault. The proposed breaker also can have a crowbar type switch at the output so that it can be used as a dc switch. Mathematical analysis, detailed simulation, and laboratory measurements of the new dc switch are included.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0885-8993	1941-0107		WOS:000388867300046

The systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure of rats were measured 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 h after administration every day. Subsequently, the effect of QIGLF on angiotensin-converting enzyme mRNA expression in the kidney of SHRs was evaluated by a polymerase chain reaction. Systolic blood pressure was found to be reduced markedly in the SHRs after a single oral administration.CONCLUSIONThe results show that the effect of QIGLF (50 mg kg(-1) body weight) was similar to that of captopril (10 mg kg(-1) body weight) with respect to lowering systolic blood pressure in SHRs. Therefore, egg white protein-derived peptide QIGLF may be useful in the prevention or treatment of hypertension.

Wetting dynamics of a collapsing fluid hole								PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS				2	1			4006	4006					JAN 26 2017	2017	The collapse dynamics of an axisymmetric fluid cavity that wets the bottom of a rotating bucket bound by vertical sidewalls are studied. Lubrication theory is applied to the governing field equations for the thin film to yield an evolution equation that captures the effect of capillary, gravitational, and centrifugal forces on this converging flow. The focus is on the quasistatic spreading regime, whereby contact-line motion is governed by a constitutive law relating the contact-angle to the contact-line speed. Surface tension forces dominate the collapse dynamics for small holes with the collapse time appearing as a power law whose exponent compares favorably to experiments in the literature. Gravity accelerates the collapse process. Volume dependence is predicted and compared with experiment. Centrifugal forces slow the collapse process and lead to complex dynamics characterized by stalled spreading behavior that separates the large and small hole asymptotic regimes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2469-990X			CCC:000393755600002

The bimetallic nanoparticles were found to be core shell in structure, and their formation was likely facilitated by their interactions with the BNNS. The Pd-Fe/BNNS catalysts were highly effective in representative Suzuki Miyaura reactions, with performances matching or exceeding those of the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the superior catalytic activities were characterized by generally shortened reaction times, minimal Pd usage, excellent reusability of the catalysts and high or nearly quantitative conversion yields in a benign solvent system without the need for any special conditions, such as ligands and surfactants or inert gas protection. The obvious advantages of the Pd Fe/BNNS over similar catalysts based on other supports, such as graphene oxide (rGO), suggest that BNNS may be developed into a versatile platform for many Other important reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			WOS:000392909500055	28051299

They also exhibit interesting and potentially useful phenomena, such as highly efficient energy transfer, anomalous single particle blinking, and twinkling phenomena associated with polaron motion. As little as one dye molecule per nanopartide can efficiently quench the fluorescence of hundreds of polymer chromophore units. Similarly, loss of a single electron can result in quenching of hundreds of chromophores. These phenomena and properties are dictated by the nature of interactions between chromophores in this dense, nanoscale multi-chromophoric system, and are characterized as amplified energy transfer or multiple energy transfer. In this review, we summarize the key aspects of conjugated polymer nanopartides optical properties and phenomena, and discuss the current understanding of exciton dynamics in these and related systems. In particular, our current understanding and theoretical models for amplified or multiple energy transfer based on exciton theory and Forster resonance energy transfer are explored.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000392910400009	28029769	
J	Kelso, Andrew A; Goodson, Steven D; Watts, Leah E; Ledford, LeAnna L; Waldvogel, Sarah M; Diehl, J Nathaniel; Shah, Shivani B; Say, Amanda F; White, Julie D; Sehorn, Michael G								The beta-isoform of BCCIP promotes ADP release from the RAD51 presynaptic filament and enhances homologous DNA pairing.								Nucleic acids research				45	2			711	725		10.1093/nar/gkw877			2017-Jan-25	2017	Homologous recombination (HR) is a template-driven repair pathway that mends DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs), and thus helps to maintain genome stability. The RAD51 recombinase facilitates DNA joint formation during HR, but to accomplish this task, RAD51 must be loaded onto the single-stranded DNA. DSS1, a candidate gene for split hand/split foot syndrome, provides the ability to recognize RPA-coated ssDNA to the tumor suppressor BRCA2, which is complexed with RAD51. Together BRCA2-DSS1 displace RPA and load RAD51 onto the ssDNA. In addition, the BRCA2 interacting protein BCCIP normally colocalizes with chromatin bound BRCA2, and upon DSB induction, RAD51 colocalizes with BRCA2-BCCIP foci. Down-regulation of BCCIP reduces DSB repair and disrupts BRCA2 and RAD51 foci formation. While BCCIP is known to interact with BRCA2, the relationship between BCCIP and RAD51 is not known. In this study, we investigated the biochemical role of the beta-isoform of BCCIP in relation to the RAD51 recombinase. We demonstrate that BCCIPbeta binds DNA and physically and functionally interacts with RAD51 to stimulate its homologous DNA pairing activity. Notably, this stimulatory effect is not the result of RAD51 nucleoprotein filament stabilization; rather, we demonstrate that BCCIPbeta induces a conformational change within the RAD51 filament that promotes release of ADP to help maintain an active presynaptic filament. Our findings reveal a functional role for BCCIPbeta as a RAD51 accessory factor in HR.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1362-4962		MEDLINE:27694622	27694622

The purpose of this study was to explore providers' opinions and concerns related to implementation of CLQ, including ethical issues.METHODS: Twenty key informant oncologists were recruited for individual in-depth interviews through ASCO contacts, purposively selected to represent a wide variety of cancer specialties as well as different levels of familiarity with CLQ (familiar v unfamiliar). Qualitative data analysis was completed by a three-member team using an inductive narrative approach. Themes were examined by participants familiar and unfamiliar with CLQ, and quotations exemplifying each theme are provided.RESULTS: Participants' opinions centered on three main themes: (1) general attitudes regarding learning health care systems, (2) optimal approach to patient consent, and (3) appropriateness of data use. There was clear support for the use of big data in clinical decision making for patients and in research. Unfamiliar participants expressed concerns regarding system protections against patient identification, and both familiar and unfamiliar participants discussed the dilemma of including genetic information. Respondents were in agreement with notifying patients early; however, there was debate over whether patients should opt in or opt out. Overall, there was great concern regarding sharing data with drug companies and insurers.CONCLUSION: Understanding oncologists' perspectives regarding the ethical implications of CLQ implementation is critical to its success. More research is needed on the impact of rapid learning systems on providers, patients, health systems, and the ultimate effect on cancer care.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1935-469X		MEDLINE:28118106	28118106	
J	Schmucker, Hannah S; Park, Jang Pyo; Coissieux, Marie-May; Bentires-Alj, Mohamed; Feltus, F Alex; Booth, Brian								RNA expression profiling reveal differentially regulated growth factor and receptor expression in redirected cancer cells.								Stem cells and development											10.1089/scd.2016.0340			2017-Jan-23	2017	Tumorigenic cells can be redirected to adopt a normal phenotype when transplanted into cleared mammary fat pads of juvenile female mice in specific ratios with normal epithelial cells. The redirected tumorigenic cells enter stem cell niches and provide progeny that differentiate into all mammary epithelial subtypes. We have developed an in vitro model that mimics the in vivo phenomenon. The shift in phenotype to redirection should be accomplished through a return to a normal gene expression state. To measure this shift we interrogated the transcriptome of various in vitro model states in search for casual genes. For this study expression of growth factors, cytokines and their associated receptors was examined. In all we queried 251 growth factor and cytokine related genes. We found numerous growth factor and cytokine genes whose expression levels switched from expression levels seen in cancer cells to expression levels observed in normal cells. The comparisons of gene expression between normal mammary epithelial cells, tumor-derived cells, and redirected cancer cells have revealed insight into active and inactive growth factors and cytokines in cancer cell redirection.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1557-8534		MEDLINE:28112572	28112572

Ia supernova (SN) 2011fe in M101, obtained before, during, and after the time of maximum apparent visual brightness. The excellent time coverage of our spectropolarimetry has allowed better monitoring of the evolution of polarization features than is typical, which has allowed us new insight into the nature of normal SNe. Ia. SN. 2011fe exhibits time-dependent polarization in both the continuum and strong absorption lines. At early epochs, red wavelengths exhibit a degree of continuum polarization of up to 0.4%, likely indicative of a mild asymmetry in the electron-scattering photosphere. This behavior is more common in subluminous SNe. Ia than in normal events, such as SN. 2011fe. The degree of polarization across a collection of absorption lines varies dramatically from epoch to epoch. During the earliest epoch, lambda 4600-5000 angstrom complex of absorption lines shows enhanced polarization at a different position angle than the continuum. We explore the origin of these features, presenting a few possible interpretations, without arriving at a single favored ion. During two epochs near maximum, the dominant polarization feature is associated with the Si lambda 6355 angstrom absorption line. This is common for SNe. Ia, but for SN. 2011fe the polarization of this feature increases after maximum light, whereas for other SNe. Ia, that polarization feature was strongest before maximum light.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000393455400100

Although fungicides are effective against ALB, reduction in the frequency of application would be economically and environmentally beneficial. Resistant melon lines have been identified but the genetic basis of this resistance has not been determined. A saturated melon genetic map was constructed with markers developed through genotyping by sequencing of a recombinant inbred line population (F6 to F10; n = 82) derived from single-seed descent of a F2 population from a cross between the ALB-resistant parent MR-1 and the ALB-susceptible parent Ananas Yokneum. The population was evaluated for A. cucumerina resistance with an augmented block greenhouse study using inoculation with the wounded-leaf method. Multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping identified two QTL that explained 33.9% of variation in lesion area. Several candidate genes within range of these QTL were identified using the C. melo v3.5 genome. Markers linked to these QTL will be used to accelerate efforts to breed melon cultivars resistant to ALB.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-949X			MEDLINE:27868479	27868479

Among those, methanol is particularly important (because of its toxicity) and is typically formed at concentrations much lower than ethanol, presenting a particular challenge that demands the implementation of separation techniques. Aiming to provide an alternative to traditional chromatographic approaches, a hybrid electrophoresis device with electrochemical preprocessing and contactless conductivity detection (hybrid EC-CE-(CD)-D-4) is herein described. The device was applied to perform the electro-oxidation of primary alcohols, followed by the separation and detection of the respective carboxylates. According to the presented results, the optimum conditions were obtained when the sample was diluted with 2 mmol L-1 HNO3 and then electro-oxidized by applying a potential of 1.4 V for 60 s. The oxidation products were then electrokinetically injected by applying a potential of 3 kV for 4 s and separated using a potential of 3 kV and a background running electrolyte (BGE) consisting of 10 mmol L-1 N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (CHES), and 5 mmol L-1 sodium hydroxide (NaOH). n-Propanol was used as an internal standard and the three carboxylate peaks were resolved with baseline separation within <3 min, defining linear calibration curves in the range of 0.10-5.0 mmol L-1.. Limits of detection (LODs) of 20, 40, and 5 mu mol L-1 were obtained for ethanol, n-propanol, and methanol, respectively. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed strategy, a laboratory-made sample (moonshine) was used. Aliquots collected along the beginning of the fractional distillation presented a decreasing methanol ratio (from 4% to <0.5%) and a growing ethanol ratio (from 80% to 100%) in the collected volume.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000392458100046	27992170

There are two major components of this disease: (i) root necrosis and (ii) foliar SDS. Root symptoms consist of root necrosis with vascular discoloration. Foliar SDS is characterized by interveinal chlorosis and leaf necrosis, and in severe cases by flower and pod abscission. A major toxin involved in initiating foliar SDS has been identified. Nothing is known about how root necrosis develops. In order to unravel the mechanisms used by the pathogen to cause root necrosis, the transcriptome of the pathogen in infected soybean root tissues of a susceptible cultivar, 'Essex', was investigated. The transcriptomes of the germinating conidia and mycelia were also examined. Of the 14,845 predicted F. virguliforme genes, we observed that 12,017 (81%) were expressed in germinating conidia and 12,208 (82%) in mycelia and 10,626 (72%) in infected soybean roots. Of the 10,626 genes induced in infected roots, 224 were transcribed only following infection. Expression of several infection-induced genes encoding enzymes with oxidation-reduction properties suggests that degradation of antimicrobial compounds such as the phytoalexin, glyceollin, could be important in early stages of the root tissue infection. Enzymes with hydrolytic and catalytic activities could play an important role in establishing the necrotrophic phase. The expression of a large number of genes encoding enzymes with catalytic and hydrolytic activities during the late infection stages suggests that cell wall degradation could be involved in root necrosis and the establishment of the necrotrophic phase in this pathogen.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000392372300047	28095498	
J	Stiglitz, Roxanne; Mikhailova, Elena; Post, Christopher; Schlautman, Mark; Sharp, Julia								Using an inexpensive color sensor for rapid assessment of soil organic carbon								GEODERMA				286				98	103		10.1016/j.geoderrna.2016.10.027			JAN 15 2017	2017	Quantifying soil organic carbon (SOC) is important for soil management, precision agriculture, soil, mapping and carbon dynamics research. Inexpensive sensor technologies offer the potential for rapid quantification of SOC in laboratory samples as well as in the field. The objective of this study was to use a commercially-available color sensor to develop SOC prediction models for both dry and moist soils from the Piedmont region of South Carolina. Thirty-one soil samples were analyzed for lightness to darkness, redness to greenness, and yellowness to blueness (CIEL*a*b*) color using a Nix Pro (TM) color sensor. Soil color was measured under both thy and moist soil conditions and the depth of each soil sample was also recorded. Using L*, a*, b* and soil depth for each sample as initial predictors, regression analyses were conducted to develop SOC prediction models for dry and moist soils. The resulting residual plots, root mean squared errors (RMSE), and coefficients of determination (R-2) were used to assess model fits for predicting the SOC content of soil. Cross validation was conducted to determine the efficiency of the predictive models and the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) was calculated. The final models included soil depth, L*, and a* as independent variables (dry soils R-2 = 0.7978 and MSPE = 0.0819, moist soils R-2 = 0.7254 and MSPE = 0.1536). The results suggest that soil color sensors have potential for rapid SOC determination, and soil depth and color are useful in predicting SOC content in soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Anthelmintic compounds were extracted with ethyl acetate after sample mixture was made alkaline followed by liquid chromatographic separation using a reversed phase C-18 column. Gradient elution was performed with a mobile phase consisting of water containing 10 mM ammonium formate and methanol. This confirmatory method was validated according to EU requirements. Evaluated validation parameters included specificity, accuracy, precision (repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility), analytical limits (decision limit and detection limit), and applicability. Most parameters were proved to be conforming to the EU requirements. The decision limit (CC alpha) and detection capability (CC beta) for all analytes ranged from 15.84 to 17.96 mu gkg(-1). The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) for all analytes were 0.07 mu gkg(-1) and 0.2 mu gkg(-1), respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to monitoring samples collected from the markets in major cities and proven great potential to be used as a regulatory tool to determine mebendazole residues in animal based foods.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000391972600026	28085912

Shams; Guo, Yuanhao; Cakmak, Miko								Real-time tracking of physical changes and optical anisotropy during drying of aqueous chitosan solution: Modeling of drying								POLYMER				108				206	214		10.1016/j.polymer.2016.11.057			JAN 13 2017	2017	The drying behavior of blade casting aqueous chitosan solution was investigated by means of a custom designed real time characterization system that can track the thickness, weight, temperature and in plane and out-of-plane birefringence. Beyond a critical solvent concentration, initially isotropic cast solution rapidly develops optical anisotropy as detected by out of plane birefringence measurement while it remains isotropic in plane. Increasing drying temperature and air flow speed can both accelerate the drying rate but change the birefringence level in opposite directions. Lower birefringence was obtained at higher drying temperature while, higher birefringence was observed when the air flow speed is increased. This is due to the cumulative effects of the residual stress development in the film and polymer chains relaxation. Using a thermodynamically consistent model developed in the framework of classical irreversible thermodynamics, we quantitatively describe the drying kinetics and evolution of concentration and temperature profiles during the course of drying of the solvent. It was shown that the model can precisely describe the experimental data without using any fitting parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Insects able to acquire fluids that are confined to pores during drought conditions would have an adaptive advantage and increased fitness over other individuals. Here, we performed feeding trials using solutions with magnetic nanoparticles to show that butterflies and flies have mouthparts adapted to pull liquids from porous surfaces using capillary action as the governing principle. In addition, the ability to feed on the liquids collected from pores depends on a relationship between the diameter of the mouthpart conduits and substrate pore size diameter; insects with mouthpart conduit diameters larger than the pores cannot successfully feed, thus there is a limiting substrate pore size from which each species can acquire liquids for fluid uptake. Given that natural selection independently favoured mouthpart architectures that support these methods of fluid uptake (Diptera and Lepidoptera share a common ancestor 280 Ma that had chewing mouthparts), we suggest that the convergence of this mechanism advocates this as an optimal strategy for pulling trace amounts of fluids from porous surfaces.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000393400500012

Acta biomaterialia											10.1016/j.actbio.2017.01.029			2017-Jan-10	2017	Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) provide an unlimited cell source to treat cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of death worldwide. However, current hiPSC-CMs retain an immature phenotype that leads to difficulties for integration with adult myocardium after transplantation. To address this, we recently utilized electrically conductive silicon nanowires (e-SiNWs) to facilitate self-assembly of hiPSC-CMs to form nanowired hiPSC cardiac spheroids. Our previous results showed addition of e-SiNWs effectively enhanced the functions of the cardiac spheroids and improved the cellular maturation of hiPSC-CMs. Here, we examined two important factors that can affect functions of the nanowired hiPSC cardiac spheroids: (1) cell number per spheroid (i.e., size of the spheroids), and (2) the electrical conductivity of the e-SiNWs. To examine the first factor, we prepared hiPSC cardiac spheroids with four different sizes by varying cell number per spheroid (0.5k, 1k, 3k, 7k cells/spheroid). Spheroids with 3k cells/spheroid was found to maximize the beneficial effects of the 3D spheroid microenvironment. This result was explained with a semi-quantitative theory that considers two competing factors: 1) the improved 3D cell-cell adhesion, and 2) the reduced oxygen supply to the center of spheroids with the increase of cell number. Also, the critical role of electrical conductivity of silicon nanowires has been confirmed in improving tissue function of hiPSC cardiac spheroids. These results lay down a solid foundation to develop suitable nanowired hiPSC cardiac spheroids as an innovative cell delivery system to treat cardiovascular diseases.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Due to the limited regenerative capacity of adult human hearts, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have received significant attention because they provide a patient specific cell source to regenerate damaged hearts. Despite the progress, current human hiPSC-CMs retain an immature phenotype that leads to difficulties for integration with adult myocardium after transplantation. To address this, we recently utilized electrically conductive silicon nanowires (e-SiNWs) to facilitate self-assembly of hiPSC-CMs to form nanowired hiPSC cardiac spheroids. Our previous results showed addition of e-SiNWs effectively enhanced the functions of the cardiac spheroids and improved the cellular maturation of hiPSC-CMs. In this manuscript, we examined the effects of two important factors on the functions of nanowired hiPSC cardiac spheroids: (1) cell number per spheroid (i.e., size of the spheroids), and (2) the electrical conductivity of the e-SiNWs. The results from these studies will allow for the development of suitable nanowired hiPSC cardiac spheroids to effectively deliver hiPSC-CMs for heart repair.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1878-7568		MEDLINE:28087483	28087483	
J	Hasegawa, Daniel K; Erickson, Stephanie L; Hersh, Bradley M; Turnbull, Matthew W								Virus Innexins induce alterations in insect cell and tissue function.								Journal of insect physiology				98				173	181		10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.01.003			2017-Jan-07	2017	Polydnaviruses are dsDNA viruses that induce immune and developmental alterations in their caterpillar hosts. Characterization of polydnavirus gene families and family members is necessary to understand mechanisms of pathology and evolution of these viruses, and may aid to elucidate the role of host homologues if present. For example, the polydnavirus vinnexin gene family encodes homologues of insect gap junction genes (innexins) that are expressed in host immune cells (hemocytes). While the roles of Innexin proteins and gap junctions in insect immunity are largely unclear, we previously demonstrated that Vinnexins form functional gap junctions and alter the junctional characteristics of a host Innexin when co-expressed in paired Xenopus oocytes. Here, we test the effect of ectopic vinnexin expression on host cell physiology using both a lepidopteran cell culture model and a dipteran whole organism model. Vinnexin expression in the cell culture system resulted in gene-specific alterations in cell morphology and a slight, but non-statistically significant, reduction in gap junction activity as measured by dye transfer, while ectopic expression of a lepidopteran innexin2 gene led to morphological alterations and increase in gap junction activity. Global ectopic expression in the model dipteran, Drosophila melanogaster, of one vinnexin (vinnexinG) or D. melanogaster innexin2 (Dm-inx2) resulted in embryonic lethality, while expression of the other vinnexin genes had no effect. Furthermore, ectopic expression of vinnexinG, but not other vinnexin genes or Dm-inx2, in D. melanogaster larval gut resulted in developmental arrest in the pupal stage. These data indicate the vinnexins likely have gene-specific roles in host manipulation. They also support the use of Drosophila in further analysis of the role of Vinnexins and other polydnavirus genes in modifying host physiological processes. Finally, our findings suggest the vinnexin genes may be useful to perturb and characterize the physiological functions of insect Innexins.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1879-1611		MEDLINE:28077262	28077262	
J	Panyam, Meghashyam; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Characterizing the effective bandwidth of tri-stable energy harvesters								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				386				336	358		10.1016/j.jsv.2016.09.022			JAN 6 2017	2017	Recently, it has been shown that nonlinear vibratory energy harvesters possessing a tri-stable potential function are capable of harvesting energy efficiently over a wider range of frequencies in comparison to harvesters with a double-well potential function. However, the effect of the design parameters of the harvester on the dynamic response and the effective bandwidth of such devices remains uninvestigated. To fill this void, this paper establishes an analytical approach to characterize the effective frequency bandwidth of harvesters that possess a hexic potential energy function. To achieve this goal, the method of multiple scales is utilized to construct analytical solutions describing the amplitude and stability of the intra- and inter-well dynamics of the harvester. Using these solutions, critical bifurcations in the parameter's space are identified and used to define an effective frequency bandwidth of the harvester. The influence of the electric parameters, namely, the time constant ratio (ratio between the period of the mechanical system and the time constant of the harvesting circuit) and the electromechanical coupling, on the effective frequency bandwidth is analyzed. Experimental studies performed on the harvester are presented to validate some of the theoretical findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Moench] is an important cereal crop for dryland areas in the United States and for small-holder farmers in Africa. Natural variation of sorghum grain composition (protein, fat, and starch) between accessions can be used for crop improvement, but the genetic controls are still unresolved. The goals of this study were to quantify natural variation of sorghum grain composition and to identify singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with variation in grain composition concentrations.Results: In this study, we quantified protein, fat, and starch in a global sorghum diversity panel using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Protein content ranged from 8.1 to 18.8%, fat content ranged from 1.0 to 4.3%, and starch content ranged from 61.7 to 71.1%. Durra and bicolor-durra sorghum from Ethiopia and India had the highest protein and fat and the lowest starch content, while kafir sorghum from USA, India, and South Africa had the lowest protein and the highest starch content. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for sorghum protein, fat, and starch. Previously published RNAseq data was used to identify candidate genes within a GWAS QTL region. A putative alpha-amylase 3 gene, which has previously been shown to be associated with grain composition traits, was identified as a strong candidate for protein and fat variation.Conclusions: We identified promising sources of genetic material for manipulation of grain composition traits, and several loci and candidate genes that may control sorghum grain composition. This survey of grain composition in sorghum germplasm and identification of protein, fat, and starch QTL contributes to our understanding of the genetic basis of natural variation in sorghum grain nutritional traits.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1471-2164			WOS:000391333100001	28056770	
J	Almuziny, Makhdora; Decker, Charlotte; Wang, Dong; Gerard, Patrick; Tharayil, Nishanth								Nutrient Supply and Simulated Herbivory Differentially Alter the Metabolite Pools and the Efficacy of the Glucosinolate-Based Defense System in Brassica Species.								Journal of chemical ecology											10.1007/s10886-016-0811-y			2017-Jan-03	2017	Environmental stress hinders growth of plants and commonly results in the accumulation of carbon-based defense compounds. However, the dynamics of nitrogen (N)-containing defense compounds are less predictable under environmental stress. The impact of nutrient deficiency on plant defenses that require the metabolic conversion of a less toxic compound to a more potent toxin is even more poorly understood. We evaluated the effects of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) deficiency and simulated herbivory on the concentration of metabolites including glucosinolates (GSLs), on the conversion of GSLs to more toxic isothiocyanates (ITCs), and on the activity of myrosinase (MYR) in leaves of Brassica juncea and Brassica nigra. Both species contained GSLs, predominantly sinigrin, but also derivatives of glucobrassicin. Compared to the control, N deficiency increased the sinigrin concentration in both species. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) application increased sinigrin production in B. junceae, whereas in B. nigra MeJA increased sinigrin only under K-deficiency. Compared to the aliphatic-glucosinolates, MeJA application produced a greater compositional change in the profiles of indolic-glucosinolates. In both species the increase in sinigrin content of the tissue was associated with a decrease in its overall nutritive value as assessed by the content of sugars and amino acids. In B. juncea, application of MeJA decreased the conversion of sinigrin to allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) under both N and K deficiency. The potential activity of MYR decreased in both species under N deficiency. The reduced conversion of sinigrin to AITC and the lower activity of MYR suggest that the GSL-ITC defense system might have a limited efficiency in deterring generalist herbivores under environmental stress.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1573-1561		MEDLINE:28050732	28050732

Effect of Natural Organic Matter on Plutonium Sorption to Goethite								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				51	1			699	708		10.1021/acs.est.6b03587			JAN 3 2017	2017	The effect of citric acid (CA), desferrioxamine B (DFOB), fulvic acid (FA), and humic acid (HA) on plutonium (Pu) sorption to goethite was studied as a function of organic carbon concentration and pH using batch sorption experiments at 5 mgC.L-1 and 50 mgC.L-1 natural organic matter (NOM), 10(-9)-10(-10) M Pu-238, and 0.1 g.L-1 goethite concentrations, at pH 3, 5, 7, and 9. Low sorption of ligands coupled with strong Pu complexation decreased Pu sorption at pH 5 and 7, relative to a ligand-free system. Conversely, CA, FA, and HA increased Pu sorption to goethite at pH 3, suggesting ternary complex formation or, in the case of humic acid, incorporation into HA aggregates. Mechanisms for ternary complex formation were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in the absence of Pu. CA and FA demonstrated clear surface interactions at pH 3, HA appeared unchanged suggesting HA aggregates had formed, and no DFOB interactions were observed. Plutonium sorption decreased in the presence of DFOB (relative to a ligand free system) at all pH values examined. Thus, DFOB does not appear to facilitate formation of ternary Pu-DFOB-goethite complexes. At pH 9, Pu sorption in the presence of all NOM increased relative to pH 5 and 7; speciation models attributed this to Pu(IV) hydrolysis competing with ligand complexation, increasing sorption. The results indicate that in simple Pu-NOM-goethite ternary batch systems, NOM will decrease Pu sorption to goethite at all but particularly low pH conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000391346900077	27935282

However, its exploitation is presently limited by the significant specific energy consumption (kWh/m(3)) required by conventional desalination technologies, further exasperated by high unit costs ($/m(3)) and environmental impacts including GHG emissions (g CO2-eq/m(3)), organism impingement/entrainment through intakes, and brine disposal through outfalls. This paper explores the state-of-the-art in present seawater desalination practice, emphasizing membrane-based technologies, while identifying future opportunities in step improvements to conventional technologies and development of emerging, potentially disruptive, technologies through advances in material science, process engineering, and system integration. In this paper, seawater reverse osmosis (RO) serves as the baseline conventional technology. The discussion extends beyond desalting processes into membrane-based salinity gradient energy production processes, which can provide an energy offset to desalination process energy requirements. The future membrane landscape in membrane-based desalination and salinity gradient energy is projected to include ultrahigh permeability RO membranes, renewable-energy driven desalination, and emerging processes including closed-circuit RO, membrane distillation, forward osmosis, pressure retarded osmosis, and reverse electrodialysis according various niche applications and/or hybrids, operating separately or in conjunction with RO.

Peak Shear Strength and Dilatancy of a Pleistocene Age Sand								JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING				143	1			16079	16079					JAN 2017	2017	This paper summarizes results of laboratory investigations performed to quantify the influence of diagenesis (or aging processes) on the peak shear strength and dilatancy of an uncemented Pleistocene age sand sampled near Charleston, South Carolina. Drained triaxial compression tests were performed on high-quality intact specimens retrieved using the in situ freezing and sampling method, and on remolded specimens prepared with matching densities. The stress-strain behavior of intact specimens is accompanied by dilation and a peak shear value, whereas remolded specimens generally contracted throughout shearing. An age-dilatancy term is added to a dilatancy index equation to account for the difference between intact and remolded peak friction angles. The resulting equation suggests that dilatancies due to age and density are suppressed with increasing confining pressure. A profile of peak friction angle with depth is established from the results and compared with estimates from empirical relationships.

J	Koo, Sangmo; Santoni, Samantha M.; Gao, Bruce Z.; Grigoropoulos, Costas P.; Ma, Zhen								Laser-assisted biofabrication in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH				32	1			128	142					JAN 2017	2017	Controlling the spatial arrangement of biomaterials and living cells provides the foundation for fabricating complex biological systems. Such level of spatial resolution (less than 10 mu m) is difficult to be obtained through conventional cell processing techniques, which lack the precision, reproducibility, automation, and speed required for the rapid fabrication of engineered tissue constructs. Recently, laser-assisted biofabrication techniques are being intensively developed with the use of computer-aided processes for patterning and assembling both living and nonliving materials with prescribed 2D or 3D organization. In this review, we discuss laser-assisted fabrication methods, including laser tweezers, multi-photon polymerization, laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT), matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE), and laser ablation as well as their applications in biological science and biomedical engineering. These advanced technologies enable the precise manipulation of in vitro cellular microenvironments and the ability to engineer functional tissue constructs with high complexity and heterogeneity, which serve in regenerative medicine, pharmacology, and basic cell biology studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0884-2914			CCC:000393878300011

One foot out the door: limb function during swimming in terrestrial versus aquatic turtles								BIOLOGY LETTERS				13	1					20160732	10.1098/rsbl.2016.0732			JAN 1 2017	2017	Specialization for a new habitat often entails a cost to performance in the ancestral habitat. Although aquatic lifestyles are ancestral among extant cryptodiran turtles, multiple lineages, including tortoises (Testudinidae) and emydid box turtles (genus Terrapene), independently specialized for terrestrial habitats. To what extent is swimming function retained in such lineages despite terrestrial specialization? Because tortoises diverged from other turtles over 50 Ma, but box turtles did so only 5 Ma, we hypothesized that swimming kinematics for box turtles would more closely resemble those of aquatic relatives than those of tortoises. To test this prediction, we compared high-speed video of swimming Russian tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii), box turtles (Terrapene carolina) and two semi-aquatic emydid species: sliders (Trachemys scripta) and painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We identified different kinematic patterns between limbs. In the forelimb, box turtle strokes most resemble those of tortoises; for the hindlimb, box turtles are more similar to semi-aquatic species. Such patterns indicate functional convergence of the forelimb of terrestrial species, whereas the box turtle hindlimb exhibits greater retention of ancestral swimming motions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000393415600004

This work demonstrates a continuous charge-based separation of fluorescent and plain spherical polystyrene particles with comparable sizes in a -shaped microchannel via the wall-induced electrical lift. The effects of both the direct current electric field in the main-branch and the electric field ratio in between the inlet branches for sheath fluid and particle mixture are investigated on this electrokinetic particle separation. A Lagrangian tracking method based theoretical model is also developed to understand the particle transport in the microchannel and simulate the parametric effects on particle separation. Moreover, the demonstrated charge-based separation is applied to a mixture of yeast cells and polystyrene particles with similar sizes. Good separation efficiency and purity are achieved for both the cells and the particles.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0173-0835	1522-2683		WOS:000393298200011	27507438

In this study, we elucidated water dynamics in MPDAHL using DVS, DSC, and low-field H-1 NMR. Based on the DVS data, we found that MPDAHL sorption kinetics obey a parallel exponential model. DSC results indicated that both water and heating could change the microstructure of MPDAHL. The T-2 parameters of NMR reflected the different phases of moisture absorption revealed that there were 4 categories of water with different states or mobility in the MPDAHL during the moisture absorption process. The fastest fraction T-2b mainly dominated the hygroscopicity of MPDAHL and the absorbed water significantly changed the proton distribution and structure of MPDAHL. Thus, this study shows that DVS, DSC, and low-field H-1 NMR are effective methods for monitoring water mobility and distribution in synthetic peptides. It can be used to improve the quality assurance of functional peptides.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-1147			CCC:000393681000008	27918611

Salinity Influences on Aboveground and Belowground Net Primary Productivity in Tidal Wetlands								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING				22	1	SI				D5015002	10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001223			JAN 2017	2017	Tidal freshwater wetlands are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate change and rising sea levels. However salinification within these systems is poorly understood, therefore, productivity (litterfall, woody biomass, and fine roots) were investigated on three forested tidal wetlands [(1) freshwater, (2) moderately saline, and (3) heavily salt-impacted] and a marsh along the Waccamaw and Turkey Creek in South Carolina. Mean aboveground (litterfall and woody biomass) production on the freshwater, moderately saline, heavily salt-impacted, and marsh, respectively, was 1,061, 492, 79, and 0 g m(-2) year(-1) versus belowground (fine roots) 860, 490, 620, and 2,128 g m(-2) year(-1). Litterfall and woody biomass displayed an inverse relationship with salinity. Shifts in productivity across saline sites is of concern because sea level is predicted to continue rising. Results from the research reported in this paper provide baseline data upon which coupled hydrologic/wetland models can be created to quantify future changes in tidal forest functions.

J	Rose, Ian; Buffett, Bruce; Heister, Timo								Stability and accuracy of free surface time integration in viscous flows								PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS				262				90	100		10.1016/j.pepi.2016.11.007			JAN 2017	2017	Geodynamic simulations increasingly rely on models with a true free surface to investigate questions of dynamic topography, tectonic deformation, gravity perturbations, and global mantle convection. However, implementations of free surface boundary conditions have proven challenging from a standpoint of accuracy, robustness, and stability. In particular, time integration of a free surface tends to suffer from a numerical instability that manifests as sloshing surface motions, also known as the "drunken sailor" instability. This instability severely limits stable timestep sizes to those much smaller than can be used in geodynamic simulations without a free surface. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to deal with these instabilities.Here we analyze the problem of creeping viscous flow with a free surface and discuss the origin of these instabilities. We demonstrate their cause and how existing stabilization schemes work to damp them out. We also propose a new scheme for removing instabilities from free surface calculations. It does not require modifications to the system matrix, nor additional variables, but is instead an explicit scheme based on nonstandard finite differences. It relies on a single stabilization parameter which may be identified with the smallest relaxation timescale of the free surface.Finally, we present numerical results to show the effectiveness of the new approach and discuss the free surface implementation in the open source, community based mantle convection software ASPECT.

Canadian respiratory journal				2017				8921917	8921917		10.1155/2017/8921917			2017	2017	Introduction. The evidence about the association between asthma and outdoor environmental factors has been inadequate for certain allergens. Even less is known about how these associations vary across seasons and climate regions. We reviewed recent literature from North America for research related to outdoor environmental factors and pediatric asthma, with attention to spatial-temporal variations of these associations. Method. We included indexed literature between years 2010 and 2015 on outdoor environmental factors and pediatric asthma, by searching PubMed. Results. Our search resulted in 33 manuscripts. Studies about the link between pediatric asthma and traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) consistently confirmed the correlation between TRAP and asthma. For general air pollution, the roles of PM2.5 and CO were consistent across studies. The link between asthma and O3 varied across seasons. Regional variation exists in the role of SO2. The impact of pollen was consistent across seasons, whereas the role of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was less consistent. Discussion. Recent studies strengthened the evidence about the roles of PM2.5, TRAP, CO, and pollen in asthma, while the evidence for roles of PM10-2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in asthma was less consistent. Spatial-temporal details of the environment are needed in future studies of asthma and environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1916-7245		MEDLINE:28239256	28239256	
J	Baeza, J Antonio; Behringer, Donald C								Small-scale spatial variation in population- and individual-level reproductive parameters of the blue-legged hermit crab Clibanarius tricolor.								PeerJ				5				e3004	e3004		10.7717/peerj.3004			2017	2017	Management of the few regulated ornamental fisheries relies on inadequate information about the life history of the target species. Herein, we investigated the reproductive biology of the most heavily traded marine invertebrate in the western Atlantic; the blue-legged hermit crab Clibanarius tricolor. We report on density, individual-level, and population-level reproductive parameters in 14 populations spanning the Florida Keys. In C. tricolor, abundance, population-level, and individual-level reproductive parameters exhibited substantial small-scale spatial variation in the Florida Keys. For instance, the proportion of brooding females varied between 10-94% across localities. In females, average (±SD) fecundity varied between 184 (±54) and 614 (±301) embryos crab-1 across populations. Fecundity usually increases with female body size in hermit crabs. However, we found no effect of female body size on fecundity in three of the populations. Altogether, our observations suggest that C. tricolor may fit a source-sink metapopulation dynamic in the Florida Keys with low reproductive intensity and absence of a parental body size-fecundity relationship resulting in net reproductive loses at some localities. We argue in favor of additional studies describing population dynamics and other aspects of the natural history of C. tricolor (e.g., development type, larval duration) to reveal 'source' populations, capable of exporting larvae to nearby populations. Our observations imply that future studies aimed at assessing standing stocks or describing other aspects of the life history of this hermit crab need to focus on multiple localities simultaneously. This and future studies on the reproductive biology of this species will form the baseline for models aimed at assessing the stock condition and sustainability of this heavily harvested crustacean.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:28229028	28229028

Development and validation of two scales to measure elaboration and behaviors associated with stewardship in children								ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH				23	2			192	213		10.1080/13504622.2015.1121377			2017	2017	This investigation examines the development of two scales that measure elaboration and behaviors associated with stewardship in children. The scales were developed using confirmatory factor analysis to investigate their construct validity, reliability, and psychometric properties. Results suggest that a second-order factor model structure provides the best fit. This model produced: (1) a stewardship elaboration scale measuring interest and cognitive engagement in stewardship issues, and (2) a stewardship behavior scale measuring in-park, community, and home behaviors. These scales will be useful for evaluating environmental educational programs focused on environmental and park stewardship. The scales may also help researchers assess whether environmental education results in participants elaborating on persuasive messaging, thereby increasing the likelihood that behavioral intentions leading to behavior change will occur.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1350-4622	1469-5871		WOS:000393209400003

Sheehan, Kate/0000-0001-5819-1362			Using species distribution models to define nesting habitat of the eastern metapopulation of double-crested cormorants								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				7	1			409	418		10.1002/ece3.2620			JAN 2017	2017	When organisms with similar phenotypes have conflicting management and conservation initiatives, approaches are needed to differentiate among subpopulations or discrete groups. For example, the eastern metapopulation of the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) has a migratory phenotype that is culled because they are viewed as a threat to commercial and natural resources, whereas resident birds are targeted for conservation. Understanding the distinct breeding habitats of resident versus migratory cormorants would aid in identification and management decisions. Here, we use species distribution models (SDM: Maxent) of cormorant nesting habitat to examine the eastern P. auritus metapopulation and the predicted breeding sites of its phenotypes. We then estimate the phenotypic identity of breeding colonies of cormorants where management plans are being developed. We transferred SDMs trained on data from resident bird colonies in Florida and migratory bird colonies in Minnesota to South Carolina in an effort to identify the phenotype of breeding cormorants there based on the local landscape characteristics. Nesting habitat characteristics of cormorant colonies in South Carolina more closely resembled those of the Florida phenotype than those of birds of the Minnesota phenotype. The presence of the resident phenotype in summer suggests that migratory and resident cormorants will co-occur in South Carolina in winter. Thus, there is an opportunity for separate management strategies for the two phenotypes in that state. We found differences in nesting habitat characteristics that could be used to refine management strategies and reduce human conflicts with abundant winter migrants and, at the same time, conserve less common colonies of resident cormorants. The models we use here show potential for advancing the study of geographically overlapping phenotypes with differing conservation and management priorities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-7758			WOS:000392069500034	28070303	
J	Chen, Shuning; Yuan, Nannan; Schnabel, Guido; Luo, Chaoxi								Function of the genetic element "Mona' associated with fungicide resistance in Monilinia fructicola								MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY				18	1			90	97		10.1111/mpp.12387			JAN 2017	2017	The genetic element Mona' has been shown previously to be associated with resistance to demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) in Monilinia fructicola. In this study, the promoter activity of the Mona' element was demonstrated genetically and the activity was narrowed down to a 20-bp active region through a series of deletions. Mona' knockout transformants (Mona) were generated from DMI-resistant isolate Bmpc7, and EC50 values and expression of the MfCYP51 gene were found to be reduced in transformants compared with the parental isolate. When the Mona' element was inserted into the upstream region of the MfCYP51 gene of the DMI-sensitive isolate HG3, the EC50 values and expression of the MfCYP51 gene increased in the transformants compared with the parental sensitive isolate. These results indicate that the Mona' element determines the DMI fungicide resistance through the up-regulation of the expression of the downstream MfCYP51 gene. No fitness penalty was observed in knockout and insertion transformants, i.e. transformants showed similar mycelial growth rate, sporulation and ability to cause lesions on fruit compared with their parental isolates, suggesting that the Mona' element does not affect basal life activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1464-6722	1364-3703		WOS:000392862700008	26918759

The system combines the merits of a wide-dynamic detection range and high sensitivity offered by the spectral approach with multiplexed high-throughput data collection and a two-dimensional (2D) biosensor array. The key feature is the use of AOTF to realize wavelength scan from a white laser source and thus to achieve fast tracking of the SPR dip movement caused by target molecules binding to the sensor surface. Experimental results show that the system is capable of completing a SPR dip measurement within 0.35 s. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest time ever reported in the literature for imaging spectral interrogation. Based on a spectral window with a width of approximately 100 nm, a dynamic detection range and resolution of 4.63 x 10(-2) refractive index unit (RIU) and 1.27 x 10(-6) RIU achieved in a 2D-array sensor is reported here. The spectral SPR imaging sensor scheme has the capability of performing fast high-throughput detection of biomolecular interactions from 2D sensor arrays. The design has no mechanical moving parts, thus making the scheme completely solid-state.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1424-8220			WOS:000393021000090

Fusing the protein to an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide offers a possible solution. The goal of this work was to develop an affinity membrane for the purification of Arg-rich fusion proteins via capture chromatography. Membranes were prepared by grafting polymers bearing diethyl-4-aminobenzyl phosphonate (D4ABP) ligands from macroporous membrane supports. Incorporation of D4ABP was studied by infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Protein-binding capacities of 3 mg lysozyme/mL were measured. While further studies are required to evaluate binding kinetics and Arg-selectivity, achieving higher protein-binding capacity is needed before investment in such studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0149-6395	1520-5754		WOS:000392852000012

The films evaluated were highly (111) textured in the direction perpendicular to the film surface. The degree of preferential orientation was found to decrease with longer pulse on-times, due to strain energy density driven growth of other grain orientations. Residual biaxial stresses were also measured in the films and higher pulse frequencies during deposition led to smaller biaxial stresses in the films. Film stress was also found to correlate with the amount of twinning in the copper film cross-sections. This has been attributed to the twins' thermal stability and mechanical properties.

Heliyon				3	1			e00232	e00232		10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00232			2017-Jan	2017	Degassing is a common preparation technique for rhenium filaments used for thermal ionization mass spectrometric analysis of actinides, including plutonium. Although optimization studies regarding degassing conditions have been reported, little work has been done to characterize filament aging after degassing. In this study, the effects of filament aging after degassing were explored to determine a "shelf-life" for degassed rhenium filaments, and methods to limit filament aging were investigated. Zone-refined rhenium filaments were degassed by resistance heating under high vacuum before exposure to ambient atmosphere for up to 2 months. After degassing the nucleation and preferential growth of oxo-rhenium crystallites on the surface of polycrystalline rhenium filaments was observed by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Compositional analysis of the crystallites was conducted using SEM-Raman spectroscopy and SEM energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and grain orientation at the metal surface was investigated by electron back-scatter diffraction mapping. Spectra collected by SEM-Raman suggest crystallites are composed primarily of perrhenic acid. The relative extent of growth and crystallite morphology were found to be grain dependent and affected by the dissolution of carbon into filaments during annealing (often referred to as carbonization or carburization). Crystallites were observed to nucleate in region specific modes and grow over time through transfer of material from the surface. Factors most likely to affect the rates of crystallite growth include rhenium substrate properties such as grain size, orientation, levels of dissolved carbon, and relative abundance of defect sites; as well as environmental factors such as length of exposure to oxygen and relative humidity. Thin (180 nm) hydrophobic films of poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) were found to slow the growth of oxo-rhenium crystallites on the filament surfaces and may serve as an alternative carbon source for filament carburization.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:28116361	28116361

The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America				141	1			172	172		10.1121/1.4973689			2017-Jan	2017	Removing drops from an air flow can be challenging, particularly, for small drops. Herein a method for demisting is presented that employs ultrasonics to force small drops to combine. Specifically, a cylindrical ultrasonic standing wave field is established in a tube, forming pressure nodes that take the form of cylinders located within the tube and having the same axis as the tube. Droplets are driven toward these pressure nodes by the acoustic radiation force, forcing smaller drops to combine to form larger drops, which eventually fall due to gravity, thereby demisting the flow. Experiments presented herein show that, for the setup employed, this method can remove a fraction of drops that approaches 0.8 and that the improvement due to ultrasonics, compared to the case without ultrasonics, is as large as 2.8. The effect of air flow rate and power is investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-8524		MEDLINE:28147564	28147564

Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine				11	1			246	255		10.1002/term.1906			2017-Jan	2017	Hydrogels have been widely investigated for localized, sustained gene delivery because of the similarity of their physical properties to native extracellular matrix and their ability to be formed under mild conditions amenable to the incorporation of bioactive molecules. The objective of this study was to develop bioactive hydrogels composed of macromolecules capable of enhancing the efficiency of non-viral vectors. Hybrid hydrogels were prepared by simultaneous enzymatic and Michael-type addition crosslinking of reduced fibrinogen and an acrylated amphiphilic block copolymer, Tetronic T904, in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) and thrombin. T904/fibrin hydrogels degraded by surface erosion in the presence of plasmin and provided sustained release of polyplex vectors up to an order of magnitude longer than pure fibrin gel control. In addition, the rate of gel degradation and time-course of polyplex vector release were readily controlled by varying the T904/fibrinogen ratio in the gel composition. When added to transfected neuroblastoma (N2A) cells, both native T904 itself and hydrogel degradation products significantly increased polyplex transfection efficiency with minimal effect on cell viability. To evaluate gel-based transfection, N2A cells encapsulated in small fibrin clusters were covered by or suspended within polyplex-loaded hydrogels. Cells progressively degraded and invaded the hybrid hydrogels, exhibiting increasing gene expression over 2 weeks and then diminishing but persistent gene expression for over 1 month. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that T904/fibrin hybrid hydrogels can be promising tissue engineering scaffolds that provide local, controlled release of non-viral vectors in combination with the generation of bioactive gel degradation products that actively enhance vector efficiency.

S	Mates, Steven; Abu-Farha, Fadi						Yoshida, S; Lamberti, L; Sciammarella, C		Opportunities for Inverse Analysis in Dynamic Tensile Testing								ADVANCEMENT OF OPTICAL METHODS IN EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS, VOL 3		Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series						207	212		10.1007/978-3-319-41600-7_27			2017	2017	Dynamic tensile testing using Kolsky Bar methods are used to assess crashworthiness of new structural materials needed for lightweight automotive design. High speed Digital Image Correlation (DIC) measurements routinely show that the strain experienced by dynamic tensile specimens deviates markedly from what is expected from the original strain wave analysis techniques used in tensile Kolsky bar metrology. Deviations can be manifest either by different average strain values over the gage section, or by departures from strain uniformity, or both. The former can be attributed to plastic yielding in the specimen outside the gauge section, while the latter concerns specimen geometry and material hardening effects. These issues are sometimes difficult to eliminate through simple modifications of the sample or the test design. Finally, it is of interest to make use of the data beyond necking, where the strain state departs significantly from ideal conditions. These metrology issues lend themselves to solution by inverse methods, where full field strain measurements and global load measurement data are available. In this paper we describe typical measurement data and explore methods to identify the constitutive response from dynamic tensile tests.

J	Guerra, Fernanda D.; Smith, Gary Douglas, Jr.; Alexis, Frank; Whitehead, Daniel C.								A Survey of VOC Emissions from Rendering Plants								AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH				17	1			209	217		10.4209/aaqr.2016.09.0391			JAN 2017	2017	Rendering is a global industry that recycles by-products resulting from butchering operations, which process billions of animals per year. About 50% of the weight of livestock is not consumed by humans and must be processed by rendering operations, which cook and separate the material into its protein and fat components. These products serve as a sustainable food source for livestock, feedstocks for oleochemicals, and raw material for biodiesel refineries. Due to the scale and nature of the raw materials and the cooking process, rendering operations emit a significant, but as yet poorly quantified, VOC load. Assessing this VOC load is important in order to calibrate the industry's contribution to global VOC emissions, and to help address nuisance odor problems. We conducted VOC air sampling of two facilities in California, USA during the winter and summer seasons. VOC and reduced sulfur analyses were conducted using 8 h ambient air samples. Analyses for amines, ammonia, aldehydes/ketones, and volatile fatty acids were conducted using sampling pumps. These analyses detected 43 compounds at the facilities, and the number and concentration of detectable compounds were seasonally dependent. The compounds present at the highest concentrations included: ammonia (1600-2800 ppb, i.e., winter-summer levels), acetic acid (80-320 ppb, along with twelve other fatty acids ranging from similar to 0.5-140 ppb), acetone (55-241 ppb, along with nine other aldehyde/ketone products ranging from 0.4-60 ppb), and ethanol (15-81 ppb). These constituents have low odor thresholds and thus contribute to nuisance odor problems. Further, the overall VOC contribution arising from rendering facilities on a global scale is as yet very poorly characterized. This analysis will be useful to guide the development of new odor abatement strategies and strategies for the reduction of VOC emissions associated with this critical industry.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1680-8584	2071-1409		WOS:000392311500018		
J	Richards, Dylan; Jia, Jia; Yost, Michael; Markwald, Roger; Mei, Ying								3D Bioprinting for Vascularized Tissue Fabrication								ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING				45	1	SI		132	147		10.1007/s10439-016-1653-z			JAN 2017	2017	3D bioprinting holds remarkable promise for rapid fabrication of 3D tissue engineering constructs. Given its scalability, reproducibility, and precise multi-dimensional control that traditional fabrication methods do not provide, 3D bioprinting provides a powerful means to address one of the major challenges in tissue engineering: vascularization. Moderate success of current tissue engineering strategies have been attributed to the current inability to fabricate thick tissue engineering constructs that contain endogenous, engineered vasculature or nutrient channels that can integrate with the host tissue. Successful fabrication of a vascularized tissue construct requires synergy between high throughput, high-resolution bioprinting of larger perfusable channels and instructive bioink that promotes angiogenic sprouting and neovascularization. This review aims to cover the recent progress in the field of 3D bioprinting of vascularized tissues. It will cover the methods of bioprinting vascularized constructs, bioink for vascularization, and perspectives on recent innovations in 3D printing and biomaterials for the next generation of 3D bioprinting for vascularized tissue fabrication.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0090-6964	1573-9686		WOS:000391923100009	27230253

This paper presents a heuristic algorithm to approximate the Pareto set of the MOSCP. The proposed algorithm applies a local branching approach on a tree structure and is enhanced with a node exploration strategy specially developed for the MOSCP. The main idea is to partition the search region into smaller subregions based on the neighbors of a reference solution and then to explore each subregion for the Pareto points of the MOSCP. Numerical experiments for instances with two, three and four objectives set covering problems are reported. Results on a performance comparison with benchmark algorithms from the literature are also included and show that the new algorithm is competitive and performs best on some instances.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-5330	1572-9338		WOS:000392331900020

The developing otic epithelium gives rise to neurosensory and non-sensory elements of the adult membranous labyrinth. Extrinsic and intrinsic signals manage the patterning and cell specification of the developing otic epithelium by establishing lineage-restricted compartments defined in turn by differential expression of regulatory genes. FGF3 and FGF16 are excellent candidates to govern these developmental events. Using the chick inner ear, we show that Fgf3 expression is present in the borders of all developing cristae. Strong Fgf16 expression was detected in a portion of the developing vertical and horizontal pouches, whereas the cristae show weaker or undetected Fgf16 expression at different developmental stages. Concerning the rest of the vestibular sensory elements, both the utricular and saccular maculae were Fgf3 positive. Interestingly, strong Fgf16 expression delimited these Fgf16-negative sensory patches. The Fgf3-negative macula neglecta and the Fgf3-positive macula lagena were included within weakly Fgf16-expressing areas. Therefore, different FGF-mediated mechanisms might regulate the specification of the anterior (utricular and saccular) and posterior (neglecta and lagena) maculae. In the developing cochlear duct, dynamic Fgf3 and Fgf16 expression suggests their cooperation in the early specification and later cell differentiation in the hearing system. The requirement of Fgf3 and Fgf16 genes in endolymphatic apparatus development and neurogenesis are discussed. Based on these observations, FGF3 and FGF16 seem to be key signaling pathways that control the inner ear plan by defining epithelial identities within the developing otic epithelium.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1863-2653	1863-2661		WOS:000392292100009	26995070

Roberts; Cousins, Tommy								Investigation of the Effects of Transverse Bending in a Composite Inverted T-Slab Bridge System								JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING				22	1					04016101	10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000974			JAN 2017	2017	The composite inverted T-slab bridge system provides an accelerated bridge construction alternative for short- to medium-span bridges with spans ranging from 6.1 to 20 m. The system consists of adjacent precast inverted T-slabs with a cast-in-place (CIP) concrete topping. Such a composite bridge system offers a shallow superstructure depth ideal for sites with stringent vertical clearance requirements. When concentrated loads are applied to a bridge of this type, the bridge deforms as a two-way flat plate. This paper presents an analytical and experimental investigation to study the relationship between transverse bending and reflective cracking. Transverse bending moment demands were quantified using a finite-element model and compared with tested transverse bending moment capacities provided by several subassemblage specimens, which feature two precast cross-sectional shapes and three transverse connections. It was concluded that all tested specimens performed well at service load levels. The detail that features a precast inverted T-slab with tapered webs and no mechanical connection between the adjacent inverted T-slabs and CIP topping is the simplest and most economical.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1084-0702	1943-5592		WOS:000392226900003		
J	Thimmaiah, Somaiah; Phelan, Keith; Summers, Joshua D.								An Experimental Study on the Influence That Failure Number, Specialization, and Controls Have on Confidence in Predicting System Failures								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				139	1					011102	10.1115/1.4034789			JAN 2017	2017	Design reviews are typically used for three types of design activities: (1) identifying errors, (2) assessing the impact of the errors, and (3) suggesting solutions for the errors. This experimental study focuses on understanding the second issue as it relates to the number of errors considered, the existence of controls, and the level of domain familiarity of the assessor. A set of design failures and associated controls developed for a completed industry sponsored project is used as the experimental design problem. Nondomain generalists (students from an undergraduate psychology class), domain generalists (first year engineering students), and domain specialists (graduate mechanical engineering students) are provided a set of failure modes and asked to provide their own opinion or confidence on whether the system would still successfully achieve the stated objectives. The confidence level for all domain populations decreased significantly as the number of design errors increased (largest p-value = 0.0793), and this decrease in confidence is more significant as the number of design errors increases. The impact on confidence is lower when solutions (controls) are provided to prevent the errors (largest p-value = 0.0334) as the confidence decreased faster for domain general engineers as compared to domain specialists (p = < 0.0001). The domain specialists showed higher confidence in making decisions than domain generalists and nondomain generalists as the design errors increase.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1050-0472			WOS:000392467400002

There has recently been an increasing interest in the integration of active and passive particle separation techniques for enhanced sensitivity and flexibility. We demonstrate herein the proof-of-concept of a ferrofluid-based hybrid microfluidic technique that combines passive inertial focusing with active magnetic deflection to separate diamagnetic particles by size. The two operations take place in series in a continuous flow through a straight rectangular microchannel with a nearby permanent magnet. We also develop a three-dimensional numerical model to simulate the transport of diamagnetic particles during their inertial focusing and magnetic separation processes in the entire microchannel. The predicted particle trajectories are found to be approximately consistent with the experimental observations at different ferrofluid flow rates and ferrofluid concentrations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-4982	1613-4990		WOS:000392334500014

Drawing on ethics of care and theories of societal post-materialism, we develop a set of hypotheses predicting patterns of value creation across gender and countries. Using a sample of 15,141 entrepreneurs in 48 countries from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, we find that gender and cultural values of post-materialism significantly impact the kinds of value creation emphasized by entrepreneurs. Specifically, women entrepreneurs are more likely than men to emphasize social value goals over economic value creation goals. Individuals who start ventures in strong post-materialist societies are more likely to have social and environmental value creation goals and less likely to have economic value creation goals. Furthermore, as levels of post-materialism rise among societies, the relationship between value creation goals and gender changes, intensifying both the negative effect of being female on economic value goals and the positive effect on social value goals. In other words, post-materialism further widens the gender gap in value creation goals.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0921-898X	1573-0913		WOS:000392306200013		
J	Arnaiz-Cot, Juan Jose; Cleemann, Lars; Morad, Martin								Xanthohumol Modulates Calcium Signaling in Rat Ventricular Myocytes: Possible Antiarrhythmic Properties.								The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics				360	1			239	248					2017-Jan	2017	Cardiac arrhythmia is a major cause of mortality in cardiovascular pathologies. A host of drugs targeted to sarcolemmal Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels has had limited success clinically. Recently, Ca2+ signaling has been target of pharmacotherapy based on finding that leaky ryanodine receptors elevate local Ca2+ concentrations causing membrane depolarizations that trigger arrhythmias. In this study, we report that xanthohumol, an antioxidant extracted from hops showing therapeutic effects in other pathologies, suppresses aberrant ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release. The effects of xanthohumol (5-1000 nM) on Ca2+ signaling pathways were probed in isolated rat ventricular myocytes incubated with Fluo-4 AM using the perforated patch-clamp technique. We found that 5-50 nM xanthohumol reduced the frequency of spontaneously occurring Ca2+ sparks (>threefold) and Ca2+ waves in control myocytes and in cells subjected to Ca2+ overload caused by the following: 1) exposure to low K+ solutions, 2) periods of high frequency electrical stimulation, 3) exposures to isoproterenol, or 4) caffeine. At room temperatures, 50-100 nM xanthohumol reduced the rate of relaxation of electrically- or caffeine-triggered Ca2+transients, without suppressing ICa, but this effect was small and reversed by isoproterenol at physiologic temperatures. Xanthohumol also suppressed the Ca2+ content of the SR and its rate of recirculation. The stabilizing effects of xanthohumol on the frequency of spontaneously triggered Ca2+ sparks and waves combined with its antioxidant properties, and lack of significant effects on Na+ and Ca2+ channels, may provide this compound with clinically desirable antiarrhythmic properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-0103		MEDLINE:27815365	27815365

The Journal of heredity				108	1			12	24					2017-Jan	2017	Black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) are distributed throughout the world, with more than 2200 formally described species. The family is renowned for its high frequency of cryptic species, offering an opportunity for integrative taxonomy, based on morphological, chromosomal, and molecular approaches. The biodiversity within Simulium (Psilopelmia) ignescens and S. (Psilopelmia) tunja in Colombia was estimated from the larval stage; 10 morphoforms were recognized based on 7 structural characters. This remarkable morphological variation was evaluated through 23 markers on the polytene chromosomes. We established 1 new cytoform in each nominal species. The congruence of the morphological and chromosomal assignments was evaluated using the mitochondrial marker Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) for each morphoform. The molecular data supported the chromosomal recognition of cytoforms (i.e., cryptic species). We also established the suitability of the COI marker for linking the pupal stage with each cytoform. Our results reveal the presence of hidden biodiversity in S. ignescens and S. tunja and demonstrate the power of polytene chromosomes as a tool for evaluating simuliid diversity, while illustrating the importance of integrated analyses in modern taxonomy.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1465-7333		MEDLINE:27974486	27974486

The antibacterial properties against Streptococcus mutans (n = 6/group) and surface micro-hardness (n = 5/group) were evaluated. Twenty dentin beams were completely demineralized in 10 wt% phosphoric acid and equally divided in two groups (n = 10/group) for incubation in simulated body fluid (SBF) or SBF containing 1 mg/ml PAA-CuI. The amount of dry mass loss and hydroxyproline (HYP) released were quantified. Kruskal-Wallis, Student's t test, two-way ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney were used to analyze the antibacterial, micro-hardness, dry mass, and HYP release data, respectively (p < 0.05).Addition of PAA-CuI nanoparticles into the glass ionomer matrix yielded significant reduction (99.999 %) in the concentration of bacteria relative to the control groups. While micro-hardness values of PAA-CuI-doped GI were no different from its control, PAA-CuI-doped RMGI demonstrated significantly higher values than its control. A significant decrease in dry mass weight was shown only for the control beams (10.53 %, p = 0.04). Significantly less HYP was released from beams incubated in PAA-CuI relative to the control beams (p < 0.001).PAA-CuI nanoparticles are an effective additive to glass ionomer-based materials as they greatly enhance their antibacterial properties and reduce collagen degradation without an adverse effect on their mechanical properties.The use of copper-doped glass ionomer-based materials under composite restorations may contribute to an increased longevity of adhesive restorations, because of their enhanced antibacterial properties and reduced collagen degradation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-6981	1436-3771		WOS:000391388300040	27020910

These incidents are important because they reflect powerful dimensions of youth's lived experience and bring issues of injustice and program inclusiveness to the fore. This study examined these culture-related incidents and how leaders responded to them. Interviews were conducted with 50 leaders from 27 programs serving primarily Latino, African American, and European youth. Half the programs served middle school-aged teens and half high school-aged teens. Qualitative analyses identified four categories of incidents, each presenting distinct considerations for leaders. Two (offensive remarks and discrimination) involved inappropriate speech and unjust actions. Two (discomfort with intercultural contact and cultural identification and identity) involved youth's expression of negative attitudes toward others' or own group. Leaders differed in their responses to incidents. A universalist, race-blind group asserted that culture did not matter in their program and reported virtually no incidents. A second group reported culture-related incidents but described limited responses because they lacked confidence or skills. A third group appeared to represent best practices: These leaders engaged directly with the incidents and facilitated reflective dialogue in which youth drew on experiences, analyzed situations, and learned through collective discussion. Implications for practice are drawn.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-5584	1552-6895		WOS:000391581200004

Localization of a Trypanosome Peroxin to the Endoplasmic Reticulum								JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY				64	1			97	105		10.1111/jeu.12343			JAN-FEB 2017	2017	Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of diseases that affect 30,000-50,000 people annually. Trypanosoma brucei harbors unique organelles named glycosomes that are essential to parasite survival, which requires growth under fluctuating environmental conditions. The mechanisms that govern the biogenesis of these organelles are poorly understood. Glycosomes are evolutionarily related to peroxisomes, which can proliferate de novo from the endoplasmic reticulum or through the growth and division of existing organelles depending on the organism and environmental conditions. The effect of environment on glycosome biogenesis is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the glycosome membrane protein, TbPex13.1, is localized to glycosomes when cells are cultured under high glucose conditions and to the endoplasmic reticulum in low glucose conditions. This localization in low glucose was dependent on the presence of a C-terminal tripeptide sequence. Our findings suggest that glycosome biogenesis is influenced by extracellular glucose levels and adds to the growing body of evidence that de novo glycosome biogenesis occurs in trypanosomes. Because the movement of peroxisomal membrane proteins is a hallmark of ER-dependent peroxisome biogenesis, TbPex13.1 may be a useful marker for the study such processes in trypanosomes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1066-5234	1550-7408		WOS:000391930200009	27339640

Because biofilms exist on immersed surfaces on which they attach, barnacles must interact with bacteria during initial attachment and subsequent growth. The objective of this study was to characterize the developing interface of the barnacle and substratum during this key developmental transition to inform potential mechanisms that promote attachment. The interface was characterized using confocal microscopy and fluorescent dyes to identify morphological and chemical changes to the interface and the status of bacteria present as a function of barnacle developmental stage. Staining revealed patchy material containing proteins and nucleic acids, reactive oxygen species amidst developing cuticle, and changes in bacteria viability at the developing interface. We found that as barnacles metamorphose from the cyprid to juvenile stage, proteinaceous materials with the appearance of coagulated liquid were released into and remained at the interface. It stained positive for proteins, including phosphoprotein, as well as nucleic acids. Regions of the developing cuticle and the patchy material itself stained for reactive oxygen species. Bacteria were absent until the cyprid was firmly attached, but populations died as barnacle development progressed. The oxidative environment may contribute to the cytotoxicity observed for bacteria and has the potential for oxidative crosslinking of cuticle and proteinaceous materials at the interface.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000392154200013	27811301	
J	Sandefur, Paul; Frett, Terrence; Clark, John; Gasic, Ksenija; Peace, Cameron								A DNA test for routine prediction in breeding of peach blush, Ppe-R-f-SSR								MOLECULAR BREEDING				37	1					11	10.1007/s11032-016-0615-3			JAN 2017	2017	Blush, the proportion of red overcolor on the skin surface of fruit, is highly variable in peach breeding germplasm and is important in the marketing of peach fruit. The fresh market peach industry demands a high level of blush to entice consumers, while the processing peach industry requires minimal blush. Therefore, blush is a major selection criterion in breeding programs. The use of DNA-based information could improve breeding efficiency and accuracy for fruit blush coverage, but a predictive DNA test is required. The objective of this study was to develop a DNA test for the prediction of blush coverage by targeting the major locus, R-f, associated with blush variation. Initially, haplotypes were developed based on five SNP markers associated with variation in blush coverage. To convert the 5-SNP haplotype test into a single, simple PCR-based assay, 11 simple sequence repeat markers were designed and used to screen individuals representing all SNP haplotypes. The most informative assay, named Ppe-R-f-SSR, was chosen to screen 200 individuals of the RosBREED peach reference germplasm set that incorporated germplasm from four breeding programs. Ppe-R-f-SSR accurately differentiated individuals with high-, medium-, and low-blush coverage in most lineages. Outcomes highlighted that DNA tests can be quite predictive for some breeding programs or specific germplasm sets, while for others the predictiveness can falter. Therefore, the confirmation of genotype effects for any DNA test is recommended in new germplasm before routine use. The prediction accuracy and breeding utility of Ppe-R-f-SSR in the University of Arkansas breeding program were subsequently confirmed by screening 443 seedlings, independent of the initial DNA test development process, derived from 18 cross-combinations of 28 parents. Ppe-R-f-SSR can be used to efficiently and accurately predict fruit blush coverage, especially in fresh market germplasm, and has been deployed for routine use in the University of Arkansas peach breeding program.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1380-3743	1572-9788		WOS:000391941700011

The scheme begins with a formulation that uses the Lamb vector to couple the usual velocity-pressure system to the vorticity dynamics equation, and then discretizes with the finite element method in space and implicit-explicit BDF2 in time, with the vorticity equation decoupling at each time step. We prove the method's vorticity and velocity are both long-time stable in the and norms, without any timestep restriction. Moreover, our analysis avoids the use of Gronwall-type estimates, which leads us to stability bounds with only polynomial (instead of exponential) dependence on the Reynolds number. Numerical experiments are given that demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0029-599X	0945-3245		WOS:000392032600006

Self-healing of glucose-modified polyurethane networks facilitated by damage-induced primary amines								POLYMER CHEMISTRY				8	1			303	309		10.1039/c6py01221c			2017	2017	Living organisms utilize metabolic processes to achieve adaptive, reproductive, and self-healing functions, which require dynamic and precise control of sequential chemical events. Since traditional synthetic materials do not possess these functions, there is an ongoing quest for the development of self-healing attributes. This study reports self-healing of crosslinked polyurethane networks by damage-induced formation of primary amines. Deliberately modified with methyl a-D-glucopyranoside (MGP) and catalyzed by zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)(2)), polyurethane (PUR) networks are capable of restoring mechanical properties upon mechanical damage. Self-repair is initially driven by entropic shape recovery facilitating interfacial contacts in damaged areas, followed by covalent reformation of cleaved bonds. Amine functionalities resulting from mechanical damage facilitate covalent re-bonding to form urea linkages responsible for recovery of mechanical properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1759-9954	1759-9962		WOS:000391732800018

DNA Barcoding Elucidates Cyprinid Reproductive Interactions in a Southwest Virginia Stream								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				146	1			84	91		10.1080/00028487.2016.1240105			2017	2017	Chubs Nocomis spp. (Cyprinidae) in freshwater streams build conspicuous gravel mounds upon which they and other nest-associative cyprinids spawn. Our understanding of such interactions is incomplete and hindered by the inability to observe all interactions directly and to identify the larvae that emerge from the mounds based on morphological traits. We used visual surveys and DNA barcoding to identify cyprinids that were associated with the nests of spawning chub in Catawba Creek, a small tributary of the James River in southwestern Virginia. All individual fish on nests were identified to species and categorized as spawning or feeding. Eggs were subsequently removed from the nests and hatched in captivity, and DNA was extracted from the larvae. The DNA sequences for region 3 of the mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I gene in individual larvae were amplified, and the resulting sequences were compared to entries in GenBank by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for nucleotide data. Of the 75 larval fish that were assayed, 56 (75%) were genetically identified. Species-level identification of the larval cyprinids was straightforward except with regard to Nocomis, for which cryptic taxonomy is currently unresolved. Four cyprinid species were identified among the larvae sampled from Nocomis nests; of those species, the Central Stoneroller Campostoma anomalum and Rosyside Dace Clinostomus funduloides had not been previously witnessed to spawn on chub nests. Central Stonerollers had been observed to perform activities that were more indicative of nest predation than spawning; hence, the presence of their eggs on Nocomis nests suggests that the activity of Central Stonerollers is not entirely antagonistic.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000391851200008

An Efficient Algorithm for Computation of MHD Flow Ensembles								COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS				17	1			121	137		10.1515/cmam-2016-0033			JAN 2017	2017	An efficient algorithm is proposed and studied for computing flow ensembles of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows under uncertainties in initial or boundary data. The ensemble average of J realizations is approximated through a clever algorithm (adapted from a breakthrough idea of Jiang and Layton [23]) that, at each time step, uses the same matrix for each of the J systems solves. Hence, preconditioners need to be built only once per time step, and the algorithm can take advantage of block linear solvers. Additionally, an Elsasser variable formulation is used, which allows for a stable decoupling of each MHD system at each time step. We prove stability and convergence of the algorithm, and test it with two numerical experiments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1609-4840	1609-9389		WOS:000391208600008		
J	Ma, Guiling; Harrison, J. H.; Block, E.; Jenkins, T. C.; VanWieringen, Lynn								Short communication: Temporal effect of feeding potassium carbonate sesquihydrate on milk fat in lactating dairy cows fed a fat-depressing diet								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				100	1			371	378		10.3168/jds.2016-11205			JAN 2017	2017	A lactation study with 10 multiparous dairy cows in early lactation, with an average of 64 days in milk (standard deviation = 37), were used to evaluate how quickly milk fat concentration would change when potassium carbonate sesquihydrate was abruptly added to the diet. The experiment had 3 periods. In period 1 (d 0 to 7) all cows were fed the same basal (control) diet with 1.8% soy oil, dry basis; in period 2 (d 8 to 28) 5 cows received the control diet, whereas the other 5 cows received the control diet plus 0.59% of added K with K carbonate sesquihydrate; and in period 3 (d 29 to 42) all 10 cows received the control diet. The control diet was formulated for a dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD), calculated as Na + K - Cl - S, of 37.7 mEq/100 g of dry matter (DM), 1.74% of DM as K, and 5.7% long-chain fatty acids (DM%), which included 1.8% of DM as soybean oil. Period 1 was used as a covariate. In period 2, d 8 to 28, 5 cows remained on the control diet whereas 5 cows were fed with the control diet plus K carbonate sesquihydrate (DCAD+ diet; DCAD of 54.3 mEq/100 g DM and 2.33% of DM as K). After feeding the DCAD+ diet, we noted a difference in milk fat concentration from 3.9 to 4.3% within 72 h. Over the 21 d of period 2, the DCAD+ diet resulted in significantly greater milk fat percentage from 4.0 to 4.3%, lactose from 4.74 to 4.82%, and fat efficiency in the form of fat in milk divided by fat in DMI from 1.27 to 1.49, without affecting dry matter intake (DMI), milk protein concentration, solids-not fat concentration, 3.5% fat-corrected milk, and protein efficiency in the form of protein in milk divided by protein in DMI. In period 3 (d 29-42), all cows were again fed the control diet, resulting in a tendency for greater milk fat concentration, significantly greater lactose concentration, and fat efficiency in the form of fat in milk divided by fat in DMI for the cows having received the DCAD+ diet during period 2. In conclusion, the abrupt addition of K carbonate sesquihydrate resulted in a greater milk fat concentration and tended to maintain the greater concentration after cessation of K carbonate sesquihydrate feeding.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000391351600031	27837989

Individual employee's perceptions of "Group-level Safety Climate" (supervisor referenced) versus "Organization-level Safety Climate" (top management referenced): Associations with safety outcomes for lone workers								ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION				98				37	45		10.1016/j.aap.2016.09.016			JAN 2017	2017	Research has shown that safety climate is among the strongest predictors of safety behavior and safety outcomes in a variety of settings. Previous studies have established that safet climate is a multi-faceted construct referencing multiple levels of management within a company, most generally: the organization level (employee perceptions of top management's commitment to and prioritization of safety) and group level (employee perceptions of direct supervisor's commitment to and prioritization of safety). Yet, no research to date has examined the potential interaction between employees' organization-level safety climate (OSC) and group-level safety climate (GSC) perceptions. Furthermore, prior research has mainly focused on traditional work environments in which supervisors and workers interact in the same location throughout the day. Little research has been done to examine safety climate with regard to lone workers. The present study aims to address these gaps by examining the relationships between truck drivers' (as an example of lone workers) perceptions of OSC and GSC, both potential linear and non-linear relationships, and how these predict important safety outcomes. Participants were 8095 truck drivers from eight trucking companies in the United States with an average response rate of 44.8%. Results showed that employees' OSC and GSC perceptions are highly correlated (r = 0.78), but notable gaps between the two were observed for some truck drivers. Uniquely, both OSC and GSC scores were found to have curvilinear relationships with safe driving behavior, and both scores were equally predictive of safe driving behavior. Results also showed the two levels of climate significantly interacted with one another to predict safety behavior such that if either the OSC or GSC scores were low, the other's contribution to safety behavior became stronger. These findings suggest that OSC and GSC may function in a compensatory manner and promote safe driving behavior even when either OSC or GSC scores are low. The results of this study provide critical insight into the supplementary interaction between perceptions of OSC and GSC. Recommendations for future research, as well as practical recommendations for organizational intervention, are discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The experiment was carried out by measuring the heat flux through the door gasket by Reverse Heat Load Method (RHLM). The experimental point measurements lie near to the continuous curve from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation, which makes it reasonable to provide a dimensionless shape profile by CFD to fill in the missing information between experimental measurement points in order to provide the actual effective heat leakage. The average effective heat leakage on the door gasket surface is determined as 0.2 W m(-1) K-1 comprising 17% and 14% heat leakage of the total load in the fresh-food and freezer compartments, respectively. The electric fan and the hot pipe along the perimeter of the door contribute to an increase of 20% and 10% in the effective heat leakage on the door surface of the freezer, respectively.

The research described in this paper targets an assistive robotic appliance which learns a user's gestures for activities performed in a healthcare or aging in place setting. The proposed approach uses the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) algorithm in combination with the Q-Learning paradigm of reinforcement learning to shape robotic motions over time. Neighborhoods of nodes in the GNG network are combined to collectively leverage past learning by the group. Connections between nodes are assigned weights based on frequency of use which can be viewed as measures of electrical resistance. In this way, the GNG network may be traversed based on distances computed in the same manner as resistance in an electrical circuit. It is shown that this distance metric provides faster convergence of the algorithm when compared to shortest path neighborhood learning.					7th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics / International Conference on Human Factors in Robots and Unmanned Systems7th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics / International Conference on Human Factors in Robots and Unmanned Systems	JUL 27-31, 2016JUL 27-31, 2016		Bay Lake, FLBay Lake, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-5357		978-3-319-41959-6; 978-3-319-41958-9	WOS:000390838400035

J	Price, Heather L.; Gohad, Neeraj V.; Mount, Andrew S.; Wendt, Dean E.					Wendt, Dean/0000-0002-1732-5616			Investigation of larval settlement pathways in the marine bryozoan, Bugula neritina								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				486				69	76		10.1016/j.jembe.2016.09.017			JAN 2017	2017	Bugula neritina is a sessile marine bryozoan with a pelagic larval stage. Larvae frequently settle on boat hulls, facilitating the introduction of B. neritina to bays and estuaries worldwide. Adrenergic agonists, such as norepinephrine, inhibit larval settlement in a variety of marine invertebrate species, including B. neritina. Light also inhibits larval settlement of B. neritina, yet the underlying mechanisms by which light and adrenergic compounds exert their effects on larvae are largely unknown. Octopamine is considered the invertebrate analog of norepinephrine, and may be one endogenous compound involved in larval settlement pathways. In this study, we investigated the effects of norepinephrine and the adrenergic antagonist phentolamine on larval settlement, and found that norepinephrine inhibited larval attachment and increased larval swimming behavior, while phentolamine increased larval attachment and decreased larval swimming behavior. We used fluorescent labeling and immunocytochemistry to localize sensory system components, and found that larvae possess adrenergic-like receptors and octopamine-like immunoreactivity. We also exposed larvae to phentolamine in both dark and light conditions, and found that light inhibited larval attachment, but phentolamine blocked those inhibitory effects. Based on these results, we put forth a putative mechanistic explanation for the effects of both light and adrenergic compounds on B. neritina larval settlement behavior. This study sheds light on previously unknown pathways underlying larval settlement behavior of bryozoans, and may aid in the development of effective, non-toxic biofouling control strategies.

J	Moyo, Ropafadzo; Pillay, Deena; Baeza, J. Antonio								Symbiont-mediated shifts in sandprawn behaviour: Implications for ecosystem functioning in marine soft-sediment ecosystems								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				486				296	304		10.1016/j.jembe.2016.10.022			JAN 2017	2017	Ecosystem engineering by burrowing species is one of the most influential determinants of community structure in marine sedimentary ecosystems. However, per capita ecosystem engineering rates displayed by burrowers are variable, and thereby contribute to enhancing local biotic and abiotic variability. Lacking in current understanding of processes influencing variability in ecosystem engineering rates by burrowers and consequent feedbacks to assemblages are interactions occurring between burrowers and their burrow-symbionts. In this paper, we quantify behavioural responses of burrowing sandprawns (Callichirus kraussi: Crustacea: Axiidea) to burrow symbionts (Betaeus jucundus: Crustacea: Alpheidae) using controlled laboratory experiments. We demonstrate that sandprawns display discrete behaviours in response to B.jucundus with distinct levels of tolerance. Such variability in tolerances of sandprawns to B.jucundus is consistent with the idea that the outcomes of symbiotic relationships are variable, depending on processes that shift the costs and benefits involved for partners. Importantly, these discrete tolerances were associated with significant changes to time spent by sandprawns on ecosystem engineering activities (sediment turnover, burrow irrigation) with intolerant sandprawns increasing sediment turnover rate by 50% and decreasing irrigation by 30%. In a second experiment seeking to determine if variability in sandprawn responses to B. jucundus could be due to differences in sandprawn sexes, we demonstrate that male and female sandprawns respond differently to the presence of B.jucundus, with differences in time spent on ecosystem engineering in the presence of B.jucundus. Taken collectively, our results highlight the complex behaviours occurring within burrows in marine sediments and their potential to influence ecosystem activities of burrowers.

J	Privette, C. V.; Smink, J.								Assessing the potential impacts of WWTP effluent reductions within the Reedy River watershed								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				98				11	16		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.10.058			JAN 2017	2017	The Reedy River Basin originates along the northern fringe of the Greenville Metro Area and flows southward through downtown Greenville and continues for about 40 miles through increasingly rural lands until it empties into Lake Greenwood. This project evaluated the potential downstream impact to the Reedy River, Boyd Millpond, and Lake Greenwood from the removal of 100% of the effluent generated from various wastewater treatment plants along the river. Evaluation was performed using the Reedy River Model which is a combination of different programs including the EPA's Loading Simulation Program in C++ (LSPC) and the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP).Both water quality and quantity were analyzed as part of this study. The nitrogen and phosphorus species investigated in this study were total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Simulation runs were conducted for the Reedy River Model holding all original parameters constant to those used in the TMDL analysis. The second simulation consisted of eliminating wastewater treatment plants from the model to simulate 100% removal of their wastewater effluent. To reflect dry, wet, and average years of rainfall, seven years of actual weather data for Greenville County were used within these simulation runs. Flow was modeled from the headwaters to the Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. River sections analyzed included the river section immediately upstream and downstream of the wastewater treatment plant locations and Boyd Millpond and Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood.Removal of effluent resulted in a reduced average flow at Boyd Millpond from 8.52 m(3)/s (301.23 cfs) to 7.34 m(3)/s (259.21 cfs), a reduction in flow of 14%; and reduced average flow at Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood from 9.15 m3/s (323.13 cfs) to 7.97 m3/s (281.46 cfs), a reduction in flow of 12.9%. The removal of wastewater effluent had the greatest impact during periods of minimum flow when effluent makes up the largest percentage of total flow. During periods of drought, effluent removal resulted in a reduction in flow of almost 70% at the upper wastewater treatment plant, 66% at the lower wastewater treatment plant, 59% at Boyd Millpond, and 55% at Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. Based on daily flow values averaged over seven years, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentration and mass loads at Boyd Millpond and Reedy Arm will both decrease by approximately 50% with the elimination of effluent. This report only considers the impacts of effluent removal to flow, total phosphorus and total nitrogen as modeled by LSPC and WASP. Other variables that may be influenced from effluent removal include, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, fecal matter, heavy metals, water temperature, habitat quality, species diversity, macroinvertabrates, recreational uses, and economic impacts but are not included in this study.

The performance and reliability of such integrated photonic components in land or space-based environments where radiation impact structure and properties is important to their ultimate deployment. Bulk glasses and thermally evaporated thin films of As2Se3 were subjected to a gamma exposure of 229 Mrad to compare bulk/film material response and the impact of film thickness on such response. Positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) spectroscopy was employed to compare the effect of gamma irradiation on the different forms of the glass. The average positron lifetime was found to be longer for the films than the bulk glass in unirradiated specimens, and the films showed more significant increases in lifetimes with gamma exposure. This effect was more pronounced for thinner films, which showed, for example, an increase in positron lifetime. Positron lifetime was measured over the course of 20 days after exposure, over which the effect of the gamma radiation was found to relax at room temperature. Long-term or incomplete relaxation of the gamma-induced changes were observed in the films, while the bulk glass positron lifetime returned to pre-exposed values. A proposed mechanism for these observations based on coordination topological defects (CTD) is presented to explain the initial and longer term response, and the possible consequence when such films are integrated in device geometries.

The primary outcome is the proportion of mechanically ventilated days in which infants were administered drugs of interest. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictors of administration of drugs of interest.Results We identified 85 911 mechanically ventilated infants. Infants received a drug of interest (opioids, benzodiazepines, other sedatives, and paralytics) on 433 587/1 305 413 (33%) of mechanically ventilated infant days. The administration of opioids increased during the study period from 5% of infant days in 1997 to 32% in 2012. The administration of benzodiazepines increased during the study period from 5% of infant days in 1997 to 24% in 2012. Use of paralytics and other drugs remained <= 1% throughout the study period. Predictors of drug administration included younger GA, small for GA status, male sex, presence of a major congenital anomaly, older postnatal age at intubation, exposure to high-frequency ventilation, exposure to inotropes, more recent year of discharge, and neonatal intensive care unit site.Conclusions Administration of opioids and benzodiazepines in mechanically ventilated premature infants increased over time. Because infant characteristics were unchanged, site-specific differences in practice likely explain our observations. Increased administration over time is concerning given limited evidence of benefit and potential for harm.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3476	1097-6833		WOS:000390028100021	27522446

However, active monitoring techniques used to dynamically measure network traffic introduce additional overheads in the network, while a passive approach lacks accuracy in terms of traffic measurement. As a result, various efforts have been devoted to designing per-flow based network measurement system to address both accuracy and overhead challenges. Existing measurement techniques lack a multi-objective network measurement mechanism to overcome various overheads, like communication cost, controller computation, and accuracy in a real-time environment. Therefore, this paper presents a novel and practical solution to enable accurate real-time traffic matrix for the traffic measurement system in SDN. The solution is proposed to measure fine-grained monitoring task with less controller communication and computational cost with high accuracy. The solution is based on two measurement designs, namely: fixed and elastic schemas. Our experiments demonstrate that both fixed and elastic schemas achieve significant overhead reduction without compromising on accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

SARA observatories comprise a 0.96 m telescope at Kitt Peak, Arizona; one of 0.6 m aperture on Cerro Tololo, Chile; and the 1 m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope at the Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain. All are operated using standard VNC or Radmin protocols communicating with on-site PCs. Remote operation offers considerable flexibility in scheduling, allowing long-term observational cadences difficult to achieve with classical observing at remote facilities, as well as obvious travel savings. Multiple observers at different locations can share a telescope for training, educational use, or collaborative research programs. Each telescope has a CCD system for optical imaging, using thermoelectric cooling to avoid the need for frequent local service, and a second CCD for offset guiding. The Arizona and Chile telescopes also have fiber-fed echelle spectrographs. Switching between imaging and spectroscopy is very rapid, so a night can easily accommodate mixed observing modes. We present some sample observational programs. For the benefit of other groups organizing similar consortia, we describe the operating structure and principles of SARA, as well as some lessons learned from almost 20 years of remote operations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-6280	1538-3873		WOS:000390360700001		
J	Pratt, S. L.; Calcatera, S. M.								Expression of microRNA in male reproductive tissues and their role in male fertility								REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT				29	1			24	31		10.1071/RD16293			2017	2017	MicroRNA (miRNA) are small non-coding RNA, approximately 22 nucleotides in length, that regulate gene expression through their ability to bind to mRNA. The role of miRNA in cellular and tissue development is well documented and their importance in male reproductive tissue development is actively being evaluated. They are present in spermatogonia, Sertoli and Leydig cells within the testis and are present in mature spermatozoa, indicating roles in normal testicular development, function and spermatogenesis. Their presence in spermatozoa has led to postulations about the roles of male miRNA during early embryonic development after fertilisation, including chromatin restructuring and possible epigenetic effects on embryo development. MiRNAs are also present in body fluids, such as blood serum, milk, ovarian follicular fluid and seminal fluid. Circulating miRNAs are stable, and aberrant expression of cellular or extracellular miRNA has been associated with multiple pathophysiological conditions, the most studied being numerous forms of cancer. Considering that miRNAs are present in spermatozoa and in seminal fluid, their stability and the relatively non-invasive procedures required to obtain these samples make miRNAs excellent candidates for use as biomarkers of male reproduction and fertility. Biomarkers, such as miRNAs, identifying fertile males would be of financial interest to the animal production industry.

J	Li, Dian-Qing; Peng, Xing; Khoshnevisan, Sara; Juang, C. Hsein								Calibration of resistance factor for design of pile foundations considering feasibility robustness								COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS				81				229	238		10.1016/j.compgeo.2016.08.018			JAN 2017	2017	The resistance factor for pile foundations in load and resistance factor design (LRFD) is traditionally calibrated considering target reliability index (beta(T)) and statistics of load and resistance bias factors. However, the resistance bias factor is hard to quantify statistically. Consequently, the design obtained using the calibrated resistance factor can still miss beta(T) if the variation in resistance bias factor has been underestimated. In this paper, we propose a new resistance factor calibration approach to address this dilemma by considering "feasibility robustness" of design in the calibration process. Herein, the feasibility robustness is defined as a probability that the beta(T) requirement can still be satisfied even in the presence of uncertainty or variation in the computed bearing capacity. For illustration, LRFD approach for pile foundations commonly used in Shanghai, China is examined. Emphasis is placed on re-calibration of resistance factors at various feasibility robustness levels, with due consideration of the variation in the resistance bias factor. A case study is presented to illustrate the use of the re-calibrated resistance factors. The results show that the feasibility robustness is gained at the expense of cost efficiency; in other words, the two objectives are conflicting. To aid in the design decision-making, an optimal feasibility robustness level and corresponding resistance factors are suggested in the absence of a designer's preference. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this study were to investigate spatio-temporal patterns (e.g. soils, simple slope classes, slope aspect, and flow accumulation) of flowering around Lake Issaqueena, South Carolina (SC, USA) using plant-flowering database collected with GPS-enabled camera (stored in Picasa 3 web albums and project website) on a monthly basis in 2012 and LiDAR-based topography. Pacolet fine sandy loam had the most flowering plants, followed by Madison sandy loam, both dominant soil types around the lake. Most flowering plants were on moderately steep (17%-30%) and gently sloping (4%-8%) slopes. Most flowering plants were on west (247.5A degrees-292.5A degrees), southwest (202.5A degrees-247.5A degrees), and northwest (292.5A degrees-337.5A degrees) aspects. Most flowering plants were associated with minimum and maximum flows within the landscape. Chi-square tests indicated differences in the distributions of the proportions of flowering plants were significant by soil type, slope, aspect, and flow accumulation for each month (February-November), for all months (overall), and across months. The Chi-square test on area-normalized data indicated significant differences for all months and individual differences by each month with some months not statistically significant. Cluster analysis on flowering counts for nine plant families with the most flowering counts indicated no unique separation by cluster, but implied that the majority of these families were flowering on strongly sloping (9%-16%) slopes, on southwest (202.5A degrees-247.5A degrees) aspects, and low flow accumulation (0-200). Presented methodology can serve as a template for future efforts to quantify spatio-temporal patterns of flowering and other phenological events.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1009-637X	1861-9568		WOS:000388979600004

Operating without any specific surface functionalization or treatment; these devices utilize the strong surface polarization of AlGaN as well as the unique device geometries, to perform selective detection of analytes based on their latent heat of evaporation and molecular dipole moment over a wide concentration range. The presented model incorporates heat transfer, Joule heating, thermal expansion and evaporative heat loss mechanisms, to predict device behaviors such as temperature profiles and sensing performance limits under various steady-state and transient test conditions. In addition, the versatility of the proposed model enables us to successfully predict the capability of the device to perform mixture analysis, and provides guidelines to further optimize the device properties to achieve a limit of detection in sub-ppm concentration.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0960-1317	1361-6439		WOS:000389236300001

The effects of late gestation maternal nutrient restriction with or without protein supplementation on endocrine regulation of newborn and postnatal beef calves								THERIOGENOLOGY				87				64	71		10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.08.004			JAN 1 2017	2017	A study was conducted to evaluate late gestation maternal nutrient restriction (NR) with or without protein supplementation on endocrine regulation in newborn beef calves. This study used multiparous cows (4 and 5 years of age, n = 57) randomly assigned to one of three treatments for the last 100 days of gestation. The control (Con; n = 19) cows were fed to increase body condition score, whereas the NR (n = 19) and NR with protein supplement (NRS, n = 19) cows were fed to lose 1.2 +/- 0.2 body condition score units during the last 100 days of gestation. Control cows were allowed ad libitum access to tall fescue/crabgrass paddock and, when grazing became insufficient, ad libitum hay was provided along with 13 kg of corn gluten feed 5 days/wk. Tall fescue paddocks were strip grazed to limit forage availability for NR and NRS. The NRS-treated dams were individually penned and fed 0.45 kg of soybean meal 3 days/wk. As forage became limited, the nutrient restricted paddocks received limited fescue hay. After parturition cow/calf pairs were moved to a common pasture and received ad libitum silage and high-concentrate feed. Maternal NR regardless of supplementation reduced cow plasma glucose and insulin concentrations during late gestation (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0051, respectively). Calves from NR dams weighed less at birth than Con calves (P = 0.04), whereas NRS calves were intermediate (33.4 +/- 1.2, 35.0 +/- 13, and 37.2 +/- 13 kg NR, NRS, and Con, respectively). Plasma glucose concentrations of unsuckled calves at birth were reduced (P = 0.037) in NR and NRS calves compared with Con (67.7 +/- 6.5 and 60.1 +/- 6.9 vs. 83.7 +/- 6.1 mg/dL, respectively). At birth, Con and NRS calves had increased (P = 0.0037) plasma leptin concentrations compared with NR calves, whereas calf plasma cortisol concentrations were greater for the nutrient-restricted groups than the Con group (treatment x day P = 0.0135). Plasma IgG concentrations from calves at 5 days of age were similar (P = 0.701) between maternal late gestation treatments. This research reports that late gestation NR reduces postnatal calf birth weight, plasma glucose and leads to reduced plasma leptin. Maternal protein supplementation appears to partially alleviate the effects of late gestation NR on reducing plasma leptin, birth weight, and growth rate from Day 30 of age to weaning.

Exploring the Effectiveness of Outreach Strategies in Conservation Projects: The Case of the Audubon Toyota TogetherGreen Program								SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES				30	1			95	111		10.1080/08941920.2016.1164266			2017	2017	Successfully engaging target audiences represents a key challenge for environmental conservation projects. In this study, we examined 354 conservation projects implemented across the United States with the intention of systematically exploring the relationships between different forms of outreach (in particular, message content and delivery) and self-reported project outcomes. Using end-of-program retrospective surveys, we found that experiential engagement and directly demonstrating and/or communicating the ease of potential conservation actions were most consistently related to achieving desired project outcomes. Although it was thought to be largely effective by project managers, we found that focusing on equipping audiences with new knowledge was negatively related to conservation outcomes. Measured outreach variables explained between 15% and 17% of the variance in project outcomes, suggesting a wide variety of unmeasured factors at play. We discuss insights relevant to engaging target audiences in future U.S. conservation projects.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0894-1920	1521-0723		WOS:000386679900008

Variation in perfluoroalkyl acids in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge								CHEMOSPHERE				166				72	79		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.088			JAN 2017	2017	This study aimed to quantify concentrations of fifteen perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in the plasma of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) inhabiting wetlands surrounding the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, USA located at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (MINWR). Approximately 10 male and 10 female alligators (n(total) = 229) were sampled each month during 2008 and 2009 to determine if seasonal or spatial trends existed with PFAA burden. PFOS represented the highest plasma burden (median 185 ng/g) and PFHxS the second highest (median 7.96 ng/g). While no significant seasonal trends were observed, unique spatial trends emerged. Many of the measured PFAAs co-varied strongly together and similar trends were observed for PFOS, PFDA, PFUnA, and PFDoA, as well as for PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA, PFTriA, and PHA, suggesting more than one source of PFAAs at MINWR. Higher concentrations of PFOS and the PFAAs that co-varied with PFOS were collected from animals around sites that included the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) fire house and the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout (O&C) retention pond, while higher concentrations of PFOA and the PFAA that co-varied with PFOA were sampled from animals near the gun range and the old fire training facility. Sex-based differences and snout-vent length (SVL) correlations with PFAA burden were also investigated.

J	Daouia, Abdelaati; Simar, Leopold; Wilson, Paul W.								Measuring firm performance using nonparametric quantile-type distances								ECONOMETRIC REVIEWS				36	1-3			156	181		10.1080/07474938.2015.1114289			2017	2017	When faced with multiple inputs and outputs , traditional quantile regression of Y conditional on X=x for measuring economic efficiency in the output (input) direction is thwarted by the absence of a natural ordering of Euclidean space for dimensions q (p) greater than one. Daouia and Simar (2007) used nonstandard conditional quantiles to address this problem, conditioning on Yy (Xx) in the output (input) orientation, but the resulting quantiles depend on the a priori chosen direction. This article uses a dimensionless transformation of the (p+q)-dimensional production process to develop an alternative formulation of distance from a realization of (X, Y) to the efficient support boundary, motivating a new, unconditional quantile frontier lying inside the joint support of (X, Y), but near the full, efficient frontier. The interpretation is analogous to univariate quantiles and corrects some of the disappointing properties of the conditional quantile-based approach. By contrast with the latter, our approach determines a unique partial-quantile frontier independent of the chosen orientation (input, output, hyperbolic, or directional distance). We prove that both the resulting efficiency score and its estimator share desirable monotonicity properties. Simple arguments from extreme-value theory are used to derive the asymptotic distributional properties of the corresponding empirical efficiency scores (both full and partial). The usefulness of the quantile-type estimator is shown from an infinitesimal and global robustness theory viewpoints via a comparison with the previous conditional quantile-based approach. A diagnostic tool is developed to find the appropriate quantile-order; in the literature to date, this trimming order has been fixed a priori. The methodology is used to analyze the performance of U.S. credit unions, where outliers are likely to affect traditional approaches.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0747-4938	1532-4168		WOS:000385938400009

Successful islet cell microencapsulation in biopolymers is a key step for providing immunoisolation of transplanted islet cells. Because of the variability in the size and shape of pancreatic islets, one of the main obstacles in their microencapsulation is the inability to consistently control shape, size, and microstructure of the encapsulating biopolymer capsule. In this chapter, we provide a detailed description of a microfluidic approach to islet cell encapsulation in alginate that might address the microencapsulation challenges.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1940-6029		MEDLINE:27738927	27738927

Lessons learned from the usability assessment of home-based telemedicine systems								APPLIED ERGONOMICS				58				424	434		10.1016/j.apergo.2016.08.003			JAN 2017	2017	At-home telemedicine visits are quickly becoming an acceptable alternative for in-person patient visits. However, little work has been done to understand the usability of these home-based telemedicine solutions. It is critical for user acceptance and real-world applicability to evaluate available telemedicine solutions within the context-specific needs of the users of this technology. To address this need, this study evaluated the usability of four home-based telemedicine software platforms: Doxy.me, Vidyo, VSee, and Polycom. Using a within-subjects experimental design, twenty participants were asked to complete a telemedicine session involving several tasks using the four platforms. Upon completion of these tasks for each platform, participants completed the IBM computer system usability questionnaire (CSUOJ and the NASA Task Load Index test. Upon completing the tasks on all four platforms, the participants completed a final post-test subjective questionnaire ranking the platforms based on their preference. Of the twenty participants, 19 completed the study. Statistically significant differences among the telemedicine software platforms were found for task completion time, total workload, mental demand, effort, frustration, preference ranking and computer system usability scores. Usability problems with installation and account creation led to high mental demand and task completion time, suggesting the participants preferred a system without such requirements. Majority of the usability issues were identified at the telemedicine initiation phase. The findings from this study can be used by software developers to develop user-friendly telemedicine systems.

The results from the study indicated several factors had an effect on the status of FSMS, associated with company size, location, target market, and valid certificates. The results also revealed a weakness of FSMS on good manufacture practices, including contamination control, pest control, clean and disinfection, facility environment and personal hygiene. In order to precisely measure implementation performance and better identify insufficiency, unannounced assessment was shown to be more efficient than announced assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These dynamics such as chaotic motion, size dependent clustering and separation can have important consequences in many natural and engineered settings. Though fluid streamlines are global attractors for the inertial particles, regions of local instability can exist where the inertial particle can move away from the fluid streamlines. Identifying and manipulating the location of the so called stable and unstable regions in the fluid flow can find important applications in microfluidics. Research in the last two decades has identified analytical criteria that can partition the fluid domain into locally stable and unstable regions. In this paper, we identify two new mechanisms by which neutrally buoyant inertial particles could exhibit globally stable dynamics in the regions of the fluid flow that are thought to be locally unstable and demonstrate this with examples. The examples we use are restricted to the simpler case of time independent fluid flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1007-5704	1878-7274		WOS:000381584600025

The catalysts were synthesized by simple impregnation of the metal salts on carbon support and followed by pyrolysis in CH4 atmosphere. The obtained catalysts show impressive HER activities in both brine and alkaline media. At current density of -7.0 mA cm(-2), the overpotential for Co modified Mo/C catalysts was greater than that obtained with a commercial Pt/C catalyst by 63-89 mV and 15-148 mV for brine and alkaline solution, respectively. Our findings for HER in both media are consistent with electrochemical desorption of hydrogen gas following the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism as the rate-determining step. The HER activities of the catalysts were correlated to their high mesopore surface areas with active pores, nanocrystallites, and low charge transfer resistances as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

The model system consisted of an azide modified bovine serum albumin (azBSA) that had been covalently attached to an alkyne modified silicon phthalocyanine (alSiPc) derivative through a copper catalyzed azide/alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition (click reaction). The azBSA/alSiPc assembly was then clicked to a ca. 67 nm poly(propargyl acrylate) (PA) nanoparticle (PA/azBSA/alSiPc). The resulting particles did not exhibit any florescence when the alSiPc was excited. Incubating the particles at 37 degrees C for 30 min with a proteolytic enzyme (trypsin) degraded the linking BSA and resulted in the appearance of florescence that was attributed to a "free" silicon phthalocyanine. The PA/azBSA/alSiPc particles were incubated with human non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549) and the florescence of the initially quenched particles was achieved with cellular uptake.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000390660000014	27892586

TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik											10.1007/s00122-016-2844-6			2016-Dec-27	2016	KEY MESSAGE: Coordinated association and linkage mapping identified 25 grain quality QTLs in multiple environments, and fine mapping of the Wx locus supports the use of high-density genetic markers in linkage mapping. There is a wide range of end-use products made from cereal grains, and these products often demand different grain characteristics. Fortunately, cereal crop species including sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] contain high phenotypic variation for traits influencing grain quality. Identifying genetic variants underlying this phenotypic variation allows plant breeders to develop genotypes with grain attributes optimized for their intended usage. Multiple sorghum mapping populations were rigorously phenotyped across two environments (SC Coastal Plain and Central TX) in 2years for five major grain quality traits: amylose, starch, crude protein, crude fat, and gross energy. Coordinated association and linkage mapping revealed several robust QTLs that make prime targets to improve grain quality for food, feed, and fuel products. Although the amylose QTL interval spanned many megabases, the marker with greatest significance was located just 12kb from waxy (Wx), the primary gene regulating amylose production in cereal grains. This suggests higher resolution mapping in recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations can be obtained when genotyped at a high marker density. The major QTL for crude fat content, identified in both a RIL population and grain sorghum diversity panel, encompassed the DGAT1 locus, a critical gene involved in maize lipid biosynthesis. Another QTL on chromosome 1 was consistently mapped in both RIL populations for multiple grain quality traits including starch, crude protein, and gross energy. Collectively, these genetic regions offer excellent opportunities to manipulate grain composition and set up future studies for gene validation.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1432-2242		MEDLINE:28028582	28028582	
J	Davis, Kathleen; Cole, Brian; Ghelardini, Melanie; Powell, Brian A.; Mefford, O. Thompson								Quantitative Measurement of Ligand Exchange with Small-Molecule Ligands on Iron Oxide Nanoparticles via Radioanalytical Techniques								LANGMUIR				32	51			13716	13727		10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b03644			DEC 27 2016	2016	Ligand exchange on the surface of hydrophobic iron oxide nanoparticles is a common method for controlling surface chemistry for a desired application. Furthermore, ligand exchange with small-molecule ligands may be necessary to obtain particles with a specific size or functionality. Understanding to what extent ligand exchange occurs and what factors affect it is important for the optimization of this critical procedure. However, quantifying the amount of exchange may be difficult because of the limitations of commonly used characterization techniques. Therefore, we utilized a radiotracer technique to track the exchange of a radiolabeled C-14-oleic acid ligand with hydrophilic small-molecule ligands on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles. Iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with C-14-oleic acid were modified with small-molecule ligands with terminal functional groups including catechols, phosphonates, sulfonates, thiols, carboxylic acids, and silanes. These moieties were selected because they represent the most commonly used ligands for this procedure. The effectiveness of these molecules was compared using both procedures widely found in the literature and using a standardized procedure. After ligand exchange, the nanoparticles were analyzed using liquid scintillation counting (LSC) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The labeled and unlabeled particles were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the particle size, hydrodynamic diameter, and zeta potential. The unlabeled particles were characterized via attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR FTIR) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) to confirm the presence of the small molecules on the particles and verify the magnetic properties, respectively. Radioanalytical determination of C-14-oleic acid was used to calculate the total amount of oleic acid remaining on the surface of the particles after ligand exchange. The results revealed that the ligand-exchange reactions performed using widely cited procedures did not go to completion. Residual oleic acid remained on the particles after these reactions and the reactions using a standardized protocol. A comparison of the ligand-exchange procedures indicated that the binding moiety, multidenticity, reaction time, temperature, and presence of a catalyst impacted the extent of exchange. Quantification of the oleic acid remaining after ligand exchange revealed a binding hierarchy in which catechol-derived anchor groups displace the most oleic acid on the surface of the nanoparticles and the thiol group displaces the least amount of oleic acid. Thorough characterization of ligand exchange is required to develop nanoparticles suitable for their intended application.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-7463			WOS:000391080800017	27966977	
J	Porter, Michael M; Ravikumar, Nakul; Barthelat, Francois; Martini, Roberto								3D-printing and mechanics of bio-inspired articulated and multi-material structures.								Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials											10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.12.016			2016-Dec-21	2016	3D-printing technologies allow researchers to build simplified physical models of complex biological systems to more easily investigate their mechanics. In recent years, a number of 3D-printed structures inspired by the dermal armors of various fishes have been developed to study their multiple mechanical functionalities, including flexible protection, improved hydrodynamics, body support, or tail prehensility. Natural fish armors are generally classified according to their shape, material and structural properties as elasmoid scales, ganoid scales, placoid scales, carapace scutes, or bony plates. Each type of dermal armor forms distinct articulation patterns that facilitate different functional advantages. In this paper, we highlight recent studies that developed 3D-printed structures not only to inform the design and application of some articulated and multi-material structures, but also to explain the mechanics of the natural biological systems they mimic.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1878-0180		MEDLINE:28131676	28131676

Lycopene has antioxidant properties. Lycopene content, sugar content and hollowheart resistance are subject to significant genotype x environment interaction (G x E), which makes breeding for these fruit quality traits difficult. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the influence of years and locations on lycopene content, sugar content and hollowheart resistance for a set of watermelon genotypes, and (ii) identify genotypes with high stability for lycopene, sugar, and hollowheart resistance. A diverse set of 40 genotypes was tested over 3 years and 8 locations across the southern United States in replicated, multi-harvest trials. Lycopene was tested in a subset of 10 genotypes. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate stability statistics (BLUP-GGE biplot) using SASGxE and RGxE programs. There were strong effects of environment as well as G x E interaction on watermelon quality traits. On the basis of stability measures, genotypes were classified as stable or unstable for each quality trait. 'Crimson Sweet' is an inbred line with high quality trait performance as well as trait stability. 'Stone Mountain', 'Tom Watson', 'Crimson Sweet' and 'Minilee' were among the best genotypes for lycopene content, sugar content and hollowheart resistance. We developed a stability chart based on marketable yield and average ranking generated from different stability measures for yield attributes and quality traits. The chart will assist in choosing parents for improvement of watermelon cultivars.

J	Glatz, Brittany; Sarupria, Sapna								The surface charge distribution affects the ice nucleating efficiency of silver iodide								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				145	21					211924	10.1063/1.4966018			DEC 21 2016	2016	Heterogeneous ice nucleation is the primary pathway for ice formation. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which surfaces promote or hinder ice nucleation are not well understood. We present results from extensive molecular dynamics simulations of ice nucleation near modified silver iodide (AgI) surfaces. The AgI surfaces are modified to investigate the effects of the surface charge distribution on the rate of ice nucleation. We find that the surface charge distribution has significant effects on ice nucleation. Specifically, AgI surfaces with the positive charges above the negative charges in the surface promote ice nucleation, while ice nucleation is hindered for surfaces in which the negative charges are above or in-plane with the positive charges. The structure of water molecules in the interfacial region as measured by the orientations of the water molecules relative to the surface can explain the differences in the ice nucleation at the different surfaces. We suggest that the distributions of the orientations of the interfacial water molecules could be used more broadly as a measure of ice nucleating propensity.

However, the depth information is lost due to integration of fluorescence signals along the propagation direction. We describe the design and implementation of two-photon lasers scanning stereomicroscopy, which allows viewing dynamic processes in three-dimensional (3D) space stereoscopically in real-time with shutter glasses at the speed of 1.4 volumes per second. The depth information can be appreciated by human visual system or be recovered with correspondence algorithms for some cases.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000392842900083	27997624	
J	Li, Suyi; Wang, K W								Plant-inspired adaptive structures and materials for morphing and actuation: a review.								Bioinspiration & biomimetics				12	1			011001	011001					2016 Dec 20	2016	Plants exhibit a variety of reversible motions, from the slow opening of pine cones to the impulsive closing of Venus flytrap leaves. These motions are achieved without muscles and they have inspired a wide spectrum of engineered materials and structures. This review summarizes the recent developments of plant-inspired adaptive structures and materials for morphing and actuation. We begin with a brief overview of the actuation strategies and physiological features associated to these plant movements, showing that different combinations of these strategies and features can lead to motions with different deformation characteristics and response speeds. Then we offer a comprehensive survey of the plant-inspired morphing and actuation systems, including pressurized cellular structures, osmotic actuation, anisotropic hygroscopic materials, and bistable systems for rapid movements. Although these engineered systems are vastly different in terms of their size scales and intended applications, their working principles are all related to the actuation strategies and physiological features in plants. This review is to promote future cross-disciplinary studies between plant biology and engineering, which can foster new solutions for many applications such as morphing airframes, soft robotics and kinetic architectures.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1748-3190		MEDLINE:27995902	27995902

Membranes				6	4						10.3390/membranes6040059			2016 Dec 20	2016	An evaluation of the performance of polyelectrolyte-modified nanofiber membranes was undertaken to determine their efficacy in the rapid uptake and recovery of heavy metals from impaired waters. The membranes were prepared by grafting poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(itaconic acid) (PIA) to cellulose nanofiber mats. Performance measurements quantified the dynamic ion-exchange capacity for cadmium (Cd), productivity, and recovery of Cd(II) from the membranes by regeneration. The dynamic binding capacities of Cd(II) on both types of nanofiber membrane were independent of the linear flow velocity, with a residence time of as low as 2 s. Analysis of breakthrough curves indicated that the mass flow rate increased rapidly at constant applied pressure after membranes approached equilibrium load capacity for Cd(II), apparently due to a collapse of the polymer chains on the membrane surface, leading to an increased porosity. This mechanism is supported by hydrodynamic radius (Rh) measurements for PAA and PIA obtained from dynamic light scattering, which show that Rh values decrease upon Cd(II) binding. Volumetric productivity was high for the nanofiber membranes, and reached 0.55 mg Cd/g/min. The use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as regeneration reagent was effective in fully recovering Cd(II) from the membranes. Ion-exchange capacities were constant over five cycles of binding-regeneration.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:27999394	27999394

With a measured recurrence period of P-rec = 351 +/- 13 days (we believe the true value to be half of this) and a white dwarf very close to the Chandrasekhar limit, M31N 2008-12a has become the leading pre-explosion supernova type Ia progenitor candidate. Following multi-wavelength follow-up observations of the 2013 and 2014 eruptions, we initiated a campaign to ensure early detection of the predicted 2015 eruption, which triggered ambitious ground and space-based follow-up programs. In this paper we present the 2015 detection, visible to near-infrared photometry and visible spectroscopy, and ultraviolet and X-ray observations from the Swift. observatory. The LCOGT 2 m (Hawaii) discovered the 2015 eruption, estimated to have commenced at August 28.28 +/- 0.12 UT. The 2013-2015 eruptions are remarkably similar at all wavelengths. New early spectroscopic observations reveal short-lived emission from material with velocities similar to 13,000 km s(-1), possibly collimated outflows. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of the eruption provide strong evidence supporting a red giant donor. An apparently stochastic variability during the early supersoft X-ray phase was comparable in amplitude and duration to past eruptions, but the 2013 and 2015 eruptions show evidence of a brief flux dip during this phase. The multi-eruption Swift/XRT spectra show tentative evidence of high-ionization emission lines above a high-temperature continuum. Following Henze et al. (2015a), the updated recurrence period based on all known eruptions is P-rec = 174 +/- 10 days, and we expect the next eruption of M31N 2008-12a. to occur around 2016 mid-September.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000391169600024

We demonstrate in this work a continuous sheath-free separation of both a binary and a ternary particle mixture in viscoelastic polymer solutions through straight rectangular microchannels. This label-free separation arises from the flow-induced lift force that directs particles toward size-sensitive focusing positions in a high width/height channel. It is found to be a strong function of multiple experimental parameters, which is systematically investigated in terms of dimensionless numbers. We propose to explain the observed lateral shifting of particle focusing positions as a result of the competing center- (due to fluid elasticity effects) and wall- (due to fluid elasticity and shear thinning effects) directed elastic lift forces. The inertial lift force comes into effect at relatively high flow rates, which appears to reduce the separation efficiency and purity in our experiments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000390621000047	28193020

Relative Importance of Different Water Categories as Sources of N-Nitrosamine Precursors								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				50	24			13239	13248		10.1021/acs.est.6b04650			DEC 20 2016	2016	A comparison of loadings of N-nitrosamines and their precursors from different source water categories is needed to design effective source water blending strategies. Previous research using Formation Potential (FP) chloramination protocols (high dose and prolonged contact times) raised concerns about precursor loadings from various source water categories, but differences in the protocols employed rendered comparisons difficult. In this study, we applied Uniform Formation Condition (UFC) chloramination and ozonation protocols mimicking typical disinfection practice to compare loadings of ambient specific and total N-nitrosamines as well as chloramine-reactive and ozone-reactive precursors in 47 samples, including 6 pristine headwaters, 16 eutrophic waters, 4 agricultural runoff samples, 9 stormwater runoff samples, and 12 municipal wastewater effluents. N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation from UFC and FP chloramination protocols did not correlate, with NDMA FP often being significant in samples where no NDMA formed under UFC conditions. N-Nitrosamines and their precursors were negligible in pristine headwaters. Conventional and to a lesser degree, nutrient removal wastewater effluents were the dominant source of NDMA and its chloramine- and ozone-reactive precursors. While wastewater effluents were dominant sources of TONO and their precursors, algal blooms, and to a lesser degree agricultural or stormwater runoff, could be important where they affect a major fraction of the water supply.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000390620900009	27993049

Linker dependent intercalation of bisbenzimidazole-aminosugars in an RNA duplex; selectivity in RNA vs. DNA binding								BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS				26	24			5989	5994		10.1016/j.bmcl.2016.10.076			DEC 15 2016	2016	Neomycin and Hoechst 33258 are two well-known nucleic acid binders that interact with RNA and DNA duplexes with high affinities respectively. In this manuscript, we report that covalent attachment of bisbenzimidazole unit derived from Hoechst 33258 to neomycin leads to intercalative binding of the bisbenzimidazole unit (oriented at 64-74 with respected to the RNA helical axis) in a linker length dependent manner. The dual binding and intercalation of conjugates were supported by thermal denaturation, CD, LD and UV-Vis absorption experiments. These studies highlight the importance of linker length in dual recognition by conjugates, for effective RNA recognition, which can lead to novel ways of recognizing RNA structures. Additionally, the ligand library screens also identify DNA and RNA selective compounds, with compound 9, containing a long linker, showing a 20.3 degrees C change in RNA duplex T-m with only a 13.0 degrees C change in T-m for the corresponding DNA duplex. Significantly, the shorter linker in compound 3 shows almost the reverse trend, a 23.8 degrees C change in DNA T-m, with only a 9.1 degrees C change in T-m for the corresponding RNA duplex.

Exploiting stiffness nonlinearities to improve flow energy capture from the wake of a bluff body								PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA				337				30	42		10.1016/j.physd.2016.07.005			DEC 15 2016	2016	Fluid-structure coupling mechanisms such as wake galloping have been recently utilized to develop scalable flow energy harvesters. Unlike traditional rotary-type generators which are known to suffer serious scalability issues because their efficiency drops significantly as their size decreases; wake galloping flow energy harvesters (FEHs) operate using a very simple motion mechanism, and, hence can be scaled down to fit the desired application. Nevertheless, wake-galloping FEHs have their own shortcomings. Typically, a wake-galloping FEH has a linear restoring force which results in a very narrow lock-in region. As a result, it does not perform well under the broad range of shedding frequencies normally associated with a variable flow speed. To overcome this critical problem, this article demonstrates theoretically and experimentally that, a bi-stable restoring force can be used to broaden the steady-state bandwidth of wake galloping FEHs and, thereby to decrease their sensitivity to variations in the flow speed. An experimental case study is carried out in a wind tunnel to compare the performance of a bistable and a linear FEH under single- and multi-frequency vortex street. An experimentally-validated lumped-parameters model of the bi-stable harvester is also introduced, and solved using the method of multiple scales to study the influence of the shape of the potential energy function on the output voltage.

An effect of composition induced optical transparency, due to the strong modification of the density of states, was observed for symmetrical compositions with approximately equal amount of components. Based on our spectroscopic ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies we can suggest that the variation of the refractive index, which is significantly reduced in the visible range for ternary systems, is involved in the physical mechanism of the phenomenon. Despite of an addition of the IR absorbing component (which allows broadening of the absorption band to up to 800 nm) no improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is observed in comparison to the binary BHJ system (P3HT:PCBM). Nevertheless, we believe that further advance of the efficiency will be possible if the energy levels will be chemically designed to avoid formation of charge traps at the BHJ interface during light excitation. Such fine adjustment of the system should become possible with a proper choice of polymer:dye composition due to a high versatility of the polymethine dyes demonstrated in previous studies.

These polymers are distinguished from other ionic macromolecules by their rigidity and therefore in their network structure. QENS measurements as a function of temperature as the fraction of ionic groups and humidity were varied have shown that the polymer molecules are immobile while absorbed water molecules remain dynamic. The water molecules occupy multiple sites, either bound or loosely constrained, and bounce between the two. With increasing temperature and hydration levels, the system becomes more dynamic. Water molecules remain mobile even at subzero temperatures, illustrating the applicability of the SPP membrane for selective transport over a broad temperature range.

NAD(+) as a Hydride Donor and Reductant								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				138	49			15833	15836		10.1021/jacs.6b10451			DEC 14 2016	2016	Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) can generate a ruthenium-hydride intermediate that catalyzes the reduction of O-2 to H2O2, which endows it with potent anticancer properties. A catalyst that could access a Ru-H intermediate using oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) as the H- source, however, could draw upon a supply of reducing equivalents 1000-fold more abundant than NADH, which would enable significantly greater H2O2 production. Herein, it is demonstrated, using the reduction of ABTS(center dot-) to ABTS(2-), that NAD(+) can function as a reductant. Mechanistic evidence is presented that suggests a Ru-H intermediate is formed via beta-hydride elimination from a ribose subunit in NAD(+). The insight gained from the heretofore unknown ability of NAD(+) to function as a reductant and H- donor may lead to undiscovered biological carbohydrate oxidation pathways and new chemotherapeutic strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7863			WOS:000389962800010	27960347

J	McGuire, Rachel; Borem, Ryan; Mercuri, Jeremy								The fabrication and characterization of a multi-laminate, angle-ply collagen patch for annulus fibrosus repair.								Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine											10.1002/term.2250			2016-Dec-12	2016	One major limitation of intervertebral disc (IVD) repair is that no ideal biomaterial has been developed that effectively mimics the angle-ply collagen architecture and mechanical properties of the native annulus fibrosus (AF). Furthermore, it would be beneficial to devise a simple, scalable process by which to manufacture a biomimetic biomaterial that could function as a mechanical repair patch to be secured over a large defect in the outer AF that will support AF tissue regeneration. Such a biomaterial would: (1) enable the employment of early-stage interventional strategies to treat IVD degeneration (i.e. nucleus pulposus arthroplasty); (2) prevent IVD re-herniation in patients with large AF defects; and (3) serve as a platform to develop full-thickness AF and whole IVD tissue engineering strategies. Due to the innate collagen fibre alignment and mechanical strength of pericardium, a procedure was developed to assemble multi-laminate angle-ply AF patches derived from decellularized pericardial tissue. Patches were subsequently assessed histologically to confirm angle-ply microarchitecture, and mechanically assessed for biaxial burst strength and tensile properties. Additionally, patch cytocompatibility was evaluated following seeding with bovine AF cells. This study demonstrated the effective removal of porcine cell remnants from the pericardium, and the ability to reliably produce multi-laminate patches with angle-ply architecture using a simple assembly technique. Resultant patches demonstrated their inherent ability to resist biaxial burst pressures reminiscent of intradiscal pressures commonly borne by the AF, and exhibited tensile strength and modulus values reported for native human AF. Furthermore, the biomaterial supported AF cell viability, infiltration and proliferation. Copyright 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1932-7005		MEDLINE:27943659	27943659

Here we present an adaptive feedback approach to address the data throughput issue in lambda SPR biosensing. A feedback loop constantly tracks the dip location while target-molecule binding occurs at the sensor surface. An adaptive window is then imposed to reduce the number of data points that each pixel has to capture without compromising measurement accuracy. Rapid wavelength scanning is performed with a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF). With the use of a feedback loop, our demonstration system can produce a dip measurement within 700ms, thus confirming that the reported lambda SPR approach is most suitable for real-time micro-array label-free biosensing applications.

J	Narman, Husnu S.; Atiquzzaman, Mohammed; Rahmani-Andebili, Mehdi; Shen, Haiying								Joint and selective periodic component carrier assignment for LTE-A								COMPUTER NETWORKS				110				192	205		10.1016/j.comnet.2016.09.024			DEC 9 2016	2016	The bandwidth demand for mobile Internet access is significantly increased with the number of mobile users. Carrier aggregation has been proposed to answer this demand in mobile networks. In carrier aggregation, the best available one or more component carriers of each band are assigned to each user to provide efficient services. Several works have been reported in the literature on mandatory and periodic component carrier assignment methods. Although the former works, especially periodic component carrier assignment methods, have significantly improved the performance of LTE-A systems, many limitations still exist. One limitation of previous works is that data transfer is interrupted during periodic component carrier assignment operations thus, decrease the performance of the system. Therefore, in this paper, selective periodic component carrier assignment technique, which allows continuous data transfer during periodic carrier assignment operations, is proposed and followed by integration of selective technique into four component carrier assignment methods: Least Load, Least Load Rate, Random, and Channel Quality to observe the performance improvements. Results indicate that the proposed selective technique increases the throughput ratio up to 18% and decreases average delay up to 50%. Our analysis and proposed technique will assist service providers to build efficient periodic component carrier assignment methods to improve the performance of the system by reducing delay and increasing throughput ratio.

Tailoring Microbial Electrochemical Cells for Production of Hydrogen Peroxide at High Concentrations and Efficiencies								CHEMSUSCHEM				9	23			3345	3352					DEC 8 2016	2016	A microbial peroxide producing cell (MPPC) for H2O2 production at the cathode was systematically optimized with minimal energy input. First, the stability of H2O2 was evaluated using different catholytes, membranes, and catalyst materials. On the basis of these results, a flat-plate MPPC fed continuously using 200 mm NaCl catholyte at a 4 h hydraulic retention time was designed and operated, producing H2O2 for 18 days. H2O2 concentration of 3.1 gL(-1) H2O2 with 1.1 Whg(-1) H2O2 power input was achieved in the MPPC. The high H2O2 concentration was a result of the optimum materials selected. The small energy input was largely the result of the 0.5 cm distance between the anode and cathode, which reduced ionic transport losses. However, >50% of operational overpotentials were due to the 4.5-5 pH unit difference between the anode and cathode chambers. The results demonstrate that a MPPC can continuously produce H2O2 at high concentration by selecting compatible materials and appropriate operating conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631			CCC:000394571400013	27863051

Limited tensile biomechanical properties of human TMJ discs have been reported. Stress relaxation tests were conducted on TMJ disc specimens harvested bilaterally from six males and six females (68.9 +/- 7.9 years), with step-strain increments of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%, at 1% strain-per-second. Stress versus strain plots were constructed, and Young's Modulus, Instantaneous Modulus and Relaxed Modulus were determined. The effects of direction, region, and sex were examined. Regional effects were significant (p < 0.01) for Young's Modulus and Instantaneous Modulus. Anteroposteriorly, the central region was significantly stiffer than medial and lateral regions. Mediolaterally, the posterior region was significantly stiffer than central and anterior regions. In the central region, anteroposteriorly directed specimens were significantly stiffer compared to mediolateral specimens (p < 0.04). TMJ disc stiffness, indicated by Young's Modulus and Instantaneous Modulus, was higher in directions corresponding to high fiber alignment. Additionally, human TMJ discs were stiffer for females compared to males, with higher Young's Modulus and Instantaneous Modulus, and female TMJ discs relaxed less. However, sex effects were not statistically significant. Using second-harmonic generation microscopy, regional collagen fiber organization was identified as a potentially significant factor in determining the biomechanical properties for any combination of direction and region. These findings establish structure-function relationships between collagen fiber direction and organization with biomechanical response to tensile loading, and may provide insights into the prevalence of TMJ disorders among women.

However, enhancing the electrochemical properties of these materials without complicated structural modifications remains a challenge. Herein, we present the preparation of a hybrid electrode system via polydiacetylene (PDA) cloaking on the surface of aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) through self-assembly based in situ photopolymerization. This strategy eliminates the need for initiators and binders that hinder electrochemical performance in conventional conducting polymer based composite electrodes. As noncovalent PDA cloaking did not alter the chemical structure of MWCNTs, high inherent conductivity from sp(2) hybridized carbon was preserved. The resulting hybrid microfiber (MWCNT@PDA) exhibited a significant increase in specific capacitance (1111 F g(-1)) when compared to bare MWCNTs (500 F g(-1)) and PDA (666.7 F g(-1)) in a voltage window of 0-1.2 V at a current density of 3 A g(-1) in 0.5 M K2SO4 electrolyte. The specific capacitance was retained (ca. 95%) after 7000 charge/discharge cycles. The present results suggest that aligned MWCNTs cloaked with conjugated polymers could meet the demands for future flexible electronics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			WOS:000389624600003	27934157

However, the high cost of such CFs and the environmental concerns during its manufacturing (from PAN) are stimulating research on alternative bio-based precursors and environmentally friendly processing routes. This review summarizes the recent research studies on the pathways for converting cellulose and lignin (most abundant and renewable biomass) into suitable precursor fibers and CFs. The role of various bio-based precursors, fiber spinning routes, and process conditions on the final properties of CFs is discussed. Although bio-based CFs reported in the current research studies have limited strength and modulus to be considered for high-performance aerospace applications, further progress in precursor purification and optimized fiber processing may lead to their application in less demanding structural applications such as automotive and industrial. Even in their current state, a lack of graphitic crystallinity results in a lower conductivity for the resulting CFs and makes them suitable for ultrahigh temperature insulative applications. Furthermore, the noncrystalline form of carbon obtained from bio-based precursors clearly indicates a significant potential of carbon nanofibers, mats, and activated CFs in nonstructural applications that require a large specific surface area, such as electrochemical energy storage and purification.

J	Zhang, Meng; Ogale, Amod A.								Effect of temperature and concentration of acetylated-lignin solutions on dry-spinning of carbon fiber precursors								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				133	45	SI				43663	10.1002/app.43663			DEC 5 2016	2016	Carbon fibers derived from biomass such as lignin have received increasing attention due to the sustainability of the precursor. In this study, partially acetylated softwood Kraft lignin (Ace-SKL) was investigated for the purpose of dry-spinning into carbon fiber precursors. The viscosity of solutions prepared from different concentrations of acetylated-lignin and acetone were investigated at high shear rates encountered during fiber spinning. Ace-SKL solutions displayed a significant shear-thinning behavior at all temperatures studied with power-law exponents ranging from 0.33 to 0.82, confirming the macromolecular nature of the Ace-SKL lignin/acetone solutions. As expected, elevated temperatures led to lower viscosities and facilitated extrusion at moderate pressures. Dry-spinning was performed over a range of concentrations and temperatures. Fibers obtained from room temperature dry-spinning displayed a relatively smooth surface but the pressure drop was excessive. Lignin fibers from elevated temperatures spinning displayed more crenulated surface pattern, and more crenulations achieved for fibers spun at higher temperatures. Presence of some doubly-convex and sharp crevices was found on fibers produced from solutions containing lower concentrations (1.85 and 2.00 g lignin/mL solvent). In contrast, no crevices were found on the fibers obtained from the concentrated solution (2.15 g/mL), likely due to the reduced extent of solvent out-diffusion. It was observed that the sharp crevices found in the lignin fibers spun at lower concentrations led to carbon fibers with occlusion type defects, thence reduced strength. In summary, this study elucidates the importance of precursor composition and processing conditions on microstructure and properties of resulting precursor and carbon fibers.

The crystal structure of the hollandite across the entire compositional range remained in the I4/m space group. Structural evolution was resolved by neutron diffraction, total scattering data, and density functional theory calculations. A trend of decreasing thermodynamic stability with smaller tunnel cations was attributed to increased structural distortion observed in the system. In addition, the tunnel cations' local environment was studied in the eightfold coordinated oxygen cavities. Local binding features of the tunnel cations reveals that the hollandite structure can strongly stabilize tunnel cations, even at elevated temperatures up to 500 K.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000393844100034		
J	Guo, Hong; Cao, Min; Zou, Sige; Ye, Boping; Dong, Yuqing								Cranberry Extract Standardized for Proanthocyanidins Alleviates beta-Amyloid Peptide Toxicity by Improving Proteostasis Through HSF-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans Model of Alzheimer's Disease								JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES				71	12			1564	1573		10.1093/gerona/glv165			DEC 2016	2016	A growing body of evidence suggests that nutraceuticals with prolongevity properties may delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently demonstrated that a proanthocyanidins-standardized cranberry extract has properties that prolong life span and promote innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans. In this article, we report that supplementation of this cranberry extract delayed A beta toxicity-triggered body paralysis in the C elegans AD model. Genetic analyses indicated that the cranberry-mediated A beta toxicity alleviation required heat shock transcription factor (HSF)-1 rather than DAF-16 and SKN-1. Moreover, cranberry supplementation increased the transactivity of HSF-1 in an IIS-dependent manner. Further studies found that the cranberry extract relies on HSF-1 to significantly enhance the solubility of proteins in aged worms, implying an improved proteostasis in AD worms. Considering that HSF-1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining proteostasis, our results suggest that cranberry maintains the function of proteostasis through HSF-1, thereby protecting C elegans against A beta toxicity. Together, our findings elucidated the mechanism whereby cranberry attenuated A beta toxicity in C elegans and stressed the significance of proteostasis in the prevention of age-related diseases from a practical point of view.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1079-5006	1758-535X		WOS:000394446900006	26405062	
J	Ozdemir, Akin; Cho, Byung Rae								A Nonlinear Integer Programming Approach to Solving the Robust Parameter Design Optimization Problem								QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL				32	8	SI		2859	2870		10.1002/qre.1970			DEC 2016	2016	Robust parameter design is a widely implemented design methodology for continuous quality improvement by identifying optimal factor level settings with minimum product variation. However, apparent flaws surrounding the original version of robust parameter design have resulted in alternative approaches, of which response surface methodology using the central composite design, in particular, has drawn a great deal of attention. There is a large number of practical situations in which some or all of variables must be integers; however, the design space associated with the traditional central composite design is typically a bounded convex feasible set involving real numbers. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss why the Box-Behnken design may be preferred over the central composite design and other three-level designs when maintaining constant or nearly constant prediction variance associated with a second-order model is crucial to integer-valued robust parameter design problems. Second, we lay out the foundation to show how the Box-Behnken design is transformed into a nonlinear integer programming framework. In this paper, we develop Box-Behnken design embedded nonlinear integer programming models, using the sequential quadratic integer programming and the Karush-Khun-Tucker conditions. Comparison studies of the proposed models and traditional counterparts are also conducted. It is believed that the proposed models have the potential to impact a wide range of engineering problems, ultimately leading to process and quality improvement.

Agamermis (Nematoda: Mermithidae) Infection in South Carolina Agricultural Pests								JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY				48	4			290	296					DEC 2016	2016	Native and invasive stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and the closely related invasive Megacopta cribraria (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) are agricultural pests in the southeastern United States. Natural enemies, from various phyla, parasitize these pests and contribute to population regulation. We specifically investigated Nematoda infections in pentatomid and plataspid pests in one soybean field in South Carolina in 2015. Nematodes were identified through molecular and morphological methods and assigned to family Mermithidae, genus Agamermis. This study reports mermithid nematode infection in immature M. cribraria for the first time and provides the first mermithid host record for the stink bugs Chinavia hilaris, Euschistus servus, and another Euschistus species, and a grasshopper (Orthoptera: Acrididae) in South Carolina. The same Agamermis species infected all hosts. The broad host range and prevalence suggests that Agamermis may be an important contributor to natural mortality of pentatomid and plataspid pests. Previous mermithid host records for the Pentatomidae and Plataspidae worldwide are summarized. Further work is needed to assess the impact of infection on populations over a broader range of agricultural fields and geographic localities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-300X			WOS:000392955800008	28154435

Support vector machine model of developmental brain gene expression data for prioritization of Autism risk gene candidates								BIOINFORMATICS				32	23			3611	3618		10.1093/bioinformatics/btw498			DEC 1 2016	2016	Motivation: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders with clinical heterogeneity and a substantial polygenic component. High-throughput methods for ASD risk gene identification produce numerous candidate genes that are time-consuming and expensive to validate. Prioritization methods can identify high-confidence candidates. Previous ASD gene prioritization methods have focused on a priori knowledge, which excludes genes with little functional annotation or no protein product such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).Results: We have developed a support vector machine (SVM) model, trained using brain developmental gene expression data, for the classification and prioritization of ASD risk genes. The selected feature model had a mean accuracy of 76.7%, mean specificity of 77.2% and mean sensitivity of 74.4%. Gene lists comprised of an ASD risk gene and adjacent genes were ranked using the model's decision function output. The known ASD risk genes were ranked on average in the 77.4th, 78.4th and 80.7th percentile for sets of 101, 201 and 401 genes respectively. Of 10,840 lncRNA genes, 63 were classified as ASD-associated candidates with a confidence greater than 0.95. Genes previously associated with brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders were prioritized highly within the lncRNA gene list.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1367-4803	1460-2059		WOS:000392749500010	27506227

We test the exposure-persuasion-identification-commitment (EPIC) process model of buy-in, here applied to student (n = 245) engagement in an undergraduate science course featuring active learning. Student buy-in to active learning was positively associated with engagement in self-regulated learning and students' course performance. The positive associations among buy-in, self-regulated learning, and course performance suggest buy-in as a potentially important factor leading to student engagement and other student outcomes. These findings are particularly salient in course contexts featuring active learning, which encourage active student participation in the learning process.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1931-7913			WOS:000392841600026

After strictly applying MID coding rules, we recommend dropping 251 cases (or over 10% of the dataset), as either we were unable to find a militarized incident in the historical record or the dispute appeared elsewhere in the data. We found evidence linking 75 disputes to other cases, and we could not identify 19 cases in the historical record. Among the remaining disputes, we recommend major changes (changes in dispute year, fatality level, and participants) in 234 disputes and minor changes in 1,009 disputes. We use this article to examine the potential impact of our suggestions on existing studies. Though we identified several systematic problems with the original coding effort, we also find that these problems do not affect current understandings of what predicts the onset of interstate conflict. However, estimates in our replications of three recent studies of dispute escalation, dispute duration, and dispute reciprocation all witness substantial changes when using corrected data-to the point of reversing previous conclusions in some cases.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-8833	1468-2478		WOS:000392925300011

The system combines the merits of wide-dynamic detection range offered by the spectral approach and multiplexed high-throughput data collection with a two-dimensional (2-D) biosensor array. The key feature of the reported scheme is a feedback loop that drives the LCTF to achieve fast tracking of the SPR dip movement caused by the binding of target molecules to the sensor surface. Experimental results show that the system is capable of completing an SPR dip measurement within 4 s. Based on using a spectral window of about 100 nm, the experimental dynamic detection range and refractive index resolution are 4.63x10(-2) RIU and 5.87x10(-6) RIU, respectively. As also demonstrated herein using 2-D microsensor arrays, among the spectral SPR sensors, the reported system is most suitable for multiplexed labelfree biosensing applications.

J	Natu, Rucha; Martinez-Duarte, Rodrigo								Numerical Model of Streaming DEP for Stem Cell Sorting								MICROMACHINES				7	12					217	10.3390/mi7120217			DEC 2016	2016	Neural stem cells are of special interest due to their potential in neurogenesis to treat spinal cord injuries and other nervous disorders. Flow cytometry, a common technique used for cell sorting, is limited due to the lack of antigens and labels that are specific enough to stem cells of interest. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a label-free separation technique that has been recently demonstrated for the enrichment of neural stem/progenitor cells. Here we use numerical simulation to investigate the use of streaming DEP for the continuous sorting of neural stem/progenitor cells. Streaming DEP refers to the focusing of cells into streams by equilibrating the dielectrophoresis and drag forces acting on them. The width of the stream should be maximized to increase throughput while the separation between streams must be widened to increase efficiency during retrieval. The aim is to understand how device geometry and experimental variables affect the throughput and efficiency of continuous sorting of SC27 stem cells, a neurogenic progenitor, from SC23 cells, an astrogenic progenitor. We define efficiency as the ratio between the number of SC27 cells over total number of cells retrieved in the streams, and throughput as the number of SC27 cells retrieved in the streams compared to their total number introduced to the device. The use of cylindrical electrodes as tall as the channel yields streams featuring >98% of SC27 cells and width up to 80 mu m when using a flow rate of 10 mu L/min and sample cell concentration up to 10(5) cells/mL.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2072-666X			WOS:000392481000004		
J	Platt, Steven G.; Miller, Dennis J.; Rainwater, Thomas R.; Smith, Jennifer L.								Notes on the reproductive ecology of the rough-footed mud turtle (Kinosternon hirtipes) in Texas, USA								ACTA HERPETOLOGICA				11	2			221	225		10.13128/Acta_Herpetol-17842			DEC 2016	2016	Kinosternon hirtipes is among the least-studied North American turtles and little is known concerning reproduction. In the United States, K. hirtipes occurs at < 10 sites within a single creek drainage in Presidio County, Texas where it is considered a threatened species. We investigated the reproductive ecology of one of these populations at Plata Wetland Complex in 2007. We captured nine female K. hirtipes in wire mesh traps and hoop nets baited with fish. Eggs were obtained by injecting females with oxytocin. We recovered 19 eggs from six females captured in May and June. The smallest female that produced eggs was about 7.1 years old. Mean (+/- 1SD) clutch size, egg length, egg width, egg mass, and clutch mass were 3.1 +/- 1.4 eggs, 28.7 +/- 1.4 mm, 17.5 +/- 0.9, 5.3 +/- 0.6 g, and 17.5 +/- 0.8 g, respectively. Relative egg mass and relative clutch mass were 0.035 and 0.011, respectively. There was a significant, positive linear relationship between female carapace length (CL) and egg width. The relationship between CL and relative egg mass was negative, and approached statistical significance. Relationships between CL and clutch size, egg length, and egg mass were not significant. Reproductive attributes of K. hirtipes in Texas are similar to those reported from a population in Mexico.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1827-9635	1827-9643		WOS:000392578500013

A new interspecific hybrid cultivar, Camellia 'Maozi', generated by crossing Camellia pubipetala with C. japonica 'Dahong Mudan', exhibits strong hybrid vigor and has small flowers with a rare light tone of purple. In southwest China with a subtropical monsoon climate, young Camellia 'Maozi' trees flush shoots three times in spring, summer, and autumn, with an average annual growth of 12.9 cm. Adult trees flush once a year. Floral bud formation occurs in late April and early May. Camellia 'Maozi' flowers are sterile with no fruits and seeds produced. While an individual flower wilts 4-8 days after opening, the blossom can last 1-3 months. Frost damage can be found in young leaves when temperature drops to 4-7 degrees C. Under direct sunlight with temperatures of 37-39 degrees C lasting for more than 2 days, young leaves can turn yellow on their edges. Its primary diseases include sooty mold, shoot tip blight, and peony leaf tip blight. Its primary insect pests are tea green leafhopper (Jacobiasca formosana) and tea aphid (Toxoptera aurantii). Rooting of stem cuttings occurs directly from stems, mostly without callus development. Two hours of treatment with 500 mg . L-1 indole-3-butyric acid and rooting in a mix of latosolic red soil and vermiculite (2:1 v/v) resulted in high rooting rate and quality of aboveground growth. Grafting can be carried out from May to September, while survival rate and new shoot length are highest in July. The most compatible rootstock is C. oleifera, followed by C. polyodonta. The results of this study are of value for understanding the reproductive biology of Camellia 'Maozi' and further disseminating it as a new cultivar for camellia collection.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000392148800023

The membranes were prepared by grafting poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(itaconic acid) (PIA) to cellulose nanofiber mats. Performance measurements quantified the dynamic ion-exchange capacity for cadmium (Cd), productivity, and recovery of Cd(II) from the membranes by regeneration. The dynamic binding capacities of Cd(II) on both types of nanofiber membrane were independent of the linear flow velocity, with a residence time of as low as 2 s. Analysis of breakthrough curves indicated that the mass flow rate increased rapidly at constant applied pressure after membranes approached equilibrium load capacity for Cd(II), apparently due to a collapse of the polymer chains on the membrane surface, leading to an increased porosity. This mechanism is supported by hydrodynamic radius (R-h) measurements for PAA and PIA obtained from dynamic light scattering, which show that R-h values decrease upon Cd(II) binding. Volumetric productivity was high for the nanofiber membranes, and reached 0.55 mg Cd/g/min. The use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as regeneration reagent was effective in fully recovering Cd(II) from the membranes. Ion-exchange capacities were constant over five cycles of binding-regeneration.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2077-0375			WOS:000392488500015

Phosphorylation of Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2 alpha during Stress and Encystation in Entamoeba Species								PLOS PATHOGENS				12	12					e1006085	10.1371/journal.ppat.1006085			DEC 2016	2016	Entamoeba histolytica is an enteric pathogen responsible for amoebic dysentery and liver abscess. It alternates between the host-restricted trophozoite form and the infective environmentally-stable cyst stage. Throughout its lifecycle E. histolytica experiences stress, in part, from host immune pressure. Conversion to cysts is presumed to be a stress-response. In other systems, stress induces phosphorylation of a serine residue on eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF2 alpha). This inhibits eIF2 alpha activity resulting in a general decline in protein synthesis. Genomic data reveal that E. histolytica possesses eIF2 alpha (EheIF2 alpha) with a conserved phosphorylatable serine at position 59 (Ser(59)). Thus, this pathogen may have the machinery for stress-induced translational control. To test this, we exposed cells to different stress conditions and measured the level of total and phospho-EheIF2 alpha. Long-term serum starvation, long-term heat shock, and oxidative stress induced an increase in the level of phospho-EheIF2 alpha, while short-term serum starvation, short-term heat shock, or glucose deprivation did not. Long-term serum starvation also caused a decrease in polyribosome abundance, which is in accordance with the observation that this condition induces phosphorylation of EheIF2 alpha. We generated transgenic cells that overexpress wildtype EheIF2 alpha, a non-phosphorylatable variant of eIF2 alpha in which Ser(59) was mutated to alanine (EheIF2 alpha-S59A), or a phosphomimetic variant of eIF2 alpha in which Ser(59) was mutated to aspartic acid (EheIF2 alpha-S59D). Consistent with the known functions of eIF2 alpha, cells expressing wildtype or EheIF2 alpha-S59D exhibited increased or decreased translation, respectively. Surprisingly, cells expressing EheIF2 alpha-S59A also exhibited reduced translation. Cells expressing EheIF2 alpha-S59D were more resistant to long-term serum starvation underscoring the significance of EheIF2 alpha phosphorylation in managing stress. Finally, phospho-eIF2 alpha accumulated during encystation in E. invadens, a model encystation system. Together, these data demonstrate that the eIF2 alpha-dependent stress response system is operational in Entamoeba species.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1553-7366	1553-7374		WOS:000392202100055	27930733	
J	Yang, Kun; Li, Yan; Xiong, Yan; Yan, Jing-yuan; Na, Hui-zhen								A model for computer-aided creative design based on cognition and iteration								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE				230	19			3470	3487		10.1177/0954406215611438			DEC 2016	2016	Conceptual design is the most creative and important stage in product design process. A computer-aided creative design (CACD) system is indispensable to provide effective support for human-oriented creative behavior and iterative decision-making during the conceptual design process. Based on cognition and iteration, this study proposes a triplhelix innovative solving model to guide the construction of CACD system. In this model, three types of space are established, including design flow space as reference for mapping direction, knowledge inspiration space as source of stimulus information, and solution operating space as carrier. The cooperation among the triple space is organized based on memory information processing theory, so as to inspire designers' cognitive thinking to generate product solutions. In addition, the iterative operations of design elements among function, behavior, and structure utilizing the proposed triple space are discussed. With this model, the designers can develop multiple innovative solutions according to expected design types (variant, adaptive, original), and different cognitive stimulation (extension, analogy, mutation) of design knowledge can also be obtained. Then, a prototype system of computer-aided creative design platform is developed to implement this innovative solving model. Finally, a design case of espresso machine is presented to demonstrate the practicability and validity of the prototype system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4062	2041-2983		WOS:000392870900010

J	Blob, Richard W; Mayerl, Christopher J; Rivera, Angela R V; Rivera, Gabriel; Young, Vanessa K H								"On the Fence" versus "All in": Insights from Turtles for the Evolution of Aquatic Locomotor Specializations and Habitat Transitions in Tetrapod Vertebrates.								Integrative and comparative biology				56	6			1310	1322					2016-Dec	2016	Though ultimately descended from terrestrial amniotes, turtles have deep roots as an aquatic lineage and are quite diverse in the extent of their aquatic specializations. Many taxa can be viewed as "on the fence" between aquatic and terrestrial realms, whereas others have independently hyperspecialized and moved "all in" to aquatic habitats. Such differences in specialization are reflected strongly in the locomotor system. We have conducted several studies to evaluate the performance consequences of such variation in design, as well as the mechanisms through which specialization for aquatic locomotion is facilitated in turtles. One path to aquatic hyperspecialization has involved the evolutionary transformation of the forelimbs from rowing, tubular limbs with distal paddles into flapping, flattened flippers, as in sea turtles. Prior to the advent of any hydrodynamic advantages, the evolution of such flippers may have been enabled by a reduction in twisting loads on proximal limb bones that accompanied swimming in rowing ancestors, facilitating a shift from tubular to flattened limbs. Moreover, the control of flapping movements appears related primarily to shifts in the activity of a single forelimb muscle, the deltoid. Despite some performance advantages, flapping may entail a locomotor cost in terms of decreased locomotor stability. However, other morphological specializations among rowing species may enhance swimming stability. For example, among highly aquatic pleurodiran turtles, fusion of the pelvis to the shell appears to dramatically reduce motions of the pelvis compared to freshwater cryptodiran species. This could contribute to advantageous increases in aquatic stability among predominantly aquatic pleurodires. Thus, even within the potential constraints of a body plan in which the body is encased by a shell, turtles exhibit diverse locomotor capacities that have enabled diversification into a wide range of aquatic habitats.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1557-7023		MEDLINE:27940619	27940619	
J	Lao, Yingjie; Tang, Qianying; Kim, Chris H.; Parhi, Keshab K.								Beat Frequency Detector-Based High-Speed True Random Number Generators: Statistical Modeling and Analysis								ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS				13	1	SI				9	10.1145/2866574			DEC 2016	2016	True random number generators (TRNGs) are crucial components for the security of cryptographic systems. In contrast to pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), TRNGs provide higher security by extracting randomness from physical phenomena. To evaluate a TRNG, statistical properties of the circuit model and raw bitstream should be studied. In this article, a model for the beat frequency detector-based high-speed TRNG (BFD-TRNG) is proposed. The parameters of the model are extracted from the experimental data of a test chip. A statistical analysis of the proposed model is carried out to derive mean and variance of the counter values of the TRNG. Our statistical analysis results show that mean of the counter values is inversely proportional to the frequency difference of the two ring oscillators (ROSCs), whereas the dynamic range of the counter values increases linearly with standard deviation of environmental noise and decreases with increase of the frequency difference. Without the measurements from the test data, a model cannot be created; similarly, without a model, performance of a TRNG cannot be predicted. The key contribution of the proposed approach lies in fitting the model to measured data and the ability to use the model to predict performance of BFD-TRNGs that have not been fabricated. Several novel alternate BFD-TRNG architectures are also proposed; these include parallel BFD, cascade BFD, and parallel-cascade BFD. These TRNGs are analyzed using the proposed model, and it is shown that the parallel BFD structure requires less area per bit, whereas the cascade BFD structure has a larger dynamic range while maintaining the same mean of the counter values as the original BFD-TRNG. It is shown that 3.25M and 4M random bits can be obtained per counter value from parallel BFD and parallel-cascade BFD, respectively, where M counter values are computed in parallel. Furthermore, the statistical analysis results illustrate that BFD-TRNGs have better randomness and less cost per bit than other existing ROSC-TRNG designs. For example, it is shown that BFD-TRNGs accumulate 150% more jitter than the original two-oscillator TRNG and that parallel BFD-TRNGs require one-third power and one-half area for same number of random bits for a specified period.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1550-4832	1550-4840		WOS:000391627300009

Inferring Capabilities of Intelligent Agents from Their External Traits								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERACTIVE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS				6	4	SI				28	10.1145/2963106			DEC 2016	2016	We investigate the usability of humanlike agent-based interfaces for interactive advice-giving systems. In an experiment with a travel advisory system, we manipulate the "humanlikeness" of the agent interface. We demonstrate that users of the more humanlike agents try to exploit capabilities that were not signaled by the system. This severely reduces the usability of systems that look human but lack humanlikehumanlike capabilities (overestimation effect). We explain this effect by showing that users of humanlike agents form anthropomorphic beliefs (a user's "mental model") about the system: They act humanlike towards the system and try to exploit typical humanlike capabilities they believe the system possesses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mental model users form of an agent-based system is inherently integrated (as opposed to the compositional mental model they form of conventional interfaces): Cues provided by the system do not instill user responses in a one-to-one matter but are instead integrated into a single mental model.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2160-6455	2160-6463		WOS:000391437800003		
J	Wilkinson, Philip M.; Rainwater, Thomas R.; Woodward, Allan R.; Leone, Erin H.; Carter, Cameron								Determinate Growth and Reproductive Lifespan in the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis): Evidence from Long-term Recaptures								COPEIA				104	4			843	852		10.1643/CH-16-430			DEC 2016	2016	The perception that crocodilians exhibit indeterminate growth is common in the general reptilian literature. However, this assumption is frequently based on observations of immature and young adult animals and therefore lacks a complete understanding of adult growth patterns. Long-term mark-recapture studies appear to be the most certain method of determining growth patterns of adult crocodilians. From 1979-2015, we conducted a mark-recapture study of an American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) population on the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center (YWC) in coastal South Carolina to examine long-term growth patterns and the influence of age on multiple reproductive parameters. We found no discernible linear growth in 19 of 31 adult female and 7 of 19 adult male alligators over periods of 5-33 years. The mean maximum reproductive lifespan for female alligators on the study site was 46 years, and females continued to reproduce for an extended period of time after reaching maximum size. The Schnute growth model predicted that male alligators grew at a faster rate and attained a greater estimated mean terminal snout-vent length (SVL) than females (males = 186.9, CI0.95 = 184.5, 189.3 cm; females = 135.9, CI0.95 = 134.1, 137.8 cm) at the hypothetical age 75. In addition, the model predicted that males exhibited a greater estimated mean size (SVL = 182.0, CI0.95 = 179.6, 184.4 cm) and age (43 years) at which growth essentially ceased when compared to females (SVL = 131.4, CI0.95 = 129.5, 133.2 cm; 31 years). However, actual growth records of individual alligators suggested that the growth model may have overestimated the age at which male alligator growth ceased. The estimated mean earliest age at sexual maturity was 11.6 years (CI0.95 = 10.5, 12.8) for males and 15.8 years (CI0.95 = 14.5, 17.1) for females. We also documented that alligators on the site commonly live to 50 and can possibly live to >70 years of age. This study provides evidence that both male and female American Alligators in a population in coastal South Carolina exhibit a pattern of determinate growth and adds to a growing list of studies suggesting crocodilians as a group exhibit this growth pattern rather than indeterminate growth. Our findings are important for modeling population growth and determining sustainable harvest rates, particularly for alligators living near their northern distributional limit where growing seasons may be shorter and onset of sexual maturity later than in more southern portions of their range.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0045-8511	1938-5110		WOS:000391678500007

I react to her position that tension fields within the phenomenon include the relationship between new and old technologies, boredom and engagement, and active and sedentary learning. In this conversation, I point to a new way of conceptualizing using digital media in the classroom as ecology of learning that may serve to decrease problems associated with the "wow-effect".									0	0	0	0	0	0			1871-1502	1871-1510		WOS:000391425700005

Difference in the abundance of scale insect parasitoids among four cardinal directions								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				99	4			813	815					DEC 2016	2016	We conducted a study to assess the potential differences in the abundances of hymenopteran parasitoids among cardinal directions. Experiments were conducted on scale insect-infested willow oak trees in the urban landscapes of South Carolina and Virginia. The parasitoids captured on yellow sticky cards deployed at the cardinal directions of the trees were identified and counted. We found that there were no significant differences in scale insect and parasitoid abundances among cardinal directions, and parasitoid abundances were weakly correlated with scale insect densities. The results suggest that 1 yellow sticky card could be deployed per tree, regardless of tree quadrant, to sufficiently sample for parasitoid abundance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0015-4040	1938-5102		WOS:000391525700045		
J	Yan, Li; Shen, Haiying; Chen, Kang								TSearch: Target-Oriented Low-Delay Node Searching in DTNs With Social Network Properties								IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING				24	6			3841	3855		10.1109/TNET.2016.2586446			DEC 2016	2016	Node searching in delay tolerant networks is of great importance for different applications, in which a locator node finds a target node in person. In the previous distributed node searching method, a locator traces the target along its movement path from its most frequently visited location. For this purpose, nodes leave traces during their movements and also store their long-term movement patterns in their frequently visited locations (i.e., preferred locations). However, such tracing leads to a long delay and high overhead on the locator by long-distance moving. Our trace data study confirms these problems and provides the foundation of our design of a new node searching method, called target-oriented method (TSearch). By leveraging social network properties, TSearch aims to enable a locator to directly move toward the target. Nodes create encounter records (ERs) indicating the locations and times of their encounters and make the ERs easily accessible by locators through message exchanges or a hierarchical structure. In node searching, a locator follows the target's latest ER, the latest ERs of its friends (i.e., frequently meeting nodes), its preferred locations, and the target's possible locations deduced from additional information for node searching. Extensive trace-driven and real-world experiments show that TSearch achieves significantly higher success rate and lower delay in node searching compared with previous methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6692	1558-2566		WOS:000391727900045

A Broadband Internally Resonant Vibratory Energy Harvester								JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				138	6					061007	10.1115/1.4034253			DEC 2016	2016	The objective of this paper is twofold: first to illustrate that nonlinear modal interactions, namely, a two-to-one internal resonance energy pump, can be exploited to improve the steady-state bandwidth of vibratory energy harvesters; and, second, to investigate the influence of key system's parameters on the steady-state bandwidth in the presence of the internal resonance. To achieve this objective, an L-shaped piezoelectric cantilevered harvester augmented with frequency tuning magnets is considered. The distance between the magnets is adjusted such that the second modal frequency of the structure is nearly twice its first modal frequency. This facilitates a nonlinear energy exchange between these two commensurate modes resulting in large-amplitude responses over a wider range of frequencies. The harvester is then subjected to a harmonic excitation with a frequency close to the first modal frequency, and the voltage-frequency response curves are generated. Results clearly illustrate an improved bandwidth and output voltage over a case which does not involve an internal resonance. A nonlinear model of the harvester is developed and validated against experimental findings. An approximate analytical solution of the model is obtained using perturbation methods and utilized to draw several conclusions regarding the influence of key design parameters on the harvester's bandwidth.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1048-9002	1528-8927		WOS:000391721200007

The surface area of porous materials significantly increases compared with that of their solid analogs. Hence, pores play an important role in the adhesion of resins and binders to solids. The authors developed an experimental protocol allowing one to evaluate the work of adhesion, a characteristic thermodynamic parameter of the liquid/porous solid pair. It is shown that for the determination of the work of adhesion, one needs to know the pore size distribution, the wicking constant of the wetting liquid and the surface tension of the liquid. Asphalt binders and different rocks were studied to illustrate the methodology.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2050-6252	2050-6260		WOS:000391872300003		
J	Ying, Tianyu; Norman, William; Zhou, Lingqiang								Is social class still working? Revisiting the social class division in tourist consumption								CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM				19	14			1405	1424		10.1080/13683500.2014.920774			DEC 2016	2016	The effects of social class division have been extensively examined in tourist behaviour studies, but mostly on specific tourism forms, attractions, or activities. Limited empirical research has looked into the effects of social class difference (as well as other demographic variables) on tourists' destination consumption in a holistic and comprehensive way. To revisit the role of social class in today's tourist consumption, this study stratified a group of American tourists based on their social class and compared their participation patterns in four types of destination activities: cultural, hedonic, nature-based, and shopping-related. The empirical data were from a conversion and destination branding study conducted for Thoroughbred Country, South Carolina. The analysis gained mixed results, as social class was found to have significant impacts on tourists' consumption of certain destination products/activities, but not on others. It was expected that this study could not only contribute to the research endeavours in tourist consuming behaviour, but also provide practical implications for more effective destination marketing and market segmentation strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1368-3500	1747-7603		WOS:000388093900002

In essence, the nanofoam film (100-300 nm thick) is anchored to a surface cross-linked polymer network in a metastable extended configuration that can relax back to a certain degree upon exposure to a chemical vapor. The level of the chain relaxation is associated with thermodynamic affinity between the polymer chains and the volatile compounds. In our design, the chemical composition of the nanofoam film is not uniform; therefore, the film possesses a gradually changing local affinity to a vapor along the surface. Upon vapor exposure, the nonuniform changes in local film morphology provide a permanent record or "fingerprint" for the chemical event of interest. This permanent modification in the film structure can be directly detected via changes not only in the film surface profile but also in the film optical characteristics. To this end, we demonstrated that sensing/recording nanofoam films can be prepared and interrogated on the surfaces of optical waveguides, microring optical resonators. It is important that the initial surface profile and structure of the nanofoam film are encrypted by the distinctive conditions that were used to fabricate the film and practically impossible to replicate without prior knowledge.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000391079700014	27754643

Uncertainty in flow stress measurements using X-ray diffraction for sheet metals subjected to large plastic deformations								JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY				49				1991	2004		10.1107/S1600576716013662			DEC 2016	2016	X-ray diffraction techniques have been developed to measure flow stresses of polycrystalline sheet metal specimens subjected to large plastic deformation. The uncertainty in the measured stress based on this technique has not been quantified previously owing to the lack of an appropriate method. In this article, the propagation of four selected elements of experimental error is studied on the basis of the elasto-viscoplastic self-consistent modeling framework: (1) the counting statistics error; (2) the range of tilting angles in use; (3) the use of a finite number of tilting angles; and (4) the incomplete measurement of diffraction elastic constants. Uncertainties propagated to the diffraction stress are estimated by conducting virtual experiments based on the Monte Carlo method demonstrated for a rolled interstitial-free steel sheet. A systematic report on the quantitative uncertainty is provided. It is also demonstrated that the results of the Monte Carlo virtual experiments can be used to find an optimal number of tilting angles and diffraction elastic constant measurements to use without loss of quality.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1600-5767			WOS:000391195900014		
J	Bao, Jiatong; Jia, Yunyi; Cheng, Yu; Tang, Hongru; Xi, Ning								Detecting Target Objects by Natural Language Instructions Using an RGB-D Camera								SENSORS				16	12					2117	10.3390/s16122117			DEC 2016	2016	Controlling robots by natural language (NL) is increasingly attracting attention for its versatility, convenience and no need of extensive training for users. Grounding is a crucial challenge of this problem to enable robots to understand NL instructions from humans. This paper mainly explores the object grounding problem and concretely studies how to detect target objects by the NL instructions using an RGB-D camera in robotic manipulation applications. In particular, a simple yet robust vision algorithm is applied to segment objects of interest. With the metric information of all segmented objects, the object attributes and relations between objects are further extracted. The NL instructions that incorporate multiple cues for object specifications are parsed into domain-specific annotations. The annotations from NL and extracted information from the RGB-D camera are matched in a computational state estimation framework to search all possible object grounding states. The final grounding is accomplished by selecting the states which have the maximum probabilities. An RGB-D scene dataset associated with different groups of NL instructions based on different cognition levels of the robot are collected. Quantitative evaluations on the dataset illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. The experiments of NL controlled object manipulation and NL-based task programming using a mobile manipulator show its effectiveness and practicability in robotic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1424-8220			WOS:000391303000136

Influence of thermal stimulation during the late phase of incubation on hatching results and post-hatch broiler performance under commercial conditions								BRITISH POULTRY SCIENCE				57	6			848	854		10.1080/00071668.2016.1209737			DEC 2016	2016	1. Two experiments, which differed in breeder age, strain and season, were conducted to study the influence of low-intensity, short-duration thermal stimuli during the late phase of incubation on hatchability and performance. The first experiment conducted in April-June used eggs from Cobb x Ross broiler breeders at 35-41 weeks of age and the second experiment performed in February-April used eggs from Hubbard x Cobb broiler breeders at 49-53 weeks of age.Eggs in the test group had the same physical environment as eggs in the control group except that incubation temperature was increased by 1C for 2h/d above the control group from 18 to 20 d of incubation (DI).The results demonstrated that thermal stimulation of 1C for 2h/d above control incubation temperature during 18-21DI did not have any adverse effects on hatch and post-hatch performance of broilers.In both experiments, treatment did not significantly alter the secondary sex ratio in hatched chickens, but hatch residue showed that the proportion of unhatched male embryos was significantly lower in the test groups than in the control groups.In the first experiment, thermal stimulation improved feed conversion by 1.82% compared with the control.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0007-1668	1466-1799		WOS:000390879500015	27385195

Here, we study the initial evolution of both electron-proton (e(-)-p(+)) and electron-positron (e(+/-)) relativistic jets containing helical magnetic fields, focusing on their interaction with an ambient plasma. We have performed simulations of "global" jets containing helical magnetic fields in order to examine how helical magnetic fields affect kinetic instabilities such as the Weibel instability, the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (kKHI) and the Mushroom instability (MI). In our initial simulation study these kinetic instabilities are suppressed and new types of instabilities can grow. In the e(-)-p(+) jet simulation a recollimation-like instability occurs and jet electrons are strongly perturbed. In the e(+/-) jet simulation a recollimation-like instability occurs at early times followed by a kinetic instability and the general structure is similar to a simulation without helical magnetic field. Simulations using much larger systems are required in order to thoroughly follow the evolution of global jets containing helical magnetic fields.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2075-4434			WOS:000391004000006

Comparison of a Novel Dry Electrode Headset to Standard Routine EEG in Veterans								JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				33	6			530	537		10.1097/WNP.0000000000000284			DEC 2016	2016	Objective: This purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of a prototype battery-powered dry electrode system (DES) EEG recording headset in Veteran patients by comparing it with standard EEG.Methods: Twenty-one Veterans had both a standard electrode system recording and DES recording in nine different patient states at the same encounter. Setup time, patient comfort, and subject preference were measured. Three experts performed technical quality rating of each EEG recording in a blinded fashion using the web-based EEGnet system. Power spectra were compared between DES and standard electrode system recordings.Results: The average time for DES setup was 5.7 minutes versus 21.1 minutes for standard electrode system. Subjects reported that the DES was more comfortable during setup. Most subjects (15 of 21) preferred the DES. On a five-point scale (1-best quality to 5-worst quality), the technical quality of the standard electrode system recordings was significantly better than for the DES recordings, at 1.25 versus 2.41 (P < 0.0001). But experts found that 87% of the DES EEG segments were of sufficient technical quality to be interpretable.Conclusions: This DES offers quick and easy setup and is well tolerated by subjects. Although the technical quality of DES recordings was less than standard EEG, most of the DES recordings were rated as interpretable by experts. Significance: This DES, if improved, could be useful for a telemedicine approach to outpatient routine EEG recording within the Veterans Administration or other health system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0736-0258	1537-1603		WOS:000390856000009	27300074

We find a significant reaction of banks' stocks to news concerning governments' finances. Banks' stock returns fall in response to a deterioration of governments' financial situation. We find little difference in the reaction between large and small banks, The evidence points towards all banks being equally likely to be bailed out. Our data are consistent with a policy during the Eurozone sovereign-debt crisis in which "no bank is too small to save". (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Hao, Na; Moysey, Stephen M. J.; Powell, Brian A.; Ntarlagiannis, Dimitrios								Comparison of the surface ion density of silica gel evaluated via spectral induced polarization versus acid-base titration								JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS				135		SI		427	435		10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.01.014			DEC 2016	2016	Surface complexation models are widely used with batch adsorption experiments to characterize and predict surface geochemical processes in porous media. In contrast, the spectral induced polarization (SIP) method has recently been used to non-invasively monitor in situ subsurface chemical reactions in porous media, such as ion adsorption processes on mineral surfaces. Here we compare these tools for investigating surface site density changes during pH-dependent sodium adsorption on a silica gel. Continuous SIP measurements were conducted using a lab scale column packed with silica gel. A constant inflow of 0.05 M NaCl solution was introduced to the column while the influent pH was changed from 7.0 to 10.0 over the course of the experiment. The SIP measurements indicate that the pH change caused a 38.49 +/- 030 mu S cm(-1) increase in the imaginary conductivity of the silica gel. This increase is thought to result from deprotonation of silanol groups on the silica gel surface caused by the rise in pH, followed by sorption of Na+ cations. Fitting the SIP data using the mechanistic model of Leroy et al. (Leroyet al., 2008), which is based on the triple layer model of a mineral surface, we estimated an increase in the silica gel surface site density of 26.9 x 10(16) sites m(-2). We independently used a potentiometric acid-base titration data for the silica gel to calibrate the triple layer model using the software FITEQL and observed a total increase in the surface site density for sodium sorption of 11.2 x 10(16) sites m(-2), which is approximately 2.4 times smaller than the value estimated using the SIP model. By simulating the SIP response based on the calibrated surface complexation model, we found a moderate association between the measured and estimated imaginary conductivity (R-2 = 0.65). These results suggest that the surface complexation model used here does not capture all mechanisms contributing to polarization of the silica gel captured by the SIP data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Emerson, Hilary P.; Hickok, Katherine A.; Powell, Brian A.								Experimental evidence for ternary colloid-facilitated transport of Th(IV) with hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) colloids and Suwannee River fulvic acid								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY				165				168	181		10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.10.001			DEC 2016	2016	Previous field experiments have suggested colloid-facilitated transport via inorganic and organic colloids as the primary mechanism of enhanced actinide transport in the subsurface at former nuclear weapons facilities. In this work, research was guided by the hypothesis that humic substances can enhance tetravalent actinide (An(IV)) migration by coating and mobilizing natural colloids in environmental systems and increasing An(IV) sorption to colloids. This mechanism is expected to occur under relatively acidic conditions where organic matter can sorb and coat colloid surfaces and facilitate formation of ternary colloid-ligand-actinide complexes. The objective of this work was to examine Th transport through packed columns in the presence of hematite colloids and/or Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA). In the presence of SRFA, with or without hematite colloids, significant transport (>60% recovery within the effluent) of thorium occurred through quartz columns. It is notable that the SRFA contributed to increased transport of both Th and hematite colloids, while insignificant transport occurred in the absence of fulvic acid. Further, in the presence of a natural sandy sediment (as opposed to pure quartz), transport is negligible in the presence of SRFA due to interactions with natural, clay-sized sediment coatings. Moreover, this data shows that the transport of Th through quartz columns is enhanced in ternary Th-colloid-SRFA and binary Th-SRFA systems as compared to a system containing only Th.

(Microelectron Eng, 88, 9, 2959-2963, 2011), (J Appl Phys, 109, 8, 083710, 2011) Generally, pentacene-based devices typically require high-vacuum processing, and/or synthetic modifications to the molecule must be incorporated. (Thin Solid Films, 427, 1-2, 367-370, 2003), (J Am Chem Soc, 129, 34, 10,308-10,309, 2007), (J Mater Chem C, 1, 11, 2193-2201, 2013), (ACS Nano, 7, 9, 7983-7991, 2013) We developed a technique to transform small molecule pentacene into an aqueously dispersed particulate material. Pentacene was introduced into a miniemulsion reaction and formed into nano-scale platelet-like particles. After the miniemulsion, the emulsified pentacene showed indefinite stability in the aqueous phase, which is key in a material used for printable electronics. Devices fabricated from the aqueously dispersed particles demonstrated behavior similar to a Zener diode with a breakdown voltage of ae 2 VDC.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0303-402X	1435-1536		WOS:000389901200014

APOE Genotypes Associate With Cognitive Performance but Not Cerebral Structure: Diabetes Heart Study MIND								DIABETES CARE				39	12			2225	2231		10.2337/dc16-0843			DEC 2016	2016	OBJECTIVEDementia is a debilitating illness with a disproportionate burden in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Among the contributors, genetic variation at the apolipoprotein E locus (APOE) is posited to convey a strong effect. This study compared and contrasted the association of APOE with cognitive performance and cerebral structure in the setting of T2D.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSEuropean Americans from the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS) MIND (n = 754) and African Americans from the African American (AA)-DHS MIND (n = 517) were examined. The cognitive battery assessed executive function, memory, and global cognition, and brain MRI was performed.RESULTSIn European Americans and African Americans, the APOE E4 risk haplotype group was associated with poorer performance on the modified Mini-Mental Status Examination (P < 0.017), a measure of global cognition. In contrast to the literature, the APOE E2 haplotype group, which was overrepresented in these participants with T2D, was associated with poorer Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test performance (P < 0.032). Nominal associations between APOE haplotype groups and MRI-determined cerebral structure were observed.CONCLUSIONSCompared with APOE E3 carriers, E2 and E4 carriers performed worse in the cognitive domains of memory and global cognition. Identification of genetic contributors remains critical to understanding new pathways to prevent and treat dementia in the setting of T2D.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0149-5992	1935-5548		WOS:000390785000029

In this study, the target genes of miR-29b were analyzed and predicted by bioinformatics. And lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) were selected for further validation by dual luciferase reporter assay. In addition, we investigated the effects of miR-29b on triglyceride synthesis and mammary epithelial cell (MEC) apoptosis. The result showed that luciferase activity was significantly lower in cells that miR-29b cotransfected with LPL and TDG gene reporter vectors (pmiR-RB-REPORT-LPL-WT, pmiR-RB-REPORT-TDG-WT) than in cells of miR-29b cotransfected with gene reporter vectors (pmiR-RB-REPORT-LPL-mut and pmiR-RB-REPORT-LPL-si; pmiR-RB-REPORT-TDG-mut and pmiR-RB-REPORT-TDG-si) (p<0.05), indicating that target sites existed in 3UTR of LPL and TDG. Furthermore, the expressions of miR-29b were negatively correlated with levels of mRNA and protein of LPL and TDG gene using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, suggesting that miR-29b might play an important role in regulation of LPL and TDG gene expression. Finally, miR-29b promoted triglyceride production and suppressed apoptosis in MECs, which might be attributed to the expressions of target genes LPL and TDG.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1044-5498	1557-7430		WOS:000390352800003	27854545

Scott; Jennings, Viniece								Ecosystem services and urban greenways: What's the public's perspective?								ECOSYSTEM SERVICES				22				111	116		10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.10.004			DEC 2016	2016	Ecosystem services (ES) are an important tool for quantifying the value of nature, yet there are often disconnects between services defined and measured by scientists and those that are realized and appreciated by the general public. Our study explored public perceptions of urban ES by examining benefits associated with greenways in two U.S. cities. Respondents (n = 460) recognized all types of ES, though environmental benefits (e.g., air and water quality regulation; acknowledged by 74% of respondents) were less widely recognized than cultural benefits (e.g., economic impacts, social connectivity; 90%) or experiential benefits (e.g., attractive scenery, recreation; 98%). The distinction between these last two categories is rarely made in conventional ES frameworks, but it may be practically significant from the public's perspective. Benefit perceptions varied across geographic and socio-demographic contexts. Enhanced integration of cultural and experiential benefits into urban ES frameworks could lead to more equitable and informed decisions about the provision, management, and valuation of urban green space across diverse settings and populations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2212-0416			WOS:000390691200012

Geoff								Comparison of Spatial Distribution Patterns of Seed Rain between Larch Plantations and Adjacent Secondary Forests in Northeast China								FOREST SCIENCE				62	6			652	662		10.5849/forsci.15-048			DEC 2016	2016	The conversion of pure larch plantations into mixed larch-broadleaf forests by promoting the natural regeneration of native broadleaved tree species of secondary forests in larch plantations is a basic strategy in Northeast China. This strategy can solve the problems existing in the larch plantations, such as mono-species composition, decreased soil fertility, and unsustainable productivity. Seed production and dispersal, the beginning of a natural regeneration process that links the end of the reproductive cycle of adult plants and their subsequent life cycle stages, are crucial to successful regeneration. The first objective of this study was to determine the spatial patterns of seed rain for broadleaved tree species produced by the common spatial distribution types of larch plantations at an independent hillside: the contour type (secondary forests and larch plantations are located at the same slope position and aspect) and the downslope type (larch plantations are located at the downslope of the adjacent secondary forests at the same aspect). The second objective was to determine the contributions of seed rain to the soil seed bank for the two common types of seed dispersal (wind- and gravity-dispersed species). We found that the seed densities of these two dispersal types tended to decrease along the gradient from secondary forests to boundary and to larch plantations of the contour type of stands. The seed density of the wind-dispersed species in the downslope type of stands was significantly higher than that in the contour type of stands, particularly in the larch plantation portion of a stand. The similarity in species composition between the seed rain and the seed bank in the downslope type of stands (0.36 +/- 0.06) was significantly higher than that in the contour type of stands (0.14 +/- 0.04). The contribution of the seed rain to the seed bank of the wind dispersed species (13.0-18.6%) was considerably greater than that of the gravity-dispersed species (1.4-1.8%). Our results indicated that the relationships between the seed rain and the seed bank were significantly influenced by both the spatial distribution types of larch plantations and the dispersal types of species. The natural regeneration potential of wind -dispersed species may be more critical in converting larch plantations into mixed forests in the downslope type of stands.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0015-749X	1938-3738		WOS:000390180900008

Our previous study showed that pentagalloyl glucose (PGG), a core derivative of tannic acid, hinders the development of AAAs in a clinically relevant animal model when applied locally. In this study, we tested whether targeted nanoparticles (NPs) can deliver PGG to the site of an aneurysm and prevent aneurysmal growth by protecting elastin. PGG-loaded albumin NPs with a surface-conjugated elastin-specific antibody were prepared. Aneurysms were induced by calcium chloride-mediated injury to the abdominal aorta in rats. NPs were injected into the tail vein after 10 days of CaCl2 injury. Rats were euthanized after 38 days. PGG delivery led to reduction in macrophage recruitment, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, elastin degradation, calcification, and development of aortic aneurysm. Such NP delivery offers the potential for the development of effective and safe therapies for AAA.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1937-5387	1937-5395		WOS:000390017000006	27542007

Egg Hatch Rate and Nymphal Survival of the Bed Bug (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) After Exposure to Insecticide Sprays								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				109	6			2495	2499		10.1093/jee/tow223			DEC 2016	2016	Few studies have addressed the efficacy of insecticides used against eggs and first-instar nymphs of the bed bug, Cimex lectularius L. (Hemiptera: Cimicidae). Insect eggs are often resistant to insecticides; therefore, information on which products are effective is important. We evaluated the efficacy of four commonly used insecticide sprays applied directly to bed bug eggs. We also evaluated the efficacy of these insecticides to first-instar nymphs exposed to residuals resulting from directly spraying eggs. Temprid SC (beta-cyfluthrin, imidacloprid) was the most effective insecticide at preventing egg hatch (13% hatch rate) for pyrethroid-resistant, field-strain (Jersey City) bed bugs compared with a control (water [99% hatch rate]), Bedlam (MGK-264, sumithrin [84% hatch rate]), Demand CS (lambda-cyhalothrin [91% hatch rate]), and Phantom SC (chlorfenapyr [95% hatch rate]). Demand CS and Temprid SC were most effective at preventing egg hatch (0%) for an insecticide-susceptible (Harold Harlan) strain, followed by Bedlam (28%). Phantom SC produced a hatch rate similar to the control (97% and 96%, respectively). Harold Harlan-strain nymphs showed 100% survival for the control but 0% survival for Bedlam and Phantom SC. Jersey City-strain nymphs showed 100% survival for the control, 99% survival for Bedlam, 0% survival for Demand CS, 4% survival for Phantom SC, and 38% survival for Temprid SC. Demand CS was less effective at preventing hatch (91% hatch rate) of Jersey City-strain nymphs but was the only product to kill all nymphs (0% survival). One of the least effective products for preventing Jersey City-strain egg hatch (Phantom SC, 95% hatch rate) was the second most effective at killing nymphs, leaving only six of 141 alive. These findings indicate that survival of directly sprayed eggs and residually exposed, first-instar nymphs varies by strain, life stage, and product used.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000390333500032	27986941

In this paper, a tyrosinase inhibitor was separated from camellia pollen by the aid of high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC), macroporous adsorptive resin chromatography and solvent fraction. The tyrosinase inhibitor was identified to be kaempferol by absorption spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrum. The purity and recovery were 98.47% and 41.94%, respectively. The kaempferol was detected to have the IC50 of 0.05 mg/mL and mainly exists in glycoside forms. It had a concentration of 1.03 mg/g in the acidic hydrolysis of the ethanol extract (HEE), and contributed 32.41% to the total tyrosinase inhibition activity of HEE. This study demonstrates an effective procedure to purify bioactive compounds from bee pollen, and reveals kaempferol as a major tyrosinase inhibitor of camellia pollen, providing interesting information for in-depth study of bioactive compounds of pollen.

Inaccuracies in measurements may result in a "window-shutter" or "eclipsing" phenomenon whereby the fenestration may not overlie the vessel ostium completely. We hypothesized that vessel position measurements from reconstructed imaging do not represent the true vessel position as obtained from a three-dimensional (3D) printed physical model of the visceral aortic segment.Methods: Medical 3D modeling software was used to develop the 3D reconstructions, which were then exported to the 3D printing software. This allowed 3D models to be physically generated. The distances to the top and bottom and the angle of each of the celiac, superior mesenteric, right renal, and left renal arteries were recorded. These same measurements were obtained by each of the blinded reviewers in addition to the aortic diameter at the midpoint of each of these vessels. Measurements were compared with intraclass correlation coefficient, nonparametric Spearman rank correlation test, and one-sample t-test to assess accuracy and precision. Statistical significance was set at P<.05 for all tests.Results: Both the individual measurements and the average of the measurements were statistically accurate (significant) for the bottom of the superior mesenteric artery and the top and bottom of both the right and left renal arteries. There was variability and inaccuracy in all visceral vessel angles and in the bottom of the celiac artery (the top and the angle of the celiac artery were the arbitrary referents).Conclusions: Whereas the visceral vessel orifices are largely accurately assessed and measured, the vessel angles are not. This may lead to an eclipsing phenomenon, which may contribute to branch or fenestrated vessel failure and therefore reintervention. Further efforts should assess the clinical significance of the eclipsing phenomenon and should target accurate and appropriate fenestration construction to prevent long-term morbidity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0741-5214			WOS:000390044000036	26607872

We use a panel of South Carolina Medicaid claims data to investigate the effects of ADHD drugs on the probability of risky sexual behavior outcomes (STDs and pregnancy), substance abuse disorders, and injuries. To overcome potential endogeneity, we instrument for treatment using physicians' preferences to prescribe medication. Our findings suggest that pharmacological treatment has substantial benefits. It reduces the probability of contracting an STD by 3.6 percentage points (5.8 percentage points if we include STD screening), reduces the probability of having a substance abuse disorder by 7.3 percentage points, reduces the probability of injuries by 2.3 percentage points per year, and associated with them Medicaid costs decrease by $88.4, or 0.054 of a standard" deviation.

The Relative Effects of the Recession-Related Stressors on Employee Strain and Job Satisfaction								STRESS AND HEALTH				32	5			629	635		10.1002/smi.2657			DEC 2016	2016	Across the globe, economic fluctuations have taken their toll on both organizations and employees, particularly during sustained recessions. Surprisingly, little research, however, has directly investigated the effects of recessions on employees. As such, the goal of the current study was to investigate the effects of specific recession-related stressors on employee outcomes (strain and satisfaction). We investigated an archival data set of 7666 individuals collected as part of the Workplace Employment Relations Study for relations among recession-related stressors with strain and job satisfaction variables. We found that recession-related stressors were significantly related to both strain and satisfaction. More specifically, certain recession-related stressors (e.g. increased workload and reorganization of work) were more strongly related to strain and satisfaction than others. These results imply the need for greater attention to stress management strategies aimed at helping both employees and their organizations cope with the human costs of economic recessions.

Continuous-Flow Process for the Purification and Fractionation of Alkali and Organosolv Lignins								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				4	12			6689	6694		10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b01560			DEC 2016	2016	Hot acetic acid-water mixtures can be used to purify and fractionate alkali (kraft) and organosolv lignins via the Aqueous Lignin Purification with Hot Acids (ALPHA) process. However, condensation polymerization reactions can occur in the solvated, lignin-rich liquid fraction at the elevated temperatures (e.g., 60-100 degrees C) of operation, significantly increasing the lignin molecular weight. Thus, conversion of ALPHA to continuous-flow operation was investigated in order to determine the effect of reduced residence times on both the above reactions and on the extraction of metals from the solvated lignin to the solvent phase. All four lignins investigated could be converted to a homogeneous lignin water slurry at ambient temperatures, facilitating continuous operation. When a static mixer is used for the mixing and equilibration device, reducing residence times to 20-30 condensation polymerization reactions are essentially eliminated. For example, the molecular weight of the lignin fraction remained unchanged with continuous processing but increased from 7900 to 13200 when batch processing was used for the same ALPHA conditions. Furthermore, the 10-fold reduction in metals content (e.g., sodium content reduced from 1400 to <100 ppm) was equal to or better than that obtained by single-stage batch processing. Thus, continuous ALPHA can be used to obtain an ultrapure, metals-free lignin of well-defined and controllable molecular weight.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000389497900050

However, their vastly different timescales make it difficult to study mantle convection and melt migration in a unified framework, especially for 3-D global models. And although experiments suggest an increase in melt volume of up to 20 per cent from the depth of melt generation to the surface, previous computations have neglected the individual compressibilities of the solid and the fluid phase. Here, we describe our extension of the finite element mantle convection code ASPECT that adds melt generation and migration. We use the original compressible formulation of the McKenzie equations, augmented by an equation for the conservation of energy. Applying adaptive mesh refinement to this type of problems is particularly advantageous, as the resolution can be increased in areas where melt is present and viscosity gradients are high, whereas a lower resolution is sufficient in regions without melt. Together with a high-performance, massively parallel implementation, this allows for high-resolution, 3-D, compressible, global mantle convection simulations coupled with melt migration. We evaluate the functionality and potential of this method using a series of benchmarks and model setups, compare results of the compressible and incompressible formulation, and show the effectiveness of adaptive mesh refinement when applied to melt migration. Our model of magma dynamics provides a framework for modelling processes on different scales and investigating links between processes occurring in the deep mantle and melt generation and migration. This approach could prove particularly useful applied to modelling the generation of komatiites or other melts originating in greater depths. The implementation is available in the Open Source ASPECT repository.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0956-540X	1365-246X		WOS:000388933300001		
J	Li, Yurong; Zhu, Wenge; Cheng, Baokai; Nygaard, Runar; Xiao, Hai								Laboratory evaluation of distributed coaxial cable temperature sensors for application in CO2 sequestration well characterization								GREENHOUSE GASES-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				6	6			812	823		10.1002/ghg.1609			DEC 2016	2016	Downhole monitoring plays a crucial part in a geological carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration project, especially in providing early warnings of failure. However, most downhole monitoring technologies are often low in spatial resolution and time-consuming, or expensive and have system longevity issues. To address this issue, a robust and cost-effective distributed coaxial cable Fabry-Perot interferometer-based temperature sensor is proposed for real-time downhole monitoring. The coaxial cable sensor (CCS) was made in house and tested using a high pressure high temperature (HPHT) testing apparatus to study the sensor accuracy, sensitivity, stability, and crosstalk effect in simulated downhole conditions. The laboratory test results indicate that the sensor can work under simulated downhole conditions of pressures up to 1000 psia and temperatures up to 110 degrees C. At 1 ATM, the sensor has an accuracy of about 1%. At 1000 psia, the hysteresis phenomenon is observed, but it is reduced and tends to stabilize after repeated heating and cooling treatments. The pressure crosstalk effect was observed on the flexible cable sensor and minimized on the rigid cable sensor. The temperature and pressure range of the distributed CCS allows long-term in situ monitoring for a well depth up to 2500 feet, which would prove of great value in detecting temperature change associated with wellbore leakage that may lead to groundwater contamination.

J	McDonald, Janie; Gerard, Patrick D.; McMahan, Christopher S.; Schucany, William R.								Exact-Permutation-Based Sign Tests for Clustered Binary Data Via Weighted and Unweighted Test Statistics								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS				21	4			698	712		10.1007/s13253-016-0261-6			DEC 2016	2016	Clustered binary data occur frequently in many application areas. When analyzing data of this form, ignoring key features, such as the intracluster correlation, may lead to inaccurate inference, e.g., inflated Type I error rates. For clustered binary data, Gerard and Schucany (Comput Stat Data Anal 51:4622-4632, 2007) proposed an exact test for examining whether the marginal probability of a response differs from 0.5, which is the null hypothesis considered in the classic sign test. This new test maintains the specified Type I error rate and has more power, when compared to both the classic sign and permutation tests. The test statistic proposed by these authors equally weights the observed data from each cluster, regardless of whether the clusters are of equal size. To further improve the performance of the Gerard and Schucany test, a weighted test statistic is proposed and two weighting schemes are investigated. Seeking to further improve the performance of the proposed test, empirical Bayes estimates of the cluster-level success probabilities are utilized. These adaptations lead to 5 new tests, each of which are shown through simulation studies to be superior to the Gerard and Schucany (Comput Stat Data Anal 51:4622-4632, 2007) test. The proposed tests are further illustrated using data from a chemical repellency trial.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1085-7117	1537-2693		WOS:000389464800006

It is mediated by the chronic overexpression of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, leading to a progressive loss of elasticity and weakening of the aortic wall. Delivery of therapeutic agents to inhibit MMPs, while concurrently coaxing cell-based regenerative repair of the elastic matrix represents a potential strategy for slowing or arresting abdominal aortic aneurysm growth. Previous studies have demonstrated elastogenic induction of healthy and aneurysmal aortic smooth muscle cells and inhibition of MMPs, following exogenous delivery of elastogenic factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-1, as well as MMP-inhibitors such as doxycycline (DOX) in two-dimensional culture. Based on these findings, and others that demonstrated elastogenic benefits of nanoparticulate delivery of these agents in two-dimensional culture, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles were developed for localized, controlled and sustained delivery of DOX and TGF-1 to human aortic smooth muscle cells within a three-dimensional gels of type I collagen, which closely simulate the arterial tissue microenvironment. DOX and TGF-1 released from these nanoparticles influenced elastogenic outcomes positively within the collagen constructs over 21 days of culture, which were comparable to that induced by exogenous supplementation of DOX and TGF-1 within the culture medium. However, this was accomplished at doses similar to 20-fold lower than the exogenous dosages of the agents, illustrating that their localized, controlled and sustained delivery from nanoparticles embedded within a three-dimensional scaffold is an efficient strategy for directed elastogenesis.

Based on the guided mode resonance principle, a diffractive grating is used to couple the normally incident waves and excite the plasmonic resonances on two graphene films separated by a spacer, thereby avoiding the need for patterning graphene. It is found that the origin of the observed transparency window transforms from Autler-Townes splitting to electromagnetically induced transparency with the increase of the separation distance between the two graphene films. The tunability of this hybrid system is also investigated via varying the Fermi energy in graphene. The proposed hybrid system has potential applications in tunable switches, sensors, and slow light devices and may open up new avenues for constructing easy-to-fabricate graphene-based plasmonic devices.

The most likely mode of 1,4-dioxane biotransformation is via a cometabolic pathway in the presence of THF. Pilot studies conducted during the process development phase established a design basis process loading factor of 0.6 g 1,4-dioxane and THF (as chemical oxygen demand [COD])/g total solids per day and proved the efficacy of the process. Full-scale design includes the use of three parallel moving bed bioreactors with effluent recycle capability. Removal efficiencies in excess of 98 percent have been documented for 1,4-dioxane. Evolving operational challenges are associated with recent trends in 1,4-dioxane pretreatment discharge limitations in combination with ongoing process optimization and increased influent flow rate conditions associated with seasonal precipitation patterns.

J	Chow, James P.; Simionescu, Dan T.; Carter, Anna L.; Simionescu, Agneta								Immunomodulatory effects of adipose tissue-derived stem cells on elastin scaffold remodeling in diabetes								TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				13	6			701	712		10.1007/s13770-016-0018-x			DEC 2016	2016	Diabetes is a major risk factor for the progression of vascular disease, contributing to elevated levels of glycoxidation, chronic inflammation and calcification. Tissue engineering emerges as a potential solution for the treatment of vascular diseases however there is a considerable gap in the understanding of how scaffolds and stem cells will perform in patients with diabetes. We hypothesized that adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) by virtue of their immunosuppressive potential would moderate the diabetes-intensified inflammatory reactions and induce positive construct remodeling. To test this hypothesis, we prepared arterial elastin scaffolds seeded with autologous ASCs and implanted them subdermally in diabetic rats and compared inflammatory markers, macrophage polarization, matrix remodeling, calcification and bone protein expression to control scaffolds implanted with and without cells in nondiabetic rats. ASC-seeded scaffolds exhibited lower levels of CD8+ T-cells and CD68+ pan-macrophages and higher numbers of M2 macrophages, smooth muscle cell-like and fibroblast-like cells. Calcification and osteogenic markers were reduced in ASCseeded scaffolds implanted in non-diabetic rats but remained unchanged in diabetes, unless the scaffolds were first pre-treated with penta-galloyl glucose (PGG), a known anti-oxidative elastin-binding polyphenol. In conclusion, autologous ASC seeding in elastin scaffolds is effective in combating diabetes-related complications. To prevent calcification, the oxidative milieu needs to be reduced by elastin-binding antioxidants such as PGG.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1738-2696			WOS:000390037200010		
J	Gong, J.; Thompson, L.; Li, G.								A semi-analytical approach for calculating the equilibrium structure and radial breathing mode frequency of single-walled carbon nanotubes								ACTA MECHANICA SINICA				32	6			1075	1087		10.1007/s10409-016-0582-2			DEC 2016	2016	A semi-analytical model for determining the equilibrium configuration and the radial breathing mode (RBM) frequency of single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is presented. By taking advantage of the symmetry characteristics, a CNT structure is represented by five independent variables. A line search optimization procedure is employed to determine the equilibrium values of these variables by minimizing the potential energy. With the equilibrium configuration obtained, the semi-analytical model enables an efficient calculation of the RBM frequency of the CNTs. The radius and radial breathing mode frequency results obtained from the semi-analytical approach are compared with those from molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio calculations. The results demonstrate that the semi-analytical approach offers an efficient and accurate way to determine the equilibrium structure and radial breathing mode frequency of CNTs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7718	1614-3116		WOS:000389199200012

Population distribution, host-switching, and chemical sensing in the symbiotic shrimp Lysmata pederseni: implications for its mating system in a changing reef seascape								CORAL REEFS				35	4			1213	1224		10.1007/s00338-016-1467-3			DEC 2016	2016	Lysmata pederseni, a protandric simultaneously hermaphroditic shrimp that inhabits the tube sponge Callyspongia vaginalis, is monogamous in the central and southeastern Caribbean Sea. We tested the null hypothesis of monogamy in a northern Caribbean population. In the Florida Keys, shrimps did not inhabit host individuals in pairs with a frequency greater than expected by chance alone. Hermaphrodites inhabited sponges solitarily and often brooded embryos. Hermaphrodites do not store sperm and need to be inseminated shortly after molting to fertilize a new batch of eggs. Thus, males and/or other hermaphrodites are likely switching among host individuals in search of sexual partners. Field experiments demonstrated low shrimp host fidelity. Host residence time was similar to 2 times shorter for males than for hermaphrodites. We inferred a polygynandrous mating system in L. pederseni from the Florida Keys, with male-role and young hermaphrodites often moving among sponges in search of older, more sedentary, female-role hermaphrodites. We expected shrimps to use water-borne chemical cues originating from conspecifics or sponges to locate sexual partners. Experiments demonstrated that shrimps were attracted to water-borne cues originating from sponges but not conspecifics. We have described the mating system of a reef-associated shrimp in a fast-pace shifting seascape increasingly dominated by sponges and vanishing stony corals. In the central and southeastern Caribbean Sea, with greater coral cover and lower sponge abundance than in the Florida Keys, the same species is monogamous. Whether or not similar shifts in the social organization of other coral reef-dwelling marine organisms are occurring due to contemporary changes in seascapes is a relevant topic that deserves further attention.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0722-4028	1432-0975		WOS:000388591500009

Processes Contributing to Resilience of Coastal Wetlands to Sea-Level Rise								ECOSYSTEMS				19	8			1445	1459		10.1007/s10021-016-0015-x			DEC 2016	2016	The objectives of this study were to identify processes that contribute to resilience of coastal wetlands subject to rising sea levels and to determine whether the relative contribution of these processes varies across different wetland community types. We assessed the resilience of wetlands to sea-level rise along a transitional gradient from tidal freshwater forested wetland (TFFW) to marsh by measuring processes controlling wetland elevation. We found that, over 5 years of measurement, TFFWs were resilient, although some marginally, and oligohaline marshes exhibited robust resilience to sea-level rise. We identified fundamental differences in how resilience is maintained across wetland community types, which have important implications for management activities that aim to restore or conserve resilient systems. We showed that the relative importance of surface and subsurface processes in controlling wetland surface elevation change differed between TFFWs and oligohaline marshes. The marshes had significantly higher rates of surface accretion than the TFFWs, and in the marshes, surface accretion was the primary contributor to elevation change. In contrast, elevation change in TFFWs was more heavily influenced by subsurface processes, such as root zone expansion or compaction, which played an important role in determining resilience of TFFWs to rising sea level. When root zone contributions were removed statistically from comparisons between relative sea-level rise and surface elevation change, sites that previously had elevation rate deficits showed a surplus. Therefore, assessments of wetland resilience that do not include subsurface processes will likely misjudge vulnerability to sea-level rise.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-9840	1435-0629		WOS:000388928800009

Temperature dependence of the formation of the passivation layer on carbon steel in high alkaline environment of concrete pore solution								ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS				73				24	28		10.1016/j.elecom.2016.10.003			DEC 2016	2016	In this study, the formation and the strength of the passive layer on carbon steel in concrete pore solution were investigated for temperatures ranging from room temperature to 850 degrees C. Two sets of carbon steel specimens were first exposed to different temperatures for an hour. One group cooled to room temperature in the air and the other one in the water. The steel specimens were then immersed in concrete pore solution and the passive layer formed on the steelwas investigated. Results showed that in the extreme conditions, i. e. very high temperature, and water-cooled condition, the passive layer rarely formed on the steel. Increasing the exposure temperature led to a decrease in the thickness of the passive layer. This decrease was more apparent when steel was cooled in water compared to air cooled specimens. Results from this study contribute to the knowledge base that may be used to advance the state of the art in predictive models for steel reinforcement in concrete exposed to high temperatures (e.g., fire, power plants).

We offer theoretical and methodological considerations for comparative international analyses in entrepreneurship research. Research questions: (1) How do the stories that are told by entrepreneurs from different cultures reveal their values? (2) What can those stories tell us about entrepreneurship in different cultures? Literature review: An emerging stream of authors proposes to study entrepreneurship from individual narratives, but studies on entrepreneurship rhetorics are scarce, seldom use an international approach, and rarely cover the cultural aspects. Methodology: We collected entrepreneurial narratives in the US, Spain, and China, and deployed a novel two-fold method to retain cultural nuances and validate translation accuracy. Narrative data were studied based upon the coding, constant comparison, and memo writing used in grounded theory. Results and conclusions: We identify three core metaphorical devices used by participants to structure their entrepreneurial journeys (action and learning, autonomy and money, and exceptionalism and networks), and we suggest that the use of these metaphorical pairs varies both within and across cultures. These findings offer preliminary evidence, for the first time in the literature, that building a rhetorical understanding of entrepreneurship requires that we consider two axes: the individual and the cultural.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1434	1558-1500		WOS:000388386000005		
J	Zhang, Donglan; Shi, Lu; Tian, Fang; Zhang, Lingling								Care Utilization with China's New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme: Updated Evidence from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study 2011-2012								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE				23	6			655	663		10.1007/s12529-016-9560-0			DEC 2016	2016	China's New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), a healthcare financing system for rural residents in China, underwent significant enhancement since 2008. Studies based on pre-2008 NRCMS data showed an increase in inpatient care utilization after NRCMS coverage. However evidence was mixed for the relationship between outpatient care use and NRCMS coverage.We assessed whether enrollment in the enhanced NRCMS was associated with less delaying or foregoing medical care, as a reduction in foregoing needed care signals about removing liquidity constraint among the enrollees.Using a national sample of rural residents (N = 12,740) from the 2011-2012 wave of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, we examined the association between NRCMS coverage and the likelihood of delaying or foregoing medical care (outpatient and inpatient) by survey-weighted regression models controlling for demographics, education, geographic regions, household expenditures, pre-existing chronic diseases, and access to local healthcare facilities. Zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to estimate the association between NRCMS coverage and number of medical visits.NRCMS coverage was significantly associated with lower odds of delaying or foregoing inpatient care (OR: 0.42, 95 % CI: 0.22-0.81). A negative but insignificant association was found between NRCMS coverage and delaying/foregoing outpatient care when ill. Among those who needed health care, the expected number of outpatient visits for NRCMS enrollees was 1.35 (95 % CI: 1.03-1.77) times of those uninsured, and the expected number of inpatient visits for NRCMS enrollees was 1.83 (95 % CI: 1.16-2.88) times of those uninsured.This study shows that the enhanced NRCMS coverage was associated with less delaying or foregoing inpatient care deemed as necessary by health professionals, which is likely to result from improved financial reimbursement of the NRCMS.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1070-5503	1532-7558		WOS:000388938600001	27102433

A., Dai, Z. R., Zavarin, M., Zhao, P. H., Kersting, A. B.: Stabilization of plutonium nano-colloids by epitaxial distortion on mineral surfaces. Environ. Sci. Technol. 45, 2698 (2011).] deduced the heteroepitaxial growth of a bcc Pu4O7 phase when sorbed onto goethite from d-spacing measurements obtained from selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. The structural and/or chemical modification of Pu(IV) oxide (PO) nanocolloids upon sorption to goethite, in turn, affects colloidal-transport of Pu in the subsurface. In this study, molecular simulations were applied to investigate mechanisms affecting the formation of non-fcc PO phases and to understand the influence of goethite in stabilizing the non-fcc PO phase. Analyses of the structure, chemistry, and formation energetics for several bulk PuO2 and PuO2-x phases, using ab initio methods, show that the formation of a non-fcc PO can occur from the lattice distortion (LD) of fcc PuO2 upon sorption and formation of a PO-goethite interface. To strain and non-uniformly distort the PuO2 lattice to match that of the goethite substrate at ambient conditions would require 88 kJ/mol Pu4O8. The formation of a hypostoichiometric PuO2-x phase, such as the experimentally-deduced bcc, Ia (3) over bar Pu4O7 phase, requires more O-poor conditions and/or high energetic inputs (>+365 kJ/mol Pu4O7 at O-rich conditions). Empirical methods were also applied to study the effect of lattice distortion on sorption energetics and adsorbate particle growth using simple heterointerfaces between cubic salts, where KCl clusters (notated as KClLD) of varying size and lattice mismatch (LM) were sorbed to a NaCl cluster. When the lattice of a KClLD cluster has <15% LM with that of a NaCl substrate, the sorption of KCl LD onto NaCl is exothermic (<-80 kJ/mol) and the KCl LD cluster can reach sizes of similar to 2-5 nm on the NaCl substrate. These models suggest that the lattice of a fcc PuO2 particle can distort upon formation of a heterointerface with goethite to lower LM, in turn better enabling the growth of the PO adsorbates and yielding more exothermic adsorption energies. A more detailed understanding of the interfacial environment between PO and goethite is obtained through structural, chemical, and energetic analyses on modeled PuO2 (110)-and PuO2-x (110)-goethite (001) heterointerfaces. Structural analyses of the heterointerfaces continue to support that the lattice of PO is strained to better match that of goethite and thus lead to the formation of a non-fcc PO phase. When the lattice of the PO (110) surface is distorted to match that of the goethite (001) surface, the alignment and d-spacings from simulated electron diffraction patterns for the PO-goethite heterointerfaces reproduce experimental observations. Non-fcc PO thin-films are also found to be stabilized through the formation of an interface with goethite, as the work of adhesion for the PuO2- and PuO2-x-goethite interfaces are 1.4 J/m(2) and 2.0 J/m(2), respectively. Analyses of electron and charge density of the heterointerfaces also show that covalent-to polar-covalent bonding at the interface promotes the stabilization of a PO-goethite interface.The results from these models contribute to experimental observations, providing further understanding of how the goethite substrate influences the formation and stabilization of a non-fcc PO phase. Furthermore, the information from this study aids in better understanding processes at mineral-water interfaces that influence actinide transport.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0033-8230			WOS:000389324400001

This study is to address scale effect of various injection diameters on the interaction between incident shock wave and transversal cavity injection in a cold kerosene-fueled scramjet combustor. The injection diameters are separately specified as from 0.5 to 1.5 mm in 0.5 mm increments when other performance parameters, including the injection angle, velocity and pressure drop are all constant. A combined three dimensional Couple Level Set & Volume of Fluids (CLSVOF) approach with an improved K-H & R-T model is used to characterize penetration height, span expansion area, angle of shock wave and sauter mean diameter (SMD) distribution of the kerosene droplets with/without considering evaporation. Our results show that the injection orifice surely has a great scale effect on the transversal injection field in cold kerosene-fueled supersonic flows. Our findings show that the penetration depth, span angle and span expansion area of the transverse cavity jet are increased with the injection diameter, and that the kerosene droplets are more prone to breakup and atomization at the outlet of the combustor for the orifice diameter of 1.5 mm. The calculation predictions are compared against the reported experimental measurements and literatures with good qualitative agreement. The simulation results obtained in this study can provide the evidences for better understanding the underlying mechanism of kerosene atomization in cold supersonic flow and scramjet design improvement.

Application of partial rootzone drying to improve irrigation water use efficiency in grapefruit trees								AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT				178				66	75		10.1016/j.agwat.2016.09.012			DEC 2016	2016	Partial rootzone drying (PRD) has been reported to potentially improve crop water use efficiency (WUEcrop) compared to full irrigation in different fruit trees; however, field studies on the effect of PRD in citrus are scarce. In this field study, three irrigation strategies were tested in an orchard of mature grapefruit trees during two consecutive seasons (2013/2014 and 2014/2015): drip PRD (two drip lines, alternating irrigation between lines every month), microsprinkler irrigation, and double-line drip irrigation (control). Irrigation was applied during the fruit enlargement stage (April August). The aims of this field study were: 1) to provide a quantitative comparison of irrigation water productivity among irrigation treatments; and 2) to study their effects on fruit quality, yield, tree growth, and flowering. Drip PRD saved 43 to 47% of irrigation water compared to control irrigation, and microsprinkler irrigation saved 12 to 18% of water compared to control irrigation PRD-irrigated trees maintained or increased yield compared to microsprinkler-irrigated and control trees, depending on the experimental season. Therefore, WUEcrop in PRD-irrigated trees was significantly higher than in control and microsprinlder-irrigated trees at the end of both seasons. Fruit and juice quality parameters were statistically similar among all treatments. PRD irrigation did not reduce the flowering potential of the trees although it delayed the onset of flowering in trees relative to the other treatments in 2013/2014. There was a similar timing of flowering among treatments in 2014/2015 and there were no differences in vegetative growth among the irrigation treatments by the end of March (86 Julian data) in both experimental seasons. Our results suggest that PRD can be economically beneficial for citrus growers who use double-line drip irrigation systems, and a strategy to sustain tree growth, tree health and yield during seasons of extreme drought or when high water restrictions are placed in citrus-producing areas.

J	Raimondo, Davide M.; Marseglia, Giuseppe Roberto; Braatz, Richard D.; Scott, Joseph K.								Closed-loop input design for guaranteed fault diagnosis using set-valued observers								AUTOMATICA				74				107	117		10.1016/j.automatica.2016.07.033			DEC 2016	2016	Active fault diagnosis (AFD) can be used to improve the diagnosability of faults by injecting a suitably designed input into a process. When faults are described as discrete switches between linear systems with uncertainties bounded within zonotopes, an optimal open-loop input guaranteeing diagnosis within a specified time horizon can be computed efficiently by solving a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). In this article, the constrained zonotope (CZ) set representation recently developed by the authors is used to extend the MIQP approach to general polytopic uncertainties without sacrificing efficiency. Next, this approach is combined with a CZ-based set-valued observer in a moving horizon framework to achieve rigorous closed-loop AFD. This method can greatly accelerate diagnosis relative to the open loop approach, but requires online optimization. To reduce the online cost, we propose a method for solving the open-loop problem explicitly with respect to past measurements and inputs, which requires only observability of the nominal and faulty models. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through several numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing conservation tools for an at-risk shorebird: Feasibility of headstarting for American Oystercatchers Haematopus palliatus								BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL				26	4			451	465		10.1017/S0959270916000095			DEC 2016	2016	Management of threatened and endangered populations of wildlife increasingly relies upon active intervention such as predator control, habitat manipulation, and ex situ breeding or care. One tool that has received consideration for the management of declining or threatened avian populations is headstarting, or the artificial incubation of eggs and subsequent placement of newly hatched chicks in original or foster nests. We assessed the feasibility of implementing a headstarting program for the American Oystercatcher Haematopus palliatus, a species of high conservation concern in the eastern USA. Annual productivity is often low and lost during incubation, suggesting artificial incubation could enhance annual productivity. We used a control-impact approach to assign nests as either control or headstart and measured daily survival rate, success of parents accepting headstarted chicks, attendance patterns and behaviours of parents, and chick survival. We also implemented a transparent scoring process to rate the success of each step and the overall program. Daily survival rates of nests were significantly higher at headstart compared to control nests, and parents continued to incubate when eggs were well secured at nest sites. Attendance patterns and behaviour did not differ between headstart and control parents, and parents readily accepted healthy chicks whether they were returned to original or foster nests. Chick survival and subsequently annual productivity were, however, not higher at headstart compared to control nests suggesting that although we were able to enhance nest survival, low chick survival was still limiting annual productivity. Ultimately, headstarting may be most appropriate for American Oystercatchers where productivity is lost primarily to flooding, predation, or disturbance during the incubation stage but not during the chick-rearing stage. If, for example, high rates of nest loss are due to predators that also may prey upon chicks, then headstarting may not be an effective conservation tool.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-2709	1474-0001		WOS:000388949800004

Investigation of Conduction and Switching Power Losses in Modified Stacked Multicell Converters								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS				63	12			7780	7791		10.1109/TIE.2016.2607160			DEC 2016	2016	Considering the advantage of the modified stacked multicell converter over flying capacitor and stacked multicell converters, and noting that investigation of the conduction and switching power losses can be advantageous in the design of multilevel converters, an analytical approach to calculate and analyze conduction and switching power losses in modified stacked multicell converter is presented in this paper. First, rms and average currents flowing through the insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and antiparallel diodes are analytically calculated by considering the duty cycle of each IGBT and diode in terms of converter modulation index, load current, and power factor. For validation, numerical results of the derived closed-form equations for computation of the rms and average currents are compared with simulation results and experimental measurements. Numeric computations of the closed-form equations match the simulation results and experimental measurements very well, which verifies the analytic equations. Next, derived equations for rms and average currents computation are utilized to calculate the conduction power losses. Finally, switching power loss analysis is performed by numeric approach and curve fitting method.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0278-0046	1557-9948		WOS:000388623300048

Based on well-known rotational hardening rules and extensive experimental results, a new unified expression of rotational hardening is proposed in this work, in which the parameters of the unified expression can be determined directly. The proposed rotational hardening expression was imported into a clay model and adopted to simulate the stress-strain behavior of different clays. The simulated results and the experimental results were compared to analyze the influence of the equilibrium values on the stress-strain behaviors. The comparisons show that the constitutive model with the proposed rotational hardening rule had good predictive capability for triaxial tests under different loading paths.

Inappropriate sample size can lead to the generation of low quality solutions with high computational burden. To overcome this challenge, our study proposes an enhanced SAA algorithm that utilizes clustering techniques to dynamically update the sample sizes and offers high quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time. We evaluate this proposed algorithm in the context of a facility location problem [FLP]. A number of numerical experiments (e.g., impact of different clustering techniques, fixed vs. dynamic clusters) are performed for various problem instances to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results indicate that on average, enhanced SAA with fixed clustering size and dynamic clustering size solves [FLP] almost 631% and 699% faster than the basic SAA algorithm, respectively. Furthermore, it is observed that there is no single winner among the clustering techniques to solve all the problem instances of enhanced SAA algorithm and the performance is highly impacted by the size of the problems.

The model prescribes equity- or fairness-based compromise solutions for user-desired goals, given limited capacity, budget, and available resources. An experimental study demonstrates how different decision making strategies can be formulated to understand important dimensions of decision making. The efficient frontiers are generated to understand the trade-off between objectives and to analyze capacity-related planning strategies.

This paper presents the results of an analytical and experimental study performed on the first inverted T-beam bridge in Virginia. The purpose of the investigation was to quantify live-load distribution factors for shear and moment for the composite precast inverted T-beam bridge. A finite-element model of Phase I of the bridge was created and the live-load distribution factors were analytically determined. Additionally, live-load tests using a stationary truck were performed with the purpose of quantifying live-load distribution factors for moment and validating the results from the finite-element analyses. The live-load tests featured four transverse truck positions on the bridge. It is concluded that it is appropriate to estimate live-load distribution factors using provisions for cast-in-place slab-span bridges.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-3828	1943-5509		WOS:000388619000014		
J	Cyle, K. T.; Hill, N.; Young, K.; Jenkins, T.; Hancock, D.; Schroeder, P. A.; Thompson, A.								Substrate quality influences organic matter accumulation in the soil silt and clay fraction								SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY				103				138	148		10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.08.014			DEC 2016	2016	Substrate quality impacts the rate of microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (OM), with higher quality substrates leading to faster rates of decomposition. Since OM decomposition is the opposite of OM stabilization, one might presume higher quality substrates would lead to less OM stabilization. Yet, there is growing evidence that C stabilized in the soil silt and clay fractions is preferentially derived from microbial metabolites. We hypothesized that the decomposition of higher quality substrates would increase silt and clay-sized (S)OM pools despite higher initial mineralization rates. Soils low in initial organic carbon were incubated for 139 d with substrates spanning a range of quality/lability including: (a) bermudagrass forage cut after 14d, 21d, 28d, 35d, and 42d of re-growth, and (b) ruminal digesta produced from these forages. We then monitored the production of CO2 as well as the carbon abundance and isotopic composition in the bulk, silt, and clay fractions. Undigested forage was respired at higher initial rates than ruminal digesta and resulted in more carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the clay fraction. Overall, substrate quality assessed as the ratio of neutral detergent fiber (NDF-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) to crude protein (CP) was directly related to decomposition kinetics with higher substrate quality resulting in more silt and clay C. These findings provide evidence that substrate quality, as a driver of microbial response, can control the flow of C and N to silt and clay fractions where there is the potential for interactions with mineral surfaces to greatly increase C and N residence times. Incorporating this concept into numerical models of SOM generation and turnover will likely improve projections of carbon dynamics in global change models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Influence of commercial (Fluka) naphthenic acids on acid volatile sulfide (AVS) production and divalent metal precipitation								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				134				86	94		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.08.022			DEC 2016	2016	Energy-derived waters containing naphthenic acids (NAs) are complex mixtures often comprising a suite of potentially problematic constituents (e.g. organics, metals, and metalloids) that need treatment prior to beneficial use, including release to receiving aquatic systems. It has previously been suggested that NAs can have biostatic or biocidal properties that could inhibit microbially driven processes (e.g. dissimilatory sulfate reduction) used to transfer or transform metals in passive treatment systems (i.e. constructed wetlands). The overall objective of this study was to measure the effects of a commercially available (Fluka) NA on sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), production of sulfides (as acid-volatile sulfides [AVS]), and precipitation of divalent metals (i.e. Cu, Ni, Zn). These endpoints were assessed following 21-d aqueous exposures of NAs using bench-scale reactors. After 21-days, AVS molar concentrations were not statistically different (p < 0.0001; alpha = 0.05) among NA treatments (10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg NA/L) and an untreated control (no NAs). Extent of AVS production was sufficient in all NA treatments to achieve Sigma SEM:AVS < 1, indicating that conditions were conducive for treatment of metals, with sulfide ligands in excess of SEM (Cu, Ni, and Zn). In addition, no adverse effects to SRB (in terms of density, relative abundance, and diversity) were measured following exposures of a commercial NA. In this bench-scale study, dissimilatory sulfate reduction and subsequent metal precipitation were not vulnerable to NAs, indicating passive treatment systems utilizing sulfide production (AVS) could be used to treat metals occurring in NAs affected waters.

We examine which variables help to predict output changes after a banking crisis using Bayesian Model Averaging. For developed economies, we find that the output losses are positively related to prior economic conditions such as credit growth. For low-income economies, we find that other factors such as having a stock market and deposit insurance are more important. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Cole								Dynamic Shortest-Path Interdiction								NETWORKS				68	4			315	330		10.1002/net.21712			DEC 2016	2016	We study a dynamic network game between an attacker and a user. The user wishes to find a shortest path between a pair of nodes in a directed network, and the attacker seeks to interdict a subset of arcs to maximize the user's shortest-path cost. In contrast to most previous studies, the attacker can interdict arcs any time the user reaches a node in the network, and the user can respond by dynamically altering its chosen path. We assume that the attacker can interdict a limited number of arcs, and that an interdicted arc can still be traversed by the user at an increased cost. The challenge is therefore to find an optimal path (possibly repeating arcs in the network), coupled with the attacker's optimal interdiction strategy (i.e., which arcs to interdict and when to interdict them). We propose an exact exponential-state dynamic-programming algorithm for this problem, which can be reduced to a polynomial-time algorithm in the case of acyclic networks. We also develop lower and upper bounds on the optimal objective function value based on classical interdiction and robust optimization models, or based on an exact solution to variations of this problem. We examine the efficiency of our algorithms and the quality of our bounds on a set of randomly generated instances.

Extractive scintillating polymer sensors for trace-level detection of uranium in contaminated ground water								ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA				947				1	8		10.1016/j.aca.2016.09.029			DEC 1 2016	2016	This contribution describes the synthesis of robust extractive scintillating resin and its use in a flow-cell detector for the direct detection of uranium in environmental waters. The base poly[(4-methyl styrene)-co-( 4-vinylbenzyl chloride)-co-(divinylbenzene)-co-(2-(1-napthyl)-4-vinyl-5-phenyloxazole)] resin contains covalently bound fluorophores. Uranium-binding functionality was added to the resin by an Arbuzov reaction followed by hydrolysis via strong acid or trimethylsilyl bromide (TMSBr)-mediated methanolysis. The resin was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and spectrofluorometry. Fluorophore degradation was observed in the resin hydrolyzed by strong acid, while the resin hydrolyzed by TMSBr-mediated methanolysis maintained luminosity and showed hydrogen bonding-induced Stokes' shift of similar to 100 nm. The flow cell detection efficiency for uranium of the TMSBr-mediated methanolysis resin was evaluated at pH 4, 5 and 6 in DI water containing 500 Bq L-1 uranium-233 and demonstrated flow cell detection efficiencies of 23%, 16% and 7%. Experiments with pH 4, synthetic groundwater with 50 Bq L-1 uranium-233 exhibited a flow cell detection efficiency of 17%. The groundwater measurements show that the resins can concentrate the uranyl cation from waters with high concentrations of competitor ions at near-neutral pH. Findings from this research will lay the groundwork for development of materials for real-time environmental sensing of alpha-and beta-emitting radionuclides. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of dietary betaine in lactating Holstein cows subjected to heat stress								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				99	12			9745	9753		10.3168/jds.2015-10514			DEC 2016	2016	Betaine (BET), a natural, organic osmolyte, improves cellular efficiency by acting as a chaperone, refolding denatured proteins. To test if dietary BET reduced the effect of heat stress (HS) in lactating dairy cows, multiparous, lactating Holstein cows (n = 24) were blocked by days in milk (101.4 +/- 8.6 d) and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 daily intakes of dietary BET: the control (CON) group received no BET, mid intake (MID) received 57 mg of BET/kg of body weight, and high dose (HI) received 114 mg of BET/kg of body weight. Cows were fed twice daily and BET was top-dressed at each feeding Cows were milked 2 times/d and milk samples were taken daily for analysis. Milk components, yield, feed intake, and water intake records were taken daily. Rectal temperature and respiration rate were taken 3 times/d at 0600, 1400, and 1800 h. Cows were housed in environmentally controlled rooms and were allowed acclimation for 7 d at thermoneutral (TN) conditions with a mean temperature-humidity index of 56.6. Cows were then exposed to 7 d of TN followed by 7 d of HS represented by a temperature-humidity index of 71.5 for 14 d. This was followed by a recovery period of 3 d at TN. Dietary BET increased milk yield during the TN period. No differences were found between BET and CON in total milk production or milk composition during HS. The increase in water intake during HS was not as great for cows fed BET compared with controls. The cows on CON diets had higher p.m. respiration rate than both MID and HI BET during HS, but lower rectal temperature compared with BET. No difference was found in serum glucose during TN, but cows given HI had elevated glucose levels during HS compared with CON. No differences were found in serum insulin levels between CON and BET but an intake by environment interaction was present with insulin increasing in HI treated lactating dairy cows during HS. The heat shock response [heat shock protein (HSP) 27 and HSP70] was upregulated in bovine mammary epithelial cells in vitro. Blood leukocyte HSP27 was downregulated at the HI dose under TN conditions and HSP70 was upregulated at the HI dose and this effect was increased by HS. No effect was seen with the MID dose with HSP27 or HSP70. The lack of effect of BET at MID may be associated with uptake across the gut. We conclude that BET increased milk production under TN conditions and was associated with reduced feed and water intake and slightly increased body temperatures during HS of cows fed BET. The effect of BET on milk production was lost during HS with HI BET, whereas serum glucose levels increased during HS.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000387837500034	27720159

Parametric Study of Perforated Pipe Underdrains Surrounded by Loose Aggregate								JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING				142	12					04016066	10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001214			DEC 2016	2016	A detailed computational parametric study of a perforated pipe underdrain surrounded by loose aggregate has been conducted. Several controlling geometric parameters (i.e., trench width, head, aggregate depth over the pipe, pipe wall perforation area per unit length of pipe, and the area of individual perforations) were considered and the variation of pipe discharge characteristics as a function of these parameters has been quantified. Results indicate that, for each combination of these parameters, there is a finite pipe length after which discharge does not increase with increasing pipe length. This pipe length depends on the pipe wall perforation area per unit length of pipe, pipe cross-sectional area, and losses associated with them. It was found that the effective pipe system discharge coefficient is independent of the channel width, aggregate depth, and head over the pipe for the range of parameters tested. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results were used to develop an equation for the system discharge coefficient as a function of the pipe geometry. This equation can be used for sizing underdrains in low-impact development (LID) best management practice (BMP) stormwater systems. These results have practical applications in many stormwater LID/BMPs of similar setup to that used in this study (e.g., porous pavements and infiltration trenches) for sizing and analyzing the hydraulic behavior of the underdrains. This allows design engineers to quantify the peak outflow from the underdrain when the systems are flooded.

An examination of the relationship between the extent of a flexible culture and the levers of control system: The key role of beliefs control								MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING RESEARCH				33				25	41		10.1016/j.mar.2016.03.005			DEC 2016	2016	This study examines the relationship between the extent of a flexible culture and the emphasis placed on the Levers of Control (LoC) Framework. We use a structural equation model to investigate whether the extent a firm emphasizes a flexible culture is related to the emphasis placed on beliefs, boundary, diagnostic and interactive controls. We also examine whether a key contingency variable, size, moderates our proposed model. Using survey data from 267 top managers of medium-sized firms, we find, as expected, that the more firms emphasize a flexible culture, the more they emphasize the use of beliefs controls. We show that this finding is robust to firm size. Thus, we conclude that the emphasis placed on beliefs control is an important control mechanism in organizations that emphasize a flexible culture. We also conclude that size moderates the associations among the control levers. Relative to the subsample of smaller firms, in the subsample of larger firms the beliefs and boundary control uses of performance measures are more reinforcing of each other while the diagnostic use of performance measures and boundary control act more as replacements for each other.

Isolates of the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex were collected from South Carolina and Georgia peach orchards and phylogenetic analysis of the combined internal transcribed spacer region, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and beta-tubulin gene sequences separated the isolates into C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae. The sensitivity of these and three other previously reported Colletotrichum spp. from peach, including C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. truncatum, to demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides difenoconazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole, metconazole, flutriafol, and fenbuconazole was determined based upon mycelial growth inhibition. C. truncatum was resistant to tebuconazole, metconazole, flutriafol, and fenbuconazole and C. nymphaeae was resistant to flutriafol and fenbuconazole based on 50% effective concentration (EC50) values >100 mu g/ml. C. fructicola and C. siamense were sensitive to all DMI fungicides (EC50 values of 0.2 to 13.1 mu g/ml). C. fioriniae subgroup 2 isolates were less sensitive to DMI fungicides (EC50 values of 0.5 to 16.2 mu g/ml) compared with C. fioriniae subgroup 1 (EC50 values of 0.03 to 2.1 mu g/ml). Difenoconazole and propiconazole provided the best control efficacy in vitro to all five species, with EC50 values of 0.2 to 2.7 mu g/ml. Tebuconazole and metconazole were effective against all Colletotrichum spp., except for C. truncatum. The strong in vitro activity of some DMI fungicides against Colletotrichum spp. may be exploited for improved anthracnose disease management of peach.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000387634000012		
J	Peng, Yunhui; Alexov, Emil								Cofactors-loaded quaternary structure of lysine-specific demethylase 5C (KDM5C) protein: Computational model								PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS				84	12			1797	1809		10.1002/prot.25162			DEC 2016	2016	The KDM5C gene (also known as JARID1C and SMCX) is located on the X chromosome and encodes a ubiquitously expressed 1560-aa protein, which plays an important role in lysine methylation (specifically reverses tri- and di-methylation of Lys4 of histone H3). Currently, 13 missense mutations in KDM5C have been linked to X-linked mental retardation. However, the molecular mechanism of disease is currently unknown due to the experimental difficulties in expressing such large protein and the lack of experimental 3D structure. In this work, we utilize homology modeling, docking, and experimental data to predict 3D structures of KDM5C domains and their mutual arrangement. The resulting quaternary structure includes KDM5C JmjN, ARID, PHD1, JmjC, ZF domains, substrate histone peptide, enzymatic cofactors, and DNA. The predicted quaternary structure was investigated with molecular dynamic simulation for its stability, and further analysis was carried out to identify features measured experimentally. The predicted structure of KDM5C was used to investigate the effects of disease-causing mutations and it was shown that the mutations alter domain stability and inter-domain interactions. The structural model reported in this work could prompt experimental investigations of KDM5C domain-domain interaction and exploration of undiscovered functionalities. Proteins 2016; 84:1797-1809.

J	Morrissey, Lee								"Obedience doth not well in parts": Jonson, Shakespeare, and the Atlantic Archipelago								SHAKESPEARE				12	4	SI		364	374		10.1080/17450918.2016.1208672			DEC 2016	2016	By considering Shakespeare's Henry V through an archipelagic comparison with Jonson's subsequent The Irish Masque at Court, this essay participates in the recent reconsideration of English literature's early modern inter-island context. Considering Shakespeare's and Jonson's different reflections on Ireland and the Irish in the Atlantic archipelago provides access to changing early seventeenth-century differences in English, metropolitan attitudes toward Ireland. While there has been more discussion of English literature understood archipelagically over the last two decades, including some consideration of Shakespeare and Jonson in inter-island contexts, there has been little reference to this slim text by Ben Jonson. In it, Jonson takes up the question of Ireland with all the playfully cruel benefit of hindsight not available when his rival, Shakespeare, wrote Henry V, his play that most famously and directly addresses Irish geopolitics within a new, emerging inter-island kingdom. Jonson's later masque, with its four principal characters, offers a re-reading of Shakespeare's earlier Four Captains scene, particularly of the role of MacMorris.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1745-0918	1745-0926		WOS:000387929100004

Although past reviews of the literature have focused on specific settings for the elderly or specific residential populations of the elderly, a systematic literature review that covers the range of settings and populations has been lacking. This article provides an overview and synthesis of the most recent empirical evidence addressing the impact of the physical environment on residents and staff of RHCSFs. The review also identifies gaps where future research is needed. This review found 66 studies examining the relationship between the built environment and outcomes in three broad domains of resident quality of life, resident safety, and staff and organizational outcomes. The studies address a range of topics including the impact on elderly residents of the facility scale and size, outdoor environments, and environmental quality.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-9165	1552-390X		WOS:000387154600001		
J	Dowling, Madeline E.; Bryson, Patricia K.; Boatwright, Harriet G.; Wilson, Jennifer R.; Fan, Zhen; Everhart, Sydney E.; Brannen, Phillip M.; Schnabel, Guido								Effect of Fungicide Applications on Monilinia fructicola Population Diversity and Transposon Movement								PHYTOPATHOLOGY				106	12			1504	1512		10.1094/PHYTO-03-16-0127-R			DEC 2016	2016	In this study, we investigated whether fungicide-induced mutagenesis previously reported in Monilinia fructicola could accelerate genetic changes in field populations. Azoxystrobin and propiconazole were applied to nectarine trees at weekly intervals for approximately 3 months between bloom and harvest in both 2013 and 2014. Fungicides were applied at half-label rate to allow recovery of isolates and to increase chances of sublethal dose exposure. One block was left unsprayed as a control. In total, 608 single-spore isolates were obtained from blighted blossoms, cankers, and fruit to investigate phenotypic (fungicide resistance) and genotypic (simple-sequence repeat [SSR] loci and gene region) changes. In both years, populations from fungicide-treated and untreated fruit were not statistically different in haploid gene diversity (P = 0.775 for 2013 and P = 0.938 for 2014), allele number (P = 0.876 for 2013 and P = 0.406 for 2014), and effective allele number (P = 0.861 for 2013 and P = 0.814 for 2014). Isolates from blossoms and corresponding cankers of fungicide treatments revealed no changes in SSR analysis or evidence for induced Mftc1 transposon translocation. No indirect evidence for increased genetic diversity in the form of emergence of reduced sensitivity to azoxystrobin, propiconazole, iprodione, and cyprodinil was detected. High levels of population diversity in all treatments provided evidence for sexual recombination of this pathogen in the field, despite apparent absence of apothecia in the orchard. Our results indicate that fungicide-induced, genetic changes may not occur or not occur as readily in field populations as they do under continuous exposure to sublethal doses in vitro.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-949X	1943-7684		WOS:000387464100007	27452900	
J	Hu, Meng-Jun; Cox, Kerik D.; Schnabel, Guido								Resistance to Increasing Chemical Classes of Fungicides by Virtue of "Selection by Association" in Botrytis cinerea								PHYTOPATHOLOGY				106	12			1513	1520		10.1094/PHYTO-04-16-0161-R			DEC 2016	2016	Previous research has shown that Botrytis cinerea isolates with resistance to multiple chemical classes of fungicides exist in eastern strawberry fields. In this study, the fungicide resistance profiles of 2,130 isolates from flowers of commercial strawberry fields located in multiple states was determined over four consecutive strawberry production seasons. Producers were asked to alternate single-site fungicides that were considered low risk in their specific location based on resistance monitoring results in their fields. This recommendation led to an increase of chemical class diversity used in the spray programs. Results indicated that simultaneous resistance in individual isolates to two, three, four, five, six, and seven classes of fungicides increased over time. The increase in chemical class resistances within isolates was likely due to a process we termed "selection by association", where fungicide resistance traits were often linked to the trait being selected rather than the selectable trait itself. Data analysis also indicated that the odds were highest for isolates resistant to one chemical class (1CCR) to be resistant to thiophanate-methyl; for 2CCR isolates to be resistant to thiophanate-methyl and pyraclostrobin; and for 3CCR isolates to be resistant to thiophanate-methyl, pyraclostrobin, and either cyprodinil or fenhexamid. We hypothesize that the more chemical classes are used in a spray program, the faster isolates will be selected with increasing numbers of chemical class resistances by virtue of selection by association if such isolates preexist in the population.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-949X	1943-7684		WOS:000387464100008	27503370

Negative Campaigning in the Social Media Age: Attack Advertising on Facebook								POLITICAL BEHAVIOR				38	4			999	1020		10.1007/s11109-016-9346-8			DEC 2016	2016	Recent studies examine politicians' decisions to use social media, as well as the content of the messages that these political actors disseminate on social media platforms. We contribute to this literature by examining how race competitiveness and a candidate's position in the race relative to her opponent affect their decisions to issue attacks. Through content analysis of nearly 15,000 Facebook posts for tone (positive or negative), we find that while competitive races encourage both candidates to issue more negative posts, candidates in less competitive races embrace attack messages with more or less frequency depending on whether they trail or lead their opponent. We find that social media negativity is much more likely to be a desperation strategy employed by underdog candidates in less competitive races. We also run separate models examining the factors that drive policy and personal attacks. While underdog candidates are more likely to engage in issue attacks, candidates in competitive races are significantly more likely to use Facebook to make personal attacks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-9320	1573-6687		WOS:000387233600010

Most agricultural and forestry residues could be used for biochars production. In this study, biochars were produced from rice straw, bamboo culm, and reed straw under different pyrolysis temperatures. The physiochemical and morphological properties, and PAHs content of biochars were investigated for determining the effect of protective gas and pyrolysis temperatures on biochars under different pyrolysis processes.Rice straw, bamboo culm (8 years old), and giant reed straw were used in this study. These three organic materials were converted into biochars by slow pyrolysis using a lab-scale fixed bed pyrolysis reactor. Treatment temperatures of slow pyrolysis were 400, 500, 600 and 700 A degrees C with or without the application of high purity nitrogen (> 99.999 %) as the protective gas.We found that the high-temperature pyrolysis produced lower biochar yield (25.84-28.84 %) than the low-temperature pyrolysis (29.44-34.4 %). However, the BET and C content of biochar under the high-temperature pyrolysis process was higher. The low H/C and O/C ratios of the biochars produced at higher temperature pyrolysis, was 0.08-0.10, 0.01-0.22, respectively, which showed that the carbon in these biochars was unsaturated. The PAHs content decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Bamboo culms pyrolysed at 700 A degrees C had the lowest concentration of a(16)PAH (10.06 mu g kg(-1)).The pyrolysis temperature significantly affected the properties of the resultant biochars (P < 0.05) while the protective gas did not (P > 0.05).									0	0	0	0	0	0			1877-2641	1877-265X		WOS:000387570500015

Sociology Compass 2 (2): 688-703], they have thus far neglected to investigate the physical experience of pregnancy as it relates to women's leisure. This study explored how women's experience of pregnancy and the changing body may play a role in shaping and defining their physically active leisure. Interviews were completed with 12 pregnant women and data were analysed thematically. Findings suggest that women experience an acute loss of control (over their pregnant bodies and over their actions) while simultaneously lacking solid information regarding how to best maintain their health and that of their unborn baby. The findings have important implications for women's health and leisure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1174-5398	2159-6816		WOS:000386603900002

This global operator reduces to Siegel's Phi operator when considering only the maximal standard cusps of degree n-1. One advantage of this generalization is that it allows us to give a general notion of cusp forms in genus n > 1 and to bridge this new notion with the classical one found in the literature.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-0421	1793-7310		WOS:000386924300001

These pathologies involve detrimental alteration to the nucleus pulposus (NP) either via biochemical degradation or extrusion from the IVD, respectively. Thus, engineering living NP tissue utilizing biomaterial scaffolds that recapitulate native NP microarchitecture, biochemistry, mechanical properties, and which support cell viability represents an approach to aiding patients with IDD and IDH. To date, an ideal biomaterial to support NP regeneration has yet to be developed; however, one promising approach to generating biomimetic materials is to employ the decellularization (decell) of xenogeneic NP tissue to remove host DNA while maintaining critical native extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Herein, 13 different procedures were evaluated in an attempt to decell bovine caudal IVD NP tissue. An optimal method was identified which was confirmed to effectively remove bovine DNA, while maintaining physiologically relevant amounts of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and type II collagen. Unconfined static and dynamic compressive mechanical properties of scaffolds approached values reported for human NP and viability of human amniotic stem cells (hAMSCs) was maintained on noncrosslinked and EDC/NHS treated scaffolds for up to 14 days in culture. Taken together, NP tissue obtained from bovine caudal IVDs can be successfully decelled in order to generate a biomimetic scaffold for NP tissue regeneration. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For two parallel conductors C and S (mu(C) center dot sigma(C) <= mu(S) center dot sigma(S)), we find that the shape of current density profile of conductor S is dependent on the product of mu(C) center dot sigma(C), while the magnitude is determined by the AC current frequency f. On the other hand, the frequency f affects not only the shape but also the magnitude of the current density profile of conductor C. We further adopt a coplanar model to investigate the signal sensitivity of alternating current potential drop (ACPD) measurement for both surface crack and inner crack detection. We find that with modified coating materials (lower electric conductivity and higher magnetic permeability, compared with the substrate material properties), the crack detection signal sensitivity can be greatly enhanced for both the cracks within the coating and at the coating/substrate interface, where cracks are most commonly encountered in real situations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-0233	1361-6501		WOS:000386602300001

Although establishing the ethical theory behind the system of radiological protection is an important ongoing endeavour within the community, it is equally important to communicate this information in a way that is useful to non-ethicists. Discussion of both ethical theory and a useful strategy for applying the theory makes ethics more accessible to those working in the field by providing them with the knowledge and confidence to apply ethical principles in decisions and practice.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0952-4746	1361-6498		WOS:000386129400002	27725339

However, tourists have been mostly ignored in managing heritage attractions. Given the importance of values in heritage tourism management, and the different tourists' preferences toward management actions, this article aims to explore the value orientations of different types of tourists at Petra Archaeological Park, and how these values influence their management actions preferences. Majority of the tourists were preservation value oriented, and they preferred direct management actions rather than indirect actions. Results indicated that whenever the level of the importance of heritage tourism increases in tourists' trip motivations, tourists tend to be more preservation value oriented and support direct management actions.

It thereby identifies banality and spectacle as two axes of a shared political condition of appearance. This condition of appearance is explored through Hannah Arendt's account of action as the space of appearance and its basis in plurality in The Human Condition (1958). The essay argues that Arendt's more historically engaged philosophical work including The Origins of Totalitarianism (1950, Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963), and her interviews about the Eichmann trial rearticulates this abstract account through a historically informed conception of "social texture" which requires care for "what the world looks like," for the Mitsein of Dasein. This care for what the world looks like is identified in the poetry of Iraqi American poet Dunya Mikhail, and is shown to provide a critical framework for addressing contemporary war culture through Arendt's concepts of "banality" and "functioning."									1	0	0	0	0	1			0093-3139	1542-4286		WOS:000368748800001

Lowell depicts a nation ironically unified in its servility to commercial interests and its indifference toward historical sacrifice and resistance to racial equality. Under such conditions, elegiac commemoration becomes impossible, and Lowell's poem functions as a meta-elegy: a lament for a failure of memory. These conditions persist and confront Lowell's successors, Claudia Rankine, Natasha Trethewey, and Kevin Young, who carry forward the legacy of "For the Union Dead" as they confront contemporary versions of the banality of memory and the perpetuation of racial violence.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0093-3139	1542-4286		WOS:000368748800004

However, despite considerable scientific attention in recent decades, the overall response of soil respiration to anticipated climatic warming remains unclear. We synthesize the largest global dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling > 3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Moreover, across all nondesert biomes, respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of similar to 25 degrees C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0027-8424			WOS:000388835700075	27849609	
J	Pilcher, June J.; Bryant, Stewart A.								Implications of Social Support as a Self-Control Resource								FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE				10						228	10.3389/fnbeh.2016.00228			NOV 28 2016	2016	Self-control is an intricate component of decision making and effectively managing day-to-day life. Failing to maintain adequate self-control can have negative effects on many desired goals and social experiences. As such, understanding how different facets of the human experience may affect self-control is an important undertaking. One area that is yet unclear is the possible relationships between social support and self-control. Research suggests that social support can be an effective resource in reducing stress and promoting health and well-being. Research has also indicated that stress can be a limiting factor on self-control. In contrast, few studies have focused on social support as a potential resource for self-control. The goal of this mini-review article is to explore the intersections between self-control and social support and encourage integration of these two relatively independent areas of research. This review will help provide a broader understanding of self-control resources and how we can better understand the relationships between social well-being and our ability to monitor and utilize our capacity to maintain self-control.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1662-5153			WOS:000388633200001	27965551

Another more popular synthesis method has been the carbonization of organic species, with the method being more efficient and versatile, but less controllable regarding synthesis and achieving the desired dot structure and performance. In this work, a hybrid approach combining the advantageous characteristics of the two synthesis methods was applied to the preparation of carbon dots using polyethyleneimine (PEI) for surface passivation, where pre-processed and selected small carbon nanoparticles were functionalized with PEI by microwave-induced thermal reactions. Their optical absorption and fluorescence emission properties were evaluated, and the results suggested that the carbon dots thus prepared shared the same photoexcited state characteristics with those from the deliberate chemical functionalization, including comparable fluorescence colors and other properties. A further demonstration of the similarity in photoexcited state properties was based on the same visible light-activated bactericidal functions of the PEI-carbon dots as those found in carbon dots from the deliberate chemical functionalization method. The advantages and potential limitations of the hybrid approach for more controllable yet versatile and efficient syntheses of carbon dots are highlighted and discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000388470600017	27933162

The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes in longissimus thoracis muscle of 48 Nellore young bulls with extreme phenotypes for fatty acid composition of intramuscular fat by RNA-seq technique.Results: Differential expression analyses between animals with extreme phenotype for fatty acid composition showed a total of 13 differentially expressed genes for myristic (C14:0), 35 for palmitic (C16:0), 187 for stearic (C18:0), 371 for oleic (C18:1, cis-9), 24 for conjugated linoleic (C18:2 cis-9, trans11, CLA), 89 for linoleic (C18:2 cis-9,12 n6), and 110 genes for a-linolenic (C18:3 n3) fatty acids. For the respective sums of the individual fatty acids, 51 differentially expressed genes for saturated fatty acids (SFA), 336 for monounsaturated (MUFA), 131 for polyunsaturated (PUFA), 92 for PUFA/SFA ratio, 55 for omega 3, 627 for omega 6, and 22 for omega 6/omega 3 ratio were identified. Functional annotation analyses identified several genes associated with fatty acid metabolism, such as those involved in intra and extra-cellular transport of fatty acid synthesis precursors in intramuscular fat of longissimus thoracis muscle. Some of them must be highlighted, such as: ACSM3 and ACSS1 genes, which work as a precursor in fatty acid synthesis; DGAT2 gene that acts in the deposition of saturated fat in the adipose tissue; GPP and LPL genes that support the synthesis of insulin, stimulating both the glucose synthesis and the amino acids entry into the cells; and the BDH1 gene, which is responsible for the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies used in the synthesis of ATP.Conclusion: Several genes related to lipid metabolism and fatty acid composition were identified. These findings must contribute to the elucidation of the genetic basis to improve Nellore meat quality traits, with emphasis on human health. Additionally, it can also contribute to improve the knowledge of fatty acid biosynthesis and the selection of animals with better nutritional quality.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1471-2164			WOS:000388773400002	27884102

Batsch, or peach, is one of the most important crops and it is widely established in irrigated arid and semi-aridregions. However, due to variations in the climate and the increased aridity, drought has become a major constraint, causing crop losses worldwide. The use of drought-tolerant rootstocks in modern fruit production appears to be a useful method of alleviating water deficit problems. However, the transcriptomic variation and the major molecular mechanisms that underlie the adaptation of drought-tolerant rootstocks to water shortage remain unclear. Hence, in this study, high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to assess the transcriptomic changes and the key genes involved in the response to drought in root tissues (GF677 rootstock) and leaf tissues (graft, var. Catherina) subjected to 16 days of drought stress. In total, 12 RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced. This generated a total of 315 M raw reads from both tissues, which allowed the assembly of 22,079 and 17,854 genes associated with the root and leaf tissues, respectively. Subsets of 500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in roots and 236 in leaves were identified and functionally annotated with 56 gene ontology (GO) terms and 99 metabolic pathways, which were mostly associated with aminobenzoate degradation and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. The GO analysis highlighted the biological functions that were exclusive to the root tissue, such as "locomotion," "hormone metabolic process," and "detection of stimulus," indicating the stress buffering role of the GF677 rootstock. Furthermore, the complex regulatory network involved in the drought response was revealed, involving proteins that are associated with signaling transduction, transcription and hormone regulation, redox homeostasis, and frontline barriers. We identified two poorly characterized genes in P persica: growth regulating factor 5 (GRF5), which may be involved in cellular expansion, and AtHB12, which may be involved in root elongation. The reliability of the RNA-seq experiment was validated by analyzing the expression patterns of 34 DEGs potentially involved in drought tolerance using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The transcriptomic resources generated in this study provide a broad characterization of the acclimation of P persica to drought, shedding light on the major molecular responses to the most important environmental stressor.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-462X			WOS:000388238000001	27933070

Here, using bioinformatics and DNA sequencing approaches, we identified a novel BPH resistance gene, LOC_Os06g03240 (MSU LOCUS ID), from the rice variety Ptb33 in the interval between the markers RM19291 and RM8072 on the short arm of chromosome 6, where a gene for resistance to BPH was mapped by Jirapong Jairin et al. and renamed as "Bph32". This gene encodes a unique short consensus repeat (SCR) domain protein. Sequence comparison revealed that the Bph32 gene shares 100% sequence identity with its allele in Oryza latifolia. The transgenic introgression of Bph32 into a susceptible rice variety significantly improved resistance to BPH. Expression analysis revealed that Bph32 was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths, where BPH primarily settles and feeds, at 2 and 24 h after BPH infestation, suggesting that Bph32 may inhibit feeding in BPH. Western blotting revealed the presence of Pph (Ptb33) and Tph (TN1) proteins using a Penta-His antibody, and both proteins were insoluble. This study provides information regarding a valuable gene for rice defence against insect pests.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000388362700001	27876888

Upon 5 min of the epoxy curing agent exposure, the Dirac point shifted from 60 to 13 V, while for 15 min of the epoxy curing agent exposure, the Dirac point changed more than 130 V, from 63 to -68 V, completely changing the doping of graphene from strong p-type to strong n-type due to the electron donating nature of the adsorbed molecules. Additionally, due to exposure, the hole mobility was found to reduce from 1243 to 401 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), indicating the strong impact of ionized impurity scattering. The temperature-dependent Hall measurement of single layer graphene before and after the epoxy curing agent exposure also exhibited a change in the dominant scattering mechanism from surface optical phonon scattering to Coulomb scattering near room temperature due to epoxy exposure. Reduction of initial p-type doping in chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene after epoxy exposure is also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. We found that the Dirac point recovered very slowly upon storage of the epoxy (or curing agent) exposed devices, changing by only similar to 11 V after 4 months without significant change in carrier mobility.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000387142800001

Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association														2016-Nov-22	2016	BACKGROUND: One area where telemedicine may prove to be highly effective is in providing medical care to the geriatric population, an age group predicted to account for 20% of the population in the near future. However, even though telemedicine has certain advantages, the usability of these systems with this population merits investigation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article reviews the literature published from 2000 to 2016 with the goal of analyzing the characteristics of usability-related studies conducted using geriatric participants and the subsequent usability challenges identified. Articles were found using Web of Knowledge and PubMed citation indexing portals using the keywords (1) Telemedicine* AND Geriatrics* (2) Telemedicine* AND Usability* (3) Telemedicine* AND Usability* AND Older Adults*.RESULTS: A total of 297 articles were obtained from the initial search. After further detailed screening, 16 articles were selected for review based on the inclusion criteria. Of these, 60% of the studies focused on the overall usability of telemedicine systems; 6.25% focused on the usability of a telepresence robot; 12.5% compared a face-to-face medical consultation with the use of telemedicine systems, and 25% focused on the study of other aspects of telemedicine in addition to its usability. Findings reported in the studies included high patient satisfaction with telemedicine in 31.25%, whereas another 31.25% indicated a high acceptance of this method of medical consultation. Care coordination in 6.25% of the studies; confidence in telemedicine in 6.25%; trust, privacy, and reliability in 6.25%; and increased convenience when compared to personal visits in 18.75% were also reported.CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests limited research providing scientifically valid and reproducible usability evaluation at various stages of telemedicine system development. Telemedicine system designers need to consider the age-related issues in cognition, perception, and behavior of geriatric patients while designing telemedicine applications. Future directions for research were developed based on the limitations as well as other results found in this systematic review.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1556-3669		MEDLINE:27875667	27875667

Mechanism of microtubule lumen entry for the alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase enzyme alpha TAT1								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				113	46			E7176	E7184		10.1073/pnas.1605397113			NOV 15 2016	2016	Microtubules are structural polymers inside of cells that are subject to posttranslational modifications. These posttranslational modifications create functionally distinct subsets of microtubule networks in the cell, and acetylation is the only modification that takes place in the hollow lumen of the microtubule. Although it is known that the a-tubulin acetyltransferase (alpha TAT1) is the primary enzyme responsible for microtubule acetylation, the mechanism for how alpha TAT1 enters the microtubule lumen to access its acetylation sites is not well understood. By performing biochemical assays, fluorescence and electron microscopy experiments, and computational simulations, we found that alpha TAT1 enters the microtubule lumen through the microtubule ends, and through bends or breaks in the lattice. Thus, microtubule structure is an important determinant in the acetylation process. In addition, once alpha TAT1 enters the microtubule lumen, the mobility of alpha TAT1 within the lumen is controlled by the affinity of alpha TAT1 for its acetylation sites, due to the rapid rebinding of alpha TAT1 onto highly concentrated a-tubulin acetylation sites. These results have important implications for how acetylation could gradually accumulate on stable subsets of microtubules inside of the cell.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0027-8424			WOS:000388970100007	27803321

Models of HEV powertrain and suspension are established and, based on their interactions, unified. The impacts of control parameters on the suspension performance are synthetically analyzed. The analyses form a basis for the design of suspension controller. High-level supervisory controller and low-level sub-controllers for HEV powertrain and suspension are designed. Low-level sub-controllers can ensure the performance of each system, whose control parameters are updated by the supervisory controller. The equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), superior in maintaining charge sustainability, is improved for better application in the proposed system. Simulation results under different conditions demonstrate that both HEV fuel economy and ride comfort are improved. Comparative analyses of various scenarios validate the positive effect of suspension energy regeneration on the energy conservation performance of power split HEV. Meanwhile, the improvement of HEV fuel economy can be highlighted by applying ECMS. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000387626600052		
J	Xiao, Rui; Zheng, Yi								Overview of microalgal extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and their applications								BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES				34	7			1225	1244		10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.08.004			NOV 15 2016	2016	Microalgae have been studied as natural resources for a number of applications, most particularly food, animal feed, biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals. In addition to the intracellular compounds of interest, microalgae can also excrete various extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) into their immediate living environment during their life cycle to form a hydrated biofilm matrix. These microalgal EPS mainly consist of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. Most notably, EPS retain their stable matrix structure and form a 3-D polymer network for cells to interact with each other, and mediate their adhesion to surfaces. EPS also play a role as extracellular energy and carbon sinks. They are also abundant source of structurally and compositionally diverse biopolymers which possess unique bioactivities for special high-value applications, specifically as antivirals, antitumor agents, antioxidants, anticoagulants and anti-inflammatories. Their superior rheological properties also make microalgal EPS particularly useful in mechanical engineering (e.g., biolubricants and drag reducers) and food science/engineering (e.g., thickener and preservatives) applications. The chemical composition and structure of EPS appear to correlate with their applications, but the fundamentals of such relationship are not well understood. This article summarizes previous research on microalgal EPS derived from green algae, diatoms and red algae, including compositions/functions/structure, production, and potential applications. The importance of exopolysaccharides and EPS proteins, with their particular metabolic characteristics, are also described because of their potential high-value applications. This review concludes with potential future research areas of microalgal EPS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0734-9750	1873-1899		WOS:000387299000004	27576096

The salt precursor was accessed in six steps from the commercially available 1,2-phenylenediamine. This carbene was found to be stable under inert conditions and it was fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The sulfur adduct of this carbene was also synthesized and fully characterized. The X-ray structure analysis of the thione revealed that the carbene carbon and the sulfur atom deviate from the plane containing the BTD moiety and the two nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring by 0.231 and 0.890 A, respectively. Complexes of type [MCI(COD)(1)] (where M = Rh and Ir) were prepared and characterized using spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. The donor strength of this new carbene was determined by IR spectroscopy (nu(av)) and cyclic voltammetry (E-1/2). Preliminary catalytic studies show that the new carbene is a suitable ligand for rhodium and iridium catalysts in the hydrosilylation of acetophenones. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The aims of this study were to investigate (i) the removal efficiencies of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), halonitromethane (HNM), and trihalomethane (THM) precursors by NF membranes from different source water types (i.e. surface water, wastewater impacted surface water, and municipal and industrial wastewater treatment effluents), (ii) the impact of membrane type, and (iii) the effects of background water components (i.e., pH, ionic strength, and Ca2+) on the removal of selected DBP precursors from different source waters. The results showed the overall precursor removal efficiencies were 57-83%, 48-87%, and 72-97% for NDMA, HNM, and THM precursors, respectively. The removal of NDMA precursors decreased with the increases in average molecular weight cut off and negative surface charge of NF membranes tested, while the removal of THM precursors was slightly affected. pH changes increased the removal of NDMA precursors, but pH did not affect the removal of THM and HNM precursors in municipal WWTP effluent. On the other hand, pH changes had little or no effect on DBP removal from industrial WWTP effluent. In addition, regardless of the membrane type or background water type/characteristics, ionic strength did not show any impact on DBP precursor removals. Lastly, an increase in Ca2+ concentration enhanced the removal of NDMA precursors while a slight decrease and no effect was observed for THM and HNM precursors, respectively, in municipal WWTP effluent.

The effects of both the mixing procedure of the starting reactant powders, and the addition of different mole fraction of alumina were investigated. The samples were characterized chemically, physically, and morphologically and their mechanical properties measured. It was found that changing the mixing procedure of the starting powders reduced the porosity of the combustion product from 24 to 7 vol%. On the other hand, the addition of 1.0 mol alumina was found to increase the porosity to 13 vol% and hence lower the mechanical properties. However, the addition of alumina resulted in samples with much better geometric definition and therefore this approach should be further investigated with optimized processing conditions.

The prepared sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), BET surface area analyzer and impedance spectroscopy techniques. XRD results confirmed the formation of a single phase of nanocrystalline spinel magnesium ferrite sample. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy (FTIR) results confirmed the structural co-ordination of the magnesium ferrite sample. The spherical shape morphology of the prepared magnesium ferrite particles was confirmed from the FE-SEM images. Specific surface area and porosity of the MgFe2O4 sample were obtained from N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms results. The D.C. and A.C. electrical conductivities of the MgFe2O4 sample as a function of temperature and frequency were investigated by analyzing the measured impedance data. The activation energy for the migration of the carriers in the MgFe2O4 sample was found to be 0.607 eV. The dielectric studies revealed that the dielectric constant of the mesoporous MgFe2O4 sample increases with increase in temperature. Further, lithium battery was fabricated using the developed nanocrystalline mesoporous spinel MgFe2O4 as anode material and investigated its electrochemical performance. The charge-discharge studies revealed that the fabricated lithium battery using the developed nanocrystalline mesoporous MgFe2O4 as anode exhibited high capacity and good cycleability in the voltage range 0.005-3 V. The results show that the developed nanocrystalline mesoporous spinel magnesium ferrite could be a better anode material for lithium battery applications.

J	Kowalski, Robin Marie; Morgan, Megan; Taylor, Katlyn								Stigma of mental and physical illness and the use of mobile technology.								The Journal of social psychology								1	9					2016-Nov-14	2016	Research has shown the stigma attached to mental disabilities, yet little research has directly compared the experiences of people with physical disabilities and those with mental disabilities. Not only are both conditions likely perceived as stigmatizing, but the pervasive use of mobile technology may be one means by which people with disabilities can manage and understand their disability. Four hundred and eighty-seven individuals with physical and/or psychological disabilities completed a survey examining whether they would be willing to use mobile technology to manage their disability and how stigmatizing they perceived their disability to be. Willingness to use mobile technology was related to the age of the sample as well as the type of disability. Individuals with psychological disabilities were more likely to use certain forms of mobile technology relative to those with physical disabilities. Observed differences between physical and psychological disabilities are discussed in terms of the symbolic interaction stigma model.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1940-1183		MEDLINE:27841705	27841705

The current study elucidates the association of pentablock copolymers in a mixture of selective solvents which are good for the hydrophobic segments and poor for the hydrophilic blocks using small angle neutron scattering (SANS). The pentablock consists of a center block of randomly sulfonated polystyrene, designed for transport, tethered to poly-ethylene-r-propylene and end-capped by poly-t-butyl styrene, for mechanical stability. We find that the pentablock forms ellipsoidal core-shell micelles with the sulfonated polystyrene in the core and Gaussian decaying chains of swollen poly-ethylene-r-propylene and poly-t-butyl styrene tertiary in the corona. With increasing solution concentration, the size of the micelle, the thickness of the corona, and the aggregation number increase, while the solvent fraction in the core decreases. In dilute solution the micelle increases in size as the temperature is increased, however, temperature effects dissipate with increasing solution concentration.

We used generalized linear mixed modeling to estimate the relative effects of Twitter activity, journal impact factor, and time since publication on Web of Science citation rates of 1,599 primary research articles from 20 ecology journals published from 2012-2014. We found a strong positive relationship between Twitter activity (i.e., the number of unique tweets about an article) and number of citations. Twitter activity was a more important predictor of citation rates than 5-year journal impact factor. Moreover, Twitter activity was not driven by journal impact factor; the 'highest-impact' journals were not necessarily the most discussed online. The effect of Twitter activity was only about a fifth as strong as time since publication; accounting for this confounding factor was critical for estimating the true effects of Twitter use. Articles in impactful journals can become heavily cited, but articles in journals with lower impact factors can generate considerable Twitter activity and also become heavily cited. Authors may benefit from establishing a strong social media presence, but should not expect research to become highly cited solely through social media promotion. Our research demonstrates that altmetrics and traditional metrics can be closely related, but not identical. We suggest that both altmetrics and traditional citation rates can be useful metrics of research impact.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000387779200059	27835703

THE INTERMEDIATE NEUTRON-CAPTURE PROCESS AND CARBON-ENHANCED METAL-POOR STARS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				831	2					171	10.3847/0004-637X/831/2/171			NOV 10 2016	2016	Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the Galactic Halo display enrichments in heavy elements associated with either the s (slow) or the r (rapid) neutron-capture process (e.g., barium and europium, respectively), and in some cases they display evidence of both. The abundance patterns of these CEMP-s/r stars, which show both Ba and Eu enrichment, are particularly puzzling, since the s and the r processes require neutron densities that are more than ten orders of magnitude apart and, hence, are thought to occur in very different stellar sites with very different physical conditions. We investigate whether the abundance patterns of CEMP-s/r stars can arise from the nucleosynthesis of the intermediate neutron-capture process (the i process), which is characterized by neutron densities between those of the s and the r processes. Using nuclear network calculations, we study neutron capture nucleosynthesis at different constant neutron densities n ranging from 10(7) -10(15) cm(-3). With respect to the classical s process resulting from neutron densities on the lowest side of this range, neutron densities on the highest side result in abundance patterns, which show an increased production of heavy s-process and r-process elements, but similar abundances of the light s-process elements. Such high values of n may occur in the thermal pulses of asymptotic giant branch stars due to proton ingestion episodes. Comparison to the surface abundances of 20 CEMP-s/r stars shows that our modeled i-process abundances successfully reproduce observed abundance patterns, which could not be previously explained by s-process nucleosynthesis. Because the i-process models fit the abundances of CEMP-s/r stars so well, we propose that this class should be renamed as CEMP-i.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000387878200022

The results from solution-phase NMR characterization support the expected dot structure of carbon nanoparticles surface-attached with EPA species. The optical properties of the EPA-carbon dots share many features with those found in carbon dots of other surface functionalities, but there is an extra absorption shoulder in the blue spectral region, into which the excitation results in much enhanced green fluorescence emissions. The EPA-carbon dots were defunctionalized by gradually removing the EPA species from the carbon nanoparticles, along with spectroscopic characterizations on the samples of different degrees of defunctionalization. The outcomes further confirm the critical role of surface functionalization in the superior optical properties of carbon dots. Results from systematic measurements of fluorescence quantum yields and decays at different excitation wavelengths for the EPA-carbon dots and their gradually defunctionalized samples are presented, and their mechanistic implications are discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447			WOS:000387737900049

Harnessing Cooperative Interactions between Thermoresponsive Aptamers and Gels To Trap and Release Nanoparticles								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				8	44			30475	30483		10.1021/acsami.6b06575			NOV 9 2016	2016	We use computational modeling to design a device that can controllably trap and release particles in solution in response to variations in temperature. The system exploits the thermoresponsive properties of end-grafted fibers and the underlying gel substrate. The fibers mimic the temperature-dependent behavior of biological aptamers, which form a hairpin structure at low temperatures (T) and unfold at higher T, consequently losing their binding affinity. The gel substrate exhibits a lower Critical solution temperature and thus, expands at low temperatures and contracts at higher T. By developing a new dissipative particle dynamics simulation, we examine the behavior of this hybrid system in a flowing fluid that contains buoyant nanoparticles. At low T, the expansion of the gel causes the hairpin-shaped fibers to extend into the path of the fluid-driven particle. Exhibiting a high binding affinity for these particles at low temperature, the fibers effectively trap and extract the particles from the surrounding solution. When the temperature is increased, the unfolding of the fiber and collapse of the supporting gel layer cause the particles to be released and transported away from the layer by the applied shear flow. Since the temperature-induced conformational changes of the fiber and polymer gel are reversible, the system can be used repeatedly to "catch and release" particles in solution. Our findings provide guidelines for creating fluidic devices that are effective at,purifying contaminated solutions or trapping cells for biological assays.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			WOS:000387737200072	27547846

Detritus Quality and Locality Determines Survival and Mass, but Not Export, of Wood Frogs at Metamorphosis								PLOS ONE				11	11					e0166296	10.1371/journal.pone.0166296			NOV 8 2016	2016	Single-site experiments have demonstrated detritus quality in wetlands can have strongly negative, neutral, and even positive influences on wildlife. However, an examination of the influence of detritus quality across several regions is lacking and can provide information on whether impacts from variation in detritus quality are consistent across species with wide ranges. To address this gap in regional studies we examined effects of emergent and allochthonous detritus of different nutrient qualities on amphibians and assessed a mechanism that may contribute to potential impacts. We used aquatic mesocosms to raise wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) from two regions of the United States with whole plants from purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), leaf litter from native hardwood trees, and a mixture of both. We examined several metrics of amphibian fitness and life history, including survival, number of days to metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis. Further, we quantified whether the effects of detritus type could translate to variation in anuran biomass or standing stock of nitrogen or phosphorus export. Our results show detritus with high nutrient quality (purple loosestrife) negatively influenced survival of wood frogs, but increased size of metamorphic individuals in two different regions of the United States. Despite the decrease in survival, the increase in size of post-metamorphic anurans raised with high quality detritus resulted in anuran biomass and standing stock of N and P export being similar across treatments at both locations. These results further demonstrate the role of plant quality in shaping wet-land ecosystem dynamics, and represent the first demonstration that effects are consistent within species across ecoregional boundaries.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000387615200084	27824915

Leaching of nano-ZnO in municipal solid waste								JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS				317				319	326		10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.05.094			NOV 5 2016	2016	Despite widespread use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in commercial products and their potential disposal in landfills, the fate of ENMs in solid waste environments are still not well understood. In this study, the leaching behavior of nano ZnO-one of the most used ENMs- in fresh municipal solid waste (MSW) was investigated. Batch reactors containing municipal solid waste samples were spiked with three different types of nano ZnO having different surface stabilization. The leaching of ZnO was examined under acidic, basic and elevated ionic strength (IS) conditions. The results of the 3-day batch tests showed that the percent of the added nano-ZnO mass retained within the solid waste matrix ranged between 80% and 93% on average for the three types of nano-ZnO tested. The pH and IS conditions, did not significantly influence the leaching behavior of ZnO. To further analyze the behavior of ZnO in the MSW matrix, a kinetic particle deposition/detachment model was developed. The model was able to reproduce the main trends of the batch experiments. Reaction rate constants for the batch tests ranged from 0.01 to 0.4 1/hr, reflecting the rapid deposition of nano-ZnO within the MSW matrix. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Functionalized magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles for U removal from low and high pH groundwater								JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS				317				494	502		10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.05.093			NOV 5 2016	2016	U(VI) species display limited adsorption onto sediment minerals and synthetic sorbents in pH <4 or pH >8 groundwater. In this work, magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MMSNs) with magnetite nanoparticle cores were functionalized with various organic molecules using post-synthetic methods. The functionalized MMSNs were characterized using N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), C-13 cross polarization and magic angle spinning (CPMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), which indicated that mesoporous silica (MCM-41) particles of 100-200 nm formed around a core of magnetic iron oxide, and the functional groups were primarily grafted into the mesopores of 3.0 nm in size. The functionalized MMSNs were effective for U removal from pH 3.5 and 9.6 artificial groundwater (AGW). Functionalized MMSNs removed U from the pH 3.5 AGW by as much as 6 orders of magnitude more than unfunctionalized nanoparticles or silica and had adsorption capacities as high as 38 mg/g. They removed U from the pH 9.6 AGW as much as 4 orders of magnitude greater than silica and 2 orders of magnitude greater than the unfunctionalized nanoparticles with adsorption capacities as high as 133 mg/g. These results provide an applied solution for treating U contamination that occurs at extreme pH environments and a scientific foundation for solving critical industrial issues related to environmental stewardship and nuclear power production.

J	Hysell, David L.; Larsen, Miguel; Sulzer, Michael								Observational evidence for new instabilities in the midlatitude E and F region								ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE				34	11			927	941		10.5194/angeo-34-927-2016			NOV 3 2016	2016	Radar observations of the E- and F-region ionosphere from the Arecibo Observatory made during moderately disturbed conditions are presented. The observations indicate the presence of patchy sporadic E (E-s) layers, medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs), and depletion plumes associated with spread F conditions. New analysis techniques are applied to the dataset to infer the vector plasma drifts in the F region as well as vector neutral wind and temperature profiles in the E region. Instability mechanisms in both regions are evaluated. The mesosphere-lower-thermosphere (MLT) region is found to meet the conditions for neutral dynamic instability in the vicinity of the patchy Es layers even though the wind shear was relatively modest. An inversion in the MLT temperature profile contributed significantly to instability in the vicinity of one patchy layer. Of particular interest is the evidence for the conditions required for neutral convective instability in the lower-thermosphere region (which is usually associated with highly stable conditions) due to the rapid increase in temperature with altitude. A localized F-region plasma density enhancement associated with a sudden ascent up the magnetic field is shown to create the conditions necessary for convective plasma instability leading to the depletion plume and spread F. The growth time for the instability is short compared to the one described by Perkins (1973). This instability does not offer a simple analytic solution but is clearly present in numerical simulations. The instability mode has not been described previously but appears to be more viable than the various mechanisms that have been suggested previously as an explanation for the occurrence of midlatitude spread F									0	0	0	0	0	0			0992-7689	1432-0576		WOS:000387862500001

Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine														2016-Nov-02	2016	BACKGROUND: Journal club is a pervasive component of graduate medical education, yet there is no gold standard as to format and logistics.METHODS: Survey of primary care sports medicine fellowship directors in the United States.RESULTS: Sixty-nine program directors completed the online questionnaire (40% response rate). There were some common aspects to journal club exhibited by a majority of programs, including the general format, required attendance by fellows and expected or required attendance by faculty, the expectation that participants had at least read the article before the meeting, and that meetings occurred during the workday in the work setting without provision of food. There was considerable variation on other aspects, including the objectives of journal club, who had primary responsibility for organizing the session, the criteria for selection of articles, who was invited to attend, and the perceived problems with journal club.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first survey investigating the current state of journal club in primary care sports medicine fellowship programs. Several opportunities for educational enhancements exist within journal clubs in primary care sports medicine, including the use of structured tools to guide discussion, providing mechanisms to evaluate the journal club experience as a whole, inviting multidisciplinary team members (eg, statisticians) to discussions, and ensuring that objectives are explicitly stated to participants.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1536-3724		MEDLINE:27811547	27811547

Graham								Blastocystis Mitochondrial Genomes Appear to Show Multiple Independent Gains and Losses of Start and Stop Codons								GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				8	11			3340	3350		10.1093/gbe/evw255			NOV 2016	2016	Complete mitochondrion-related organelle (MRO) genomes of several subtypes (STs) of the unicellular stramenopile Blastocystis are presented. Complete conservation of gene content and synteny in gene order is observed across all MRO genomes, comprising 27 protein coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 16 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Despite the synteny, differences in the degree of overlap between genes were observed between subtypes and also between isolates within the same subtype. Other notable features include unusual base-pairing mismatches in the predicted secondary structures of some tRNAs. Intriguingly, the rps4 gene in some MRO genomes is missing a start codon and, based on phylogenetic relationships among STs, this loss has happened twice independently. One unidentified open reading frame (orf160) is present in all MRO genomes. However, with the exception of ST4 where the feature has been lost secondarily, orf160 contains variously one or two in-frame stop codons. The overall evidence suggests that both the orf160 and rps4 genes are functional in all STs, but how they are expressed remains unclear.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1759-6653			WOS:000393815300008	27811175

A commercially available double-pass retina point imaging instrument (OQAS 108 II AcuTarget HD; Visiometrics S.L., Terrassa, Spain) was used to collect Objective Scatter Index (OSI) values in 21 keratoconic and 22 normal eyes. Eyes were also subjected to corneal topography and tomography, and staged using the Keratoconus Severity Score (KSS) and Amsler-Krumeich (AK) scales.RESULTS: The OSI was increased in keratoconic eyes (5.85 +/- 0.98) versus control eyes (0.83 +/- 0.12; mean +/- SEM), in AK stages 1 to 4, and KSS stages 3 and 4. Receiver-operator characteristic analysis obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.859 when evaluating the OSI as a unimodal diagnostic indicator for any KSS stage and 0.993 for KSS stages 3 and higher. An AUC of 0.949 was obtained in comparing eyes with lower severity topographic aberrations (KSS 1 and 2) versus mild to moderate keratoconus (KSS 3 and 4). Increasing corneal steepening patterns on tomography and topography were associated with PSF broadening and increased OSI.CONCLUSIONS: Double-pass retina point imaging is useful in correlating retinal image quality with keratoconus severity. The OSI may represent a clinically significant parameter for staging keratoconus with a unique ability to directly evaluate quality of vision in this population.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1081-597X	1938-2391		WOS:000393128300007	27824380	
J	Fang, Hongbin; Li, Suyi; Wang, K. W.					Fang, Hongbin/0000-0001-6691-0531			Self-locking degree-4 vertex origami structures								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES				472	2195					20160682	10.1098/rspa.2016.0682			NOV 1 2016	2016	A generic degree-4 vertex (4-vertex) origami possesses one continuous degree-of-freedom for rigid folding, and this folding process can be stopped when two of its facets bind together. Such facet-binding will induce self-locking so that the overall structure stays at a pre-specified configuration without additional locking elements or actuators. Self-locking offers many promising properties, such as programmable deformation ranges and piecewise stiffness jumps, that could significantly advance many adaptive structural systems. However, despite its excellent potential, the origami self-locking features have not been well studied, understood, and used. To advance the state of the art, this research conducts a comprehensive investigation on the principles of achieving and harnessing self-locking in 4-vertex origami structures. Especially, for the first time, this study expands the 4-vertex structure construction from single-component to dual-component designs and investigates their self-locking behaviours. By exploiting various tessellation designs, this research discovers that the dual-component designs offer the origami structures with extraordinary attributes that the single-component structures do not have, which include the existence of flat-folded locking planes, programmable locking points and deformability. Finally, proof-of-concept experiments investigate how self-locking can effectively induce piecewise stiffness jumps. The results of this research provide new scientific knowledge and a systematic framework for the design, analysis and utilization of self-locking origami structures for many potential engineering applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1364-5021	1471-2946		WOS:000391101900026	27956889

Based on his definitions of space-time constraints (i.e., authority constraints, capability constraints, and coupling constraints), Shoval (2012) modified the constraints concept for tourism research. This study examines the associations between these constraints and spatial patterns of travels. The results indicate that authority constraints (i.e., the purpose of travel) are significantly associated with the macro level (i.e., single destination travel and multi-destination travel), while the capability constraints (i.e., the length of travel) and coupling constraints (i.e., the composition of travel party) are significantly associated with the micro level (i.e., multi-destination travel patterns).

Spurred by the growing need for data collection and transmission, WSN research topics have gained interest in recent years. WSNs are often deployed in hostile or inaccessible locations in which sensor replacement or repair is impractical. This survey explores various research approaches and extensions to the problem, which include online routing, clustering approaches, and lifetime maximization on specially structured networks. We additionally consider the impact of having mobile and/or multiple sinks and delay-tolerant routing. Finally, we expand our analysis to examine multicriteria optimization problems, and outline future research challenges in the field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper develops a conceptual model to investigate the effectiveness of utilizing customer training and education (CTE) to improve customer readiness to provide effective behaviors in a professional service. The model was tested using survey data from patients diagnosed with diabetes who received CTE as part of their healthcare service. We found that customers who are taught why they have to perform the tasks, have higher levels of motivation to perform these tasks effectively.

Characterization of the recombination activities of the Entamoeba histolytica Rad51 recombinase								MOLECULAR AND BIOCHEMICAL PARASITOLOGY				210	1-2			71	84		10.1016/j.molbiopara.2016.09.001			NOV-DEC 2016	2016	The protozoan parasite responsible for human amoebiasis is Entamoeba histolytica. An important facet of the life cycle of E. histolytica involves the conversion of the mature trophozoite to a cyst. This transition is thought to involve homologous recombination (HR), which is dependent upon the Rad51 recombinase. Here, a biochemical characterization of highly purified ehRad51 protein is presented. The ehRad51 protein preferentially binds ssDNA, forms a presynaptic filament and possesses ATP hydrolysis activity that is stimulated by the presence of DNA. Evidence is provided that ehRad51 catalyzes robust DNA strand exchange over at least 5.4 kilobase pairs. Although the homologous DNA pairing activity of ehRad51 is weak, it is strongly enhanced by the presence of two HR accessory cofactors, calcium and Hop2-Mnd1. The biochemical system described herein was used to demonstrate the potential for targeting ehRad51 with two small molecule inhibitors of human RAD51. We show that 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) inhibited ehRad51 by interfering with DNA binding and attenuated encystation in Entamoeba invadens, while B02 had no effect on ehRad51 strand exchange activity. These results provide insight into the underlying mechanism of homology-directed DNA repair in E. histolytica. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Gomez, Angela C.; Holford, Timothy W.; Yamaguchi, Naohiro								Malignant hyperthermia-associated mutations in the S2-S3 cytoplasmic loop of type 1 ryanodine receptor calcium channel impair calcium-dependent inactivation								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-CELL PHYSIOLOGY				311	5			C749	C757		10.1152/ajpcell.00134.2016			NOV 1 2016	2016	Channel activities of skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) are activated by micromolar Ca2+ and inactivated by higher (similar to 1 mM) Ca2+ To gain insight into a mechanism underlying Ca2+-dependent inactivation of RyR1 and its relationship with skeletal muscle diseases, we constructed nine recombinant RyR1 mutants carrying malignant hyperthermia or centronuclear myopathy-associated mutations and determined RyR1 channel activities by [H-3] ryanodine binding assay. These mutations are localized in or near the RyR1 domains which are responsible for Ca2+-dependent inactivation of RyR1. Four RyR1 mutations (F4732D, G4733E, R4736W, and R4736Q) in the cytoplasmic loop between the S2 and S3 transmembrane segments (S2-S3 loop) greatly reduced Ca2+-dependent channel inactivation. Activities of these mutant channels were suppressed at 10-100 mu M Ca2+, and the suppressions were relieved by 1 mM Mg2+. The Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent regulation of S2-S3 loop RyR1 mutants are similar to those of the cardiac isoform of RyR (RyR2) rather than wild-type RyR1. Two mutations (T4825I and H4832Y) in the S4-S5 cytoplasmic loop increased Ca2+ affinities for channel activation and decreased Ca2+ affinities for inactivation, but impairment of Ca2+ dependent inactivation was not as prominent as those of S2-S3 loop mutants. Three mutations (T4082M, S4113L, and N4120Y) in the EF-hand domain showed essentially the same Ca2+-dependent channel regulation as that of wild-type RyR1. The results suggest that nine RyR1 mutants associated with skeletal muscle diseases were differently regulated by Ca2+ and Mg2+. Four malignant hyperthermia-associated RyR1 mutations in the S2-S3 loop conferred RyR2-type Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent channel regulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-6143	1522-1563		WOS:000390107000005	27558158

The obtained bulk materials were single-phase, nearly stoichiometric structures with a relative packing density of 97% or higher. The structures contained high concentration of atomic scale defects and pores of 20-200 nm diameter. The above attributes gave rise to a high thermoelectric performance: at 873 K, the ZT value of Cu2S reached 1.07, about 2.1 times the value typical of samples grownfrom the melt. The ZT value of Cu2Se samples reached in excess of 1.2, close to the state-of-the-art value. (C) 2016 Author(s).									0	0	0	0	0	0			2166-532X			WOS:000390228300012

In humans, these viruses spread via person-to-person contact, food, water, and/or the environment. Their survival and inactivation on hard surfaces have been extensively studied; however, nonlaunderable soft surfaces, such as upholstery and carpet, have received little attention. The aim of this systematic review was to determine factors that influence the survival and inactivation of enteric viruses on nonlaunderable soft surfaces.Methods: EBSCO and Web of Science were searched for experimental studies published between 1965 and 2015 using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methods. Titles and abstracts were screened using 3 eligibility criteria. The quality of all study methods was also assessed.Results: Our search yielded 12 articles. Viruses survived between 0 hours and 140 days depending on surface and environment conditions. Virus survival was influenced by temperature, relative humidity, organic content, and deposition method. A variety of chemistries were tested across studies and were shown to have a varied effect on enteric viruses. Chlorine, glutaraldehyde, vaporous ozone, and hydrogen peroxide were the most efficacious against enteric viruses (>3-log reduction).Conclusions: Environmental factors, such as temperature and relative humidity, can influence survival of enteric viruses on nonlaunderable soft surfaces. The efficacy of liquid and vaporous chemistries are associated with surface and virus type. (C) 2016 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

Evaluation of the Honey-Card Technique for Detection of Transmission of Arboviruses in Florida and Comparison With Sentinel Chicken Seroconversion								JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY				53	6			1449	1457		10.1093/jme/tjw106			NOV 2016	2016	Zoonotic mosquito-borne viruses, such as the West Nile virus (WNV) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), are major public health threats in the United States. Early detection of virus transmission and targeted vector management are critical to protect humans against these pathogens. Sentinel chickens and pool screening of mosquitoes, the most widely used methods of arbovirus early detection, have technical time-lags that compromise their early-detection value. The exploitation of sugar-feeding by trapped mosquitoes for arbovirus surveillance may represent a viable alternative to other methods. Here we compared effectiveness of sugar-impregnated nucleic-acid preserving substrates (SIPS) and sentinel chicken program for detecting WNV, EEEV, and St. Louis encephalitis virus in gravid traps, CO2-baited light traps, and resting traps at 10 locations in two Florida counties. In St. Johns County, comparable numbers of EEEV detections were made by SIPS traps (18) and sentinel chickens (22), but fewer WNV detections were made using SIPS (1) than sentinel chickens (13). In Volusia County, seven arbovirus detections were made via the sentinel chicken program (one EEEV and six WNV), whereas only one arbovirus detection (WNV) was made using SIPS. CO2-baited light traps captured > 90% of total mosquitoes, yet yielded < 30% of arbovirus detections. Resting traps and gravid traps captured a fraction of total mosquitoes, yet yielded roughly equivalent numbers of arbovirus detections, as did light traps. Challenges to successful deployment of SIPS include optimization of traps for collecting all vector species, increasing sugar-feeding rates of trapped vectors, and developing tractable methods for arbovirus detection.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2585	1938-2928		WOS:000390217500026	27330092

Effect of Resident Involvement on Operative Time and Operating Room Staffing Costs								JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION				73	6			979	985		10.1016/j.jsurg.2016.05.014			NOV-DEC 2016	2016	OBJECTIVE: The operating room (OR) is a major driver of hospital costs; therefore, operative time is an expensive resource. The training of surgical residents must include time spent in the OR, but that experience comes with a cost to the surgeon and hospital. The objective of this article is to determine the effect of surgical resident involvement in the OR on operative time and subsequent hospital labor costs.DESIGN: The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test is used to determine whether or not there is a difference in operative times between 2 groups of cases (with residents and without residents). This difference leads to an increased cost in associated hospital labor costs for the group with the longer operative time.SETTING: Cases were performed at Greenville Memorial Hospital. Greenville Memorial Hospital is part of the larger healthcare system, Greenville Health System, located in Greenville, SC and is a level 1 trauma center with up to 33 staffed ORs.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 84,997 cases were performed at the partnering hospital between January 1st, 2011 and July 31st, 2015. Cases were only chosen for analysis if there was only one CPT code associated with the case and there were more than 5 observations for each group being studied. This article presents a comprehensive retrospective analysis of 29,134 cases covering 246 procedures.RESULTS: The analysis shows that 45 procedures took significantly longer with a resident present in the room. The average increase in operative time was 4.8 minutes and the cost per minute of extra operative time was determined to be $9.57 per minute. OR labor costs at the partnering hospital was found to be $2,257,433, or $492,889 per year.CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the affect on operative time and OR costs allows managers to make smart decisions when considering alternative educational and training techniques. In addition, knowing the connection between residents in the room and surgical duration could help provide better estimates of surgical time in the future and increase the predictability of procedure duration.

Shared phylogeographical breaks in a Caribbean coral reef sponge and its invertebrate commensals								JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY				43	11			2136	2146		10.1111/jbi.12785			NOV 2016	2016	Aim To test whether phylogeographical barriers in the brooding sponge Callyspongia vaginalis match breaks previously identified in the Caribbean. We also compared patterns of subdivision in the sponge to those of three of its commensals, the broadcast spawning brittle star Ophiothrix suensonii and the brooding amphipods Leucothoe ashleyae and L. kensleyi, and tested whether any shared breaks arose simultaneously.Location Florida, Bahamas and the Caribbean.Methods Subdivision of C. vaginalis populations was inferred from one mitochondrial (COI) and six nuclear loci using clustering analyses. We identified phylogeographical breaks in the sponge and its invertebrate commensals by determining geographical patterns of genetic variation and tested simultaneous population divergence across barriers shared among taxa using hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation.Results Sponge populations were partitioned into western and eastern groups across the Caribbean, with hierarchical subdivision within regions. The sponge and its commensals shared barriers across their ranges despite differences in dispersal strategy: C. vaginalis, L. ashleyae and O. suensonii populations in Central America were isolated from the remainder of the Caribbean, and all four taxa shared a break between Florida and the Bahamas, although simultaneous population divergence could not be inferred with statistical certainty. Our results also suggest cryptic speciation within C. vaginalis.Main conclusions Phylogeographical patterns in C. vaginalis largely matched barriers previously identified at the Florida Straits, Mona Passage and Bay of Honduras in other Caribbean taxa. Oceanographic features such as deep water between locations, strong currents, and eddies are likely mechanisms responsible for these breaks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0305-0270	1365-2699		WOS:000388868700005

We tested Rensch's rule in the superfamily Majoidea, a diverse Glade of 'spider crabs.' Considering that having the widest range of data available is important when testing macroevolutionary hypotheses, we first explored SSD in the pygmy spider crab Petramithrax pygmaeus (Bell, 1836), one of the smallest spider crabs in the superfamily. Petramithrax pygmaeus exhibits an unusual pattern of sexual dimorphism, with females displaying a larger average carapace width than males, yet males attain a larger overall body size. This type of SSD is unusual for spider crabs, with most species displaying male-biased sexual size dimorphism for both mean and overall body size. Hierarchical cluster and discriminant analyses demonstrated the existence of two distinct ontogenetic phases in P. pygmaeus (juvenile/prepubertal and adult/postpubertal). We used our data on body size of P. pygmaeus along with previously published body-size data for 11 other species within the superfamily Majoidea to test for Rensch's rule. Using raw data, phylogenetic independent contrasts generated from maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenetic trees, and reduced major axis regression analyses, we determined that for the tested species in the Majoidea that the predictions of Rensch's rule were not upheld. Macroevoultionary patterns such as Rensch's rule are not well studied in marine invertebrate systems; looking at how these rules compare between vertebrate and invertebrate and terrestrial and aquatic animals will help us to understand the differences and factors that could influence size and growth in these systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-0372	1937-240X		WOS:000389115300004

A UNIFIED MODEL FOR GRB PROMPT EMISSION FROM OPTICAL TO gamma-RAYS; EXPLORING GRBs AS STANDARD CANDLES								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS				831	1					L8	10.3847/2041-8205/831/1/L8			NOV 1 2016	2016	The origin of prompt emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains to be an open question. Correlated prompt optical and.-ray emission observed in a handful of GRBs strongly suggests a common emission region, but failure to adequately fit the broadband GRB spectrum prompted the hypothesis of different emission mechanisms for the low-and high-energy radiations. We demonstrate that our multi-component model for GRB gamma-ray prompt emission provides an excellent fit to GRB. 110205A from optical to.-ray energies. Our results show that the optical and highest.-ray emissions have the same spatial and spectral origin, which is different from the bulk of the X-and softest.-ray radiation. Finally, our accurate redshift estimate for GRB. 110205A demonstrates promise for using GRBs as cosmological standard candles.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000388926100001

We then propose new fathoming rules that rely on solving specially designed LPs, hence making no assumption on the type of problem and only using polynomial-time algorithms. We describe an enhancement for carrying out these rules by performing a limited number of pivot operations on an LP, and then we provide insight that helps to make these rules even more efficient by either focusing on a smaller number of feasible solutions or by resorting to heuristics that limit the number of LPs solved.

A finite element model (FEM) of the Monument is developed and updated based on the dynamic characteristics of the structure identified through ambient vibration measurements. The calibrated model is used to study the behavior of the Monument during the 2011 Virginia earthquake. The FEM is modified to have nonlinear material properties to investigate the initiation and propagation of cracking, as well as any compressive crushing in the Monument's shaft during a future earthquake. The nonlinear FEM is subjected to two ensembles of site-compatible ground motions representing different seismic hazard levels for the Washington Monument, and the response used to investigate the probability of occurrence of several structural and nonstructural damage states.									0	0	0	0	0	0			8755-2930	1944-8201		WOS:000388626400022

One way to answer that question is to compare the energy return of a certain technology-i.e., how much energy is remaining after accounting for the amount of energy expended in the production and delivery process. Such energy return ratios (the most famous of which is energy return on investment (EROI)) fall within the field of net energy analysis (NEA), and provide an easy way to determine which technology is "better"; i.e., higher Energy Return Ratios (ERRs) are, certeris paribus, better than lower ERRs. Although useful as a broad measure of energy profitability, comparisons can also be misleading, particularly if the units being compared are different. For example, the energy content of electricity produced from a photovoltaic cell is different than the energy content of coal at the mine-mouth, yet these are often compared directly within the literature. These types of inconsistencies are common within the NEA literature. In this paper, we offer life cycle assessment (LCA) and the LCA methodology as a possible solution to the persistent methodological issues within the NEA community, and urge all NEA practitioners to adopt this methodology in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1996-1073			WOS:000388580000059

Despite of best efforts, research for the infection of the fungus has yielded equivocal and conflicting results about where and how the infection is initiated and developed. Here we show a stepwise infection pattern and sophisticated regulation during this process. Initial infection occurred on the filaments, which prevented the production of mature pollen thus blocked the pollination. In the following days, the pathogen invaded the stigmas and styles, occasionally the ovaries. Expression analysis indicated that the fungus mimicked a successful fertilization process and enabled the continuous supply of nutrients for fungus to produce false smut balls. The stepwise infection of flower organs and mimicry of ovary fertilization unveiled in this study guided the rice plant into supplying nutrients for false smut ball development and represents a new and unique biological process of host pathogen interactions.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1462-2912	1462-2920		WOS:000388614800018	27129414

A relevant example of problematic bacterial colonization within UV-inaccessible confines where chemical techniques have found only limited success is biofouling of feed channels in high-pressure membrane elements for water treatment. Herein we demonstrate a unique method of generating UV internally using embedded radioluminescent (RL) particles excited by an external X-ray source. We further show that the magnitude of the emitted UV intensity and required X-ray dose rates are likely within effective and practical ranges for future application to antibiofouling technology. Assessment of three Pr3+-activated RL phosphor candidates revealed LaPO4:Pr-3(+) to have the most favorable luminescence properties, achieving over 2-log inactivation of E. coli in a thin water film with a 74 Gy dose of 150 kVp X-rays. The effect of UVC RL resulted in a doubling of inactivation rates over X-ray irradiation alone. Further efforts targeting membrane applications, which included X-ray penetration modeling, RO membrane UVC tolerance, and economic analysis, suggested that UVC RL shows promise for application to bacteria control in seawater RO.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000386991100055	27740769

Research also shows that these differences have direct implications for software that aims to support users' problem-solving activities, and that much of this software is more supportive of problem-solving processes favored (statistically) more by males than by females. However, there is almost no work considering how software practitioners-such as User Experience (UX) professionals or software developers-can find gender-inclusiveness issues like these in their software. To address this gap, we devised the GenderMag method for evaluating problem-solving software from a gender-inclusiveness perspective. The method includes a set of faceted personas that bring five facets of gender difference research to life, and embeds use of the personas into a concrete process through a gender-specialized Cognitive Walkthrough. Our empirical results show that a variety of practitioners who design software-without needing any background in gender research-were able to use the GenderMag method to find gender-inclusiveness issues in problem-solving software. Our results also show that the issues the practitioners found were real and fixable. This work is the first systematic method to find gender-inclusiveness issues in software, so that practitioners can design and produce problem-solving software that is more usable by everyone.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0953-5438	1873-7951		WOS:000388596300004

Trend detection and identification in a better and refined manner are among the major current research topics in water resources domain. Even though different methodologies can be found for trend detection in literature, two well-known procedures are the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test and recently innovative-Aen trend method, which provides different aspects of the trend. The theoretical basis and application of these two methods are completely different. The MK test gives a holistic monotonic trend without any categorization of the time series into a set of clusters, but the innovative-Aen method is based on cluster and provides categorical trend behavior in a given time series. The main purpose of this paper is to provide important differences between these two approaches and their possible similarities. The applications of the two approaches are given for hydro-meteorological records including relative humidity, temperature, precipitation and runoff from Ergene drainage basin in the north-western part of Turkey. It is observed that although MK trend test does not show significant trend almost in all the cases, the innovative-Aen approach yields trend categorizations as "very low", "low", "medium" "high" and "very high", which should be taken into consideration in future flood ("very high") and drought ("very low") studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-4741	1573-1650		WOS:000388183900014

For these equations which do not satisfy an underlying maximum principle, sufficient conditions are given in terms of the coefficient functions, the computational grid and the discretization parameters to ensure that the nonnegativity property of the true solution is also satisfied by its approximation. Numerical examples are given which confirm the necessity and sufficiency of the discretization conditions to guarantee the nonnegativity of the approximation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Accurate reproduction of the physiologic flow waveforms at various anatomic locations is an important component of these experimental methods. This study discusses the design, construction, and testing of a low-cost and fully programmable pulsatile flow pump capable of continuously producing unlimited cycles of physiologic waveforms. It consists of a gear pump actuated by an AC servomotor and a feedback algorithm to achieve highly accurate reproduction of flow waveforms for flow rates up to 300 ml/s across a range of loading conditions. The iterative feedback algorithm uses the flow error values in one iteration to modify the motor control waveform for the next iteration to better match the desired flow. Within four to seven iterations of feedback, the pump replicated desired physiologic flow waveforms to within 2% normalized RMS error (for flow rates above 20 mL/s) under varying downstream impedances. This pump device is significantly more affordable (similar to 10% of the cost) than current commercial options. More importantly, the pump can be controlled via common scientific software and thus easily implemented into large automation frameworks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0148-0731	1528-8951		WOS:000388508700004		
J	Veettil, Anoop Valiya; Mishra, Ashok K.								Water security assessment using blue and green water footprint concepts								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY				542				589	602		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.09.032			NOV 2016	2016	The quantitative assessment of water security using the concept of blue and green water footprints can improve water resources management at local to regional scale. We developed an integrated modeling framework by considering both climatic and anthropogenic factors to investigate spatio-temporal variability of blue and green water availability and to quantify the water security in a river basin. The proposed modeling framework can be useful for providing an overview of the water security within the watershed and to identify water stress (hot spots) regions within the river basin. We applied Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to quantify the availability of fresh water (blue water and green water) in Savannah River Basin (SRB), USA. The anthropogenic factors (e.g., water demand) and Environmental Flow Requirement (EFR) information are incorporated to quantify the water security in terms of scarcity and vulnerability indices. A higher amount of blue water was observed for counties located in the upper part of SRB and higher green water flow was observed for counties that has the presence of intensive agriculture and large water bodies (e.g., reservoir). A time lag exists between the maximum rainfall during June-September and the maximum blue water observed in December-March. The study also analyzed the monthly variation of blue and green water flow for counties located in SRB. We expect that the water security assessment can provide useful information for understanding the emerging hot spots within a river basin (eco-system) due to the abstraction of water for human activities, such as irrigation, industrial use, energy production and domestic use.

Both spherical polystyrene beads and a commercial antacid are used to determine the effect of scattering particle size and shape on the results. Varying concentrations of the scattering agents were used to study the propagation of light in both minimally scattered and multiply scattered regimes (over 20 attenuation lengths). To study temporal dispersion, a custom diode seeded fiber amplified laser source is used to modulate beams up to 1 GHz, and diffractive spiral phase plates are used to compare performance over different spatial modes. We observe an increase in received signal with increasing OAM order (vertical bar m vertical bar = 0, 8, and 16) under multiple scattering conditions. Initial experimental results suggest that this variation is dependent on particle shape and size. We do not observe any dependency of OAM order on temporal dispersion.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-128X	2155-3165		WOS:000387101100004	27828256

Since the size of an MSP or the length of an LC corresponds to the communicational complexity of an LSSS, one main motivation to study MSPs or LCs is the lower bound for their sizes or lengths. Therefore, it is one of the most important open problems how to efficiently construct an MSP or LC for a given access structure Gamma with the smallest sizes or shortest length. Our contributions are: We extend TANG et al.'s result, showing that, for any given access structure Gamma, there exists an MSP or an LC to realize Gamma if and only if a system of quadratic equations has solutions; We utilize the relationship between LCs and MSPs to obtain the greatest lower bound on the row size and the column size of MSPs realizing a given Gamma, as well as an upper bound on the column size of MSPs; We give an algorithm to construct an MSP with the smallest sizes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1022-4653	2075-5597		WOS:000387735900001

The Effect of Personalization Provider Characteristics on Privacy Attitudes and Behaviors: An Elaboration Likelihood Model Approach								JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				67	11			2587	2606		10.1002/asi.23629			NOV 2016	2016	Many computer users today value personalization but perceive it in conflict with their desire for privacy. They therefore tend not to disclose data that would be useful for personalization. We investigate how characteristics of the personalization provider influence users' attitudes towards personalization and their resulting disclosure behavior. We propose an integrative model that links these characteristics via privacy attitudes to actual disclosure behavior. Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model, we discuss in what way the influence of the manipulated provider characteristics is different for users engaging in different levels of elaboration (represented by the user characteristics of privacy concerns and self-efficacy). We find particularly that (a) reputation management is effective when users predominantly use the peripheral route (i.e., a low level of elaboration), but much less so when they predominantly use the central route (i.e., a high level of elaboration); (b) client-side personalization has a positive impact when users use either route; and (c) personalization in the cloud does not work well in either route. Managers and designers can use our results to instill more favorable privacy attitudes and increase disclosure, using different techniques that depend on each user's levels of privacy concerns and privacy self-efficacy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2330-1635	2330-1643		WOS:000385777500002

This paper presents wind pressures around a cooling tower caused by a translating tornado-like vortex with two different swirl ratios at three different translational velocities. The translational motion is scaled so that the durations of tornado force on both prototype and model structures are identical. The effects of translational motion are studied by comparing the pressure characteristics caused by a translating tornado-like vortex with quasi-steady results obtained for stationary tornado-like vortices located in different radial locations relative to the cooling tower model. Results of the present study show that translational motion does not significantly influence the peak external and internal pressures, although peak pressures and forces decrease slightly with translational velocity. A peak pressure coefficient does not necessarily appear after the passage of a tornado. The running-window cross-correlation analyses show that the correlation is actually lower than that of stationary tornadoes, although greater correlation occurs if it is calculated by the traditional steady analysis method that includes the effects of pressure variation trend.

However, most of previous microarrayed synthetic polymers do not possess biological ligands (e.g., peptides) to directly engage cell surface receptors. Here, we report the development of peptide-functionalized hydrogel microarrays based on light-assisted copolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylates (PEGDA) and methacrylated-peptides. Using solid-phase peptide/organic synthesis, we developed an efficient route to synthesize methacrylated-peptides. In parallel, we identified PEG hydrogels that effectively inhibit non-specific cell adhesion by using PEGDA-700 (M. W. = 700) as a monomer. The combined use of these chemistries enables the development of a powerful platform to prepare peptide-functionalized PEG hydrogel microarrays. Additionally, we identified a linker composed of 4 glycines to ensure sufficient exposure of the peptide moieties from hydrogel surfaces. Further, we used this system to directly compare cell adhesion abilities of several related RGD peptides: RGD, RGDS, RGDSG and RGDSP. Finally, we combined the peptide-functionalized hydrogel technology with bioinformatics to construct a library composed of 12 different RGD peptides, including 6 unexplored RGD peptides, to develop culture substrates for hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), a cell type known for poor adhesion to synthetic substrates. 2 out of 6 unexplored RGD peptides showed substantial activities to support hiPSC-CMs. Among them, PMQKMRGDVESP from laminin beta 4 subunit was found to support the highest adhesion and sarcomere formation of hiPSC-CMs. With bioinformatics, the peptide-functionalized hydrogel microarrays accelerate the discovery of novel biological ligands to develop biomaterials for stem cell and tissue engineering applications.Statement of SignificanceIn this manuscript, we described the development of a robust approach to prepare peptide-functionalized synthetic hydrogel microarrays. Combined with bioinformatics, this technology enables us to rapidly identify novel biological ligands for the development of the next generation of functional biomaterials for stem cell and tissue engineering applications.

For a graph F, we define the F-upper chromatic number of G as the maximum number of colors that can be used to color the vertices of G such that there is no rainbow copy of F. We present some results on this parameter for certain graph classes. The focus is on the case that F is a star or triangle. For example, we show that the K-3-upper chromatic number of any maximal outerplanar graph on n vertices is [n/2] + 1.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1234-3099	2083-5892		WOS:000387549300016

J	Montone, Verona O.; Fraisse, Clyde W.; Peres, Natalia A.; Sentelhas, Paulo C.; Gleason, Mark; Ellis, Michael; Schnabel, Guido								Evaluation of leaf wetness duration models for operational use in strawberry disease-warning systems in four US states								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY				60	11			1761	1774		10.1007/s00484-016-1165-4			NOV 2016	2016	Leaf wetness duration (LWD) plays a key role in disease development and is often used as an input in disease-warning systems. LWD is often estimated using mathematical models, since measurement by sensors is rarely available and/or reliable. A strawberry disease-warning system called "Strawberry Advisory System" (SAS) is used by growers in Florida, USA, in deciding when to spray their strawberry fields to control anthracnose and Botrytis fruit rot. Currently, SAS is implemented at six locations, where reliable LWD sensors are deployed. A robust LWD model would facilitate SAS expansion from Florida to other regions where reliable LW sensors are not available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of mathematical models to estimate LWD and time of spray recommendations in comparison to on site LWD measurements. Specific objectives were to (i) compare model estimated and observed LWD and resulting differences in timing and number of fungicide spray recommendations, (ii) evaluate the effects of weather station sensors precision on LWD models performance, and (iii) compare LWD models performance across four states in the USA. The LWD models evaluated were the classification and regression tree (CART), dew point depression (DPD), number of hours with relative humidity equal or greater than 90 % (NHRH aeyen90 %), and Penman-Monteith (P-M). P-M model was expected to have the lowest errors, since it is a physically based and thus portable model. Indeed, the P-M model estimated LWD most accurately (MAE < 2 h) at a weather station with high precision sensors but was the least accurate when lower precision sensors of relative humidity and estimated net radiation (based on solar radiation and temperature) were used (MAE = 3.7 h). The CART model was the most robust for estimating LWD and for advising growers on fungicide-spray timing for anthracnose and Botrytis fruit rot control and is therefore the model we recommend for expanding the strawberry disease warning beyond Florida, to other locations where weather stations may be deployed with lower precision sensors, and net radiation observations are not available.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-7128	1432-1254		WOS:000387273200013	27180263

Effects of Bite Count Feedback from a Wearable Device and Goal Setting on Consumption in Young Adults								JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS				116	11			1785	1793		10.1016/j.jand.2016.05.004			NOV 2016	2016	Background New technologies are emerging that may help individuals engage in healthier eating behaviors. One paradigm to test the efficacy of a technology is to determine its effect relative to environment cues that are known to cause individuals to overeat.Objective The purpose of this work was to independently investigate two questions: How does the presence of a technology that provides bite count feedback alter eating behavior? and, How does the presence of a technology that provides bite count feedback paired with a goal alter eating behavior?Design Two studies investigated these research questions. The first study tested the effects of a large and small plate crossed with the presence or absence of a device that provided bite count feedback on intake. The second study tested the effects of a bite count goal with bite count feedback, again crossed with plate size, on intake. Both studies used a 2x2 between-subjects design.Participants/setting In the first study, 94 subjects (62 women aged 19.0 +/- 1.6 years with body mass index [BMI] 23.04 +/- 3.6) consumed lunch in a laboratory. The second study examined 99 subjects (56 women aged 18.5 +/- 1.5 years with BMI 22.73 +/- 2.70) under the same conditions.Intervention In both studies subjects consumed a single-course meal, using either a small or large plate. In the first study participants either wore or did not wear an automated bite counting device. In the second study all participants wore the bite counting device and were given either a low bite count goal (12 bites) or a high bite count goal (22 bites).Statistical analyses Effect of plate size, feedback, and goal on consumption (grams) and number of bites taken were assessed using 2 x 2 analyses of variance. As adjunct measures, the effects of serving size, bite size (grams per bite), postmeal satiety, and satiety change were also assessed.Results In the first study there was a main effect of plate size on grams consumed and number of bites taken such that eating from a large plate led to greater consumption (P=0.001) and a greater number of bites (P=0.001). There was also a main effect of feedback on consumption and number of bites taken such that those who received feedback consumed less (P=0.011) and took fewer bites (P<0.001). In the second study there was a main effect of plate size on consumption such that those eating from a large plate consumed more (P=0.003) but did not take more bites. Further analysis revealed a main effect of goal on number of bites taken such that those who received the low goal took fewer bites (P<0.001) but did not consume less.Conclusions Providing feedback on the number of bites taken from a wearable intake monitor can reduce overall intake during a single meal. Regarding the first research question, providing feedback significantly reduced intake in both plate size groups and reduced the overall number of bites taken. Regarding the second research question, participants were successful in eating to their goals. However, individuals in the low goal condition appeared to compensate for the restricted goal by taking larger bites, leading to comparable levels of consumption between the low and high goal groups. Hence, the interaction of technology with goals should be considered when introducing a health intervention.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2212-2672	2212-2680		WOS:000387203000008	27346460

Correlates and Reasons for Mental Health Treatment Dropout Among Active Duty Soldiers								PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES				13	4			356	363		10.1037/ser0000082			NOV 2016	2016	Many soldiers who seek treatment for mental health problems drop out of treatment before it is complete. The present study examined factors that are associated with dropout among active duty soldiers. Soldiers who had sought treatment (N = 260) responded to measures of beliefs about mental health treatment, mental health symptoms, treatment- seeking behaviors, and treatment dropout. Fifty- seven soldiers reported dropping out before treatment was completed. Commonly endorsed reasons for dropout were that soldiers were too busy with work and a preference to handle the symptoms oneself. A series of logistic regressions revealed that depression symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07), functional impairment (OR = 1.49), career stigma (OR = 1.70), differential treatment stigma (OR = 1.62), practical barriers (OR = 1.76), negative beliefs about treatment (OR = 1.98), and self- reliance (OR = 1.78) were associated with an increased likelihood of dropout. Positive beliefs about treatment were associated with a decreased likelihood of dropout (OR = 0.60). Functional impairment, career stigma, and self- reliance remained unique predictors in a final forward conditional regression. These findings highlight the need for interventions to support service members in treatment by educating them on the benefits of treatment and reducing practical barriers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1541-1559	1939-148X		WOS:000387244600004	27077392

The aim of this study was to develop a tissue-engineered mitral valve scaffold possessing appropriate composition and structure to ensure ideal characteristics of mitral valves, such as large orifice, rapid opening and closure, maintenance of mitral annulus-papillary muscle continuity, in vivo biocompatibility and extended durability. An extracellular matrix-based scaffold was generated, based on the native porcine mitral valve as starting material and a technique for porcine cell removal without causing damage to the matrix components. To stabilize these structures and slow down their degradation, acellular scaffolds were treated with penta-galloyl glucose (PGG), a well-characterized polyphenol with high affinity for collagen and elastin. Biaxial mechanical testing presented similar characteristics for the PGG-treated scaffolds compared to fresh tissues. The extracellular matrix components, crucial for maintaining the valve shape and function, were well preserved in leaflets, and in chordae, as shown by their resistance to collagenase and elastin. When extracted with strong detergents, the PGG-treated scaffolds released a reduced amount of soluble matrix peptides, compared to untreated scaffolds; this correlated with diminished activation of fibroblasts seeded on scaffolds treated with PGG. Cell-seeded scaffolds conditioned for 5 weeks in a valve bioreactor showed good cell viability. Finally, rat subdermal implantation studies showed that PGG-treated mitral valve scaffolds were biocompatible, nonimmunogenic, noninflammatory, and noncalcifying. In conclusion, a biocompatible mitral valve scaffold was developed, which preserved the biochemical composition and structural integrity of the valve, essential for its highly dynamic mechanical demands, and its biologic durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1937-3341	1937-335X		WOS:000387208200001	27608885

This seems to be particularly true for individuals seeking to modify chronic health conditions like weight loss, obesity, and obesity-related diseases. Purpose: This study explores whether watching Dr. Oz weight loss episodes influences a viewer's health behaviors around obesity and weight loss. Methods: Changes in lifestyle habits were evaluated with pre- and post-wellness surveys. Dependent t tests were used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in the self-reported behaviors of the control and Dr. Oz group before and after the study time period. Results: Preintervention and postintervention surveys suggest that health television shows were not likely to influence health behaviors for most of the participants. A statistically significant result from one of the survey questions demonstrates the need for an expanded study with a more generalizable population. Discussion: Results reveal the need for health professionals to better understand where patients receive health information and how information received from social media sources is utilized. Translation to Health Education Practice: Social media may be a useful device for health promotion by practitioners to reach their patients.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-5037	2168-3751		WOS:000386624200005

One set of such critical faults in Li-ion batteries are thermal faults which can be potentially catastrophic. In this paper, a diagnostic algorithm is presented that diagnoses thermal faults in Lithium-ion batteries. The algorithm is based on a two-state thermal model describing the dynamics of the surface and the core temperature of a battery cell. The residual signals for fault detection are generated by nonlinear observers with measured surface temperature and a reconstructed core temperature feedback. Furthermore, an adaptive threshold generator is designed to suppress the effect of modelling uncertainties. The residuals are then compared with these adaptive thresholds to evaluate the occurrence of faults. Simulation and experimental studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lotfi, Nima; Zomorodi, Hesam; Landers, Robert G.								Active disturbance rejection control for voltage stabilization in open-cathode fuel cells through temperature regulation								CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE				56				92	100		10.1016/j.conengprac.2016.08.006			NOV 2016	2016	Temperature regulation is an important control challenge in open-cathode fuel cell systems. In this paper, a feedback controller, combined with a novel output-injection observer, is designed and implemented for fuel cell stack temperature control. The first functionality of the observer is to smooth the noisy temperature measurements. To this end, the observer gain is calculated based on Kalman filter theory which, in turn, results in a robust temperature estimation despite temperature model uncertainties and measurement noise. Furthermore, the observer is capable of estimating the output voltage model uncertainties. It is shown that temperature control not only ensures the fuel cell temperature reference is properly tracked, but, along with the uncertainty estimator, can also be used to stabilize the output voltage. Voltage regulation is of great importance for open-cathode fuel cells, which typically suffer from gradual voltage decay over time due to their dead-end anode operation. Moreover, voltage control ensures predictable and fixed fuel cell output voltages for given current values, even in the presence of disturbances. The observer stability is proved using Lyapunov theory, and the observer's effectiveness in combination with the controller is validated experimentally. The results show promising controller performances in regulating fuel cell temperature and voltage in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Four fold sensitivity enhancement for NH3 is demonstrated after Pt nanoparticle functionalization of graphene/p-Si Schottky diode sensor, and the response is also orders of magnitude higher compared to functionalized graphene chemiresistor. Experimentally obtained impedance spectra were modeled utilizing an equivalent circuit for both sensor types, and the junction resistance and capacitance were extracted for various gaseous analytes exposure. Variations in junction resistance, capacitance and 3-dB cut-off frequency plotted in three-dimensional (3D) enables extraction of unique signatures for various analyte gases.

Content Analysis of Vomit and Diarrhea Cleanup Procedures To Prevent Norovirus Infections in Retail and Food Service Operations								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				79	11			1946	1952		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-196			NOV 2016	2016	Human noroviruses are the leading cause of foodborne disease in the United States, sickening 19 to 21 million Americans each year. Vomit and diarrhea are both highly concentrated sources of norovirus particles. For this reason, establishing appropriate cleanup procedures for these two substances is critical. Food service establishments in states that have adopted the 2009 or 2013 U.S. Food and Drug Administration Food Code are required to have a program detailing specific cleanup procedures. The aim of our study was to determine the alignment of existing vomit and diarrhea cleanup procedures with the 11 elements recommended in Annex 3 of the 2011 Supplement to the 2009 Food Code and to determine their readability and clarity of presentation. In July 2015, we located vomit and diarrhea cleanup procedures by asking Norovirus Collaborative for Outreach, Research, and Education stakeholders for procedures used by their constituency groups and by conducting a Google Advanced Search of the World Wide Web. We performed content analysis to determine alignment with the recommendations in Annex 3. Readability and clarity of presentation were also assessed. A total of 38 artifacts were analyzed. The mean alignment score was 7.0 +/- 1.7 of 11 points; the mean clarity score was 6.7 +/- 2.5 of 17 points. Only nine artifacts were classified as high clarity, high alignment. Vomit and diarrhea cleanup procedures should align with Annex 3 in the Food Code and should, as well, be clearly presented; yet, none of the artifacts completely met both conditions. To reduce the spread of norovirus infections in food service establishments, editable guidelines are needed that are aligned with Annex 3 and are clearly written, into which authors could insert their facility-specific information.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000387094400017	28221908

Responses were analyzed to evaluate seven domains: knowledge of duty hours; opinions about duty hours; attitudes regarding shift work; patient safety concerns; and the effects of DHRs on continuity of care, on resident training, and on resident professionalism.Results:Respondents felt that fatigue was unsafe and duty hours were beneficial in preventing resident physician fatigue. They supported the idea of residents working in shifts but did not support shifts for attending physicians. However, respondents wanted the same resident to provide continuity of care, even if that violated DHRs. They were supportive of increasing the length of residency to complete training. DHRs were not believed to affect professionalism. Half of the respondents believed that patient opinion should influence policy on this topic.Discussion:Orthopaedic patients and those likely to require orthopaedic care have inconsistent opinions regarding DHRs, making it potentially difficult to incorporate their preferences into policy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1067-151X	1940-5480		WOS:000386978100012	27661392

The nature of this variation can be revealed by studying the tips of an ongoing adaptive radiation. We studied genomic variation at the tips of the Darwin's finch radiation; specifically focusing on polymorphism within, and variation among, three sympatric species of the genus Geospiza. Using restriction site-associated DNA (RAD-seq), we characterized 32 569 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from which 11 outlier SNPs for beak and body size were uncovered by a genomewide association study (GWAS). Principal component analysis revealed that these 11 SNPs formed four statistically linked groups. Stepwise regression then revealed that the first PC score, which included 6 of the 11 top SNPs, explained over 80% of the variation in beak size, suggesting that selection on these traits influences multiple correlated loci. The two SNPs most strongly associated with beak size were near genes associated with beak morphology across deeper branches of the radiation: delta-like 1 homologue (DLK1) and high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2). Our results suggest that (i) key adaptive traits are associated with a small fraction of the genome (11 of 32 569 SNPs), (ii) SNPs linked to the candidate genes are dispersed throughout the genome (on several chromosomes), and (iii) micro-and macro-evolutionary variation (roots and tips of the radiation) involve some shared and some unique genomic regions.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000386353200003	27363308

Design and analysis of retaining wall backfilled with shredded tire and subjected to earthquake shaking								SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING				90				227	239		10.1016/j.soildyn.2016.08.034			NOV 2016	2016	The applicability of shredded tire as an economical alternative for conventional granular soil backfill for retaining walls was investigated by conducting geotechnical and structural designs as well as finite element simulations. A literature survey was conducted to compile and document the engineering properties of shredded tire. It was found that the key geotechnical engineering properties vary significantly with shred size and shredding method. Then, a gravity-cantilever retaining wall was designed for dynamic loading conditions considering seismic design parameters corresponding to the Charleston, SC area. Geotechnical design revealed a longer toe compared to heel for shredded tire backfill to maintain stability; however, a shorter footing was needed to maintain overall stability compared to that of granular backfill. Conventional designs and finite element simulations showed significant reductions in computed horizontal deflection at the tip of the wall, structural demand in terms of maximum shear force and bending moment, and construction cost in terms of excavation and material when shredded tire was used as the backfill. Upper and lower bound curves of maximum shear force and maximum bending moment in the stem were also produced based on the results of parametric studies conducted by varying the friction angle and cohesion of shredded tire, and the amplitude and mean period of the input motion.

J	Mobley, Catherine								What Matters When Explaining Environmentalism at the Watershed Level: Who You Are, Where You Live, What You See, or What You Perceive?								ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR				48	9			1148	1174		10.1177/0013916515586058			NOV 2016	2016	This research was conducted in the southeastern United States, one of the most rapidly developing regions in the country. The study included two sets of predictor variables: environmental experiences and perceptions (i.e., observation of pollution and assessment of pollution's impact) and residential factors (i.e., rural vs. urban residence and upstream vs. downstream watershed location); sociodemographic characteristics served as control variables. Sequential regression was performed on survey data of watershed residents to isolate the predictors of environmentalism. Observation of pollution and assessment of pollution's impact on water quality were most important for explaining environmental concern, self-reported household-based behaviors, and self-reported likelihood of engaging in water quality improvement efforts. The sociodemographic variables were also significant predictors; the residential variables had limited influence on the dependent variables. These results indicate that stormwater educators should account for experiential factors and perceptions of pollution when designing strategies for encouraging environmentalism.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-9165	1552-390X		WOS:000386040100003

An Exact Solution for the Ground-level Gamma Dose Rate from a Spherical Gaussian Puff								HEALTH PHYSICS				111	5			403	409		10.1097/HP.0000000000000567			NOV 2016	2016	Analytical solutions of the absorbed dose rate integral for a spherically symmetric Gaussian puff were developed for both linear and Berger buildup approximations. Mathematically simpler solutions were also developed for the absorbed dose rate at the center of the puff. These solutions are valid for a ground-level receptor and both ground-level and elevated spherical puffs. Graphical solutions allow estimates of the ratio of the absorbed dose rate due to a puff to the absorbed dose rate for an infinite cloud with concentration equal to the maximum concentration at the center of the puff. Calculations also give the ratio of the absorbed dose rate integral due to photons from Compton scattering and secondary photons, assuming Berger buildup, to the absorbed dose rate integral using linear buildup for ranges of the Berger b parameter reported for air.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0017-9078	1538-5159		WOS:000386220500001	27682898

Electroluminescent Materials Can Further Enhance the Nighttime Conspicuity of Pedestrians Wearing Retroreflective Materials								HUMAN FACTORS				58	7			976	985		10.1177/0018720816651535			NOV 2016	2016	Objective: We investigated the nighttime conspicuity benefits of adding electroluminescent (EL) panels to pedestrian clothing that contains retroreflective elements.Background: Researchers have repeatedly documented that pedestrians are too often not sufficiently conspicuous to drivers at night and that retroreflective materials can enhance the conspicuity of pedestrians. However, because retroreflective elements in clothing are effective only when they are illuminated by the headlamps of an approaching driver, they are not useful for pedestrians who are positioned outside the beam pattern of an approaching vehicle's headlamps. Electroluminescent materialsflexible luminous panels that can be attached to clothinghave the potential to be well suited for these conditions.Method: Using an open-road course at night, we compared the distances at which observers responded to pedestrians who were positioned at one of three lateral positions (relative to the vehicle's path) wearing one of two high-visibility garments.Results: The garment that included both EL and retroreflective materials yielded longer response distances than the retroreflective-only garment. This effect was particularly strong when the test pedestrian was positioned farthest outside of the area illuminated by headlamps.Conclusion: These findings suggest that EL materials can further enhance the conspicuity of pedestrians who are wearing retroreflective materials.Application: EL materials can be applied to garments. They may be especially valuable to enhance the conspicuity of roadway workers, emergency responders, and traffic control officers.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-7208	1547-8181		WOS:000385937200002	27198899

Auditory Attention and Comprehension During a Simulated Night Shift: Effects of Task Characteristics								HUMAN FACTORS				58	7			1031	1043		10.1177/0018720816654377			NOV 2016	2016	Objective: The current study investigated performance on a dual auditory task during a simulated night shift.Background: Night shifts and sleep deprivation negatively affect performance on vigilance-based tasks, but less is known about the effects on complex tasks. Because language processing is necessary for successful work performance, it is important to understand how it is affected by night work and sleep deprivation.Method: Sixty-two participants completed a simulated night shift resulting in 28 hr of total sleep deprivation. Performance on a vigilance task and a dual auditory language task was examined across four testing sessions.Results: The results indicate that working at night negatively impacts vigilance, auditory attention, and comprehension. The effects on the auditory task varied based on the content of the auditory material. When the material was interesting and easy, the participants performed better. Night work had a greater negative effect when the auditory material was less interesting and more difficult.Conclusion: These findings support research that vigilance decreases during the night. The results suggest that auditory comprehension suffers when individuals are required to work at night. Maintaining attention and controlling effort especially on passages that are less interesting or more difficult could improve performance during night shifts.Application: The results from the current study apply to many work environments where decision making is necessary in response to complex auditory information. Better predicting the effects of night work on language processing is important for developing improved means of coping with shiftwork.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-7208	1547-8181		WOS:000385937200006	27307380

A censorship-resistant web browsing system must be scalable, blocking resistant, and tracing resistant. However, current censorship-resistant web browsing systems, which use a group of dedicated proxies to bypass censorship, fail to meet these requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose Freeweb, which relies on widely-distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) nodes in a decentralized manner rather than specified proxies in a centralized manner. We also proposed enhancement methods to reduce file access delay and avoid node overloads in Freeweb. Freeweb is built on top of a Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based P2P network, where nodes not under censorship help nodes under censorship to access blocked webpages. Freeweb has a web browser front-end whose user interface resembles existing web browsers. The underlying complex process of retrieving blocked webpages is therefore hidden from users. We implemented an open-sourced Freeweb and conducted extensive real-world experiments on PlanetLab. The experimental results show that Freeweb has a high success rate and reasonable browsing latency, and its enhancement reduces much network load and file access latency, and avoids node overloads.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000386247000011

The effects of chemical treatments on GPWC were examined through combination of chemical composition followed by enzymatic hydrolysis (using Accellerase((R)) 1500). The application of EHOs treatment removes the foaming issue that currently occurs due to AHP treatment at the elevated temperature. A removal of the foaming phenomenon increased the enzymatic glucan conversion (>70%) which is important in increasing the efficiency of biorefinery. The interaction of different variables in EHOs solvent formulations including ethanol concentration (0-60%), potassium hydroxide concentration (0-50 g L-1), hydrogen peroxide concentration (0-50 g L-1), and processing temperature (38 degrees-78 degrees C) were analyzed through four variables response surface methodology using glucan conversion and total polysaccharide conversion as responses. The glucan conversion and total polysaccharide conversion were analyzed to determine the specific and overall effects of Accellerase((R)) 1500 on the amorphous polysaccharide contents of GPWC resulted through EHOs treatment formulations, respectively. The implications of all these findings are discussed with the available literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0961-9534	1873-2909		WOS:000385330600015

For example, a current sensor fault leads to erroneous estimates of state of charge and other parameters, which in turn affects the control actions in the BMS. A temperature sensor fault may lead to ineffective thermal management. In this brief, a model-based diagnostic scheme is presented that uses sliding mode observers designed based on the electrical and thermal dynamics of the battery. It is analytically shown how the extraction of the equivalent output error injection signals on the sliding manifolds enables the detection, the isolation, as well as the estimation of the temperature, voltage, and current sensor faults. This brief includes simulation and experimental studies to demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Leaching studies of the PS and PVT resins with methyl acetate show a 60 % reduction in luminosity and 80 % reduction in detection efficiency for alpha-NPO samples; while v-NPO resins retained detection properties. Degradation studies indicate the nitration of PS resins and the fluors after nitric acid exposure, resulting in a 100 % reduction in optical properties; whereas PVT resins with v-NPO fluor maintained 20 % detection efficiency.

Evaluation of first generation synthetic cannabinoids on binding at non-cannabinoid receptors and in a battery of in vivo assays in mice								NEUROPHARMACOLOGY				110				143	153		10.1016/j.neuropharm.2016.07.016			NOV 2016	2016	Anecdotal reports suggest that abused synthetic cannabinoids produce cannabis-like "highs," but some of their effects may also differ from traditional cannabinoids such as Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This study examined the binding affinities of first-generation indole-derived synthetic cannabinoids at cannabinoid and noncannabinoid receptors and their effects in a functional observational battery (FOB) and drug discrimination in mice. All seven compounds, except JWH-391, had favorable affinity (<= 159 nM) for both cannabinoid receptors. In contrast, binding at noncannabinoid receptors was absent or weak. In the FOB, THC and the six active compounds disrupted behaviors in CNS activation and muscle tone/equilibrium domains. Unlike THC, however, synthetic cannabinoids impaired behavior across a wider dose and domain range, producing autonomic effects and signs of CNS excitability and sensorimotor reactivity. In addition, mice acquired JWH-018 discrimination, and THC and JWH-073 produced full substitution whereas the 5-HT2B antagonist mianserin did not substitute in mice trained to discriminate JWH-018 or THC. Urinary metabolite analysis showed that the compounds were extensively metabolized, with metabolites that could contribute to their in vivo effects. Together, these results show that, while first-generation synthetic cannabinoids shared some effects that were similar to those of THC, they also possessed effects that differed from traditional cannabinoids. The high nanomolar (or absent) affinities of these compounds at receptors for most major neurotransmitters suggests that these divergent effects may be related to the greater potencies and/or efficacies at CB1 receptors; however, action(s) at noncannabinoid receptors yet to be assessed or via different signaling pathways cannot be ruled out.

Ward								Characterization of Colletotrichum Species Causing Bitter Rot of Apple in Kentucky Orchards								PLANT DISEASE				100	11			2194	2203		10.1094/PDIS-10-15-1144-RE			NOV 2016	2016	Multiple species of Colletotrichum can cause bitter rot disease of apple, but the identities and relative representation of the species causing the disease in Kentucky are unknown. In total, 475 Colletotrichum isolates were collected from diseased apple fruit in 25 counties and characterized both morphologically and by using various molecular approaches. Multigene sequence analyses revealed that sample isolates belonged to several newly erected species within the Colletotrichum acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes. The isolates were identified as C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae, which reside within the C. acutatum species complex, and C. siamense, C. theobromicola, and C. fructicola, which are placed within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. C. fioriniae was the most common species causing bitter rot in Kentucky, comprising more than 70% of the isolates. Infectivity tests on detached fruit showed that C. gloeosporioides species-complex isolates were more aggressive than isolates in the C. acutatum species complex. However, isolates within the C. acutatum species complex produced more spores on lesions compared with isolates within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Aggressiveness varied among individual species within a species complex. C. siamense was the most aggressive species identified in this study. Within the C. acutatum species complex, C. fioriniae was more aggressive than C. nymphaeae, causing larger, deeper lesions. Apple cultivar did not have a significant effect on lesion development. However, Colletotrichum spp. produced more spores on 'Red Stayman Wine sap' than on 'Golden Delicious'. Fungicide sensitivity tests revealed that the C. acutatum species complex was more tolerant to thiophanate-methyl, myclobutanil, trifloxystrobin, and captan compared with the C. gloeosporioides species complex. The study also revealed that mycelial growth of C. siamense was more sensitive to tested fungicides compared with C. fructicola and C. theobromicola. These research findings emphasize the importance of accurate identification of Colletotrichum spp. within each species complex, because they exhibit differences in pathogenicity and fungicide sensitivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000385608800002

Parametric investigation of two aerosol scavenging models in the inertial regime								JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE				101				34	42		10.1016/j.jaerosci.2016.07.011			NOV 2016	2016	Models of drop scavenging of aerosols via inertial impaction proposed by Slinn and by Calvert are compared with published experimental measurements to determine which model is a better predictor of the data. Additionally, a parametric study was performed on the residual of the model predictions from the measurements to identify dimensionless groups not included in these models, which might increase model performance. The study found that the Calvert model predicts scavenging in the inertial regime with less error than the Slinn model. The study also found that two dimensionless groups, the relative Stokes number, Stk(r), and the drop Reynolds number, Re-D, are both well correlated with the residual of these models. They are included in modified versions of both of these models to provide better performance. That these two dimensionless groups improve model performance suggests that an inertial mechanism and an advective mechanism not accounted for in the existing models play some role in aerosol scavenging in the inertial regime.

Joseph								Half-Heusler Alloys for Efficient Thermoelectric Power Conversion								JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS				45	11			5554	5560		10.1007/s11664-016-4810-0			NOV 2016	2016	Half-Heusler (HH) phases (space group F43m, Cl-b) are increasingly gaining attention as promising thermoelectric materials in view of their thermal stability and environmental benignity as well as efficient power output. Until recently, the verifiable dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of HH phases has remained moderate near 1, which limits the power conversion efficiency of these materials. We report herein ZT similar to 1.3 in n-type (Hf,Zr)NiSn alloys near 850 K developed through elemental substitution and simultaneous embedment of nanoparticles in the HH matrix, obtained by annealing the samples close to their melting temperatures. Introduction of mass fluctuation and scattering centers play a key role in the high ZT measured, as shown by the reduction of thermal conductivity and increase of thermopower. Based on computation, the power conversion efficiency of a n-p couple module based on the new n-type (Hf,Zr,Ti)NiSn particles-in-matrix composite and recently reported high-ZT p-type HH phases is expected to reach 13%, comparable to that of state-of-the-art materials, but with the mentioned additional materials and environmental attributes. Since the high efficiency is obtained without tuning the microstructure of the HH phases, it leaves room for further optimization.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000385021300009

In this paper, we used mullite films prepared from the monophasic sol-gel precursors as an example system to study the effects of polymer additives on the coating's critical thickness. The mullite and mullite-polymer hybrid gels demonstrated monophasic characteristics, enabling low-temperature processing of nanocrystalline, phase-pure mullite films at 1000 A degrees C. The cracking in the films was only observed at the temperatures below 400 A degrees C. Increasing film thickness caused a decrease in the cracking onset temperature. Adding polymers, such as PVP, PEO, and PVA, in the precursor increased the critical thickness. We demonstrated that the reasons of the crack prevention caused by the polymer additives were because they not only slowed down the sol-gel polycondensation process, but also relaxed the stresses during heat treatment. The polymer decomposing in a wider temperature range had a greater critical thickness. The polymer additives also showed optimal concentrations in improving the critical thicknesses. Dense, crack-free, and phase-pure mullite films with thickness up to 450 nm were achieved after firing at 1000 A degrees C.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000385179800005

Unfortunately, empirical research concerning the potential implications of this practice is extremely limited. We address the use of social media for selection by examining how recruiter ratings of Facebook profiles fare with respect to two important criteria on which selection procedures are evaluated: criterion-related validity and subgroup differences (which can lead to adverse impact). We captured Facebook profiles of college students who were applying for full-time jobs, and recruiters from various organizations reviewed the profiles and provided evaluations. We then followed up with applicants in their new jobs. Recruiter ratings of applicants' Facebook information were unrelated to supervisor ratings of job performance (rs = -.13 to -.04), turnover intentions (rs = -.05 to .00), and actual turnover (rs = -.01 to .01). In addition, Facebook ratings did not contribute to the prediction of these criteria beyond more traditional predictors, including cognitive ability, self-efficacy, and personality. Furthermore, there was evidence of subgroup difference in Facebook ratings that tended to favor female and White applicants. The overall results suggest that organizations should be very cautious about using social media information such as Facebook to assess job applicants.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0149-2063	1557-1211		WOS:000384829800003

Balanced, non-contiguous partitioning of power systems considering operational constraints								ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				140				456	463		10.1016/j.epsr.2016.06.001			NOV 2016	2016	This paper presents an integer programming based partitioning of dynamic graphs that arise in power systems. The proposed approach allows for explicitly expressing power systems operational constraints in the partitioning algorithm. Balanced, non-contiguous graphs appear in several power systems applications such as network partitioning for high performance computing based parallel transient simulators and in wide area control. Quality of partition obtained using the developed algorithm compares favorably with a well known multi-level graph partitioning approach - METIS. Several test systems, ranging from a 9 bus test system to the 2383 bus western polish test system is used to demonstrate the applicability of proposed approach for power system partitioning problems. In addition, applicability of the proposed approach for a non-stationary system such as power networks is demonstrated by partitioning in real-time. Real-time in this context is defined as the interval between two dispatches as the edge weights of the dynamic graph is expected to change at every dispatch. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Factors influencing herpetofaunal assemblages of aquatic systems in a managed pine forest								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				379				124	132		10.1016/j.foreco.2016.08.012			NOV 1 2016	2016	Although >12 million ha of southeastern United States are intensively managed pine forest, we have little understanding of biological contributions of aquatic systems embedded in pine plantations. Further, the influence surrounding forest stand structure on assemblages of wetland-associated species in managed forests are poorly understood. To address these gaps, we investigated herpetofaunal assemblages across three ephemeral aquatic system types [unaltered sites (n = 16), altered sites (n = 18), and roadside ditches (n = 19)] embedded in an intensively managed pine landscape in eastern North Carolina, USA. These aquatic systems varied in their disturbance intensity and landscape context. Unaltered sites were avoided by silvicultural activities (set aside), altered sites were actively managed as part of the surrounding plantation, and ditches received maintenance as part of routine forest management. We examined amphibian and reptile species richness and assemblage composition at 53 aquatic sites surrounded by early-, middle-, or late-rotation aged pine plantations. During January-July 2013 and January-June 2014, we detected 34 amphibian and reptile species with visual encounter, dipnet, and call surveys at aquatic sites. We estimated species richness and used Analysis of Similarity to assess differences in species richness and assemblage structure by aquatic system type and stand age class. Amphibian species richness was greatest in unaltered and altered sites but was similar among stand age classes. Reptile species richness was similar among aquatic system types and stand age classes. Analysis of Similarity results revealed that amphibian assemblages were similar among stand age classes but were significantly different among all aquatic systems. Reptile assemblages also were similar among stand age classes but differed between altered sites and roadside ditches. Differences between richness and assemblage results may have been related to low detections of reptiles because our non-metric multi-dimensional scaling analysis, which only included species with >1 detection, revealed less obvious differences among reptile assemblages by aquatic system type. Despite dramatic variation in disturbance intensity and site-level environmental metrics, we did not find distinct herpetofaunal assemblages among aquatic system types or stand age classes. Our results suggest that aquatic systems in reconfigured landscapes not only support a range of herpetofaunal species, but that amphibian and reptile assemblages are similar across system types.

MOFs are porous crystalline solids comprised of metal nodes linked by organic molecules. Recently, they have been successfully grown around metal nanoparticle catalysts. The resulting "porous networks have been shown to promote regioselective chemistry, i.e., hydrogenation of trans-1,3-hexadiene to 3-hexene, presumably by forcing the linear alkene to stand "upright" on the catalyst surface and allowing only the terminal C-H bonds to be activated. In this work, we extend this concept to alkane oxidation. Our goal is to determine if a MOF-encapsulated catalyst could be used to selectively produce 1-butanol. Reaction energies and activation barriers are presented for more than 40 reactions in" the pathway for n-butane oxidation. We find that C-H bond activation proceeds through an oxygen-assisted pathway and that butanal and 1-butanol are some of the possible products. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Comparing soil carbon estimates in glaciated soils at a farm scale using geospatial analysis of field and SSURGO data								GEODERMA				281				119	126		10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.06.029			NOV 1 2016	2016	Soil carbon is a key soil property related to ecosystem services and it is often used in soil carbon content estimates at various scales. Uncertainties in soil carbon estimates often arise from variability in field, laboratory, and/or geospatial data at a farm scale. The objectives of this study were to quantify and compare levels of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TC) for a 147-hectare field site in upstate New York based on three alternative analysis procedures: a) using carbon concentrations reported by the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) spatial databases for each soil map unit (SMU) present at the field site and applying that value across each SMU; b) averaging the carbon contents of soil cores collected within a specific SMU boundary and applying the averaged value across each SMU; and c) interpolating carbon contents across the field site based on the individual soil cores. Maps of SOC, SIC, and TC contents based on the interpolated core samples were different from maps created by applying averaged core results or SSURGO values across the SMUs. Differences in the magnitudes and spatial distributions of carbon can be attributed to several factors. For example, SSURGO soil carbon values are frequently measured for a selected pedon(s) from a "type location" and not from the actual study location. These "type locations" can be located far from study sites and even in different states. Also, SSURGO soil carbon values may overestimate the actual contents when compared to systematic field measurements because the SSURGO values at lower depths are often extrapolated from upper soil horizons. Such extrapolations affect inorganic carbon to a much greater extent than organic carbon, therefore better agreement is observed in the present study between SOC estimates from the SSURGO database and field measurements. Because regional and/or global carbon estimates are rarely made with detailed field data due to the high costs of field and laboratory measurements, additional field sampling is needed to constrain and improve these estimates and also to assess the potential variability present.

Various processing protocols are explored such as gas composition (Argon, NH3 and a 10%NH3/Argon mix) and a gas switching process where gas is switched from NH3 to Argon at specified temperatures and specified times to quench the reaction. Results showed an accurate control of the volume fraction of SiC in 0-30 volume% range in a Si3N4 matrix. FTIR spectroscopic results confirmed that a substitution reaction occurs between NH3 and the polyureasilazane.

X-ray tomography was used to determine the cell size distribution. The ablation resistance of the foams was studied by subjecting it to different oxyacetylene flame temperatures. After ablation, fragmentation was not observed and the mass ablation rate was found to be minimal for the foams produced from highest vol% of hafnium tetra n-butoxide. The foams remained X-ray amorphous after ablation and the presence of Hf-O and Si-O bonds were confirmed using ATR spectroscopy. For comparison, a reasonably dense spark plasma sintered pellet was also ablated and the evolution of monoclinic hafnia was confirmed using X-ray diffraction. The microstructural characterization exhibited three different zones on the ablated surface for sintered sample and the ablation mechanisms were understood using thermodynamic calculations.

Toward performance-based evaluation for offshore wind turbine jacket support structures								RENEWABLE ENERGY				97				709	721		10.1016/j.renene.2016.06.028			NOV 2016	2016	This paper introduces a framework for the assessment of damage of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) supported by jackets under extreme environmental loadings. Performance levels/damage states, ranging from operational/undamaged to near collapse/severely damaged, are defined based on static pushover analyses. An example performance assessment is presented for an OWT supported by a jacket based on environmental conditions for a site off Massachusetts along U.S. Atlantic coast. The environmental conditions are characterized based on two methods for estimating wind and wave conditions, one on extrapolation of NOAA buoy measurements and one on a stochastic hurricane catalog, and two models for extreme wave height, one on the crest height and one on the zero-up-crossing height. Using probabilistic models for demands and capacities, two curves of fragility, one estimating the initiation of yielding and the other estimating the onset of collapse, are developed to distinguish between the three damage states. The curves are applied to four combinations of two environmental hazard models and two extreme wave height models, and significant differences are found in the probability of damage among the four combinations of models. The findings have potential implications for the evaluation of the overall risk profile and associated performance for offshore wind farms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a challenge to analyze the complexity of such algorithms because the work they perform is not uniform across the input region. Continuous amortization was introduced in Burr et al. (2009) as a way to bound the complexity of subdivision-based algorithms. The main features of this new technique are that (1) the technique can be applied, uniformly, to a variety of subdivision-based algorithms, (2) the technique considers a function directly related to the subdivision-based algorithm under consideration, and (3) the output of the technique is often explicitly expressed in terms of the intrinsic complexity of the problem instance.In this paper, the theory of continuous amortization is generalized and applied in several directions. The theory is generalized (1) to allow the domain to be higher dimensional or an abstract measure space, (2) to allow more general subdivisions than bisections, and (3) to bound the value of general functions on the regions of the final partition. The theory is applied to seven examples of subdivision-based algorithms. These applications include (1) bounding the number of subdivisions performed by algorithms for isolating real and complex roots of polynomials, (2) bounding the bit-complexity of subdivision-based algorithms for isolating the real roots of polynomials, and (3) bounding the expected run-time of an algorithm for approximating a biased coin. In each of these applications, by using continuous amortization, we achieve or improve the best-known complexity bounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Important component of the binding free energy is the electrostatics, which is frequently modeled via the solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann Equations (PBE). However, numerous works have shown that the electrostatic component (Delta Delta G(elec)) of binding free energy is very sensitive to the parameters used and modeling protocol. This prompted some researchers to question the robustness of PBE in predicting Delta Delta G(elec). We argue that the sensitivity of the absolute Delta Delta G(elec) calculated with PBE using different input parameters and definitions does not indicate PBE deficiency, rather this is what should be expected. We show how the apparent sensitivity should be interpreted in terms of the underlying changes in several numerous and physical parameters. We demonstrate that PBE approach is robust within each considered force field (CHARMM-27, AMBER-94, and OPLS-AA) once the corresponding structures are energy minimized. This observation holds despite of using two different molecular surface definitions, pointing again that PBE delivers consistent results within particular force field. The fact that PBE delivered Delta Delta G(elec) values may differ if calculated with different modeling protocols is not a deficiency of PBE, but natural results of the differences of the force field parameters and potential functions for energy minimization. In addition, while the absolute Delta Delta G(elec) values calculated with different force field differ, their ordering remains practically the same allowing for consistent ranking despite of the force field used.

Comparison of methods for measuring porosity of porous paving mixtures								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				125				299	305		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.08.038			OCT 30 2016	2016	The porosity of porous paving mixtures is critical to their performance and is a commonly measured parameter. However, as there are a number of methods to measure the porosity of a specimen, this research addressed how these different methods compared to one another and identified where differences in measurements arose. The four methods tested were the Corelok, Mantes et al., vacuum, and image analysis methods (listed in order of increasing porosity measurements for the same specimens). All four methods, as well as variations of methods, were found to be statistically different except for the vacuum and image analysis methods. The Corelok method measured lower porosity values than the soak/tap and vacuum methods due to how the total specimen volume was measured, though once the difference in volume was accounted for, it fell between those two methods. The soak/tap and vacuum methods measured similar porosities for higher porosity samples (>25%), but due to the efficiency of the vacuum at removing entrapped air pockets from smaller voids, the vacuum method recorded higher porosity values for specimens that had lower porosity (<25%).

The feasibility of a non-destructive discrimination of glyphosate-resistant and conventional soybean seeds and their hybrid descendants was examined by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system combined with chemometrics. Principal component analysis (PCA), least squares-support vector machines (LS-SVM) and PCA-back propagation neural network (PCA-BPNN) models with the first and second derivative and standard normal variate (SNV) transformation pre-treatments were applied to classify soybean seeds based on genotype. Results demonstrated clear differences among glyphosate-resistant, hybrid descendants and conventional non-transformed soybean seeds could easily be visualized with an excellent classification (accuracy was 88.33% in validation set) using the LS-SVM and the spectra with SNV pre-treatment. The results indicated that THz spectroscopy techniques together with chemometrics would be a promising technique to distinguish transgenic soybean seeds from non-transformed seeds with high efficiency and without any major sample preparation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000386110100001	27782205	
J	Fang, Hongbin; Li, Suyi; Ji, Huimin; Wang, K. W.					Fang, Hongbin/0000-0001-6691-0531			Uncovering the deformation mechanisms of origami metamaterials by introducing generic degree-four vertices								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				94	4					043002	10.1103/PhysRevE.94.043002			OCT 24 2016	2016	Origami-based design holds promise for developing new mechanical metamaterials whose overall kinematic and mechanical properties can be programmed using purely geometric criteria. In this article, we demonstrate that the deformation of a generic degree-four vertex ( 4-vertex) origami cell is a combination of contracting, shearing, bending, and facet-binding. The last three deformation mechanisms are missing in the current rigid-origami metamaterial investigations, which focus mainly on conventional Miura-ori patterns. We show that these mechanisms provide the 4-vertex origami sheets and blocks with new deformation patterns as well as extraordinary kinematical and mechanical properties, including self-locking, tridirectional negative Poisson's ratios, flipping of stiffness profiles, and emerging shearing stiffness. This study reveals that the 4-vertex cells offer a better platform and greater design space for developing origami-based mechanical metamaterials than the conventional Miura-ori cell.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000388438400015

Using SiGe in the core extends the accessible wavelength range and potential optical functionality because the bandgap and optical properties can be tuned by changing the composition. However, silicon and germanium segregate unevenly during non-equilibrium solidification, presenting new fabrication challenges, and requiring detailed studies of the alloy crystallization dynamics in the fibre geometry. We report the fabrication of SiGe-core optical fibres, and the use of CO2 laser irradiation to heat the glass cladding and recrystallize the core, improving optical transmission. We observe the ramifications of the classic models of solidification at the microscale, and demonstrate suppression of constitutional undercooling at high solidification velocities. Tailoring the recrystallization conditions allows formation of long single crystals with uniform composition, as well as fabrication of compositional microstructures, such as gratings, within the fibre core.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-1723			WOS:000385927200001	27775066	
J	Brittain, Sean D.; Najita, Joan R.; Carr, John S.; Adamkovics, Mate; Reynolds, Nickalas								A STUDY OF RO-VIBRATIONAL OH EMISSION FROM HERBIG Ae/Be STARS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				830	2					112	10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/112			OCT 20 2016	2016	We present a study of ro-vibrational OH and CO emission from 21 disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars. We find that the OH and CO luminosities are proportional over a wide range of stellar ultraviolet luminosities. The OH and CO line profiles are also similar, indicating that they arise from roughly the same radial region of the disk. The CO and OH emission are both correlated with the far-ultraviolet luminosity of the stars, while the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) luminosity is correlated with the longer wavelength ultraviolet luminosity of the stars. Although disk flaring affects the PAH luminosity, it is not a factor in the luminosity of the OH and CO emission. These properties are consistent with models of UV-irradiated disk atmospheres. We also find that the transition disks in our sample, which have large optically thin inner regions, have lower OH and CO luminosities than non-transition disk sources with similar ultraviolet luminosities. This result, while tentative given the small sample size, is consistent with the interpretation that transition disks lack a gaseous disk close to the star.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000386488200015

A total of 38% of the sources are optically classified type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), 60% are type 2 AGNs, and 2% are passive, low-redshift galaxies. We study the distribution of AGN photon index Gamma and of the intrinsic absorption N-H,N-z based on the sources' optical classification: type 1 AGNs have a slightly steeper mean photon index Gamma than type 2 AGNs, which, on the other hand, have average N-H,N-z similar to 3 times higher than type 1 AGNs. We find that similar to 15% of type 1 AGNs have N-H,N-z > 10(22) cm(-2), i.e., are obscured according to the X-ray spectral fitting; the vast majority of these sources have L2-10 (keV) > 10(44) erg s(-1). The existence of these objects suggests that optical and X-ray obscuration can be caused by different phenomena, the X-ray obscuration being, for example, caused by dust-free material surrounding the inner part of the nuclei. Approximately 18% of type 2 AGNs have N-H,N-z < 10(22) cm(-2), and most of these sources have low X-ray luminosities (L2-10 (keV) < 10(43) erg s(-1)). We expect a part of these sources to be low-accretion, unobscured AGNs lacking broad emission lines. Finally, we also find a direct proportional trend between N-H,N-z and host-galaxy mass and star formation rate, although part of this trend is due to a redshift selection effect.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000386488200003

Anharmonic renormalization of the dispersion of flexural modes in graphene using atomistic calculations								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				94	15					155434	10.1103/PhysRevB.94.155434			OCT 20 2016	2016	We investigate through an atomistic method the effects of anharmonicity on the dispersion of flexural modes of graphene. Using a calculation based on ensemble averages of correlations among displacements and forces, we calculate the temperature-dependent frequencies for a semiempirical potential for graphene. We find that the dispersion relation of the flexural modes of graphene is renormalized by anharmonic coupling to other modes. Our calculations confirm that the anharmonic continuum results of Mariani and von Oppen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 076801 (2008)] hold in detail for small wave number and at low temperatures. We examine the deviation from the continuum result outside of that range.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000386099300005

Host resistance to this pathogen is partial and is encoded by a large number of quantitative trait loci, each conditioning small effects. Breeding SDS resistance is therefore challenging and identification of single-gene encoded novel resistance mechanisms is becoming a priority to fight this devastating this fungal pathogen. In this transcriptomic study we identified a few putative soybean defense genes, expression of which is suppressed during F. virguliforme infection. The F. virguliforme infection-suppressed genes were broadly classified into four major classes. The steady state transcript levels of many of these genes were suppressed to undetectable levels immediately following F. virguliforme infection. One of these classes contains two novel genes encoding ankyrin repeat-containing proteins. Expression of one of these genes, GmARP1, during F. virguliforme infection enhances SDS resistance among the transgenic soybean plants. Our data suggest that GmARP1 is a novel defense gene and the pathogen presumably suppress its expression to establish compatible interaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000386204000007	27760122

Carefully controlled thermal gradients of 30 or less were also used to minimize the number of nucleation sites. The resulting crystals exhibit improvements in size and optical clarity over those grown at 600-650 degrees C. These outcomes are likely also attributed to a greater stability of Lu2O3 relative to LuO(OH) at the higher temperature conditions. The doping of Lu2O3 single crystals has been extended to encompass all spectroscopically active trivalent rare earth ions. Absorption spectra have been obtained of a wide range of lanthanide-doped Lu2O3 single crystals from 80 to 298 K and the spectra of Nd:Lu2O3 are reported as a representative example herein.

J	Hong, Tao; Brinkman, Kyle; Xia, Changrong								Copper oxide as a synergistic catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta perovskite structured electrocatalyst								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				329				281	289		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.08.075			OCT 15 2016	2016	This work presents the effect of dispersed copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a typical solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrocatalyst, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta(LSCF). The ORR kinetics were enhanced by a factor up to 4 at 750 degrees C as demonstrated by electrical conductivity relaxation measurements used to determine the chemical surface exchange coefficient, k(chem). The value of k(chem) increased from 2.6 x 10(-5) cm s(-1) to 9.3 x 10(-5) cm s(-1) at 750 degrees C when the LSCF surface was coated with submicron CuO particles. The enhanced k(chem) was attributed to additional reactions that occur on the CuO surface and at the LSCF-CuO-gas three-phase boundaries (3PBs) as suggested by the k(chem) dependence on CuO coverage and 3PB length. This enhancement was further demonstrated by the introduction of CuO nanoparticles into LSCF electrodes. CuO infiltrated electrodes reduced the interfacial polarization resistance from 2.27 Omega cm(2) to 1.5 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C and increased the peak power density from 0.54 W cm(-2) to 0.72 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that the reduced resistance was due to the shrinkage of the low frequency arc, which is associated with the electrochemical surface exchange reaction.

The effect of the addition of six different metal oxide additives (CuO, ZnO, Fe2O3, MnO2, PdO, and Cr2O3) on the transport properties of BCZY63 was investigated. Although most additives (e.g. ZnO, Fe2O3, MnO2, Cr2O3) led to a decrease (sometimes minor) in conductivity, CuO and PdO dopants yielded an increase in total conductivity compared to the BCZY63 control. The enhancement in the total conductivity is found to be related to two factors: 1) the additive can act as a sintering aid to produce larger grain size; 2) the presence of the metal ions from additives in the structure can lead to increased bulk proton concentration. Due to its excellent sinterability and moderately improved proton conductivity, CuO-doped BCZY63 was subsequently applied as the dense electrolyte layer in protonic ceramic fuel cells utilizing a recently developed single firing step fabrication technique to produce high quality single cells that showed exceptional performance and long-term stability.

The level of polymerization of the TeO4 chain-like structure in a TeO2 glass system has been identified to be the main parameter for reaching high linear and nonlinear optical constant. We have observed that replacement of TaO5/2 by ZnO strongly modifies the optical properties and, primarily, the Raman and hyper-Raman spectra of the glasses. In particular, we clearly demonstrate a linear relationship between Raman gain and the linear and second-order optical response of the glass, which is directly related to the number density of TeO4 chain like units. Assuming that only TeO4 chain-like units contribute significantly to the glass' polarizability, we have found that about 30% of the Te atoms contribute to the hyperpolarizability of the binary system 80TeO(2)-20ZnO in very good accordance with neutron diffraction results.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447			WOS:000385607000042

These assumptions are insufficient in cases where the foundation may have a unilateral stiffness that vanishes in compression or tension such as in non pneumatic tires and bushing bearings. This paper analyzes the in-plane dynamics of such a thick ring on a unilateral elastic foundation, specifically, on a two-parameter unilateral elastic foundation, where the stiffness of the foundation is treated as linear in the circumferential direction but unilateral (i.e. collapsible or tensionless) in the radial direction. The thick ring is modeled as an orthotropic and extensible circular Timoshenko beam. An arbitrarily distributed time-varying in-plane force is considered as the excitation. The Equations of Motion are explicitly derived and a solution method is proposed that uses an implicit Newmark scheme for the time domain solution and an iterative compensation approach to determine the unilateral zone of the foundation at each time step. The dynamic axle force transmission is also analyzed. Illustrative forced vibration responses obtained from the proposed model and solution method are compared with those obtained from a finite element model. (C)) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We then propose a Cartesian parametrization for vectors that lie a cube of side length two and use these vectors in lieu of unit normals to test for the loss of the ellipticity condition. This parametrization is then used to construct a tensor akin to the acoustic tensor. It is shown that both of these tensors become singular at the same time and in the same planes in the presence of a material instability. The performance of the Cartesian parametrization is compared against the other parametrizations, with the results of these comparisons showing that in general, the Cartesian parametrization is more robust and more numerically efficient than the others.

Exploiting endogenous fibrocartilage stem cells to regenerate cartilage and repair joint injury								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				7						13073	10.1038/ncomms13073			OCT 10 2016	2016	Tissue regeneration using stem cell-based transplantation faces many hurdles. Alternatively, therapeutically exploiting endogenous stem cells to regenerate injured or diseased tissue may circumvent these challenges. Here we show resident fibrocartilage stem cells (FCSCs) can be used to regenerate and repair cartilage. We identify FCSCs residing within the superficial zone niche in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condyle. A single FCSC spontaneously generates a cartilage anlage, remodels into bone and organizes a haematopoietic microenvironment. Wnt signals deplete the reservoir of FCSCs and cause cartilage degeneration. We also show that intra-articular treatment with the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin sustains the FCSC pool and regenerates cartilage in a TMJ injury model. We demonstrate the promise of exploiting resident FCSCs as a regenerative therapeutic strategy to substitute cell transplantation that could be beneficial for patients suffering from fibrocartilage injury and disease. These data prompt the examination of utilizing this strategy for other musculoskeletal tissues.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-1723			WOS:000385546900001	27721375

The forecast's construction and an assessment of its performance are described.Methods: The forecast is based on a spatial-temporal conditional autoregressive model fitted to over 31 million antigen heartworm tests conducted in the 48 contiguous United States during 2011-2015. The forecast uses county-level data on 16 predictive factors, including temperature, precipitation, median household income, local forest and surface water coverage, and presence/absence of eight mosquito species. Non-static factors are extrapolated into the forthcoming year with various statistical methods. The fitted model and factor extrapolations are used to estimate next year's regional prevalence.Results: The correlation between the observed and model-estimated county-by-county heartworm prevalence for the 5-year period 2011-2015 is 0.727, demonstrating reasonable model accuracy. The correlation between 2015 observed and forecasted county-by-county heartworm prevalence is 0.940, demonstrating significant skill and showing that heartworm prevalence can be forecasted reasonably accurately.Conclusions: The forecast presented herein can a priori alert veterinarians to areas expected to see higher than normal heartworm activity. The proposed methods may prove useful for forecasting other diseases.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1756-3305			WOS:000384847200005	27724981

Transcriptome Profile of the Chicken Thrombocyte: New Implications as an Advanced Immune Effector Cell								PLOS ONE				11	10					e0163890	10.1371/journal.pone.0163890			OCT 6 2016	2016	Thrombocytes are nucleated platelets involved in immune functions such as pathogen recognition and release of pro-inflammatory bioactive compounds when exposed to bacterial and viral molecules. However, the complete role of these cells in innate and adaptive immune responses is not understood, and little is known about their biology at the molecular-genetic level. Highly sensitive RNA-sequencing technologies were used to analyze the complete transcriptome of thrombocytes for the first time with analytical resolution focused on cell-based components of the immune system/response. Amongst all the genes listed in the current chicken genome assembly, 10,041 gene transcripts were found in the chicken thrombocyte. After 1-hour in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Salmonella minnesota), 490 genes were upregulated and 359 genes were downregulated, respectively, with at least a 1-fold change relative to unexposed thrombocytes. Additionally, by constructing a de novo assembly, we were able to identify a total of 3,030 novel genes in the thrombocyte transcriptome. The information generated here is useful in development of novel solutions to lower the economic burden and zoonotic threat that accompanies infectious diseases for birds and fish. In addition, the resources created here have translational utility as a model system to find orthologous genes and genes related to its enucleated counterpart, the platelet.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000385697600046	27711235

However, while phosphorus carbon composite anodes have been previously explored, the influence of the inactive materials on electrode cycle performance is still poorly understood. Here, we report and explain the significant impacts of polymer binder chemistry, carbon conductive additives, and an underlayer between the Al current collector and ball milled P electrodes on cell stability. We focused our study on the commonly used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) binders as well as exfoliated graphite (ExG) and carbon nanotube (CNT) additives. The mechanical properties of the binders were found to change drastically because of interactions with both the slurry and electrolyte solvents, significantly effecting the electrochenlical cycle stability of the electrodes. Binder adhesion was also found to be critical in achieving stable electrochemical cycling. The best anodes demonstrated similar to 1400 mAh/g-P gravimetric capacity after 200 cycles at C/2 rates in Li half cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			WOS:000384951800040	27636526

The extracellular proteomes of F. proliferatum grown in the absence and presence of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) were analyzed comparatively. A total of 66 significantly different expressed secreted proteins were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The BHA treatment suppressed the accumulation of some pathogenic factors such as aspartic protease, cell wall degradation enzymes, porin, superoxide dismutase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. On the contrary, the BHA treatment increased the abundances of some proteins, such as ATP binding cassette transporter substrate-binding protein and lipopolysaccharide-assembly lipoprotein, involved in the growth of F. proliferatum. These findings suggest that BHA treatment could influence the pathogenic ability of F. proliferatum via inhibiting the levels of virulence factors and cell wall degradation-associated enzymes. Moreover, the induction of the growth-related proteins after the BHA treatment suggests that the livelihood of F. proliferatum might depend on the cost of reduced pathogenic ability. This study has provided some evidence for understanding the complicated mechanisms of F. proliferatum infection in an effort to develop new targets for the control of this fungal pathogen.Biological significance: To better understand the inhibitory mechanism of F. proliferatum by butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) treatment, a comprehensive proteomic analysis of the secreted proteins of F. proliferatum was firstly conducted. Among the 66 identified spots, 34 and 32 proteins were down- and up-accumulated significantly by BHA treatment, respectively. Many of the identified key protein species were involved in the pathogenic ability and the growth of F. proliferatum.

The embedded electrode approach using an externally applied potential to repel organic foulants and inhibit bacterial adhesion can effectively reduce the frequency of membrane replacement. Electrode embedment in membranes is often carried out by dispensing a conductor (e.g., carbon nanotubes, or CNTs) in the membrane substrate, which gives rise to two problems: the leaching-out of the conductor and a percolation limited membrane conductivity that results in an added energy cost. This study presents a facile method for the embedment of a continuous electrode in thin-film composite (TFC) forward osmosis (FO) membranes. Specifically, a conducting porous carbon paper is used as the understructure for the formation of a membrane substrate by the classical phase inversion process. The carbon paper and the membrane substrate polymer form an interpenetrating structure with good stability and low electrical resistance (only about 1 Omega/square). The membrane-electrode assembly was deployed as the cathode of an electrochemical cell, and showed good resistance to organic and microbial fouling with the imposition of a 2.0 V DC voltage. The carbon paper-based FO TFC membranes also possess good mechanical stability for practical use.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000384841900035	27607546

We analyzed the banding structure of the larval polytene chromosomes in the Simulium tuberosum species group to probe for diversity beyond the morphological level. Among 272 larvae, 88 different chromosomal rearrangements, primarily paracentric inversions, were discovered in addition to 25 already known in the basic sequences of the group in Asia. Chromosomal diversity in Vietnam far exceeds that known for the group in Thailand, with only about 5% of the rearrangements shared between the two countries. Fifteen cytoforms and nine morphoforms were revealed among six nominal species in Vietnam. Chromosomal evidence, combined with available molecular and morphological evidence, conservatively suggests that at least five of the cytoforms are valid species, two of which require formal names. The total chromosomal rearrangements and species (15) now known from the group in Vietnam far exceed those of any other area of comparable size in the world, supporting the country's status as a biodiversity hotspot. Phylogenetic inference based on uniquely shared, derived chromosomal rearrangements supports the clustering of cytoforms into two primary lineages, the Simulium tani complex and the Southeast Asian Simulium tuberosum subgroup. Some of these taxa could be threatened by habitat destruction, given their restricted geographical distributions and the expanding human population of Vietnam.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000385553100061	27695048

J	Orellana, Jose Luis; Mauhar, Michael; Kitchens, Christopher L.								Cellulose Nanocrystals versus Polyethylene Glycol as Toughening Agents for Poly(Lactic Acid)-Poly(Acrylic Acid) Graft Copolymer								JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE MATERIALS				4	5			340	350		10.7569/JRM.2016.634126			OCT 2016	2016	Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the most widely used biodegradable polymers due to the ability to synthesize it economically at industrial scale and its favorable properties for many consumer products. However, the rigid nature of PLA is not desirable for specific applications, requiring the incorporation of effective bioderived additives in order to enhance the PLA toughness and broaden applications. In this work, PLA was modified by graft polymerization of polyacrylic acid (PLA-g-PAA) to increase the hydrophilicity to promote compatibilization of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) or high molecular polyethylene glycol (PEG). CNCs were found to act as a nucleating agent for the PLA-g-PAA copolymer due to an enhanced compatibility with these rigid nanocrystals, thus increasing the tensile modulus and reducing toughness. This was not the case for pure PLA, for which the toughness was increased up to 125% for a 1% CNC loading. PEG successfully increased toughness of the PLA-g-PAA by more than 34 times that of neat PLA and PLA-g-PAA with a substantial yet not critical reduction in strength and modulus for a wide range of applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2164-6325	2164-6341		WOS:000393131400005

The resulting fibers were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, which showed a network-like structure with a length of 600 nm, width of 50 nm and an aspect ratio of 12. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that chemical treatments progressively removed noncellulosic constituents. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that crystallinity increased with successive chemical treatments. Using the synthesized isora nanofibers, poly(butylene succinate) (PBS)-based biodegradable nanocomposites were prepared. The nanocomposites were processed using a Brabender twin-screw compounder and an injection molding machine. Effects of INF on the mechanical properties of nanocomposites were investigated. Tensile and flexural moduli of PBS-INF nanocomposites showed an increase with increase in INF content owing to the network formation of the nanofibers in the PBS matrix, whereas toughness and strain-at-break exhibited the opposite trend. Tensile and flexural strengths showed an increase up to 1.5 phr of INF loading, beyond which they were observed to decline owing to agglomeration of INF. Theoretically predicted tensile strength and Young's modulus were found to increase with INF content; however, there existed a mismatch between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2164-6325	2164-6341		WOS:000393131400006

Formation of Highly Oriented Cellulose Nanocrystal Films by Spin Coating Film from Aqueous Suspensions								JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE MATERIALS				4	5			377	387		10.7569/JRM.2016.634131			OCT 2016	2016	Spin coating was used to cast a uniform film of cellulose nanocrystals with low surface roughness and variable thickness as a function of operational parameters that include rotational speed and dispense suspension concentration. The film thickness was controllable from 40 nm up to 1 mu m with surface roughness an order of magnitude less than blade-coating methods. The degree of radial orientation was qualitatively assessed and shown to be variable with processing parameters. Under specific processing conditions, the formation of striation patterns was observed and associated with film drying instability. The striation patterns are periodic in nature where the wavelength and amplitude are controllable to a certain degree with wetting film concentration and rotational speed. The striation patterns possess ordered, oriented nanorods, which exist as both rippled ring-like structures and radial ridges along the shear direction. There is potential to employ these rippled structures as low-cost manufacturing of ordered materials, device platforms, or optical components such as diffraction gratings. Mechanical properties of the films were measured by nanoindentation. The maximum elastic modulus of the films was 8.3 GPa and the maximum hardness was 322 MPa. A post-drying heat treatment (80 degrees C) was employed and resulted in a 17% increase in modulus and 35% increase in hardness, which is attributed to the formation of an enhanced intermolecular hydrogen bonding network between nanocrystals with removal of bound water.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2164-6325	2164-6341		WOS:000393131400008

Determinants of mental health treatment seeking among soldiers who recognize their problem: implications for high-risk occupations								WORK AND STRESS				30	4			318	336		10.1080/02678373.2016.1246490			OCT-DEC 2016	2016	Although research has documented an increased risk of mental health problems among employees in high-stress occupations, little attention has been devoted to the process by which employees seek treatment for these problems. Using components of the Stages of Change Model (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1982), this study examined the correlates of considering and receiving treatment for such problems among active-duty military personnel in the U.S. Army. A multidimensional assessment of determinants of treatment seeking was administered to 1725 military personnel, along with measures of mental health symptoms and treatment seeking. These determinants were examined as predictors of considering and receiving treatment among a sub-sample of 466 personnel who recognized having a current mental health problem. Multinomial logistic regressions indicated that attitudes towards treatment and a preference for self-reliance distinguished those considering treatment from those who had not sought treatment. A larger number of factors distinguished soldiers considering treatment from those who had actually received treatment, with operational barriers and self-reliance being the strongest and unique correlates. The discussion focuses on the importance of what organizations can do to facilitate treatment seeking among employees in high-risk environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0267-8373	1464-5335		WOS:000390128000002
