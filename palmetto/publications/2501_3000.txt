The 200 mu m radii microring modulators present 1.2 dB/cm waveguide propagation loss, 1.2 x 10(5) quality factor, 0.4 GHz/V tuning rate, and 13 dB extinction ratio. The 6 mm long Mach-Zehnder modulators have a halfwave voltage-length product of 3.8 V. cm and an extinction ratio of 15 dB. The demonstrated work is a key step towards enabling wafer scale dense on-chip integration of high performance lithium niobate electro-optical devices on silicon for short reach optical interconnects and higher order advanced modulation schemes.

Alternatively, reaction of [RuCl(1)(eta(6)-cymene)] (3) with bpy and AgOTf successfully produced [Ru(1)(bpy)(2)][OTf] (4). Methylation of 2 and 4 with MeOTf yielded trans(C)-[Ru(1-Me)(2)(bpy)][OTf](2) (5) and [Ru(1-Me)(bpy)(2)][OTf](2) (6), accompanied by a + 2 and + 1 increase in net charge, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry indicated that the increase in Ru(II)/Ru(III) oxidation potential from 2 to 5 was twice the increase from 4 to 6. UV-Vis spectroscopy also revealed that transitions in 5 occurred at higher energy than in 2 by double the difference between 6 and 4. Crystallographic analysis demonstrated that the coordination environment of Ru did not differ significantly between 2 and 5, suggesting that the observed shifts in oxidation potentials and absorption wavelengths are not due to changes in coordination chemistry or formal oxidation state. Collectively, these results show that 5 and 6 feature Ru centers more electron deficient than those in 2 and 4, respectively, by amounts linearly proportional to the difference in net charge.

In MRS, a uniformly rotating magnetic field rotates magnetic micro-or nano-probes in the liquid and one analyzes the features of the probe rotation to extract rheological parameters of liquids. Magnetic properties of nanoprobes must be well characterized and understood to make results reliable and reproducible. Ni and Co nanorods synthesized by electrochemical template synthesis in alumina membranes are discussed in applications to MRS. We employ alternating gradient field magnetometry, X-ray diffraction, and magnetic force microscopy to evaluate and compare properties of these nanorods and study their performance as the MRS probes. It is shown that nickel nanorods do not seem to violate any assumptions of the MRS rigid dipole theory, while cobalt nanorods do.

It shows that the thermal conductivity of graphene decreases with increasing hydrogen doping coverage. The decreasing rate, however, depends on the doping orientation. Based on the kinetic theory of lattice thermal transport, we study the effect of doping coverage and orientation on the phonon density of states, phonon dispersion relation, phonon relaxation time, and the specific heat. While hydrogen doping has little effect on the specific heat, it decreases the phonon group velocity and increases phonon-phonon scattering in graphene. The phonon group velocity reduction is only due to the increment of doping coverage and is independent of doping orientation. A larger angle between the doping stripe orientation and the heat flux direction leads to smaller relaxation times, i.e., stronger phonon-phonon scattering, resulting in a lower thermal conductivity.

The interference fringe pattern caused by the optical path difference of the two arms is interrogated in the microwave domain, where the fringe visibility of 40 dB has easily been obtained. The strain sensing at both room temperature and high temperatures has been demonstrated by using such a sensor. Experimental results show that this sensor has a linear response to the applied strain, and also has relatively low temperature-strain cross talk. The dopant-free quality of the fused silica fiber provides high possibility for the sensor to have promising strain sensing performance in a high temperature environment.

However, experimental evidence suggested that contrasting dispersion mechanisms of PAMAM exist toward different types of hydrocarbon ligands, including linear and polyaromatic oil molecules. Specifically, the dispersion of linear hydrocarbons by PAMAM was found to violate the unimolecular micelle convention by forming molecular complexes orders of magnitude larger than a single PAMAM. It is, therefore, essential to re-examine the dispersion mechanisms of PAMAM toward different types of ligands in order to facilitate dendrimer applications in environmental remediation, catalysis, and nanomedicine. Here, we applied atomistic discrete molecular dynamics simulations to study generation-four (G4) PAMAM dendrimers dispersing hexadecane (C16) and phenanthrene (PN), two representative linear and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in crude oil. We observed a strong cooperativity in the binding of both C16 and PN to PAMAM dendrimers, especially with C16. Simulations of multiple PAMAM molecules interacting with many hydrocarbons illustrated that phenanthrene bound to individual dendrimers to render a unimolecular micelle, while multiple C16 molecules formed a large droplet enclosed and stabilized by multiple PAMAM dendrimers to assemble into a multimolecular micelle. Our analysis revealed that such deviation of the PAMAM ligand architecture from the conventional unimolecular micelle paradigm arose from strong interligand interactions between linear hydrocarbons.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1932-7447			WOS:000360026200073

We investigated spatial patterns of disease risk for two human pathogens in the Borrelia genus-B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi-that are transmitted by the western black-legged tick, Ixodes pacificus. We collected ticks (349 nymphs, 273 adults) at 20 sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA. Tick abundance, pathogen prevalence and density of infected nymphs varied widely across sites and habitat type, though nymphal western black-legged ticks were more frequently found, and were more abundant in coast live oak forest and desert/semi-desert scrub (dominated by California sagebrush) habitats. We observed Borrelia infections in ticks at all sites where we able to collect >10 ticks. The recently recognized human pathogen, B. miyamotoi, was observed at a higher prevalence (13/349 nymphs = 3.7%, 95% CI = 2.0-6.3; 5/273 adults = 1.8%, 95% CI = 0.6-4.2) than recent studies from nearby locations (Alameda County, east of the San Francisco Bay), demonstrating that tick-borne disease risk and ecology can vary substantially at small geographic scales, with consequences for public health and disease diagnosis.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000360018600029	26288371

Art-based assessments that encourage creativity and accommodate different modes of expression may be a particularly useful complement to conventional tools (e.g. surveys), but their efficacy and feasibility across diverse contexts has not been adequately explored. To examine the potential utility of integrating art into evaluations of environmental education outcomes, we adapted an existing drawing prompt and corresponding grading rubric to assess the environmental attitudes and awareness of children (ages 6-12) at summer camps in Athens, GA, USA (n=285). We then compared children's drawings with scores on a more typical survey instrument that measured similar outcomes, the Children Environmental Perception's Scale. Results showed that a drawing prompt was a practical and unique learner-centered tool for measuring distinct components of environmental attitudes and awareness. Findings also revealed different response patterns across the two instruments, highlighting the value of using multiple approaches (e.g. art-based and survey-based) to assess cognitive and affective aspects of children's environmental orientations.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1350-4622	1469-5871		WOS:000361461700004

Sorption of sodium on silica gel surfaces was monitored as the pH of a column was equilibrated at 5.0 and then successively raised to 6.5 and 8.0, but the composition of the 0.01 M NaCl solution was otherwise unchanged. SIP measurements show an increase in the imaginary conductivity of the sample (17.82 +/- 0.07 mu S/cm) in response to the pH change, interpreted as deprotonation of silanol groups on the silica gel surface followed by sorption of sodium cations. Independent measurements of Na+ accumulation on grain surfaces performed using a radioactive Na-22 tracer support the interpretation of pHdependent sorption as a dominant process controlling the electrical properties of the silica gel (R-2 = 0.99) and confirms the importance of grain polarization (versus membrane polarization) in influencing SIP measurements of silicate minerals. The number of surface sorption sites estimated by fitting a mechanistic, triple layer model for the complex conductivity to the SIP data (13.22 X 10(16) sites/m(2)) was 2.8 times larger than that estimated directly by a Na-22 mass balance (5.13 X 10(16) sites/m(2)), suggesting additional contributions to polarization exist.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000359891700056	26191613

Clustering effects in ionic polymers: Molecular dynamics simulations								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				92	2					022601	10.1103/PhysRevE.92.022601			AUG 18 2015	2015	Ionic clusters control the structure, dynamics, and transport in soft matter. Incorporating a small fraction of ionizable groups in polymers substantially reduces the mobility of the macromolecules in melts. These ionic groups often associate into random clusters in melts, where the distribution and morphology of the clusters impact the transport in these materials. Here, using molecular dynamic simulations we demonstrate a clear correlation between cluster size and morphology with the polymer mobility in melts of sulfonated polystyrene. We show that in low dielectric media ladderlike clusters that are lower in energy compared with spherical assemblies are formed. Reducing the electrostatic interactions by enhancing the dielectric constant leads to morphological transformation from ladderlike clusters to globular assemblies. Decrease in electrostatic interaction significantly enhances the mobility of the polymer.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1539-3755	1550-2376		WOS:000359868300002	26382420

It follows that such graphs must have two disjoint minimal dominating sets R and B. We describe a self-stabilizing algorithm for finding such a pair of sets. It also follows from Ore's theorem that in a graph with no isolates, one can find disjoint sets R and B where R is maximal independent and B is minimal dominating. We describe a self-stabilizing algorithm for finding such a pair. Both algorithms are described using the Distance-2 model, but can be converted to the usual Distance-1 model [7], yielding running times of O (n(2)m). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an in-line grating structure has been fabricated within the core of an optical fiber with an intact buffer coating, allowing the fiber to retain optimal mechanical properties, an important consideration for strain and temperature sensing applications. Low energy pulses from a femtosecond laser were adjusted to avoid buffer absorption while inscribing a terahertz fiber Bragg grating (THz FBG) within the optical fiber core. Strain and temperature tests were conducted using both a THz FBG sensor fabricated using the reported method and a second THz FBG fabricated using a previously reported method requiring buffer removal. Highly similar results from both Thz FBGs were observed, indicating that the new intact buffer fabrication technique holds substantial potential as a method of fabricating optical fiber grating structures for distributed sensing applications.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1041-1135	1941-0174		WOS:000357932700007

Mechanisms and control of fouling during ultrafiltration of high strength wastewater without pretreatment								JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE				488				103	110		10.1016/j.memsci.2015.04.018			AUG 15 2015	2015	This contribution describes the application of ultrafiltration membranes for treating wastewaters with high levels of suspended particles, fats, grease and proteins. The objectives of this research were to understand the mechanisms leading to fouling of the membranes and to evaluate how the process parameters affect membrane performance. Modeling of direct flow filtration data revealed that early stage fouling was indicative of a cake formation pore blocking mechanism, which was followed by cake layer growth. Modeling of cross flow filtration data determined that the cake layer contributed the dominant resistance to flow through the membrane. The cake layer was highly compressible, with a compressibility factor of 1.1. Thus, while higher transmembrane pressure provided a larger driving force for water transport, this driving force was counteracted by a higher resistance caused by cake layer compression. Membrane type (polysulfone and regenerated cellulose) and initial pure water permeability (from 10 to 70 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)) had only minor effects on the measured steady state flux and threshold flux values. This result suggests that, in terms of membrane design, increasing membrane pure water permeability alone may not necessarily enhance filtration flux. Constant flux values higher than the measured threshold fluxes yielded rapid fouling and high rates of transmembrane pressure increase. The work provides valuable insights for subsequent cleaning studies and pilot scale testing.

We show that when the superfluid order parameters are homogeneous and are enforced to be identical along different chains, there are multiple MFs at each end with or without an experimentally tunable in-plane Zeeman field V-y. For V-y = 0 the multiple MFs are topologically protected by a chiral symmetry; however, for V-y not equal 0 the existence of multiple MFs is related to the peculiar spectrum properties of the system despite the broken chiral symmetry. In the generalization to higher dimensions, the multiple MFs form a zero-energy flat band. Furthermore, when the superfluid order parameters are solved self-consistently, the multiple MFs are usually destroyed because of the inhomogeneous order parameters of either Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (V-y = 0) type or Fulde-Ferrell (V-y not equal 0) type. Our results are useful to guide the experimentalists on searching for MFs in ultracold spin-orbit coupled fermionic superfluids.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2469-9926	2469-9934		WOS:000359486000008

Focusing on openness to racial exogamy as an indicator of racial boundaries, we examine the link between Christian nationalism and white Americans' views towards their hypothetical daughter marrying an African American, Latino, or Asian. Drawing on insights from social identity complexity theory, we argue that the convergence of religious and national identities serves to reinforce in-group boundaries, thereby fortifying notions of white purity, and consequently, strengthening whites' discomfort with potential race-mixing in marriage. Multivariate analyses of national survey data demonstrate that Christian nationalism is strongly associated with an increase in white Americans' discomfort with a daughter marrying any racial minority, and particularly African Americans. We demonstrate how the convergence of religious and national identities in Christian nationalism influences whites' regulating of racial boundaries (evidenced in intermarriage attitudes) above and beyond the independent effects of political conservatism or religious exclusivism.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0141-9870	1466-4356		WOS:000355808100001

The Turkish Ministry of National Education is in the midst of the FATH project, a nation-wide attempt to provide each classroom with an interactive whiteboard and each student with a tablet computer. In this paper, the authors present interview data from teachers at first-year FATH pilot schools who are using these technologies to understand how this national attempt is being translated into practice, and identify what is working and what areas need further attunement. Results show that teachers were especially content with being able to make their lessons visually more appealing for their students. They were, however, not satisfied with the in-service training provided, especially in understanding ways to effectively integrate the technologies into their teaching, and the limitations put upon Internet access from the tablets.

Toward a mechanistic understanding of animal migration: incorporating physiological measurements in the study of animal movement								CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY				3						cov035	10.1093/conphys/cov035			AUG 5 2015	2015	Movements are a consequence of an individual's motion and navigational capacity, internal state variables and the influence of external environmental conditions. Although substantial advancements have been made in methods of measuring and quantifying variation in motion capacity, navigational capacity and external environmental parameters in recent decades, the role of internal state in animal migration (and in movement in general) is comparatively little studied. Recent studies of animal movement in the wild illustrate how direct physiological measurements can improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying movement decisions. In this review, we synthesize and provide examples of how recent technical advances in the physiology-related fields of energetics, nutrition, endocrinology, immunology and ecotoxicology provide opportunities for direct measurements of physiological state in the study of animal movement. We then propose a framework for practitioners to enable better integration of studies of physiological state into animal movement ecology by assessing the mechanistic role played by physiology as both a driver and a modulator of movement. Finally, we highlight the current limitations and research priorities for better integration of direct measurements of animal physiological state into the study of animal movement.									3	0	0	3	0	3			2051-1434			WOS:000375199700001	27293720

A nonlinear model is developed from constitutive relations and is linearized about a static equilibrium position for analysis. A classical Maxwell-Weichert model, represented via a Prony series, is used to model the viscoelastic system. The exact solution to both the free and forced vibration problem is derived and used to study the behavior of an idealized packaging system containing Nova Chemicals Arcel (R) foam. It is observed that, although three Prony series terms are deemed sufficient to fir the static Lest data, convergence of the dynamic response and study of the storage and loss modulii necessitate the use of additional Prony series terms. It is also shown that the model is able to predict the modal frequencies and the primary resonance response at low acceleration excitation, both with reasonable accuracy given the non-homogeneity and density variation observed in the specimens.

Neal								Relative Cosolute Size Influences the Kinetics of Protein-Protein Interactions								BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL				109	3			510	520		10.1016/j.bpj.2015.06.043			AUG 4 2015	2015	Protein signaling occurs in crowded intracellular environments, and while high concentrations of macromolecules are postulated to modulate protein-protein interactions, analysis of their impact at each step of the reaction pathway has not been systematically addressed. Potential cosolute-induced alterations in target association are particularly important for a signaling molecule like calmodulin (CaM), where competition among >300 targets governs which pathways are selectively activated. To explore how high concentrations of cosolutes influence CaM-target affinity and kinetics, we methodically investigated each step of the CaM-target binding mechanism under crowded or osmolyte-rich environments mimicked by ficoll-70, dextran-10, and sucrose. All cosolutes stabilized compact conformers of CaM and modulated association kinetics by affecting diffusion and rates of conformational change; however, the results showed that differently sized molecules had variable effects to enhance or impede unique steps of the association pathway. On- and off-rates were modulated by all cosolutes in a compensatory fashion, producing little change in steady-state affinity. From this work insights were gained on how high concentrations of inert crowding agents and osmolytes fit into a kinetic framework to describe protein-protein interactions relevant for cellular signaling.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000359180400008	26244733

In this paper, we employed deep sequencing technology to sequence and identify microRNAs in M. incognita genome, which is one of the important plant parasitic nematodes. We identified 102 M. incognita microRNA genes, which can be grouped into 71 nonredundant miRNAs based on mature sequences. Among the 71 miRANs, 27 are known miRNAs and 44 are novel miRNAs. We identified seven miRNA clusters in M. incognita genome. Four of the seven clusters, miR-100/let-7, miR-71-1/miR-2a-1, miR-71-2/miR-2a-2 and miR-279/miR-2b are conserved in other species. We validated the expressions of 5 M. incognita microRNAs, including 3 known microRNAs (miR-71, miR-100b and let-7) and 2 novel microRNAs (NOVEL-1 and NOVEL-2), using RT-PCR. We can detect all 5 microRNAs. The expression levels of four microRNAs obtained using RT-PCR were consistent with those obtained by high-throughput sequencing except for those of let-7. We also examined how M. incognita miRNAs are conserved in four other nematodes species: C. elegans, A. suum, B. malayi and P. pacificus. We found that four microRNAs, miR-100, miR-92, miR-279 and miR-137, exist only in genomes of parasitic nematodes, but do not exist in the genomes of the free living nematode C. elegans. Our research created a unique resource for the research of plant parasitic nematodes. The candidate microRNAs could help elucidate the genomic structure, gene regulation, evolutionary processes, and developmental features of plant parasitic nematodes and nematode-plant interaction.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000358942700016	26241472

We have studied quantitatively the electrical transport through surface states in high-quality single crystals of SmB6. We observe a large nonlocal surface signal at temperatures lower than the bulk Kondo gap scale. Measurements and finite-element simulations allow us to distinguish unambiguously between the contributions from different transport channels. In contrast to general expectations, the electrical transport properties of the surface channels were found to be insensitive to high magnetic fields. We propose possible scenarios that might explain this unexpected finding. Local and nonlocal magnetoresistance measurements allowed us to identify possible signatures of helical spin states and strong interband scattering at the surface.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000358932600004

Cytoskeletal Reorganization Drives Mesenchymal Condensation and Regulates Downstream Molecular Signaling								PLOS ONE				10	8					e0134702	10.1371/journal.pone.0134702			AUG 3 2015	2015	Skeletal condensation occurs when specified mesenchyme cells self-organize over several days to form a distinctive cartilage template. Here, we determine how and when specified mesenchyme cells integrate mechanical and molecular information from their environment, forming cartilage condensations in the pharyngeal arches of chick embryos. By disrupting cytoskeletal reorganization, we demonstrate that dynamic cell shape changes drive condensation and modulate the response of the condensing cells to Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathways. Rho Kinase (ROCK)-driven actomyosin contractions and Myosin II-generated differential cell cortex tension regulate these cell shape changes. Disruption of the condensation process inhibits the differentiation of the mesenchyme cells into chondrocytes, demonstrating that condensation regulates the fate of the mesenchyme cells. We also find that dorsal and ventral condensations undergo distinct cell shape changes. BMP signaling is instructive for dorsal condensation-specific cell shape changes. Moreover, condensations exhibit ventral characteristics in the absence of BMP signaling, suggesting that in the pharyngeal arches ventral morphology is the ground pattern. Overall, this study characterizes the interplay between cytoskeletal dynamics and molecular signaling in a self-organizing system during tissue morphogenesis.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000358942400033	26237312

To overcome limitations of spin-coating such as excessive material waste and difficulty for scale-up, this paper introduces electrospray as a film deposition technique for solution-based chalcogenide glasses. Electrospray is shown to produce Ge23Sb7S70 films with similar surface quality and optical properties as films deposited by spin-coating. The advantages of electrospray deposition for nanoparticle dispersion, scalable and continuous manufacturing with little material waste, and comparable film quality to spin-coating make electrospray a promising deposition method for practical applications of chalcogenide glass films.

This stipulation is limiting for the verification and validation of numerical solutions where discontinuities are frequent. In an effort to adapt the standard method of manufactured solutions procedure, we propose a piecewise approach for modeling solutions with discontinuities. Linearly and quadratically exact transformations are used for determining the exact solutions and source terms for cells split by discontinuities. Upwind manufactured solutions are initialized and a least squares fit is used to solve for solutions downwind of the discontinuity such that the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are satisfied. The codes used throughout this research are finite volume, 1st and 2nd order, inviscid schemes combined with uniform structured grids. This study shows that a modified method of manufactured solutions procedure can be performed with fully general discontinuous solutions yielding 1st order convergences typically associated with shocks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-1452	1533-385X		WOS:000359313600023

J	Maier, Jonathan R. A.								On the computability of affordances as relations								AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING				29	3	SI		249	256		10.1017/S0890060415000207			AUG 2015	2015	One of the principal advantages of affordance-based design is that Gibson's theory of affordances is a relational theory, akin to other relational approaches such as relational biology and relational computer science. The relationships between artifacts and their designers and users are of such primary importance that only a theory that is able to deal with those relationships directly appears to be sufficient for describing the wide breadth of problems in engineering design. However, there is no precise definition for what qualifies as a relational theory. In mathematics, we do find something approaching a theory of relations, dating back at least to Charles Peirce's Logic of Relatives around 1870. While rather general, Peirce's ideas on the subject laid the foundation for advances in the 20th century, including the relational model of databases. This paper is a first attempt at applying the mathematics of relations to affordances, with the aim of more precisely characterizing affordances, which heretofore have been difficult to define and, lacking appropriate mathematics, nearly impossible to subject to computation. Meanwhile, the implicit computability of affordances as relations is demonstrated by examples drawn from engineering, physics, computer science, biology, and architecture.

The ABD ontology formalizes the entities, properties, and relationships within the domains of ABD. The ontology enables designers to describe the affordances of existing products and specify the intended affordances of future products in line with ABD. The ontology consists of 14 concepts and 5 relationships. The ontology is developed using Protege 4.3 and DL-query to query and reason with the ontology. The ontology is demonstrated using a consumer vacuum cleaner. The formal ontology serves as the basis for developing computer support for ABD applications. When implemented, these design tools will help designers manage the affordances of artifacts being designed, specifying the interacting entities of every affordance when a three-dimensional model of the artifact is available. Further, these software tools could be used to support ABD methods.

Three locations are examined in this long-term study: northeastern Brazil (August 2009 to August 2014), a midlatitude site in North Carolina, USA (June 2011 to December 2014), and a midlatitude site in Morocco (November 2013 to December 2014). We discuss the day-to-day, seasonal, and solar cycle trends and variations of thermospheric meridional winds, zonal winds, neutral temperatures, and for the first time vertical winds. Observations made from solar minimum to solar maximum (with F-10.7 values ranging from approximate to 70 to approximate to 159 solar flux units) confirm that neutral temperatures have a strong solar cycle dependence. However, this data set shows that the neutral winds are more closely tied to the seasonal variation, rather than the solar cycle. We also present comparisons between the two midlatitude sites and include neutral wind comparisons to the updated Horizontal Wind Model 14.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000362125300047

The extensometer is pushed into soil at depths of 5 m or more, and displacement between two anchors separated by similar to 1.5 m is measured with a resolution of better than 0.01 mu m (10(-8) m). The instrument is sensitive to load changes at the ground surface within a radial distance that is roughly twice its depth, potentially providing a method for averaging changes in water content over hundreds of m(2) or more. During a field trial at a site in South Carolina, compressive displacements in unsaturated saprolite were strongly correlated to rainfall with a calibration factor of 0.16 mu m displacement per mm of rainfall +/- 0.002 mu m/mm (R-2 = 0.95). Estimates of the net change in water volume per unit area made using the calibration factor from rainfall were similar to independent estimates of evapotranspiration. The technique was affected by barometric pressure variations, but the sensitivity was less than expected and does not hinder meaningful application. A companion instrument demonstrated the displacement signal was repeatable.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0043-1397	1944-7973		WOS:000363402800008

Using the DAS-ELISA Test to Establish an Effective Distance Between Bait Stations for Control of Linepithema humile (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Natural Areas								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				108	4			1961	1971		10.1093/jee/tov152			AUG 2015	2015	Linepithema humile (Mayr), the Argentine ant, is an invasive pest that has spread throughout the United States and is a problem in natural and managed habitats in South Carolina. Foraging patterns and the effectiveness of liquid baits for control of this pest have been studied in urban areas. However, similar studies have not been conducted in natural areas such as parks, picnic grounds, or campsites. L. humile populations can be large and widespread, making them a major nuisance pest for visitors to these natural areas. The primary objective of this study was to determine an effective distance between bait stations for control of L. humile in a natural area. A double antibody-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) procedure was used to detect individual ants that consumed rabbit immunoglobin (IgG) protein for marking and tracking. In both lab and field conditions, there was a significant difference in the detection of IgG in ants fed protein marker mixed with sugar water compared with ants only fed sugar water. Additional field studies revealed that an individual ant could retain detectable levels of protein marker for 3 d and that an ant feeding on IgG containing bait could be detected over 15 m from the original bait source. Overall, we found that using liquid ant baits, with a placement of 20 m between stations, was effective in reducing L. humile numbers between April to October, 2012 in a natural park area of Lake Greenwood State Park, SC.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000360626600058	26470341

Polycrystalline ceramics possessing a unique morphology can be achieved by optimizing the process parameters, particularly spark plasma sintering heating rate. The phase and morphology of the synthesized ceramics were investigated in detail using Xray diffraction, scanning electron microcopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It was observed that the grains of these bulk Pr-doped SrTiO3 ceramics were enhanced with Pr-rich grain boundaries. Electronic and thermal transport properties were also investigated as a function of temperature and doping concentration. Such a microstructure was found to give rise to improved thermoelectric properties. Specifically, it resulted in a significant improvement in carrier mobility and the thermoelectric power factor. Simultaneously, it also led to a marked reduction in the thermal conductivity. As a result, a significant improvement (> 30%) in the thermoelectric figure of merit was achieved for the whole temperature range over all previously reported maximum values for SrTiO3-based ceramics. This synthesis demonstrates the steps for the preparation of bulk polycrystalline ceramics of non-uniformly Pr-doped SrTiO3.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1940-087X			WOS:000361537100015

In vivo strains in the femur of the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus)								JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY				276	8			889	899		10.1002/jmor.20387			AUG 2015	2015	The capacity of limb bones to resist the locomotor loads they encounter depends on both the pattern of those loads and the material properties of the skeletal elements. Among mammals, understanding of the interplay between these two factors has been based primarily on evidence from locomotor behaviors in upright placentals, which show limb bones that are loaded predominantly in anteroposterior bending with minimal amounts of torsion. However, loading patterns from the femora of opossums, marsupials using crouched limb posture, show appreciable torsion while the bone experiences mediolateral (ML) bending. These data indicated greater loading diversity in mammals than was previously recognized, and suggested the possibility that ancestral loading patterns found in sprawling lineages (e.g., reptilian sauropsids) might have been retained among basal mammals. To further test this hypothesis, we recorded in vivo locomotor strains from the femur of the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), a member of the basal xenarthran clade of placental mammals that also uses crouched limb posture. Orientations of principal strains and magnitudes of shear strains indicate that armadillo femora are exposed to only limited torsion; however, bending is essentially ML, placing the medial aspect of the femur in compression and the lateral aspect in tension. This orientation of bending is similar to that found in opossums, but planar strain analyses indicate much more of the armadillo femur experiences tension during bending, potentially due to muscles pulling on the large, laterally positioned third trochanter. Limb bone safety factors were estimated between 3.3 and 4.3 in bending, similar to other placental mammals, but lower than opossums and most sprawling taxa. Thus, femoral loading patterns in armadillos show a mixture of similarities to both opossums (ML bending) and other placentals (limited torsion and low safety factors), along with unique features (high axial tension) that likely relate to their distinctive hindlimb anatomy.

The governing partial differential equation is discretized into a single-mode nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE). Solution of the nonlinear ODE is analytically approximated using the method of multiple scales. Comparison to experimental data reveals that the single-mode analytical solution is capable of capturing the nonlinear bending behaviour missed by a previously solved linearized model. It is also shown that limitations due to the system-identification data-collection method affect the ability of the model to capture the degree of nonlinearity present at lower strain levels. While this limitation has no observable effect on the previously studied linearized system response, nonlinear modelling can benefit from further work performed in the low strain characterization of expanded polymer foam. Lastly, the nonlinear solution is used to study the effect of varying excitation acceleration and static stress on the frequency response of expanded polymer foam.

To move towards gene discovery and marker-assisted breeding in cacao, a single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) identification project was undertaken using RNAseq data from 16 diverse cacao cultivars. RNA sequences were aligned to the assembled transcriptome of the cultivar Matina 1-6, and 330,000 SNPs within coding regions were identified. From these SNPs, a subset of 6,000 high-quality SNPs were selected for inclusion on an Illumina Infinium SNP array: the Cacao6kSNP array. Using Cacao6KSNP array data from over 1,000 cacao samples, we demonstrate that our custom array produces a saturated genetic map and can be used to distinguish among even closely related genotypes. Our study enhances and expands the genetic resources available to the cacao research community, and provides the genome-scale set of tools that are critical for advancing breeding with molecular markers in an agricultural species with high genetic diversity.									2	1	0	2	0	3			1340-2838	1756-1663		WOS:000362346000004	26070980	
J	Morris, Eric A.; Guerra, Erick								Are we there yet? Trip duration and mood during travel								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR				33				38	47		10.1016/j.trf.2015.06.003			AUG 2015	2015	Are longer trips more strenuous or unpleasant than shorter ones? This paper examines this question using data from the American Time Use Survey's well-being module, which queried individuals about the extent to which they felt happiness, pain, sadness, stress, and fatigue during three randomly selected daily activities. Over 22,000 instances of individuals traveling are observed, including their trip duration, mode, purpose, and demographic and geographic information. Each emotion, plus a constructed, composite mood variable, is regressed on trip duration. Overall, the relationship between trip duration and traveler mood is not strong, which is unsurprising given prior findings on the limited impact of activities on mood. However, there is a statistically significant and negative association between trip duration and mood, primarily because of rising stress, fatigue and sadness on long trips. This is particularly true for drivers, while negative emotions do not rise with increasing trip duration for auto passengers. This suggests strain rises as the result of operating the vehicle for long periods, not traveling in an auto per se. Long bicycle trips are more painful than shorter ones, probably due to the physical demands of the mode, and long train trips are associated with less sadness. For commutes, long trips significantly degrade the mood of both drivers and bus riders, in the latter case probably due in part to vehicle crowding and standing. The findings imply that reducing the duration of trips, for example through land use policies that reduce trip distances, or congestion reduction, would have emotional benefits. Policies to promote ridesharing instead of solo driving for long trips may increase traveler mood in the aggregate. Improving bus service or substituting rail for bus for long commute trips may also improve traveler mood. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The morphology and the size distribution of the dried particles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; particle size distribution was evaluated using laser diffraction; copper content was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy; and finally, the oxidation state of copper was determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Plate-like structures of cellulose and cellulose-copper nanoparticles were formed after the freeze-drying process, with length and width over hundreds of microns. Most of the spray dried particles exhibited spherical shapes with the particle size ranging from around 300 nm to several microns. The spray drying process caused more copper loss compared with freeze drying, most probably because of the additional steps required to perform the spray drying. XPS results showed that the state of oxidation of the final dried material depends on the specific substrate. CMC surfaces exhibit mostly Cu-0 and/or Cu+. On the contrary TNFC surfaces present mostly Cu2+. Solvent exchange process using ethanol and butanol creates more porous structures on the CMC substrates. A solvent exchange process using ethanol and tert-butanol sequence facilitates the formation of a more porous structure on TEMPO nanofibrillated cellulose.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0969-0239	1572-882X		WOS:000361003100040

JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				108	4			1540	1544		10.1093/jee/tov156			AUG 2015	2015	In 1999, crop consultants scouting for stink bugs (Hemiptera spp.) in South Carolina discovered a formerly unobserved seed rot of cotton that caused yield losses ranging from 10 to 15% in certain fields. The disease has subsequently been reported in fields throughout the southeastern Cotton Belt. Externally, diseased bolls appeared undamaged; internally, green fruit contain pink to dark brown, damp, deformed lint, and necrotic seeds. In greenhouse experiments, we demonstrated transmission of the opportunistic bacterium Pantoea agglomerans by the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.). Here, green bolls were sampled from stink bug management plots (insecticide protected or nontreated) from four South Atlantic coast states (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida) to determine disease incidence in the field and its association with piercing-sucking insects feeding. A logistic regression analysis of the boll damage data revealed that disease was 24 times more likely to occur (P = 0.004) in bolls collected from plots in Florida, where evidence of pest pressure was highest, than in bolls harvested in NC with the lowest detected insect pressure. Fruit from plots treated with insecticide, a treatment which reduced transmission agent numbers, were 4 times less likely to be diseased than bolls from unprotected sites (P = 0.002). Overall, punctured bolls were 125 times more likely to also have disease symptoms than nonpunctured bolls, irrespective of whether or not plots were protected with insecticides (P = 0.0001). Much of the damage to cotton bolls that is commonly attributed to stink bug feeding is likely the resulting effect of vectored pathogens.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000360626600010	26470293

Action Thresholds for Managing Megacopta cribraria (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) in Soybean Based on Sweep-Net Sampling								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				108	4			1818	1829		10.1093/jee/tov171			AUG 2015	2015	The kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (F.), first discovered in the United States in 2009, has rapidly become a pest of commercial soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, throughout much of the southeast. Because of its recent arrival, management practices and recommendations are not well established. To develop action thresholds, we evaluated insecticide applications targeted at different densities of adults and nymphs determined using the standard 38-cm diameter sweep net sampling method in 12 soybean field trials conducted in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina from 2011 to 2013. Average peak densities of M. cribraria in the untreated controls reached as high as 63.5 +/- 11.0 adults per sweep and 34.7 +/- 8.0 nymphs per sweep. Insecticide applications triggered at densities of one adult or nymph of M. cribraria per sweep, two adults or nymphs per sweep, and one adult or nymph per sweep, with nymphs present, resulted in no yield reductions in most cases compared with plots that were aggressively protected with multiple insecticide applications. A single insecticide application timed at the R3 or R4 soybean growth stages also resulted in yields that were equivalent to the aggressively protected plots. Typically, treatments (excluding the untreated control) that resulted in fewer applications were more cost-effective. These results suggest that a single insecticide application targeting nymphs was sufficient to prevent soybean yield reduction at the densities of M. cribraria that we observed.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000360626600041	26470324	
J	Grabke, Anja; Stammler, Gerd								A Botrytis cinerea Population from a Single Strawberry Field in Germany has a Complex Fungicide Resistance Pattern								PLANT DISEASE				99	8			1078	1086		10.1094/PDIS-07-14-0710-RE			AUG 2015	2015	Gray mold, caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea, is one of the most important diseases of strawberry in Germany. The application of site-specific fungicides remains the main strategy to reduce disease incidence and severity in the field. Isolates (n = 199) were collected from fungicide-treated strawberry fruit at a German research site with a long history of fungicide efficacy trials against gray mold. Sensitivities to the six site-specific botryticides registered in Germany were determined using microtiter assays. Values for the concentration of a fungicide at which fungal development is inhibited by 50% (EC(5)0) ranged from 0.03 to >= 30 ppm for the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor boscalid, 0.015 to >= 10 ppm for the hydroxyanilide fenhexamid, 0.009 to 0.739 ppm for the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil, 0.55 to 43.45 ppm for the dicarboximide iprodione, 0.021 to >= 3 ppm for the quinone outside inhibitor pyraclos-trobin, and 0.106 to >= 30 ppm for the anilinopyrimidine pyrimethanil. Pyrosequencing revealed that amino acid substitutions in the target proteins Bos1 (I365S/N, V368F + Q369H), CytB (G143A), Erg27 (F412S), and SdhB (P225F, N230I, and H272R/Y) were associated with reduced sensitivity levels to the corresponding fungicide classes. In most cases, isolates with a decreased sensitivity to fludioxonil showed a reduced sensitivity to tolnaftate. This reduction is considered to be an indication of multidrug efflux pump activity. The amino acid change I365S, I365N, or V368F + Q369H in Bosl and H272R in SdhB by itself showed EC50 values of 3.99 to 14.73 ppm, 3.87 to 5.37 ppm, 4.81 to 15.63 ppm, and 2.071 to >= 30ppm, respectively. When isolates that contained one of these mutations were also multidrug resistant, the ranges of EC50 values shifted to 6.47 to 43.45 ppm for I365S, 7.28 to 29.84 ppm for I365N, 6.89 to 26.67 ppm for V368F + Q369H, and >= 30 ppm for H272R. The reported data suggest that the combination of multidrug resistance and an amino acid change in the target site may result in a lower sensitivity to the fungicides than one resistance mechanism by itself. Although 20% of the population analyzed was sensitive to all six different chemical classes, the majority showed reduced sensitivity to one (6%), two (13%), three (23%), four (17%), five (11%), and six (11%) different fungicides.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000360866300004		
J	Gao, Yu; Shi, Lu								Mindfulness, Physical Activity and Avoidance of Secondhand Smoke: A Study of College Students in Shanghai								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH				12	8			10106	10116		10.3390/ijerph120810106			AUG 2015	2015	Introduction: To better understand the documented link between mindfulness and longevity, we examine the association between mindfulness and conscious avoidance of secondhand smoke (SHS), as well as the association between mindfulness and physical activity. Method: In Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) we surveyed a convenience sample of 1516 college freshmen. We measured mindfulness, weekly physical activity, and conscious avoidance of secondhand smoke, along with demographic and behavioral covariates. We used a multilevel logistic regression to test the association between mindfulness and conscious avoidance of secondhand smoke, and used a Tobit regression model to test the association between mindfulness and metabolic equivalent hours per week. In both models the home province of the student respondent was used as the cluster variable, and demographic and behavioral covariates, such as age, gender, smoking history, household registration status (urban vs. rural), the perceived smog frequency in their home towns, and the asthma diagnosis. Results: The logistic regression of consciously avoiding SHS shows that a higher level of mindfulness was associated with an increase in the odds ratio of conscious SHS avoidance (logged odds: 0.22, standard error: 0.07, p < 0.01). The Tobit regression shows that a higher level of mindfulness was associated with more metabolic equivalent hours per week (Tobit coefficient: 4.09, standard error: 1.13, p < 0.001). Discussion: This study is an innovative attempt to study the behavioral issue of secondhand smoke from the perspective of the potential victim, rather than the active smoker. The observed associational patterns here are consistent with previous findings that mindfulness is associated with healthier behaviors in obesity prevention and substance use. Research designs with interventions are needed to test the causal link between mindfulness and these healthy behaviors.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1660-4601			WOS:000360587800096	26308029

Here we demonstrate femtoscale displacement transduction using an AlGaN/GaN heterojunction field effect transistor-integrated GaN microcantilever that utilizes piezoelectric polarization-induced changes in two-dimensional electron gas to transduce displacement with very high sensitivity. The piezotransistor demonstrated an ultra-high gauge factor of 8,700 while consuming an extremely low power of 1.36 nW, and transduced external excitation with a superior noise-limited resolution of 12.43 fm Hz(-1/2) and an outstanding responsivity of 170 nV fm(-1), which is comparable to the optical transduction limits. These extraordinary characteristics, which enabled unique detection of nanogram quantity of analytes using photoacoustic spectroscopy, can be readily exploited in realizing a multitude of novel sensing paradigms.									6	0	0	3	0	6			2041-1723			WOS:000360344500004	26258983

In this study, the authors realise an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Inputs and outputs of the proposed ALU keep the logical reversibility in computation processes. The proposed ALU is capable of performing four logical (AND, OR, EX-OR and NOT) with three arithmetic (addition, subtraction and multiplication) operations. They use DNA-based multiplexer to carry out final output. Compared to silicon-based computation, the proposed ALU is faster and requires less space and power due to parallelism, replication properties, compactness and formation of DNA strands. However, compared to one existing DNA-based system, fewer signals are required in each step. Besides, another existing DNA-based ALU requires five complex biological steps to compute, whereas the proposed ALU requires three biological steps. Also, the time complexities of that existing system are O(mln(2)n) for addition and subtraction operations; O(m) for logical operations and O(m(ln(2)n)(2)) for multiplication operation, while the proposed system has O(1) for logical operations and O(n) for others; here n is the number of bits and m is the number of test tubes for operands.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1751-8741	1751-875X		WOS:000359478100010	26224353

Changes in a transistor's equivalent resistance and capacitance can affect the frequency and damping factor of the characteristic ringing detected on the inverter's output. In this paper, the matrix pencil method is used to locate the poles associated with this ringing, and detect shifts in position that indicate transistor degradation.

Inhibition of Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Growth by Transgenic Corn Expressing Bt Toxins and Development of Resistance to Cry1Ab								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				44	4			1275	1285		10.1093/ee/nvv076			AUG 2015	2015	Transgenic corn, Zea mays L., that expresses the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin Cry1Ab is only moderately toxic to Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and has been planted commercially since 1996. Growth and development of H. zea was monitored to determine potential changes in susceptibility to this toxin over time. Small plots of corn hybrids expressing Cry1F, Cry1F x Cry1Ab, Cry1Ab x Cry3Bb1, Cry1A.105 x Cry2Ab2 x Cry3Bb1, Cry1A.105 x Cry2Ab2, and Vip3Aa20 x Cry1Ab x mCry3A were planted in both 2012 and 2013 in North and South Carolina with paired non-Bt hybrids from the same genetic background. H. zea larvae were sampled on three time periods from ears and the following factors were measured: kernel area injured (cm 2) by H. zea larvae, larval number per ear, larval weight, larval length, and larval head width. Pupae were sampled on a single time period and the following factors recorded: number per ear, weight, time to eclosion, and the number that eclosed. There was no reduction in larval weight, number of insect entering the pupal stadium, pupal weight, time to eclosion, and number of pupae able to successfully eclose to adulthood in the hybrid expressing Cry1Ab compared with a non-Bt paired hybrid. As Cry1Ab affected these in 1996, H. zea may be developing resistance to Cry1Ab in corn, although these results are not comprehensive, given the limited sampling period, size, and geography. We also found that the negative impacts on larval growth and development were greater in corn hybrids with pyramided traits compared with single traits.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000359668100038	26314074

This study examined service use behavior, barriers, and facilitators of mental health treatment-seeking in an active duty sample of 927 U.S. Army soldiers with mental health problems. SA victims (n = 113) did not differ from non-victims on barriers or facilitators after adjusting for demographic and mental health variables, with stigma rated as the largest barrier. Most SA victims (87.6%) had sought informal support and 59.3% had sought formal treatment. One third of treatment-seekers had dropped out of treatment. Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified several correlates of treatment-seeking among SA victims: Black race (OR = 7.57), SA during the military (OR = 4.34), positive treatment beliefs (OR = 2.22), social support for treatment (OR = 2.14), self-reliance (OR = 0.47), and stigma towards treatment seekers (OR = 0.43). Mental health symptoms were not associated with treatment seeking. Findings suggested that treatment-facilitating interventions should focus on improving recognition of mental health symptoms, altering perceptions related to self-reliance, and reducing stigma. Interventions should also enlist support for treatment-seeking from unit members, leaders, and significant others.Resumen ABUSO SEXUAL: BARRERAS Y FACILITADORES DE TRATAMIENTO Pese a las significativas necesidades de atencion en salud mental entre las victimas de agresion sexual en la milicia, poco se conoce sobre los patrones de busqueda de tratamiento o factores asociados al uso de servicios. Este estudio examino la conducta en el uso de servicios y las barreras y facilitadores en la busqueda de tratamiento en el area de salud mental en una muestra de 927 de soldados de la Armada de USA en servicio activo, con problemas de salud mental. Las victimas con AS (n = 123) no difirieron respecto de las barreras y facilitadores despues de ajustar las variables demograficas y de salud mental, en cuanto al estigma, calificado como la mayor barrera. La mayoria de las victimas con AS (87,6%) habian buscado apoyo informal y 59,3% habian buscado tratamiento formal. Un tercio de los que buscaron tratamiento desertaron. El analisis de regresion logistica multivariada identifico varios correlatos entre las victimas de AS que buscaron tratamiento: raza negra (OR = 7.57), AS durante el ejercicio de la milicia (OR = 4.34), creencias positivas acerca de los tratamientos (OR = 2.22), apoyo social para tratamiento (OR = 2.14), autosuficiencia (OR = 0.47) y estigma hacia los buscadores de tratamiento (OR = 0.43). Los sintomas de salud mental no se asociaron con la busqueda de tratamiento. Los hallazgos sugieren que las intervenciones terapeuticas facilitadoras deberian focalizarse en mejorar el reconocimiento de los sintomas de salud mental, modificacion de la percepcion relacionadas con la autosuficiencia y reducir el estigma. Las intervenciones deberian igualmente considerar apoyo en la busqueda de tratamiento desde los miembros, lideres y otros significantes de la unidad.Traditional and Simplified Chinese Abstracts by AsianSTSS ?? : ??????????????????????????? ??: ??????????(SA)??????????????,?????????????????????????????????927???????????????,???????????????????????????????????????????????, ??SA???(n = 113) ??????????????,???????????????SA???(87.6%)?????????,59.3%???????????????????????????????????SA?????????????(OR = 7.57)??????SA(OR = 4.34)?????????(OR = 2.22)??????????(OR = 2.14)???(OR = 0.47)???????????(OR = 0.43)?????????????????????,???????????????????????,???????????????????????????????????????????? ?? : ?????????????????????????? ??: ??????????(SA)??????????????,?????????????????????????????????927???????????????,???????????????????????????????????????????????, ??SA???(n = 113) ??????????????,???????????????SA???(87.6%)?????????,59.3%???????????????????????????????????SA?????????????(OR = 7.57)?????SA(OR = 4.34)?????????(OR = 2.22)??????????(OR = 2.14)???(OR = 0.47)???????????(OR = 0.43)?????????????????????,???????????????????????,????????????????????????????????????????????									2	0	0	0	0	2			0894-9867	1573-6598		WOS:000359912400004	26215254

Genetic introgression of novel alleles from related species is being pursued to expand genetic diversity. This process is, however, challenging and requires the incorporation of innovative genomic and statistical tools to facilitate efficient transfer of these exotic alleles across the multiple generations required for introgression. In this study, pedigree-based analysis (PBA) in a Bayesian QTL mapping framework was applied to a diverse peach pedigree introgressed with almond and other related Prunus species. The aim was to investigate the genetic control of eight commercially important fruit productivity and fruit quality traits over two subsequent years. Fifty-two QTLs with at least positive evidence explaining up to 98 % of the phenotypic variance across all trait/year combinations were mapped separately per trait and year. Several QTLs exhibited variable association with traits between years. By using the peach genome sequence as a reference, the intrachromosomal positions for several QTLs were shown to differ from those previously reported in peach. The inclusion of introgressed germplasm and the explicit declaration of the genetic structure of the pedigree as covariate in PBA enhanced the mapping and interpretation of QTLs. This study serves as a model study for PBA in a diverse peach breeding program, and the results highlight the ability of this strategy to identify genomic resources for direct utilization in marker-assisted breeding.									7	0	0	5	0	7			1380-3743	1572-9788		WOS:000360005100013

The best-characterized MSI1 target is Numb mRNA, whose encoded protein negatively regulates Notch signaling. Additional MSI1 targets include the mRNAs for the tumor suppressor protein APC that regulates Wnt signaling and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21(WAF-1). We hypothesized that increased expression of NUMB, P21 and APC, through inhibition of MSI1 RNA-binding activity might be an effective way to simultaneously downregulate Wnt and Notch signaling, thus blocking the growth of a broad range of cancer cells. We used a fluorescence polarization assay to screen for small molecules that disrupt the binding of MSI1 to its consensus RNA binding site. One of the top hits was (-)-gossypol (Ki = 476 +/- 273 nM), a natural product from cottonseed, known to have potent anti-tumor activity and which has recently completed Phase IIb clinical trials for prostate cancer. Surface plasmon resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance studies demonstrate a direct interaction of (-)-gossypol with the RNA binding pocket of MSI1. We further showed that (-)-gossypol reduces Notch/Wnt signaling in several colon cancer cell lines having high levels of MSI1, with reduced SURVIVIN expression and increased apoptosis/autophagy. Finally, we showed that orally administered (-)-gossypol inhibits colon cancer growth in a mouse xenograft model. Our study identifies (-)-gossypol as a potential small molecule inhibitor of MSI1-RNA interaction, and suggests that inhibition of MSI1's RNA binding activity may be an effective anti-cancer strategy.

PSGE occurs when the expression level of a gene depends on whether an allele was inherited from the mother or the father. Kin selection theory predicts that there should be extensive PSGE in social insects because social insect parents can gain inclusive fitness benefits by silencing parental alleles in female offspring. We searched for evidence of PSGE in honey bees using transcriptomes from reciprocal crosses between European and Africanized strains. We found 46 transcripts with significant parent-of-origin effects on gene expression, many of which overexpressed the maternal allele. Interestingly, we also found a large proportion of genes showing a bias toward maternal alleles in only one of the reciprocal crosses. These results indicate that PSGE may occur in social insects. The nonreciprocal effects could be largely driven by hybrid incompatibility between these strains. Future work will help to determine if these are indeed parent-of-origin effects that can modulate inclusive fitness benefits.									6	0	0	6	0	6			2160-1836			WOS:000359265800012	26048562

We describe and evaluate two techniques for subcarrier ordering in half-duplex packet radio systems, including OFDM dynamic spectrum access systems. The ordering techniques require no estimates of subchannel gains or subcarrier signal strengths. The performance of each technique is evaluated for channels with fading and for channels with interference and fading.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1089-7798	1558-2558		WOS:000359539400040

A "Manifest Violation" of the Rights of Englishmen: Rights Talk and the Law of Property in Early Eighteenth-Century Jamaica								LAW AND HISTORY REVIEW				33	3			543	575		10.1017/S0738248015000279			AUG 2015	2015	In 1706, Jamaica's provost marshal received a writ of escheat from the island's Supreme Court of Judicature. The writ directed him to empanel a jury of Twelve and Lawful Men of the Neighbourhood who would determine whether the slaves of James Whitchurch, a Jamaican merchant, should be escheatedreturnedto the Crown. Did the Negro Woman Slave Commonly Called Catalina and her Seaven Pickaninny belong to Whitchurch, or could Queen Anne claim her prerogative right to an escheat because the previous owner of the slaves, Charles Delamaine, had died without an heir? The jury found in the Crown's favor, but a dissatisfied Whitchurch petitioned Queen Anne for relief, asking her to return the slaves and quiet his title. Whitchurch's petition, the first Jamaican escheat case to come before the Queen, sparked a transatlantic legal controversy as colonists, Assembly members, and imperial officials weighed the Crown's prerogative right to escheats against local political grievances and the Board of Trade's desire to encourage West Indian settlement and trade. This seemingly mundane conflict over property law quickly acquired constitutional significance, generating the kind of rights talk so familiar to early American historians: Jamaican colonists claimed the rights of Englishmen, and the Jamaican Assembly asserted an institutional capacity akin to Parliament. In this article, I contextualize colonists' rights talk, rooting their claims to English rights in concerns about the administration of property law during a crucial liminal moment in Jamaican history. As the colony transitioned from a small-scale to a large-scale plantation economy and from a society with slaves to a slave society, property and the law that governed it became the focus of intense political conflict.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0738-2480	1939-9022		WOS:000359282000002

Barritt, Alfred/0000-0002-4200-3256			Predicting Liver Transplant Capacity Using Discrete Event Simulation								MEDICAL DECISION MAKING				35	6			784	796		10.1177/0272989X14559055			AUG 2015	2015	The number of liver transplants (LTs) performed in the US increased until 2006 but has since declined despite an ongoing increase in demand. This decline may be due in part to decreased donor liver quality and increasing discard of poor-quality livers. We constructed a discrete event simulation (DES) model informed by current donor characteristics to predict future LT trends through the year 2030. The data source for our model is the United Network for Organ Sharing database, which contains patient-level information on all organ transplants performed in the US. Previous analysis showed that liver discard is increasing and that discarded organs are more often from donors who are older, are obese, have diabetes, and donated after cardiac death. Given that the prevalence of these factors is increasing, the DES model quantifies the reduction in the number of LTs performed through 2030. In addition, the model estimatesthe total number of future donors needed to maintain the current volume of LTs and the effect of a hypothetical scenario of improved reperfusion technology.We also forecast the number of patients on the waiting list and compare this with the estimated number of LTs to illustrate the impact that decreased LTs will have on patients needing transplants. By altering assumptions about the future donor pool, this model can be used to develop policy interventions to prevent a further decline in this lifesaving therapy. To our knowledge, there are no similar predictive models of future LT use based on epidemiological trends.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-989X	1552-681X		WOS:000359427600011	25391681	
J	Murdoch, Lawrence C.; Xie, Shuangshuang; Falta, Ronald W.; Ruprecht, Catherine								Effects of increased upward flux of dissolved salts caused by CO2 storage or other factors								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY				527				776	787		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.05.022			AUG 2015	2015	Injection of CO2 in deep saline aquifers is being considered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, and this process is expected to increase formation pressure with the potential consequence of increasing the upward flux of saline water. Saline and brackish groundwater occur naturally at shallow depths above many sedimentary basins, where an upward flux of solutes could degrade the quality of freshwater aquifers and affect aquatic ecosystems. Relatively large fluxes of salty water could be transported upward along preferential paths, like faults or improperly abandoned wells. Diffuse upward flow through the natural stratigraphy could also occur in response to basin pressurization. This process would be slower, but diffuse upward flow could affect larger areas than flow through preferential paths, and this motivated us to evaluate the associated effects. We analyzed idealized 2D and 3D geometries representing the essential details of a shallow, freshwater aquifer underlain by salty groundwater. First, we simulated the development of a freshwater aquifer by flushing out saline water as an initialization step, followed by simulations of a pulse-like increase in the upward flux from the basin. The results showed that increasing the upward flux from a basin increased the salt concentration and mass loading of salt to streams, and decreased the depth to the transition of fresh/salt groundwater. The magnitude of these effects varied widely, from a small, slow process that would be challenging to detect, to a large, rapid response that could be an environmental catastrophe. The magnitude of the increased flux, and the initial depth to the fresh/salt transition in groundwater controlled the concentration and mass loading of water discharging to streams and the change in the depth to the fresh/salt transition. We also identified impact categories for salt concentration, mass loading, and freshwater aquifer thickness, and used these categories to characterize the severity of the response. This showed that the impact depends on the magnitude of upward flux. Impact appeared minor when the upward flux was smaller than a few tenths of the magnitude of recharge, but it could be significant when the upward flux was greater than the recharge, according to the 2D analyses. Hydrostratigraphy will also play an important role by localizing the discharge of salty water, according to 3D analyses. The major contribution of this work is that it shows how a large increase in diffuse upward flux from a basin could cause significant problems, but a small increase in upward flux may occur without significantly impairing the shallow freshwater flow system. This heightens the importance of understanding interactions between shallow and deep hydrologic systems when characterizing CO2 storage projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In human cRCTs, clusters that are randomly assigned are typically families, classrooms, schools, worksites, or counties. With growing interest in community-based, public health, and policy interventions to reduce obesity or improve nutrition, the use of cRCTs has increased. Errors in the design, analysis, and interpretation of cRCTs are unfortunately all too common. This situation seems to stem in part from investigator confusion about how the unit of randomization affects causal inferences and the statistical procedures required for the valid estimation and testing of effects. In this article, we provide a brief introduction and overview of the importance of cRCTs and highlight and explain important considerations for the design, analysis, and reporting of cRCTs by using published examples.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0002-9165	1938-3207		WOS:000359037800004	26016864

Naringin and limonin have different polarity and solubility values, causing difficulty in simultaneous extraction and quantification. A procedure combining HPLC and solid-phase extraction was developed to simultaneously quantify these analytes in citrus juice. Analytes exhibited calibration curves of good linearity along with low limit of detection and limit of quantification values. Naringin, prunin, naringenin, and limonin exhibited respective recovery values of 92.2-100.6, 92.0-97.3, 98.1-102.2, and 102.4-103.9%, respectively. Relative standard deviations were lower than 5%. For analysis of naringin, prunin, naringenin, and limonin in citrus juices, the simultaneous method displayed analytical results identical to traditional respective quantification methods. The simultaneous method is highly effective for monitoring naringin, prunin, naringenin, and limonin levels in citrus juice.									0	1	0	0	0	1			1226-7708	2092-6456		WOS:000358801400008		
J	Wright, Robert R.; Mohr, Cynthia D.; Sinclair, Robert R.; Yang, Liu-Qin								Sometimes less is more: Directed coping with interpersonal stressors at work								JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR				36	6			786	805		10.1002/job.2002			AUG 2015	2015	Within the coping literature, researchers have long been interested in identifying ways in which individuals can improve their coping efforts, making them more effective and thereby reducing the harmful effects of stressful encounters. Although Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model has greatly advanced understanding of the coping process, there continues to be methodological and conceptual challenges that have hindered understanding of the mechanisms behind effective coping. Addressing these issues in the use of a novel approach of analyzing variation in coping (i.e., directed coping) at both the coping event and person coping levels, the current study examined the process of coping with work stress and the beneficial coping outcomes associated with using a directed coping strategy. A total of 143 nurses completed up to 12 weekly surveys online, reporting on weekly stressful interpersonal conflicts and how they coped with them. Results from multilevel analyses supported predictions that greater directed coping at both the level of the coping event and person is associated with improvements in occupational health outcomes even after controlling for other coping factors. Implications of these results are discussed in relation to future research on coping effectiveness and workplace applications.

J	Oberdan, Thomas								From Helmholtz to Schlick: The evolution of the sign-theory of perception								STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE				52				35	43		10.1016/j.shpsa.2015.04.004			AUG 2015	2015	Efforts to trace the influence of fin de siecle neo-Kantianism on early 20th Century philosophy of science have led scholars to recognize the powerful influence on Moritz Schlick of Hermann von Helmholtz, the doyen of 19th Century physics and a leader of the zuruck zu Kant movement. But Michael Friedman thinks that Schlick misunderstood Helmholtz' signature philosophical doctrine, the sign-theory of perception. Indeed, Friedman has argued that Schlick transformed Helmholtz' Kantian view of spatial intuition into an empiricist version of the causal theory of perception. However, it will be argued that, despite the key role the sign-theory played in his epistemology, Schlick thought the Kantianism in Helmholtz' thought was deeply flawed, rendered obsolete by philosophical insights which emerged from recent scientific developments. So even though Schlick embraced the sign-theory, he rejected Helmholtz' ideas about spatial intuition. In fact, like his teacher, Max Planck, Schlick generalized the sign-theory into a form of structural realism. At the same time, Schlick borrowed the method of concept-formation developed by the formalist mathematicians, Moritz Pasch and David Hilbert, and combined it with the conventionalism of Henri Poincare. Then, to link formally defined concepts with experience, Schlick's introduced his 'method of coincidences', similar to the 'point-coincidences' featured in Einstein's physics. The result was an original scientific philosophy, which owed much to contemporary scientific thinkers, but little to Kant or Kantianism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Morris, Eric A.								Should we all just stay home? Travel, out-of-home activities, and life satisfaction								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE				78				519	536		10.1016/j.tra.2015.06.009			AUG 2015	2015	How and why travel contributes to our life satisfaction is of considerable import for transportation policy and planning. This paper empirically examines this relationship using data from the American Time Use Survey. It finds that, controlling for relevant demographic, geographic, and temporal covariates, travel time per day is significantly and positively associated with life satisfaction. This relationship is attenuated, but still significant, when the amount of time spent participating in out-of-home activities is controlled for. Time spent bicycling is strongly associated with higher life satisfaction, though it attains significance only in some models; time spent walking is also quite positive, though it is not significant. However, both walking and bicycling are positively and significantly associated with life satisfaction when time spent on purely recreational walking and bicycling is included. Life satisfaction is positively and significantly associated with time spent traveling for the purposes of eating and drinking, religious activities, volunteering, and playing and watching sports. Travel time exhibits a strong positive relationship with life satisfaction in smaller towns and cities, but in large cities the association weakens, and for very large cities travel time may actually not be associated with life satisfaction at all. This may be due to the costs of traffic congestion, which disproportionately exists in large cities. In all, while the associations between travel and life satisfaction are clear, the causal story is complex, with the positive relationships potentially being explained by (1) travel allowing us to access destinations that make us happy, (2) the act of travel itself being fulfilling, and/or (3) intrinsically happier people being more likely to travel. In all likelihood, all three factors are at play. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0965-8564			WOS:000359169100038

In this study, several electrochemical measurements were performed on steel immersed in simulated concrete pore solution (with and without chloride ions) under different types and levels of mechanical loadings. Results indicate that steel specimens immersed in chloride-free pore solution under tensile loadings passivate more rapidly compared with those under compressive loadings. However, the situation in chloride-contaminated solution is different, and steel under tensile stress exhibits more corrosion than steel under compressive stress or under no load.

Association of DLA-DQB1 alleles with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in Pembroke Welsh Corgis								ANIMAL GENETICS				46	4			462	465		10.1111/age.12317			AUG 2015	2015	Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is a digestive disorder resulting from the insufficient secretion of enzymes from the pancreas. In dogs, this condition is often attributed to pancreatic acinar atrophy, wherein the enzyme-producing acinar cells are believed to be destroyed through an autoimmune process. Although EPI affects many diverse breeds, to date, molecular studies have been limited to the German Shepherd dog. A recent study of major histocompatibility genes in diseased and healthy German Shepherd dogs identified both risk and protective haplotypes. Herein, we genotyped DLA-DQB1 in Pembroke Welsh Corgis to determine whether dog leukocyte antigen alleles contribute to the pathogenesis of EPI across dog breeds. We evaluated 14 affected and 43 control Pembroke Welsh Corgis, which were selected based on an age of onset similar to German Shepherd dogs. We identified one protective allele (odds ratio=0.13, P-value=0.044) and one risk allele (odds ratio=3.8, P-value=0.047). As in German Shepherd dogs, the risk allele is a duplication of DLA-DQB1 (alleles DQB1*013:03 and 017:01); however, Pembroke Welsh Corgis have acquired a single polymorphism on DQB1*017:01. Thus, the DLA-DQB1 duplication is a risk allele for EPI in at least two breeds.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-9146	1365-2052		WOS:000358641800018	26095904	
J	Casabianca, Leah B.; Sarda, Yifat; Bergman, Elad; Nevo, Uri; Frydman, Lucio								Single-Sided Stray-Field NMR Profiling Using Chirped Radiofrequency Pulses								APPLIED MAGNETIC RESONANCE				46	8			909	919		10.1007/s00723-015-0693-0			AUG 2015	2015	Single-sided nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scanners find increased use in applications where non-destructive measurements are needed. These single-sided scanners are characterized by a weak magnetic field and a large stray magnetic field gradient. These characteristics make these scanners suitable for determining a sample's proton density profile, or for mapping NMR properties such as T (1), T (2) or diffusivity as a function of distance. The strong stray-field gradient generated by these magnets dictates a need for relatively high transmission/reception bandwidths, even when thin slices are involved. Consequently, scanning a large volume demands multiple separate measurements, associated with long scan times, potential inaccuracies associated with mechanical misplacements and limitations in tackling certain in vivo or dynamic systems. This work explores the consequences of replacing the hard pulses in the usual multi-echo sequence used in this kind of scanner, with frequency-swept (chirped) pulses. It was found that, under identical echo times and number of echoes, peak power-limited cases like the ones usually involved in these setups endow chirped-pulse sequences with a higher sensitivity than their square-pulse counterparts. Furthermore, data can be extracted in this manner faster; it can also be measured from larger slabs following a single excitation, thereby avoiding the need for multiple mechanical motions of the scanner/sample. Still, at least with the system hereby assayed, hardware limitations prevented us from utilizing equally short echo times for square- as well as chirped-pulse implementations. Given the shorter echo delays that could be used in the square-pulse versions, optimal acquisitions ended up endowing the latter with the best overall sensitivity defined as signal intensity per unit acquisition time. Potential bypasses of this limitation are briefly discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0937-9347	1613-7507		WOS:000358580600006		
J	Gong, Chao; Jiang, Xiuping								Application of bacteriophages to reduce biofilms formed by hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria on surfaces in a rendering plant								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY				61	8			539	544		10.1139/cjm-2015-0142			AUG 2015	2015	Hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria (SPB) in raw animal by-products are likely to grow and form biofilms in the rendering processing environments, resulting in the release of harmful hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas. The objective of this study was to reduce SPB biofilms formed on different surfaces typically found in rendering plants by applying a bacteriophage cocktail. Using a 96-well microplate method, we determined that 3 SPB strains of Citrobacter freundii and Hafnia alvei are strong biofilm formers. Application of 9 bacteriophages (10(7) PFU/mL) from families of Siphoviridae and Myoviridae resulted in a 33%-70% reduction of biofilm formation by each SPB strain. On stainless steel and plastic templates, phage treatment (10(8) PFU/mL) reduced the attached cells of a mixed SPB culture (no biofilm) by 2.3 and 2.7 log CFU/cm(2) within 6 h at 30 degrees C, respectively, as compared with 2 and 1.5 log CFU/cm(2) reductions of SPB biofilms within 6 h at 30 degrees C. Phage treatment was also applied to indigenous SPB biofilms formed on the environmental surface, stainless steel, high-density polyethylene plastic, and rubber templates in a rendering plant. With phage treatment (10(9) PFU/mL), SPB biofilms were reduced by 0.7-1.4, 0.3-0.6, and 0.2-0.6 log CFU/cm(2) in spring, summer, and fall trials, respectively. Our study demonstrated that bacteriophages could effectively reduce the selected SPB strains either attached to or in formed biofilms on various surfaces and could to some extent reduce the indigenous SPB biofilms on the surfaces in the rendering environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-4166	1480-3275		WOS:000358786800003	26102989

Trends that degrade organ quality are expected to continue over the next 2 decades. We used the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database to inform a 20-year discrete event simulation estimating LT volume from 2010 to 2030. Data to inform the model were obtained from deceased organ donors between 2000 and 2009. If donor liver utilization practices remain constant, utilization will fall from 78% to 44% by 2030, resulting in 2230 fewer LTs. If transplant centers increase their risk tolerance for marginal grafts, utilization would decrease to 48%. The institution of opt-out organ donation policies to increase the donor pool would still result in 1380 to 1866 fewer transplants. Ex vivo perfusion techniques that increase the use of marginal donor livers may stabilize LT volume. Otherwise, the number of LTs in the United States will decrease substantially over the next 15 years. In conclusion, the transplant community will need to accept inferior grafts and potentially worse posttransplant outcomes and/or develop new strategies for increasing organ donation and utilization in order to maintain the number of LTs at the current level.

J	Emerson, Hilary P.; Powell, Brian A.								Observations of surface-mediated reduction of Pu(VI) to Pu(IV) on hematite nanoparticles by ATR FT-IR								RADIOCHIMICA ACTA				103	8			553	563		10.1515/ract-2014-2372			AUG 2015	2015	Previous studies have shown that mineral surfaces may facilitate the reduction of plutonium though the mechanisms of the reduction are still unknown. The objective of this study is to use batch sorption and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy experiments to observe the surface-mediated reduction of plutonium on hematite nanoparticles. These techniques allow for in situ measurement of reduction of plutonium with time and may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of surface mediated reduction of plutonium. For the first time, ATR FT-IR peaks for Pu(VI) sorbed to hematite are measured at similar to 916 cm(-1), respectively. The decrease in peak intensity with time provides a real-time, direct measurement of Pu(VI) reduction on the hematite surface. In this work pseudo first order rate constants estimated at the high loadings (22mg(Pu)/g(hematite), 1.34 x 10(-6) M-Pu/m(2)) for ATR FT-IR are approximately 10x slower than at trace concentrations based on previous work. It is proposed that the reduced rate constant at higher Pu loadings occurs after the reduction capacity due to trace Fe(II) has been exhausted and is dependent on the oxidation of water and possibly electron shuttling based on the semiconducting nature of hematite. Therefore, the reduction rate at higher loadings is possibly due to the thermodynamic favorability of Pu(IV)-hydroxide complexes.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0033-8230			WOS:000358414300002		
J	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying; Sapra, Karan; Liu, Guoxin								A Social Network Based Reputation System for Cooperative P2P File Sharing								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				26	8			2140	2153		10.1109/TPDS.2014.2346192			AUG 2015	2015	Current reputation systems for peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing networks suffer from high overhead on reputation querying. Also, purely relying on a threshold to detect malicious nodes may make a high-reputed node be reluctant to further increase its reputation in these reputation systems. On the other side, the social network concept of "friendship foster cooperation" can be utilized to alleviate the high overhead in reputation systems. However, the limited number of friends limits the availability of file resources in these approaches. To overcome the drawbacks, we propose a social network based reputation system, namely SocialTrust, that synergistically leverages the social network connections and traditional credit based reputation system to provide efficient reputation management for P2P file sharing. In SocialTrust, each node favors friends for service transactions, which are resulted from both real life acquaintances and online partnerships established between high-reputed and frequently-interacted nodes. When no friends are available for a request, a node chooses the server with the highest reputation. The benefits of friendship and partnership on file sharing and cost saving encourage nodes to be continuously cooperative. Further, SocialTrust considers the number of friends/partners and the reputation of a node in reputation rewarding/punishment in order to realize accurate reputation evaluation. SocialTrust can also prevent certain attacks such as deny of service and collusion. Extensive trace-driven simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of SocialTrust.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000358226400006		
J	Grujicic, M.; Snipes, J. S.; Ramaswami, S.; Yavari, R.; Barsoum, R. S.								All-Atom Molecular-Level Analysis of the Ballistic-Impact-Induced Densification and Devitrification of Fused Silica								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				24	8			2970	2983		10.1007/s11665-015-1590-2			AUG 2015	2015	All-atom molecular-level computations are carried out to infer the dynamic response and material microstructure/topology changes of fused silica subjected to ballistic impact by a hard projectile. The analysis was focused on the investigation of specific aspects of the dynamic response and of the microstructural changes such as the deformation of highly sheared and densified regions and the conversion of amorphous fused silica to SiO2 crystalline allotropic modifications (in particular, alpha-quartz and stishovite). The microstructural changes in question were determined by carrying out a post-processing atom-coordination procedure. This procedure suggested the formation of stishovite (and perhaps alpha-quartz) within fused silica during ballistic impact. To rationalize the findings obtained, the all-atom molecular-level computational analysis is complemented by a series of quantum-mechanics density functional theory (DFT) computations. The latter computations enable determination of the relative potential energies of the fused silica, alpha-quartz, and stishovite under ambient pressure (i.e., under their natural densities) as well as under imposed (as high as 50 GPa) pressures (i.e., under higher densities) and shear strains. In addition, the transition states associated with various fused-silica devitrification processes were identified. The results obtained are found to be in good agreement with their respective experimental counterparts.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000358335600014

In particular, curved channels such as spiral channels are of growing interest because the lift and drag force exerted on inertial particles can be used to hydrodynamically separate the particles. In this paper we present a scale invariant classification of the lateral focusing of particles in highly curved spiral micro channels with a square cross section. We then use this scale invariant classification to demonstrate the separation of particles in two-particle mixtures across a large range of sizes. We thus show that our results can be used to systematically design the geometry of devices and select flow parameters to separate particles by size in a mixture.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0960-1317	1361-6439		WOS:000358360700014

JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT				79	6			872	876		10.1002/jwmg.897			AUG 2015	2015	Given limited resources and current mechanisms for conservation of rare and imperiled species, a common practice is to prioritize species that are in need of conservation attention. Agencies and individuals responsible for the conservation of species within given boundaries may deprioritize the conservation of species that are rare within those boundaries if the species' range is extensive (e.g., such as when populations occur at the edges of a species' geographic range). We overlapped amphibian and reptile geographic ranges with state boundaries in the United States to show that many of the species within any given state could be considered peripheral and are therefore vulnerable to conservation inaction based on that fact alone. We argue that a species' overall geographic range should not be used as a primary reason for deprioritizing the conservation of a species within a given boundary, and illustrate that even populations at the edges of a species' range have value to the overall conservation of that species and are integral parts of ecological communities wherever they occur. We urge decision makers and biologists to consider these arguments during ranking processes, and not reflexively deprioritize the conservation of species at the edges of their geographic ranges.

The authors drew from past organizational research to theorize distinct effects of affective and continuance community commitment in relation to nurses' health, retention, and engagement. These effects were investigated in a prospective study in which nurses' (N = 330) organizational and community commitment were assessed at one time point and measures of health, retention, and engagement were captured nine months later. Affective community commitment predicted health and retention outcomes after controlling for both types of organizational commitment, but continuance commitment did not. Mediation analyses suggested that continuance community commitment had indirect effects on outcomes through its relationship with continuance organizational commitment. Neither form of community commitment was associated with professional or organizational turnover intentions. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research in both community and organizational psychology.

A textual analysis, using constant comparative procedures of 465 tweets from 125 NFL players, was conducted. Results revealed that players discussed the case in the following ways: (a) anticipation, (b) disbelief, (c) critiques of the American Justice System, (d) social commentary, (e) condolences and support, (f) responding to fans, and (g) freedom of speech arguments. The results suggest that Twitter is a viable mechanism for African American and other minority athletes to engage in activism and initiate important conversations about social justice issues. Although empowering, this also may create conflict for team personnel and fans who may be uncomfortable with athletes using Twitter to question structures that favor Whiteness.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0193-7235	1552-7638		WOS:000357947200004		
J	Wang, Tianwei (Thomas); Wagner, John								Advanced automotive thermal management - Nonlinear radiator fan matrix control								CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE				41				113	123		10.1016/j.conengprac.2015.04.004			AUG 2015	2015	Advanced automotive cooling systems for gasoline and diesel engines can improve the powertrain performance. The replacement of the mechanical driven coolant pump and radiator fans with computer controlled servo-motor actuators, and update of the wax-based thermostat valve with a 3-way variable position smart valve, allow the coolant flow rate and proportion directed through the radiator to be carefully adjusted. A smart thermal management system approach can regulate the forced convection heat transfer process to match the engine's cooling needs. This paper presents a Lyapunov based nonlinear control strategy to solely operate the radiator fan matrix for transient engine temperature tracking. A reduced order mathematical model serves as the basis for the closed-loop feedback system. An adaptive backstepping method was implemented to derive the control law. An experimental test bench with multiple radiator fans, heat exchanger, wind tunnel, coolant pump, three way valve, and engine thermal load has been fabricated. Representative numerical and experimental tests demonstrate that the advanced control strategy can regulate the engine temperature tracking error within 0.12 degrees C and compensate the unknown heat load. The nonlinear controller provided superior performance in terms of power consumption and temperature tracking as evident by the reduced magnitude when compared to a classical PI with lookup table based controller and a bang bang controller.

However, these techniques remain reliant on the use of higher order resonant peaks, enhancing their sensitivity at the cost of limited dynamic range. The use of a lower order resonant peak for sensing can lead to a larger dynamic range at the cost of accuracy. This letter reports a pi-phase-shifted THz fiber Bragg grating, fabricated using a femtosecond laser, capable of detecting changes in strain over a substantially larger dynamic range than previously reported methods with improved accuracy. A second THz grating without a pi-phase-shifted structure, but otherwise identically constructed, was interrogated in series on the same optical fiber. The two devices were simultaneously experimentally investigated using a strain test (similar to 1 m epsilon in total), and the results presented in this letter. In addition, the theoretical models of the devices were created, which closely matched experimentally observed device physics.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1041-1135	1941-0174		WOS:000357830000020

Such materials provide a means to control electrochemical systems using an external stimulus that affects the polymer phase behavior and electrolyte properties. RPEs were synthesized with N-isopropylacrylamide, which governs the thermal properties, and varying fractions of acrylic acid, which provides ionic properties. These polymers undergo a thermally activated phase separation in aqueous solutions at a given temperature, thereby altering the ionic strength, pH, and conductivity of the electrolyte solution. In this article, we demonstrate how the molecular properties of RPEs, specifically the ionic composition, influence the temperature-dependent electrolyte properties and the extent to which these electrolytes can control the activity of redox electrodes. Materials with high ionic content provide the highest room temperature ion conductivity and redox activity; however, RPEs with low ionic content provide the highest "on-off" ratio in electrochemical activity at elevated temperatures.[GRAPHICS].									1	0	0	1	0	1			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000357667800012

JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH				69	8			724	731		10.1136/jech-2014-203881			AUG 2015	2015	Objective Studies have shown that immigrants' acculturation is associated with numerous unhealthy behaviours. Yet, the role of environmental factors in modifying the effect of acculturation on health behaviours has received little attention. This study aims to create a more nuanced understanding of the health effects of acculturation by examining how neighbourhood immigrant composition modifies the association between individuals' eating patterns and acculturation.Methods Cross-sectional Data from Los Angeles County Health Survey 2007 adult sample were linked to data on retail food establishments and US Census 2000 neighbourhood characteristics. Acculturation was measured by language spoken at home and years stayed in the US. Eating fast food more than once per week and eating zero serving of fruit or vegetables during the previous day were used as proxy indicators for unhealthy dietary behaviour. Multilevel logistic regression models were performed in the full sample and in the sample with only Latino adults.Results Immigrants' lack of acculturation and living in a neighbourhood with a high percentage immigrants were associated with healthier dietary behaviour. We also identified that lack of acculturation conveyed a significantly stronger protective effect on regular fast-food consumption for immigrants living in neighbourhoods with higher percentage immigrants (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.93).Conclusions Among immigrants in Los Angeles County, living in a neighbourhood with a high density of other immigrants attenuates the negative effects of acculturation on healthy eating behaviours. Healthy eating promotion efforts should build on this protective effect in outreach to acculturating immigrant communities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0143-005X	1470-2738		WOS:000357720500003	25737531

Impact of The Personal Strengths Program on Self-Determination Levels of College Students With LD and/or ADHD								LEARNING DISABILITY QUARTERLY				38	3			145	159		10.1177/0731948714526998			AUG 2015	2015	This study investigates the impact of The Personal Strengths Program (PSP) on seven college students with learning disabilities and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (LD/ADHD) using a multiple baseline design. Students with LD/ADHD experience increased challenges in school settings and decreased post-secondary outcomes when compared with their peers without disabilities. Research has indicated that students who are able to transition into post-secondary settings successfully often have higher levels of self-determination than those who do not transition as successfully. PSP is grounded in effective teaching practices for students with LD/ADHD, self-determination, and positive psychology. It utilizes guided cognitive strategy instruction to assist students in identifying and using their strengths to achieve their goals related to their academic classes. Results were mixed, but do suggest there is some effect from participating in PSP on self-determination levels. Implications for students with LD/ADHD and researchers conducting intervention studies are discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0731-9487	2168-376X		WOS:000357569900002

An entity arrives on this network at a designated origin node and traverses the network in a random-walk fashion until it either terminates at a destination node, or until an arc fails while being traversed. We study the problem of assessing the probability that the random walk reaches the destination node, which we call the survival probability of the network. Complicating our analysis is the assumption that certain arcs have memory, in the sense that after a memory arc is successfully traversed, it cannot fail on any subsequent traversal during the walk. We prove that this problem is #P-hard, provide methods for obtaining lower and upper bounds on the survival probability, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounding methods on randomly generated networks.

It is demonstrated that even high-purity ZnO single crystals can "flash" at similar to 870 degrees C. In comparison, flash sintering occurs at a substantially lower onset temperature of similar to 550 degrees C in ZnO powder specimens, indicating the important roles of surfaces and/or grain boundaries. A model has been developed to forecast the thermal runaway conditions and the predictions are in excellent agreements with the observed onset flash temperatures, attesting that the flash starts as a thermal runaway in at least these ZnO based systems. Interestingly, enhanced grain growth is observed at the anode side of the pure ZnO specimens with an abrupt change in the grain sizes, indicating the occurrence of electric-potential-induced abnormal grain growth. With a large current density, the growth of aligned hexagonal single-crystalline rods toward the anode direction is evident in the ZnO powder specimen. Moreover, Bi2O3 doping defers the onset of flash sintering, which can be explained from the formation of space charges at grain boundaries, and it homogenizes the microstructure due to a liquid-phase sintering effect. The key scientific contributions of this study include the development of a model to predict the thermal runaway conditions that are coincident with the observed onset flash sintering temperatures, the clarification of how flash starts in ZnO based specimens, and the observation and explanation of diversifying phenomena of sintering and microstructural development under applied electric currents.

In addition, the impacts of background water components (i.e., natural organic matter (NOM), ionic strength (IS) and pH) on the SOC adsorption behavior were investigated. The results indicated HD3000 and SWCNT with higher microporous volumes exhibited higher adsorption capacities for the selected aliphatic SOCs than graphenes, demonstrating microporosity of carbonaceous adsorbents played an important role in the adsorption. Analysis of adsorption isotherms demonstrated that hydrophobic interactions were the dominant contributor to the adsorption of aliphatic SOCs by graphenes. However, pi-pi electron donor-acceptor and van der Waals interactions are likely the additional mechanisms contributing to the adsorption of aliphatic SOCs on graphenes. Among the three background solution components examined, NOM showed the most influential effect on adsorption of the selected aliphatic SOCs, while pH and ionic strength had a negligible effects. The NOM competition on aliphatic adsorption was less pronounced on graphenes than SWCNT. Overall, in terms of adsorption capacities, graphenes tested in this study did not exhibit a major advantage over SWCNT and GAG for the adsorption of aliphatic SOCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Geoff								Prescribed burning and mastication effects on surface fuels in southern pine beetle-killed loblolly pine plantations								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				81				514	524		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.04.076			AUG 2015	2015	Surface fuels were characterized in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations severely impacted by southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Ehrh.) (SPB) outbreaks in the upper South Carolina Piedmont. Prescribed burning and mastication were then tested as fuel reduction treatments in these areas. Prescribed burning reduced fuelbed continuity by consuming litter (Oi layer), duff (Oe + Oa), and woody surface fuels (1-, 10-, and 100-h timelag size classes) immediately after the treatment. Total loading of 1- and 10-h fuels in burned stands (3.1 Mg ha (1)) remained significantly lower than that in the control (no treatment) (5.6 Mg ha (1)) in the 2nd year post-treatment. However, 100- and 1000-h fuels increased post-burn due to accelerated failure of remaining pine snags and totaled 14.5 Mg ha (1) in the 2nd year post-treatment which was not significantly different than the control (17.3 Mg ha (1)). Mineral soil exposure averaged 73% of burned stands after consumption of the duff layer in many areas. Custom low, moderate, and high load fuel models were developed for SPB-killed stands and produced simulated fire behavior (flame length and rate of spread) similar to two standard slash-blowdown fuel models (SB2 and SB3) when input to the BehavePlus fire modeling system. Mastication resulted in a compacted (bulk density = 131.3 kg m (3)) and continuous layer of woody debris that averaged 15.1 cm in depth. Equations were developed for estimating masticated debris load and utilize fuelbed depth as input. The masticated debris load averaged 192.4 Mg ha (1) in the 1st year post-treatment and was significantly higher than total fuel loading in burned (16.3 Mg ha (1)) and control (24.3 Mg ha (1)) stands. The treatments tested in this study provide different options for preparing SPB-killed areas for reforestation activities and may produce short-term reductions in fire hazard. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While recent work has demonstrated the possibility of SPIF of polymers the effects of incremental depth and tool rotation speed, key process parameters in SPIF, have rarely been examined. This work experimentally examines how incremental depth and tool rotation speed affect the failure mode during forming, forming forces as well as the void structure and crystallinity of the formed material in polymer SPIF. The dependence of both tearing and wrinkling on the incremental depth and tool rotation speed is uncovered. It is shown that contrary to SPIF of metals, greater incremental depths result in increased formability in polymer SPIF, but this advantage is limited by the occurrence of sheet wrinkling at excessively high incremental depths. Further, the occurrence of sheet wrinkling depends not just on the incremental depth but also on the part shape being formed. Microstructural examination of the formed material shows that greater incremental depth results in greater void densities and that the material formed with SPIF has greater crystallinity than the unformed material. Additionally, it is shown that higher tool rotation speed can cause earlier onset of wrinkling. The implications of these observations on SPIF of polymers are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It can be applied to design cancer medicines with improved therapeutic indices. At the basic level, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene are sp(2) carbon nanomaterials. Their unique physical and chemical properties make them interesting candidates of research in a wide range of areas including biological systems and different diseases. Recent research has been focused on exploring the potential of the CNTs as a carrier or vehicle for intracellular transport of drugs, proteins, and targeted genes in vitro and in vivo. Several research groups are actively involved to find out a functional CNT carrier capable of transporting targeted drug molecules in animal models with least toxicity. Current investigations are also focused on graphene, an allotrope of carbon, which appears to be a promising agent for successful delivery of biomolecules in various animal models. But potential clinical implementations of CNTs are still hampered by distinctive barriers such as poor bioavailability and intrinsic toxicity, which pose difficulties in tumor targeting and penetration as well as in improving therapeutic outcome. This article presents recent progresses in the design and evaluation of closely related CNTs for experimental cancer therapy and explores their implications in bringing nanomedicines into the clinics.									8	0	0	3	0	8			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000350268100002	26369109

Spectral data indicated that a particular tautomer, a (1Z,4Z)-1-(4-aryl)-1,5-dihydroxy-5-phenylpenta-1,4-dien-3-one, resulted upon recrystallization of the linear products. Condensation-cyclization of the dianion-type intermediate with methyl thiosalicylate resulted in a phenacyl benzdheterocyclic thiopyranone and with 5-chloroisatoic anhydride in a phenacyl quinolinone.

Yam (Dioscorea spp.) is a major food and cash crop in many countries but research efforts have been limited to understand the genetics and generate genomic information for the crop. The availability of a large number of genomic resources including genome-wide molecular markers will accelerate the breeding efforts and application of genomic selection in yams. In the present study, several methods including expressed sequence tags (EST)-sequencing, de novo sequencing, and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) profiles on two yam (Dioscorea alata L.) genotypes (TDa 95/00328 and TDa 95-310) was performed to generate genomic resources for use in its improvement programs. This includes a comprehensive set of EST-SSRs, genomic SSRs, whole genome SNPs, and reduced representation SNPs. A total of 1,152 EST-SSRs were developed from >40,000 EST-sequences generated from the two genotypes. A set of 388 EST-SSRs were validated as polymorphic showing a polymorphism rate of 34% when tested on two diverse parents targeted for anthracnose disease. In addition, approximately 40X de novo whole genome sequence coverage was generated for each of the two genotypes, and a total of 18,584 and 15,952 genomic SSRs were identified for TDa 95/00328 and TDa 95-310, respectively. A custom made pipeline resulted in the selection of 573 genomic SSRs common across the two genotypes, of which only eight failed, 478 being polymorphic and 62 monomorphic indicating a polymorphic rate of 83.5%. Additionally, 288,505 high quality SNPs were also identified between these two genotypes. Genotyping by sequencing reads on these two genotypes also revealed 36,790 overlapping SNP positions that are distributed throughout the genome. Our efforts in using different approaches in generating genomic resources provides a non-biased glimpse into the publicly available EST-sequences, yam genome, and GBS profiles with affirmation that the genomic complexity can be methodically unraveled and constitute a critical foundation for future studies in linkage mapping, germplasm analysis, and predictive breeding.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000358836800098	26222616

Resolution-limited rods of scattering are indicative of a long-range two-dimensional 2 root 2 x 2 root 2 superstructure in the a-b plane, adhering to planar space-group symmetry p4gm, which is subject to stacking disorder perpendicular to the planes. This superstructure is present only in annealed, superconducting samples, but not in the as-grown, nonsuperconducting samples. These long-range distortions of the CuO2 planes, which are generally considered to be detrimental to superconductivity, have avoided detection to date due to the challenges of observing and interpreting subtle diffuse-scattering features.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000358841400002

The nano-hair structure fabricated with alternating layers of alumina/hafnia on a fused silica substrate has a high diffraction efficiency of similar to 90% around the design wavelength, lambda(o) = 1.55 mu m and is insensitive to the polarization of the incident optical beam. The phase in transmission of these devices are controlled by azimuthally varying the fill fraction of the subwavelength grating. Realization of phase optical elements in an all-dielectric platform, based on subwavelength gratings offering full 0-2 pi phase modulation, is important for miniaturization and integration of conventional refractive optical elements.

RNiSn half-Heusler phases (R = Hf, Zr, and Ti) are the most studied in view of thermal stability. The highest dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) obtained is similar to 1 in the temperature range similar to 450-900 degrees C, primarily achieved in nanostructured alloys. Through proper annealing, ZT similar to 1.2 has been obtained in a previous ZT similar to 1 n-type (Hf,Zr)NiSn phase without the nanostructure. There is an appreciable increase in power factor, decrease in charge carrier density, and increase in carrier mobility. The findings are attributed to improved structural order. Present approach may be applied to optimize the functional properties of Heusler-type alloys. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.									7	1	0	1	0	7			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000358924200029

Here we establish an exact equivalence between 1D "topological mirror superconductivity" and chiral topological superconductivity in the BDI class which can also stabilize multiple Majorana-Kramers pairs in 1D TR invariant topological superconductors. The equivalence proves that topological mirror superconductivity can be understood as chiral superconductivity in the BDI symmetry class coexisting with time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, we show that the mirror Berry phase coincides with the chiral winding invariant of the BDI symmetry class, which is independent of the presence of the time-reversal symmetry. Thus, the time-reversal invariant topological mirror superconducting state may be viewed as a special case of the BDI symmetry class in the well-known Altland-Zirnbauer periodic table of free fermionic phases. We illustrate the results with the examples of 1D spin-orbit coupled quantum wires in the presence of nodeless s(+/-) superconductivity and the recently discussed experimental system of ferromagnetic atom (Fe) chains embedded on a lead (Pb) superconductor.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000358373600004		
J	Sau, Jay D.; Swingle, Brian; Tewari, Sumanta								Proposal to probe quantum nonlocality of Majorana fermions in tunneling experiments								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				92	2					020511	10.1103/PhysRevB.92.020511			JUL 22 2015	2015	Topological Majorana fermion (MF) quasiparticles have been recently suggested to exist in semiconductor quantum wires with proximity induced superconductivity and a Zeeman field. Although the experimentally observed zero bias tunneling peak and a fractional ac-Josephson effect can be taken as necessary signatures of MFs, neither of them constitutes a sufficient "smoking gun" experiment. Since one pair of Majorana fermions share a single conventional fermionic degree of freedom, MFs are in a sense fractionalized excitations. Based on this fractionalization we propose a tunneling experiment that furnishes a nearly unique signature of end state MFs in semiconductor quantum wires. In particular, we show that a "teleportation"-like experiment is not enough to distinguish MFs from pairs of MFs, which are equivalent to conventional zero energy states, but our proposed tunneling experiment, in principle, can make this distinction.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000358372100002

Scavenger receptor B1 facilitates macrophage uptake of silver nanoparticles and cellular activation								JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH				17	7					313	10.1007/s11051-015-3116-0			JUL 21 2015	2015	Due to increased use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for their antimicrobial activity, concerns have risen regarding potential adverse human health effects. Scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1), a major receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), is expressed by macrophages and has also been reported to play a role in recognition of negatively charged particles. We, therefore, hypothesized that SR-B1 mediates macrophage uptake of AgNPs and inflammatory activation. To test this hypothesis, we exposed a mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (RAW) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) to 20 nm citrate-suspended AgNPs. To verify the role of the SR-B1 receptor, we utilized a SR-B1 inhibitor (Blt2). In vitro studies demonstrated uptake of AgNPs and HDL-coated AgNPs by macrophages which were significantly reduced following pretreatment with Blt2. Inflammatory cytokine arrays revealed that macrophages exposed to AgNPs up-regulated expression of Tnf-alpha, Oncostatin m (OSM), Ccl4, Il17f, Ccl7, and Ccl2, whereas Il16 was found to be down-regulated. Macrophage activation was observed following AgNP and HDL-coated AgNP exposure as measured by OSM protein production and increased surface expression of CD86. These markers of activation were reduced with Blt2 pretreatment. The in vitro findings were confirmed in vivo through pulmonary instillation of AgNPs in mice. Pulmonary instillation of AgNPs resulted in a recruitment of inflammatory cells that were reduced in SR-B1-deficient mice or following Blt2 pretreatment. This study suggests that SR-B1 plays a major role in cellular recognition of AgNPs and the induction of cell responses that could contribute to inflammation caused by AgNP exposure.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000363484400003		
J	Dominguez, Alberto; Siana, Brian; Brooks, Alyson M.; Christensen, Charlotte R.; Bruzual, Gustavo; Stark, Daniel P.; Alavi, Anahita					Dominguez, Alberto/0000-0002-3433-4610			Consequences of bursty star formation on galaxy observables at high redshifts								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				451	1			839	848		10.1093/mnras/stv1001			JUL 21 2015	2015	The star formation histories (SFHs) of dwarf galaxies are thought to be bursty, with large - order of magnitude changes in the star formation rate on time-scales similar to O-star lifetimes. As a result, the standard interpretations of many galaxy observables (which assume a slowly varying SFH) are often incorrect. Here, we use the SFHs from hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the effects of bursty SFHs on sample selection and interpretation of observables and make predictions to confirm such SFHs in future surveys. First, because dwarf galaxies' star formation rates change rapidly, the mass-to-light ratio is also changing rapidly in both the ionizing continuum and, to a lesser extent, the non-ionizing ultraviolet continuum. Therefore, flux limited surveys are highly biased towards selecting galaxies in the burst phase and very deep observations are required to detect all dwarf galaxies at a given stellar mass. Second, we show that a log(10)[nu L nu (1500 angstrom)/L-H alpha] > 2.5 implies a very recent quenching of star formation and can be used as evidence of stellar feedback regulating star formation. Third, we show that the ionizing continuum can be significantly higher than when assuming a constant SFH, which can affect the interpretation of nebular emission line equivalent widths and direct ionizing continuum detections. Finally, we show that a star formation rate estimate based on continuum measurements only (and not on nebular tracers such as the hydrogen Balmer lines) will not trace the rapid changes in star formation and will give the false impression of a star-forming main sequence with low dispersion.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000360827800063

New techniques for intracellular pH monitoring are urgently needed to gain new insights into single-cell responses to external stimuli. In this study, fiber-optic reflection-based pH micro (mu)-probes (tip diameter: 500-3000 nm) were designed and fabricated using a novel hexagonal 1-in-6 fiber configuration. An organic-modified silicate (OrMoSils) sol-gel doped with a pH-sensitive dye, 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), were coated onto the probe sensing tip for pH detection. These probes enabled neutral pH monitoring and quasi-real-time data acquisition (response time: 20 +/- 5 s). The fluorescence signals of the newly developed probes were found to correlate linearly with pH (R-2 = 0.9869 when coupling laser power was at 8.2 mW) within a biologically relevant pH range (6.18-7.80). The pH resolution was 0.038 pH unit. The miniaturized probes were validated in single human lung cancer A549 cells to demonstrate applicability in single-cell experiments. In summary, novel pH mu-probes with excellent resolution and response times within a biologically relevant pH range were developed, and they can be used for measuring pH changes in single cells.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000358555900027	26118725	
J	Zhang, Lynn X.; Manard, Benjamin T.; Powell, Brian A.; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Preliminary Assessment of Potential for Metal-Ligand Speciation in Aqueous Solution via the Liquid Sampling-Atmospheric Pressure Glow Discharge (LS-APGD) Ionization Source: Uranyl Acetate								ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				87	14			7218	7225		10.1021/acs.analchem.5b01637			JUL 21 2015	2015	The determination of metals, including the generation of metalligand speciation information, is essential across a myriad of biochemical, environmental, and industrial systems. Metal speciation is generally affected by the combination of some form of chromatographic separation (reflective of the metal-ligand chemistry) with element-specific detection for the quantification of the metal composing the chromatographic eluent. Thus, the identity of the metal-ligand is assigned by inference. Presented here, the liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) is assessed as an ionization source for metal speciation, with the uranyl ion-acetate system used as a test system. Molecular mass spectra can be obtained from the same source by simple modification of the sustaining electrolyte solution. Specifically, chemical information pertaining to the degree of acetate complexation of uranyl ion (UO22+) is assessed as a function of pH in the spectral abundance of three metallic species: inorganic (nonligated) uranyl, UO2Ac(H2O)(n)(MeOH)(m)(+), and UO2Ac2(H2O)(n)(MeOH)(m)H+ (n = 1, 2, 3,...; m = 1, 2, 3,...). The product mass spectra are different from what are obtained from electrospray ionization sources that have been applied to this system. The resulting relationships between the speciation and pH values have been compared to calculated concentrations of the corresponding uranyl species: UO22+, UO2Ac+, UO2Ac2. The capacity for the LS-APGD to affect both atomic mass spectra and structurally significant spectra for organometallic complexes is a unique and potentially powerful combination.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000358555900033	26134783

Here, we propose to use the magnetic domain walls to engender Majorana fermions, which has several notable advantages compared to the existing approaches. First of all, the local tunneling density-of-states anomaly associated with the Majorana zero mode bound to a smooth magnetic soliton is immune to most of parasitic artifacts associated with the abrupt physical ends of a wire, which mar the existing experimental probes. Second, a viable route to move and braid Majorana fermions is offered by domain-wall motion. In particular, we envision the recently demonstrated heat-current induced motion of domain walls in insulating ferromagnets as a promising tool for nonintrusive displacement of Majorana modes. This leads us to propose a feasible scheme for braiding domain walls within a magnetic nanowire network, which manifests the nob-Abelian exchange statistics within the Majorana subspace.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000358254900001

This new series of compounds is structurally reminiscent of the brackebuschite mineral type. The structure of Ba2V(VO4)(2)(OH) is monoclinic in space group P2(1)/m, a = 7.8783(2) angstrom, b = 6.1369(1) angstrom, c = 9.1836(2) angstrom, beta = 113.07(3)degrees, V = 408.51(2) angstrom(3). The other structures are similar and consist of one-dimensional trans edge-shared distorted octahedral chains running along the b-axis. The vanadate groups bridge across edges of their tetrahedra. Structural analysis of the Ba2Mn(VO4)(2)(OH) analogue yielded a new understanding of the Jahn-Teller effect in this structure type. Raman and infrared spectra were investigated to observe the fundamental vanadate and hydroxide vibrational modes. Single-crystal temperature-dependent magnetic studies on Ba2V(VO4)(2)(OH) reveal a broad feature over a wide temperature range with maximum at similar to 100 K indicating that an energy gap could exist between the antiferromagnetic singlet ground state and excited triplet states, making it potentially of interest for quantum magnetism studies.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000358549300040	26154989

This premidnight surge is preceded by strong westward winds. These disturbances were observed over three sites with geodetic latitudes 35-42 degrees N in the American sector by Fabry-Perot interferometers at 630nm wavelength. Prior to the wind disturbances, subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) were measured by the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar between 20 and 02UT. We identify the observed neutral wind variations as driven by SAPS, through a scenario where strong ion flows cause a westward neutral wind, subsequently establishing a poleward wind surge due to the poleward Coriolis force on that westward wind. These regional disturbances appear to have prevented the well-known storm time equatorward wind surge from propagating into low latitudes, with the consequence that the classic disturbance dynamo mechanism failed to occur.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0094-8276	1944-8007		WOS:000358691300007

Here we review the possible impacts of changes in climate variability on the properties of different drought types. The downscaled and bias-corrected data from five general circulation models (GCMs) were used to produce an ensemble of precipitation, temperature, and wind speed, through a relative entropy approach and were used for drought analysis. A novel Multivariate Drought Index was then employed for an integrated quantification of all physical forms of drought. We studied the spatial patterns of drought properties and performed multivariate frequency analysis for each planning region in Texas to recognize the distribution of potential drought hazard areas under climate change impact by formulating a Drought Hazard Index. A drought vulnerability assessment was also carried out by taking into consideration various socioeconomic factors, leading to the development of socioeconomic Drought Vulnerability Index. A set of composite drought risk maps that combines hazard and vulnerability analysis were developed. This study also explored the cause-effect relationship between the drought events and several hydroclimatic triggers. A transfer entropy measure was used to quantify the causal relationships, thus indicating the predominant future drought triggers. Overall, the findings are expected to help achieve an effective drought mitigation strategy for the state of Texas.									3	0	0	1	0	3			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000358695200004

The objective of this study was to assess the racial differences in pediatric hypertension and to explore whether these differences, if any, can be explained by low birth weight (LBW) and obesity.MethodsAnalyses were performed for participants aged 8-17 years (N = 9,250) included in the 1999-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Multivariate logistic regressions and weighted analysis were carried out considering the complex survey design.ResultsCompared to non-Hispanic White youth, the crude prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in non-Hispanic Blacks (7.1% vs. 5.6%; P = 0.04), but not in Mexican Americans (5.4% vs. 5.6%; P = 0.77). Blacks also had higher rates of LBW (14.6% vs. 5.9%; P < 0.001) and obesity (22.9% vs. 15.8%; P < 0.001) than Whites. In stratified analysis by age-sex groups, the Black-White difference in hypertension prevalence was only significant in boys aged 13-17 (9.6% vs. 6.6%). After controlling for age, Black boys had a 51% higher odds of having hypertension (Odds ratio = 1.51; 95% confidence interval: 1.03, 3.43; P = 0.04) compared to White youth at ages 13-17. This racial difference persisted with additional adjustment for birth weight (odds ratio (OR) = 2.00; P = 0.02) and for current body mass index (OR = 1.50; P = 0.04). Mexican American youth had no difference in hypertension prevalence as compared to White youth after adjusting for age, sex, birth weight and obesity (Odds ratio = 0.82; P = 0.16) and in age-sex stratified subgroups.ConclusionsNon-Hispanic Black adolescent boys have a significantly higher hypertension rate than their non-Hispanic White counterparts in the US. This racial difference cannot be explained by LBW and current obesity status within the Black population.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000358197600130	26176843

We first built support vector regression (SVR) model using three descriptors, and the SVR model (t = 2) had the highest external prediction ability (MSEext = 0.068, Q(ext)(2) = 0.682), about 40% higher than literature model's. Second, to identify more effective descriptors, we applied in-house methods to select descriptors with clear meanings from 2835 descriptors calculated by the PCLIENT and used them to construct the SVR models. Our results showed that our twenty new QSAR models significantly increased the standard regression coefficient on test set (MSEext values ranged from 0.003 to 0.063 and Q(ext)(2) values ranged from 0.708 to 0.985). The Y random response permutation test and different splits of training/test datasets also supported the excellent predictive power of the best SVR model. We further evaluated the regression significance of our SVR model and the importance of each single descriptor of the model according to the interpretability analysis. Our work provided useful theoretical understanding of the toxicity of phenol analogues. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0169-7439	1873-3239		WOS:000356195200005

In this study, a potential way to overcome the scientific and technical barrier of nanoparticle dispersion in high performance lightweight MMNCs is presented. The goal is to identify the shape and size of Al2O3 nanoparticle for its optimal dispersion in Al matrix. Critical velocity of solidification is calculated numerically for spherical, cylindrical and disk-shaped nanoparticles using an analytical model which incorporates drag force, intermolecular force and inertia effect. The results show that it is possible to reduce the critical solidification velocity for nanoparticle capture by 6 times with proper shape modification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using an ytterbium-doped-phosphosilicate double-clad leakage-channel fiber with similar to 50 mu m core and similar to 420 mu m cladding, we have achieved similar to 70% optical-to-optical efficiency at 1018nm. The much larger cladding than those in previous reports demonstrates the much lower required pump brightness, a key for efficient kW operation. The demonstrated 1018nm fiber laser has ASE suppression of similar to 41dB. This is higher than previous reports and further demonstrates the advantages of the fiber used. Limiting factors to efficiency are also systematically studied. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America									5	0	0	0	0	5			1094-4087			WOS:000361033900005	26191831

Increased tissue-level strain magnitude and rate have both been identified as potent stimuli leading to increased bone formation. Mechanotransduction models hypothesize that osteocytes sense bone deformation by detecting fluid flow-induced drag in the bone's lacunar-canalicular porosity. This model suggests that the osteocyte's intracellular response depends on fluid-flow rate, a product of bone strain rate and gradient, but does not provide a mechanism for detection of strain magnitude. Such a mechanism is necessary for bone modelling to adapt to loads, because strain magnitude is an important determinant of skeletal fracture. Using strain gauge data from the limb bones of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, we identified strong correlations between strain rate and magnitude across clades employing diverse locomotor styles and degrees of rhythmicity. The breadth of our sample suggests that this pattern is likely to be a common feature of tetrapod bone loading. Moreover, finding that bone strain magnitude is encoded in strain rate at the tissue level is consistent with the hypothesis that it might be encoded in fluid-flow rate at the cellular level, facilitating bone adaptation via mechanotransduction.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000357719500009

FTY720 inhibited proinflammatory cytokine release and osteoclastogenesis induced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans								LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE				14						66	10.1186/s12944-015-0057-7			JUL 4 2015	2015	Background: Periodontitis is a bacteria-driven inflammatory bone loss disease. Previous studies showed that the oral pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) stimulated the generation of sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P). In addition, S1P signaling regulated the migration of osteoclast precursors and affected osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, treatment with FTY720 (also called fingolimod, a modulator of multiple S1P receptors) alleviated osteoporosis and suppressed arthritis in animals. This study determined the effect of FTY720 on proinflammatory cytokine production and osteoclastogenesis in murine bone marrow cells with or without A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulation.Methods: Murine bone marrow-derived monocytes and macrophages (BMMs) were treated with vehicle ethanol or FTY720, and were either unstimulated or stimulated for 0.5 to 6 h with A. actinomycetemcomitans. The protein levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the media of BMMs were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Protein expressions, including phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K), p-Akt, p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), PI3K, Akt, and ERK were evaluated by Western blot. In addition, murine bone marrow-derived pre-osteoclasts were treated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) for three days. Then the cells were treated with either vehicle or FTY720 and were either unstimulated or stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans for 4 to 24 h. Control cells were treated with M-CSF alone with or without bacterial stimulation. Osteoclasts were stained by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. The mRNA levels of osteoclastogenic factors, including nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic calcineurin-dependent 1 (Nfatc1), cathepsin K (Ctsk), acid phosphatase 5 (Acp5), osteoclast-associated receptor (Oscar), and RANKL were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Results: FTY720 dose-dependently inhibited IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha protein levels induced by A. actinomycetemcomitans in BMMs compared with controls. Additionally, FTY720 attenuated p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-ERK expressions induced by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Furthermore, FTY720 suppressed osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow-derived pre-osteoclasts with or without bacterial stimulation and reduced the mRNA levels of Nfatc1, Ctsk, Acp5, and Oscar, but not RANKL in bone marrow-derived pre-osteoclasts.Conclusion: FTY720 inhibited proinflammatory cytokine production and suppressed osteoclastogenesis, supporting FTY720 as a potential therapy for inflammatory bone loss diseases.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1476-511X			WOS:000357450600001	26138336

This 'cable' robot is a next-generation version of the current state of the art (NASA's 'Tendril'). The article describes the key practical limitations of the mechanical design of 'Tendril'. We introduce the design specifics of our novel concept for a next-generation device with significantly enhanced performance. Equipped with a light and compact motor-encoder actuation mechanism, the new design has improved compliance and possesses a concentric backbone arrangement which is tendon-actuated and spring-loaded. A new forward kinematic model is developed extending the established models for constant-curvature continuum robots, to account for the new design feature of controllable compression (in the hardware). The model is validated by performing experiments with a three-section prototype of the design. The new model is found to be effective as a baseline to predict the performance of such long and thin continuum 'cable' robots.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0169-1864	1568-5535		WOS:000360223600001

The members of the collaboration team implemented these reforms with the goal of supporting all students' learning of 1st-year college preparatory mathematics. This study used conceptual tools from frame analysis (E. Goffman, 1974) alongside an analysis of teacher participation patterns to understand teacher learning within a community of practice (E. Wenger, 1998). This analysis documented development within the teacher community through teachers increasing orientation to classroom-based interventions for struggling students alongside more collegial participation patterns, contributing an empirical example of teacher learning within a community of practice.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1050-8406	1532-7809		WOS:000359340400002

Staying on the job: The relationship between work performance and cognition in individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis								JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY				37	6			630	640		10.1080/13803395.2015.1039963			JUL 3 2015	2015	People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are apt to become unemployed as the disease progresses, and most research implies that this is due to diminishing mobility. Some studies have shown that presence of cognitive impairment also predicts employment status. Yet, no studies have examined how neuropsychological factors predict vocational performance among individuals with MS who remain employed. We assessed employer- and self-rated work performance, mobility status, and neuropsychological function in a sample of 44 individuals diagnosed with MS. Results suggest that cognitive impairment is common in these employed individuals, despite largely intact mobility status. Moreover, a significant interaction emerged, such that cognitively impaired individuals' work performance was rated more poorly by supervisors. In contrast, self-ratings of work performance were higher in cognitively impaired than in unimpaired participants. These novel findings suggest that cognitive impairment may influence work performance, even in patients whose physical disability status is relatively intact.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1380-3395	1744-411X		WOS:000357938300007	26149071

More than words: a literature review of language of mathematics research								EDUCATIONAL REVIEW				67	3			369	384		10.1080/00131911.2014.971714			JUL 3 2015	2015	This paper presents the results of a systematic search of the empirical literature on language of mathematics. Historically, mathematics educators and policy-makers have focused primarily on the importance of vocabulary in helping students move from everyday language to more formal mathematical language in order to promote academic outcomes. Utilizing Gee's notion of Discourse, which includes many aspects of language as well as notions of identity and power, we synthesize the extant literature to explore the multifaceted ways researchers have extended the traditional focus on vocabulary. Our findings suggest that for students to be successful in mathematics classrooms, educators must become cognizant of the role of language in establishing classroom norms, negotiating identities, and challenging inequitable distributions of power. We also utilize Gee's seven building blocks of language to identify aspects of language that remain ripe for future research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-1911	1465-3397		WOS:000354928500007

Non-Native Ambrosia Beetles as Opportunistic Exploiters of Living but Weakened Trees								PLOS ONE				10	7					e0131496	10.1371/journal.pone.0131496			JUL 2 2015	2015	Exotic Xylosandrus spp. ambrosia beetles established in non-native habitats have been associated with sudden and extensive attacks on a diverse range of living trees, but factors driving their shift from dying/dead hosts to living and healthy ones are not well understood. We sought to characterize the role of host physiological condition on preference and colonization by two invaders, Xylosandrus germanus and Xylosandrus crassiusculus. When given free-choice under field conditions among flooded and non-flooded deciduous tree species of varying intolerance to flooding, beetles attacked flood-intolerant tree species over more tolerant species within 3 days of initiating flood stress. In particular, flood-intolerant flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) sustained more attacks than flood-tolerant species, including silver maple (Acer saccharinum) and swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor). Ethanol, a key host-derived attractant, was detected at higher concentrations 3 days after initiating flooding within stems of flood intolerant species compared to tolerant and non-flooded species. A positive correlation was also detected between ethanol concentrations in stem tissue and cumulative ambrosia beetle attacks. When adult X. germanus and X. crassiusculus were confined with no-choice to stems of flood-stressed and non-flooded C. florida, more ejected sawdust resulting from tunneling activity was associated with the flood-stressed trees. Furthermore, living foundresses, eggs, larvae, and pupae were only detected within galleries created in stems of flood-stressed trees. Despite a capability to attack diverse tree genera, X. germanus and X. crassiusculus efficiently distinguished among varying host qualities and preferentially targeted trees based on their intolerance of flood stress. Non-flooded trees were not preferred or successfully colonized. This study demonstrates the host-selection strategy exhibited by X. germanus and X. crassiusculus in non-native habitats involves detection of stress-induced ethanol emission and early colonization of living but weakened trees.									6	0	0	6	0	7			1932-6203			WOS:000358154400052	26134522

We used simulations to help staff visualize the effect of communication and coordination delays that occur on the day of surgery. Perioperative services staff participated in tabletop exercises in which they chose the delays that were most important to eliminate. Using a day-of-surgery computer simulation model, the elimination of delays was tested and the results were shared with the group. This exercise, repeated for multiple groups of staff, provided an understanding of not only the dynamic events taking place, but also how small communication delays can contribute to a significant loss in efficiency and the ability to provide timely care. Survey results confirmed these understandings.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-2092			WOS:000373447500012	26119616

These new data are ground-based 630 nm Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) measurements in the equatorial and polar regions, as well as cross-track winds from the Gravity Field and Steady State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite. The GOCE wind observations provide valuable wind data in the twilight regions. The ground-based FPI measurements fill latitudinal data gaps in the prior observational database. Construction of this reference model also provides the opportunity to compare these new measurements. The resulting update (HWM14) provides an improved time-dependent, observationally based, global empirical specification of the upper atmospheric general circulation patterns and migrating tides. In basic agreement with existing accepted theoretical knowledge of the thermosphere general circulation, additional calculations indicate that the empirical wind specifications are self-consistent with climatological ionosphere plasma distribution and electric field patterns.									28	0	0	1	0	28			2333-5084			WOS:000370750300006

Our facile synthesis involves the self-assembly of MWCNTs and carbon fibers into a multilayered, highly porous, and hierarchical structure that can be easily flexed, compressed, or burnt without any noticeable changes in its structure and absorption capacity. The BAG surface absorbs nonpolar solvents efficiently up to similar to 20 times its own weight due to its superhydrophobic nature arising from the presence of MWCNTs. Furthermore, BAGs exhibit excellent resilience to impact by recovering more than 70% of the deformation. The energy dissipated by BAGs at 80% compressive strain is in the order of 500 kJ m(-3), which is nearly 50 times more than the energy dissipated by commercial foams with similar densities.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1438-1656	1527-2648		WOS:000357680700009

Technical note: Digital quantification of eye pigmentation of cattle with white faces								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				93	7			3654	3660		10.2527/jas.2014-8786			JUL 2015	2015	Cancer of the eye in cattle with white faces occurs less frequently in cattle with pigmented eyelids. Corneoscleral pigmentation is related to eyelid pigmentation and occurrence of lesions that may precede cancer. Objectives of this study were to assess 1) variation in the proportion of eyelid and corneoscleral pigmentation in Hereford, Bos taurus, and Bos indicus crossbreds and 2) the occurrence of lesions with the presence of pigmentation in those areas. Hereford and Bos indicus crosses (Brahman or Nellore with Angus and Hereford and straightbred Brafords) and Bos taurus crosses (Angus-Hereford) were included in the study (n = 1,083). Eyelid pigmentation proportions were estimated by pixel quantification and were evaluated as total proportions and for upper and lower eyelids distinctly for each eye. Fixed effects included breed type, age categories, and sex of the animal. Lesion presence (1) or absence (0) was obtained by visual appraisal of image and was assumed to be binomially distributed. Eyelid pigmentation proportions (overall, upper, and lower eyelids) for Hereford ranged from 0.65 +/- 0.03 to 0.68 +/- 0.03 and were significantly lower than Bos indicus (range from 0.93 +/- 0.02 to 0.95 +/- 0.02) or Bos taurus (ranged from 0.88 +/- 0.02 to 0.92 +/- 0.02) crosses. Corneoscleral pigmentation in Hereford cows (0.17 +/- 0.06) did not differ (P = 0.91) from Hereford calves and yearlings (0.16 +/- 0.07). Bos indicus and Bos taurus crossbred cows had larger corneoscleral pigmentation (0.38 +/- 0.05 and 0.48 +/- 0.04 for left eyes and 0.37 +/- 0.05 and 0.53 +/- 0.04 for right eyes, respectively) than all calves (P < 0.001), and their corneoscleral pigmentations were greater than that of Hereford cows (P < 0.003). Bos indicus and Bos taurus cows had greater proportions of left eye corneoscleral pigmentation (0.38 +/- 0.05 and 0.48 +/- 0.04, respectively) than Hereford cows (0.17 +/- 0.06) and all young animal breed types (P < 0.05). Right eye proportions differed for all cow groups (P < 0.05; 0.53 +/- 0.04, 0.37 +/- 0.05, and 0.17 +/- 0.06). Among calves and yearlings, Hereford had a lower right eye corneoscleral pigmentation proportion (0.16 +/- 0.07) than Bos taurus (P = 0.02). The lesion proportion for Hereford (0.08 +/- 0.03) was significantly greater than that of either Bos indicus (0.01 +/- 0.005) or Bos taurus (0.01 +/- 0.003).

The Interaction Between an Individual's Acculturation and Community Factors on Physical Inactivity and Obesity: A Multilevel Analysis								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH				105	7			1460	1467		10.2105/AJPH.2014.302541			JUL 2015	2015	Objectives. We examined whether the interactions between primarily speaking English at home and community-level measures (median household income and immigrant composition) are associated with physical inactivity and obesity.Methods. We pooled the 2005 and 2007 Los Angeles County Health Survey data to construct a multilevel data set, with community-level median household income and immigrant density as predictors at the community level. After controlling for individual-level demographic variables, we included the respondent's perceived community safety as a covariate to test the hypothesis that perceived public safety mediates the association between acculturation and health outcomes.Results. The interaction between community median household income and primarily speaking English at home was associated with lower likelihoods of physical inactivity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.644; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.502, 0.825) and obesity (OR = 0.674; 95% CI = 0.514, 0.882). These odds remained significant after we controlled for perceived community safety.Conclusions. Resources in higher-income areas may be beneficial only to residents fully integrated into the community. Future research could focus on understanding how linguistic isolation affects community-level social learning and access to resources and whether this differs by family-level acculturation.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0090-0036	1541-0048		WOS:000362909400035	25973827	
J	Childress, Michael J.; Heldt, Katherine A.; Miller, Scott D.								Are juvenile Caribbean spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) becoming less social?								ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE				72				170	176		10.1093/icesjms/fsv045		1	JUL 2015	2015	Caribbean spiny lobsters are one of the most commercially important fisheries due in large part to their highly gregarious nature that facilitates their harvest by the use of traps or aggregation devices containing conspecifics. Aggregation in this species has been shown to be due to strong attraction to conspecific chemical cues that influence movement rates, discovery of crevice shelters, and den sharing behaviours. Although aggregation has been shown to have many potential benefits (reduction in exposure time and predation risk), it may also have significant costs as well (increase in predator encounters, disease transmission, and fishing mortality). We compared the results of three published and three unpublished Y-maze chemical cue choice experiments from 1996 to 2012 to determine if there has been a decrease in conspecific attraction by early benthic juvenile Caribbean spiny lobsters (15-55 mm carapace length, CL). We found that attraction to conspecific chemical cues decreased since 2010 and was significantly lower in 2012. Lobsters showed individual variation in conspecific attraction but this variation was unrelated to size, sex, or dominance status. We also found localized regional variation in conspecific attraction with lobsters from high shelter/high disease areas showing significantly lower conspecific attraction than those from low shelter/low disease areas. Given that conspecific attraction varies among individuals and potentially increases mortality through either natural (increased disease transmission) or fishery-induced (attraction to traps) mechanisms, we should play close attention to this loss of conspecific attraction in juvenile lobsters. Future studies should investigate both the causation and the ecological significance of changes in conspecific attraction in regions that vary in intensity of disease (PaV1) and fishing pressure.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1054-3139	1095-9289		WOS:000359698700018

Described from California, Idaho, and Oregon, it since has been recorded only from Washington State. Adults are known from juniper (Juniperus), but it is not known whether junipers support the pentatomid's nymphal development. From 2012 to 2014, nymphs and adults were collected from Rocky Mountain juniper (J. scopulorum) in natural communities and ornamental plantings at 18 sites in five states: Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming; all are new state records. Nymphs of all instars (I-V) were found on female plants of the dioecious J. scopulorum in early July and instars II-V in early to mid-September. Juniperus scopulorum is considered a host plant in a restricted sense of the term: a plant on which nymphs feed and develop. Occasionally present on junipers were fifth instars of three other pentatomids: B. euchlora Stal (Wyoming is a new state record), Thyanta calceata (Say), and T. custator accerra McAtee.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000360054200008

The data indicate that by simple modifications of linker length and composition, substantial differences in rRNA selectivity and AME activity can be obtained. We tested five different AMEs with dimeric NEO dimers that were tethered via triazole, urea, and thiourea linkages. We show that triazole-linked dimers were the worst substrates for most AMEs, with those containing the longer linkers showing the largest decrease in activity. Thiourea-linked dimers that showed a decrease in activity by AMEs also showed increased bacterial A site binding, with one compound (compound 14) even showing substantially reduced human A site binding. The urea-linked dimers showed a substantial decrease in activity by AMEs when a conformationally restrictive phenyl linker was introduced. The information learned herein advances our understanding of the importance of the linker length and composition for the generation of dimeric aminoglycoside antibiotics capable of avoiding the action of AMEs and selective binding to the bacterial rRNA over binding to the human rRNA.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0066-4804	1098-6596		WOS:000360896000025	25896697

For ultra-small area of the order of 0.1 cm(2), efficiency of 20% or so are reported. However, for area of 25 cm(2), the efficiency is about 10%. Based on the photovoltaic module manufacturing requirements of no constraint on the supply of raw materials, low variability of every key process and process-induced defects, low cost of manufacturing, prospects for further cost reduction in the future, green manufacturing, and long-term reliability, there are absolutely no prospects of manufacturing perovskite solar cells. No one has commercialized perovskite solar cells. Thus, contrary to hype in the literature, there is no truth that perovskite solar cells will replace silicon solar cells. We have also examined the role of perovskite solar cells for increasing the efficiency of silicon solar cells and found unsuitable both for two and four terminal device architectures.

The method utilizes 3D structures of the corresponding protein-protein complexes and takes advantage of both approaches: sequence- and structure-based methods. The method has two components: a MM/PBSA-based component, and an additional set of statistical terms delivered from statistical investigation of physico-chemical properties of protein complexes. While the approach is rigid body approach and does not explicitly consider plausible conformational changes caused by the binding, the effect of conformational changes, including changes away from binding interface, on electrostatics are mimicked with amino acid specific dielectric constants. This provides significant improvement of SAAMBE predictions as indicated by better match against experimentally determined binding free energy changes over 1300 mutations in 43 proteins. The final benchmarking resulted in a very good agreement with experimental data (correlation coefficient 0.624) while the algorithm being fast enough to allow for large-scale calculations (the average time is less than a minute per mutation).									8	0	0	4	0	8			1553-734X	1553-7358		WOS:000360620100011	26146996

Existing methods for diamagnetic particle trapping require the placement of one or multiple pairs of magnets nearby the particle flowing channel. The strong attractive or repulsive force between the magnets makes it difficult to align and place them close enough to the channel, which not only complicates the device fabrication but also restricts the particle trapping performance. This work demonstrates for the first time the use of a single permanent magnet to simultaneously trap diamagnetic and magnetic particles in ferrofluid flows through a T-shaped microchannel. The two types of particles are preconcentrated to distinct locations of the T-junction due to the induced negative and positive magnetophoretic motions, respectively. Moreover, they can be sequentially released from their respective trapping spots by simply increasing the ferrofluid flow rate. In addition, a three-dimensional numerical model is developed, which predicts with a reasonable agreement the trajectories of diamagnetic and magnetic particles as well as the buildup of ferrofluid nanoparticles.

J	Cross, Robert B.; Bridges, William C., Jr.; McCarty, Lambert B.; McElroy, J. Scott								Evaluating Annual Bluegrass Herbicide Resistance Evolution in Golf Course Fairways								WEED TECHNOLOGY				29	3			488	500		10.1614/WT-D-14-00151.1			JUL-SEP 2015	2015	Annual bluegrass is one of the most diverse plant species in the world and is the most problematic winter annual weed in commercial turfgrass. Continuous application of the same herbicide mechanism of action for annual bluegrass control on golf courses has increased herbicide-resistant populations. The purpose of this research was to simulate six herbicide-use strategies to evaluate the risk of annual bluegrass resistance evolution to glyphosate. In a worst-case scenario of yearly glyphosate applications at dormancy, resistance evolved within 10 yr and was predicted to evolve in > 90% of populations by yr 20. When glyphosate was rotated on alternate years with a unique mechanism of action, resistance was delayed for 12 to 15 yr. Season-long control of annual bluegrass often requires multiple herbicide applications. Therefore, additional strategies were simulated in which glyphosate was applied at dormancy with combinations of PRE and/or POST herbicides at various timings. Resistance was most effectively delayed with a PRE application in late summer, a POST application in fall, and alternating glyphosate with a different POST option at dormancy. This delayed resistance by 25 yr and a 35% risk was predicted after 50 yr. Strategies utilizing three annual herbicide applications with unique mechanisms of action were more effective for controlling population growth compared to other strategies. Resistance was predicted to evolve within 35 yr for each of the strategies simulated. However, these results indicate annual bluegrass herbicide resistance can be managed by using an integrated herbicide program, rotating unique mechanisms of action as frequently as possible.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0890-037X	1550-2740		WOS:000359448400017

The gamma-ray emission of the source measured by Fermi-LAT showed multiple distinct flares reaching the highest flux level measured in this object since the beginning of the Fermi mission, with F(E > 100 MeV) of 10(-5) photons cm(-2) s(-1), and with a flux-doubling time scale as short as 2 hr. The gamma-ray spectrum during one of the flares was very hard, with an index of Gamma(gamma) = 1.7 +/- 0.1, which is rarely seen in flat-spectrum radio quasars. The lack of concurrent optical variability implies a very high Compton dominance parameter L-gamma/L-syn > 300. Two 1 day NuSTAR observations with accompanying Swift pointings were separated by 2 weeks, probing different levels of source activity. While the 0.5 - 70 keV X-ray spectrum obtained during the first pointing, and fitted jointly with Swift-XRT is well-described by a simple power law, the second joint observation showed an unusual spectral structure: the spectrum softens by Delta Gamma(X) similar or equal to 0.4 at similar to 4 keV. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution during this flare with the standard synchrotron plus inverse-Compton model requires: (1) the location of the gamma-ray emitting region is comparable with the broad-line region radius, (2) a very hard electron energy distribution index p similar or equal to 1, (3) total jet power significantly exceeding the accretion-disk luminosity L-j/L-d greater than or similar to 10, and (4) extremely low jet magnetization with L-B/L-j less than or similar to 10(-4). We also find that single-zone models that match the observed gamma-ray and optical spectra cannot satisfactorily explain the production of X-ray emission.									31	1	0	0	0	32			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000358945200079

Arsenic and Its Methylated Metabolites Inhibit the Differentiation of Neural Plate Border Specifier Cells								CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY				28	7			1409	1421		10.1021/acs.chemrestox.5b00036			JUL 2015	2015	Exposure to arsenic in food and drinking water has been correlated with adverse developmental outcomes, such as reductions in birth weight and neurological deficits. Additionally, studies have shown that arsenic suppresses sensory neuron formation and skeletal muscle myogenesis, although the reason why arsenic targets both of these cell types in unclear. Thus, P19 mouse embryonic stem cells were used to investigate the mechanisms by which arsenic could inhibit cellular differentiation. P19 cells were exposed to 0, 0.1, or 0.5,mu M sodium arsenite and induced to form embryoid bodies over a period of 5 days. The expression of transcription factors necessary to form neural plate border specifier (NPBS) cells, neural crest cells and their progenitors, and myocytes and their progenitors were examined. Early during differentiation, arsenic significantly reduced the transcript and protein expression of Msxl and Pax3, both needed for NPBS cell formation. Arsenic also significantly reduced the protein expression of Sox 10, needed for neural crest progenitor cell production, by 31-50%, and downregulated the protein and mRNA levels of NeuroD1, needed for neural crest cell differentiation, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. While the overall protein expression of transcription factors in the skeletal muscle lineage was not changed, arsenic did alter their nuclear localization. MyoD nuclear translocation was significantly reduced on days 2-5 between 15 and 70%. At a 10-fold lower concentration, monomethylarsonous acid (MMA III) appeared to be just as potent as inorganic arsenic at reducing the mRNA levels Pax3 (79% vs84%), Sox10 (49% vs 65%), and Msxl (56% vs 56%). Dimethylarsinous acid (DMA III) also reduced protein and transcript expression, but the changes were less dramatic than those with MMA or arsenite. All three arsenic species reduced the nuclear localization of MyoD and NeuroD1 in a similar manner. The early changes in the differentiation of neural plate border specifier cells may provide a mechanism for arsenic to suppress both neurogenesis and myogenesis.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0893-228X	1520-5010		WOS:000358548200004	26024302

Morphometric values of amphimictic lance nematode species overlap considerably, and useful morphological characters for their discrimination require high magnification and significant diagnostic time. Given their morphological similarity, these Hoplolaimus species provide an interesting model to investigate hidden diversity in crop agroecosystems. In this scenario, H. galeatus may have been over-reported and the related species that are morphologically similar could be more widespread in the United States that has been recognized thus far. The main objectives of this study were to delimit Hoplolaimus galeatus and morphologically similar species using morphology, phylogeny, and a barcoding approach, and to estimate the genetic diversity and population structure of the species found. Molecular analyses were performed using sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (Cox1) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) on 23 populations. Four morphospecies were identified: H. galeatus, H. magnistylus, H. concaudajuvencus, and H. stephanus, along with a currently undescribed species. Pronounced genetic structure correlated with geographic origin was found for all species, except for H. galeatus. Hoplolaimus galeatus also exhibited low genetic diversity and the shortest genetic distances among populations. In contrast, H. stephanus, the species with the fewest reports from agricultural soils, was the most common and diverse species found. Results of this project may lead to better delimitation of lance nematode species in the United States by contributing to the understanding the diversity within this group.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-7758			WOS:000358452700015	26306177	
J	Abdelaziz, Sherif L.; Olgun, C.

Such interference is observed as sudden fluid temperature increases or stabilizations which require advanced data processing techniques for reliable estimates of the effective ground thermal conductivity. This paper presents a modified testing procedure to eliminate the ambient interference observed in thermal conductivity tests for short ground heat exchangers including Energy Piles. The proposed testing technique relies on counterbalancing the ambient interference when heating the circulating fluid. Supported with a full-scale field experiment on an Energy Pile, the proposed testing technique showed a successful elimination of the ambient interference and an accurate estimate of the ground thermal conductivity using the simple infinite line source (ILS) model. Further, the estimated ground thermal conductivity is independent of the number of hours included in the data processing which offers the potential to reduce the testing duration and consequently the associated testing costs.

In the public eye there is a natural expectation of efficient response. There is abundant literature on the topic of efficient planning of EMS systems (maximizing expected coverage or minimizing response time). Other objectives have been considered but the literature available is very sparse compared to efficiency-based works. Furthermore, while real size EMS systems have been studied, the use of exact models is usually hindered by the amount of computational time required to obtain solutions. We approach the planning of large-scale EMS systems including fairness considerations using a Tabu Search-based heuristic with an embedded approximation procedure for the queuing submodel. This allows for the analysis of large-scale real systems, extending the approach in which strategic decisions (location) and operative decisions (dispatching) are combined to balance efficiency and fairness.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0160-5682	1476-9360		WOS:000358187000009

Using a Novel Absolute Ontogenetic Age Determination Technique to Calculate the Timing of Tooth Eruption in the Saber-Toothed Cat, Smilodon fatalis								PLOS ONE				10	7					e0129847	10.1371/journal.pone.0129847			JUL 1 2015	2015	Despite the superb fossil record of the saber-toothed cat, Smilodon fatalis, ontogenetic age determination for this and other ancient species remains a challenge. The present study utilizes a new technique, a combination of data from stable oxygen isotope analyses and micro-computed tomography, to establish the eruption rate for the permanent upper canines in Smilodon fatalis. The results imply an eruption rate of 6.0 millimeters per month, which is similar to a previously published average enamel growth rate of the S. fatalis upper canines (5.8 millimeters per month). Utilizing the upper canine growth rate, the upper canine eruption rate, and a previously published tooth replacement sequence, this study calculates absolute ontogenetic age ranges of tooth development and eruption in S. fatalis. The timing of tooth eruption is compared between S. fatalis and several extant conical-toothed felids, such as the African lion (Panthera leo). Results suggest that the permanent dentition of S. fatalis, except for the upper canines, was fully erupted by 14 to 22 months, and that the upper canines finished erupting at about 34 to 41 months. Based on these developmental age calculations, S. fatalis individuals less than 4 to 7 months of age were not typically preserved at Rancho La Brea. On the whole, S. fatalis appears to have had delayed dental development compared to dental development in similar-sized extant felids. This technique for absolute ontogenetic age determination can be replicated in other ancient species, including non-saber-toothed taxa, as long as the timing of growth initiation and growth rate can be determined for a specific feature, such as a tooth, and that growth period overlaps with the development of the other features under investigation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000358153000042	26132165

A suspected resistant (R) biotype of annual bluegrass was identified on a golf course in South Carolina after at least 10 consecutive years of glyphosate application. Greenhouse bioassays revealed the R biotype was 4.4-fold resistant to glyphosate compared with a standard susceptible (S) biotype. Further studies were conducted to investigate the mechanism conferring glyphosate resistance in the R biotype. Leaf discs of both biotypes accumulated shikimate in response to increasing glyphosate concentration, but the glyphosate concentration resulting in 50% EPSP synthase inhibition as a result of shikimate accumulation (I-50) was 4.2-fold higher in the R biotype compared with the S biotype. At the whole plant level, similar levels of shikimate accumulation were observed between biotypes at 6 and 24 h after treatment (HAT) with glyphosate, but greater shikimate accumulation occurred in the S biotype at 72, 120, and 168 HAT. Shikimate levels decreased in the R biotype after 72 HAT. There were no differences in C-14-glyphosate absorption between biotypes. However, more C-14-glyphosate translocated out of the treated leaf in the R biotype and into root tissues over time compared with the S biotype. Partial sequencing of the EPSP synthase gene revealed a point mutation that resulted in an Ala substitution at Pro(106). Although other mechanisms may contribute to glyphosate resistance, these results confirm a Pro(106) to Ala substitution is associated with resistance to glyphosate in the R annual bluegrass biotype.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0043-1745	1550-2759		WOS:000358252400007		
J	Taylor, Tonya; Ingram-Smith, Cheryl; Smith, Kerry S.								Biochemical and Kinetic Characterization of the Eukaryotic Phosphotransacetylase Class IIa Enzyme from Phytophthora ramorum								EUKARYOTIC CELL				14	7			652	660		10.1128/EC.00007-15			JUL 2015	2015	Phosphotransacetylase (Pta), a key enzyme in bacterial metabolism, catalyzes the reversible transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl phosphate to coenzyme A (CoA) to produce acetyl-CoA and P-i. Two classes of Pta have been identified based on the absence (Pta(I)) or presence (Pta(II)) of an N-terminal regulatory domain. Pta(I) has been fairly well studied in bacteria and one genus of archaea; however, only the Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica Pta(II) enzymes have been biochemically characterized, and they are allosterically regulated. Here, we describe the first biochemical and kinetic characterization of a eukaryotic Pta from the oomycete Phytophthora ramorum. The two Ptas from P. ramorum, designated PrPta(II)1 and PrPta(II)2, both belong to class II. PrPta(II)1 displayed positive cooperativity for both acetyl phosphate and CoA and is allosterically regulated. We compared the effects of different metabolites on PrPta(II)1 and the S. enterica PtaII and found that, although the N-terminal regulatory domains share only 19% identity, both enzymes are inhibited by ATP, NADP, NADH, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and pyruvate in the acetyl-CoA/Pi-forming direction but are differentially regulated by AMP. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic sequences identified four subtypes of PtaII based on the presence or absence of the P-loop and DRTGG subdomains within the N-terminal regulatory domain. Although the E. coli, S. enterica, and P. ramorum enzymes all belong to the IIa subclass, our kinetic analysis has indicated that enzymes within a subclass can still display differences in their allosteric regulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1535-9778	1535-9786		WOS:000357025900003	25956919

Understanding and Improving Teamwork in Organizations: A Scientifically Based Practical Guide								HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT				54	4			599	622		10.1002/hrm.21628			JUL-AUG 2015	2015	Teams are pervasive in today's world, and rightfully so as we need them. Drawing upon the existing extensive body of research surrounding the topic of teamwork, we delineate nine critical considerations that serve as a practical heuristic by which HR leaders can determine what is needed when they face situations involving teamwork. Our heuristic is not intended to be the definitive set of all considerations for teamwork, but instead consolidates key findings from a vast literature to provide an integrated understanding of the underpinnings of teamworkspecifically, what should be considered when selecting, developing, and maintaining teams. This heuristic is designed to help those in practice diagnose team-based problems by providing a clear focus on relevant aspects of teamwork. To this end, we first define teamwork and its related elements. Second, we offer a high-level conceptualization of and justification for the nine selected considerations underlying the heuristic, which is followed by a more in-depth synthesis of related literature as well as empirically-driven practical guidance. Third, we conclude with a discussion regarding how this heuristic may best be used from a practical standpoint, as well as offer areas for future research regarding both teamwork and its critical considerations.

Data collected in a lagged field study of 144 retailer manager (customer)-salesperson dyads were modeled using hierarchical linear modeling and response surface modeling techniques. Results from our analysis reveal that salesperson expertise drives retailers' desire for control in these relationships. In addition, while incongruence in perceived-desired control was negatively associated with both satisfaction and objective sales, retailer satisfaction was higher when both desired and perceived control were high. Further, as desired and perceived control over the sales relationship both increase, product sales initially decrease, and then increase, exhibiting a "U-shaped" effect. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed. These include adaptive sales training to identify misalignment between desired and perceived control, optimization of cocreation strategies, incorporation of interorganizational relational constructs, exploration of triadic social network configurations, examination of unmet expectations, and the implications of assimilation-contrast theory.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9010	1939-1854		WOS:000357814500006	25495095	
J	Wang, Xiaoxia; Cook, Lauren F.; Grasso, Lindsay M.; Cao, Min; Dong, Yuqing								Royal Jelly-Mediated Prolongevity and Stress Resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans Is Possibly Modulated by the Interplays of DAF-16, SIR-2.1, HCF-1, and 14-3-3 Proteins								JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES				70	7			827	838		10.1093/gerona/glu120			JUL 2015	2015	Recent studies suggest that royal jelly (RJ) and its related substances may have antiaging properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects remain elusive. We report that the effects of RJ and enzyme-treated RJ (eRJ) on life span and health span in Caenorhabditis elegans (C elegans) are modulated by the sophisticated interplays of DAF-16, SIR-2.1, HCF-1, and 14-3-3 proteins. Dietary supplementation with RJ or eRJ increased C. elegans life span in a dose-dependent manner. The RJ and eRJ consumption increased the tolerance of C elegans to oxidative stress, ultraviolet irradiation, and heat shock stress. Our genetic analyses showed that RJ/eRJ-mediated life-span extension requires insulin/IGF-1 signaling and the activities of DAF-16, SIR-2.1, HCF-1, and FTT-2, a 14-3-3 protein. Earlier studies reported that DAF-16/FOXO, SIR-2.1/SIRT1, FTT-2, and HCF-1 have extensive interplays in worms and mammals. Our present findings suggest that RJ/eRJ-mediated promotion of longevity and stress resistance in C elegans is dependent on these conserved interplays. From an evolutionary point of view, this study not only provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of RJ's action on health span promotion in C elegans, but also has imperative implications in using RJ/eRJ as nutraceuticals to delay aging and age-related disorders.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1079-5006	1758-535X		WOS:000357878900005	25073462

Clustering is widely used as a first step to interpreting high dimensional biological data, such as the gene expression data measured by microarrays. A good clustering algorithm should be efficient, reliable, and effective, as demonstrated by its capability of determining biologically relevant clusters. This paper proposes a new minimum spanning tree based heuristic B-MST, that is guided by an innovative objective function: the tightnesg and separation index (TSI). The TSI presented here obtains biologically meaningful clusters, making use of co-expression network topology, and this paper develops a local search procedure to minimize the TSI value. The proposed B-MST is tested by comparing results to: (1) adjusted rand index (ARI), for microarray data sets with known object classes, and (2) gene ontology (GO) annotations for data sets without documented object classes.

The testing results show that the volume erosion rates of 3YSZ and LaMgA1(11)O(19)-3YSZ ceramic were similar in the temperature range from room temperature to 600 degrees C, then exhibited a sharp increase from 600 degrees C to 1200 degrees C, and dropped again at 1400 degrees C. It was mainly caused by the change in material removal mechanisms from plastic deformation below 600 degrees C to the interaction of transverse cracks in the temperature range from 600 degrees C to 1400 degrees C. The solid particle impact erosion wear properties of 3YSZ ceramic in the temperature range from 600 degrees C to 1400 degrees C were successfully improved by the addition 2 wt% LaMgA1(11)O(19) platelets. Comparing with the volume erosion rate of pure 3YSZ ceramic (0.687mm(3)/g) at 1200 degrees C, the value of LaMgA1(11)O(19)-3YSZ ceramic (0.551mm(3)/g) has been decreased by 20%.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1546-542X	1744-7402		WOS:000357484500014

Order release is a key component of the Workload Control concept that aims to maintain work-in-process within limits while ensuring due dates are met. Order release includes two decisions: (i) a sequencing decision that establishes the order in which jobs are considered for release; and, (ii) a selection decision that determines the criteria for choosing jobs for release. While selection has received much research attention, sequencing has been largely neglected. Using simulation, this study uncovers the potential for performance improvement in the sequencing decision and improves our understanding of how order release methods should be designed. Although most prior studies apply time-oriented sequencing rules and load-oriented selection rules, analysis reveals that load balancing considerations should also be incorporated in the sequencing decision. But an exclusive focus on load balancing is shown to increase mean tardiness and, paradoxically, require high workloads. A new sequencing rule is developed that only balances loads when multiple orders become urgent. It avoids high mean tardiness and allows the shop to operate at a low workload level. At the same time, the percentage tardy is reduced by up to 50% compared to a purely time-oriented rule. The findings have implications not only for Workload Control but for any concept that features order release control, such as ConWIP and Drum-Buffer-Rope.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1059-1478	1937-5956		WOS:000357834000010		
J	Chen, Fei; Falta, Ronald W.; Murdoch, Lawrence C.								Numerical Analysis of Thermal Remediation in 3D Field-Scale Fractured Geologic Media								GROUNDWATER				53	4			572	587		10.1111/gwat.12241			JUL-AUG 2015	2015	Thermal methods are promising for remediating fractured geologic media contaminated with volatile organic compounds, and the success of this process depends on the coupled heat transfer, multiphase flow, and thermodynamics. This study analyzed field-scale removal of trichloroethylene (TCE) and heat transfer behavior in boiling fractured geologic media using the multiple interacting continua method. This method can resolve local gradients in the matrix and is less computationally demanding than alternative methods like discrete fracture-matrix models. A 2D axisymmetric model was used to simulate a single element of symmetry in a repeated pattern of extraction wells inside a large heated zone and evaluate effects of parameter sensitivity on contaminant recovery. The results showed that the removal of TCE increased with matrix permeability, and the removal rate was more sensitive to matrix permeability than any other parameter. Increasing fracture density promoted TCE removal, especially when the matrix permeability was low (e.g., <10(-17)m(2)). A 3D model was used to simulate an entire treatment zone and the surrounding groundwater in fractured material, with the interaction between them being considered. Boiling was initiated in the center of the upper part of the heated region and expanded toward the boundaries. This boiling process resulted in a large increase in the TCE removal rate and spread of TCE to the vadose zone and the peripheries of the heated zone. The incorporation of extraction wells helped control the contaminant from migrating to far regions. After 22d, more than 99.3% of TCE mass was recovered in the simulation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0017-467X	1745-6584		WOS:000357284700012	25040727

Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the effects of PEF treatment parameters on antioxidant activity of CPS. The optimal conditions were as follows: concentration of CPS 10 mg mL(-1), electric field intensity 15 kV cm(-1), and pulse frequency 2,000 Hz. Under the optimized conditions, the DPPH inhibition of CPS increased 32.1 %, compared to the sample untreated. And mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) was used for analyzing the structure change of CPS. The results showed that PEF technology could obviously increase the DPPH inhibition of CPS under the optimized conditions (P<0.05).									3	0	0	2	0	3			0022-1155	0975-8402		WOS:000357108000039

Results indicate that citizens of wealthier countries tend to see climate change as the most important problem, but are less likely to rank it as a highly dangerous threat. We find that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita correlates positively with perceived importance of climate change, but negatively with perceived risk. Also, climate change is less likely to be seen as highly dangerous in those countries that are better prepared for climate change. These findings have important implications for climate adaptation. The relatively weaker sense of danger among the wealthiest societies may eventually lead to maladaptation to climate change. Adequate economic resources provide people collective security and protection from impending crises, but could elevate a self-assuring attitude that might prematurely reduce their caution toward the impending threat and capacity for dealing with climate uncertainties.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0165-0009	1573-1480		WOS:000357037700012

The energy management problem, which by its very nature is a finite-time horizon control problem, is reformulated as a nonlinear-nonquadratic infinite-time optimization problem, leading to a family of state-feedback control laws that provide optimality with respect to an infinite time horizon performance objective, while guaranteeing asymptotic stability. The stability problem in charge-sustaining HEVs is formulated to allow the design of analytical solutions using a Lyapunov-based argument. The proposed control law is implemented on a pre-transmission parallel hybrid heavy-duty vehicle and the performance of the closed-loop system is shown in simulation and compared with the benchmark solution provided by Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) and the real-time adaptive controller adaptive-PMP. Results show low sensitivity to the control parameter, low-calibration effort, and reduction of computational effort, while maintaining close-to-the-optimum performance. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations were conducted to validate and verify the new strategy in a real-time simulation setup.									4	1	0	0	0	5			1063-6536	1558-0865		WOS:000356523600005

This study proposes a novel hybrid topology for double flying capacitor multicell (DFCM) converters that is suitable for grid-tied renewable energy systems. The proposed power converter is realised by cascade connection of one DFCM converter and one full-bridge converter (FBC) comprising a floating-capacitor. The floating-capacitor voltage of the FBC is regulated naturally at its requisite voltage level because of the existence of the abundant redundant charging/discharging states provided by the proposed switching and modulation pattern for the suggested hybrid converter. Hence the proposed control technique not only preserves the natural balancing for the FC voltages of the DFCM converter but also provides natural balancing for the floating-capacitor voltage of the FBC. The main objective of the FBC is to generate additional intermediate voltage steps to double the number of DFCM converter's voltage levels for enhancing power quality significantly. The proposed hybrid DFCM converter is simulated to inject/absorb active/reactive-power provided and harvested from renewable energy resources into/from electric power grid. Furthermore, experimental measurements of the proposed hybrid power converter are also presented to validate its viability, merits, effectiveness and the proposed modulation and control strategy.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1751-8687	1751-8695		WOS:000356584400009

Recent investigations have revealed that reading motivation begins to erode as early as second grade. Therefore, it can be suggested that motivation must be carefully considered during early literacy instruction. However, such motivating instruction can be effectively planned only when informed by data. Consequently, there is a need for a developmentally appropriate tool to assess reading motivation in kindergarten through grade two.

The main structural characteristics and biological activities of prenylated flavonoids are reviewed in this paper. Usually prenylated flavonoids have a low abundance in nature and are complicated to be chemically synthesized, which limits the applications in dietary supplements and medicines. Biotransformation is a promising alternative to solve this problem due to the advantages of high specificity, easy manipulation and good productivity. The key to this technique is to find an effective flavonoid prenyltransferase.

Political oil import diversification by financial and commercial traders								ENERGY POLICY				82				289	297		10.1016/j.enpol.2015.02.025			JUL 2015	2015	International politics affects the oil trade. But do financial and commercial traders who participate in spot oil trading also respond to changes in international politics? We construct a firm-level dataset for all U.S. oil-importing companies over 1986-2008 to examine how these firms respond to increases in "political distance" between the U.S. and her trading partners, measured by divergence in their UN General Assembly voting patterns. Consistent with previous macro evidence, we first show that individual firms diversify their oil imports politically, even after controlling for unobserved firm heterogeneity. However, the political pattern of oil imports is not entirely driven by the concerns of hold-up risks, which exist when oil transactions via term contracts are associated with backward vertical FDI that is subject to expropriation. In particular, our results indicate that even financial and commercial traders significantly reduce their oil imports from U.S. political enemies. Interestingly, while these traders diversify their oil imports politically immediately after changes in international politics, other oil companies reduce their oil imports with a significant time lag. Our findings suggest that in designing regulations to avoid harmful repercussions on commodity and financial assets, policymakers need to understand the nature of political risk.

A decision making framework with MODFLOW-FMP2 via optimization: Determining trade-offs in crop selection								ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE				69				280	291		10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.11.031			JUL 2015	2015	Farmers in regions experiencing water stress or drought conditions can struggle to balance their crop portfolios. Periods of low precipitation often lead to increased, unsustainable reliance on groundwater-supplied irrigation. As a result, regional water management agencies place limits on the amount of water which can be obtained from groundwater, requiring farmers to reduce acreage for more water-intensive crops or remove them from the portfolio entirely. Real-time decisions must be made by the farmer to ensure viability of their farming operation and reduce the impacts associated with limited water resources. Evolutionary algorithms, coupled with accurate, flexible, realistic simulation tools, are ideal mechanisms to allow farmers to assess scenarios with regard to multiple, competing objectives. In order to effective, however, one must be able to select among a variety of simulation tools and optimization algorithms. Many simulation tools allow no access to the source code, and many optimization algorithms are now packaged as part of a suite of tools available to a user. In this work, we describe a framework for integrating these different software components using only their associated input and output streams. We analyze our strategy by coupling a multi-objective genetic algorithm available in the DAKOTA optimization suite (developed and distributed by Sandia National Laboratory) with the MODFLOW-FMP2 simulation tool (developed and distributed by the United States Geological Survey). MODFLOW-FMP2 has been used extensively to model hydrological and farming processes in agriculture-dciminated regions, allowing us to represent both farming and conservation interests. We evaluate our integration by considering a case study related to planting decisions facing farmers experiencing water stress. We present numerical results for three competing objectives associated with stakeholders in a given region (i.e., profitability, meeting demand targets, and water conservation). The data obtained from the optimization are robust with respect to algorithmic parameter choices, validating the ability of the associated evolutionary algorithm to perform well without expert guidance. This is integral to our approach, as a motivation for this work is providing decision-making tools. In addition, the results from this study demonstrate that output from the chosen evolutionary algorithm provides a suite of feasible planting scenarios, giving farmers and policy makers the ability to compromise solutions based on realistic simulation data.

The role of trust in stock market reactions to corporate earnings announcements								JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS				117	1	SI		190	223		10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.08.004			JUL 2015	2015	We examine whether the level of trust in a country affects investors' perception and utilization of information transmitted by firms through financial disclosure. Specifically, we investigate the effect of societal trust on investor reactions to corporate earnings announcements. We test two competing hypotheses. On the one hand, corporate earnings announcements are perceived as more credible by investors in more trusting societies and, therefore, elicit stronger investor reactions. On the other hand, societal trust mitigates outside investors' concern of moral hazard and reduces the value of corporate earnings announcements to them, thereby weakening their reactions to these events. We analyze the abnormal trading volume and abnormal stock return variance during the earnings announcement period in a large sample of firm-year observations across 25 countries, and we find that both measures of investor reactions to earnings announcements are significantly higher in more trusting countries. We also find that the positive effect of societal trust on investor reactions to earnings news is more pronounced when a country's investor protection and disclosure requirements are weaker, suggesting that trust acts as a substitute for formal institutions; when a country's average education level is lower, consistent with less educated people relying more on trust in making economic decisions; and when firm-level information asymmetry is higher, supporting the notion that trust plays a more important role in poorer information environments.

While the concrete prism test (CPT) test is considered to be a more reliable alternative, the unusually long test duration (1 or 2years, depending on the purpose) renders it unsuitable for routine evaluation of materials. This paper presents a new test methodthe miniature concrete prism test (MCPT) that addresses the shortcomings of both the AMBT and the CPT test methods. The aggregates studied in this project were selected based on their established field performance. Results from this investigation indicate that the MCPT test method can reliably identify aggregate reactivity within a short duration of 56days for the majority of aggregates, whereas it may take up to 84days for some slowly reactive aggregates.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0899-1561	1943-5533		WOS:000356421200029		
J	Dey, Kakan Chandra; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Wiecek, Margaret M.; Dunning, Anne								Infrastructure Damage-Cost-Recovery Fee for Overweight Trucks: Tradeoff Analysis Framework								JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING				141	7					04015008	10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000769			JUL 2015	2015	The rapid growth of freight traffic is now taxing a significant number of the U.S. national freight corridors. Additional demand accompanied by trucks over legal weight limits has been accelerating pavement and bridge deterioration at a faster rate than anticipated. States do not collect sufficient revenues to offset pavement and bridge damage caused by overweight trucks. As increase in overweight permit fee may affect different stakeholders positively and/or negatively, decision makers must develop policy options considering multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously. A multiobjective analysis approach [i.e.,the epsilon (epsilon)-constraint method] was applied to address conflicting objectives associated with overweight freight truck mobility and to identify rational overweight truck damage cost recovery fee options by generating detailed tradeoffs between these options. Bridge damage costs were estimated as fatigue damage using finite-element simulation models of bridge archetypes and pavement damage costs were estimated using a method based on equivalent single-axle load as per AASHTO standard. These costs were used to develop the mathematical relationship between the objectives and constraints in the multiobjective model. This paper presents a case study with two objectives, as follows: (1)minimization of unpaid pavement and bridge damage by overweight freight trucks, and (2)minimization of overweight damage cost recovery fees. A set of 10 overweight fee options and the associated tradeoffs are developed for four damage cost recovery fee types [i.e.,(1)flat, (2)axle-based, (3)weight-based, and (4)weight-distance-based fee types]. The tradeoff analysis reveals that increasing the flat overweight damage cost recovery fee by $1 from $43 will reduce unpaid damages by $4.2million annually in South Carolina with a high elasticity of demand. In the axle-based damage cost recovery fee type, increasing the average axle-based overweight damage cost recovery fee by $1 from $43 will reduce unpaid damages of $3.8million annually in South Carolina. These types of tradeoff analyses provide valuable information to decision makers in selecting types and levels of fee for overweight trucks. Tradeoff analysis framework and results of the tradeoff analysis depicted in the paper contributes to assessing infrastructure damage due to overweight trucks, and developing damage recovery fee policies considering multiple conflicting objectives.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0733-947X	1943-5436		WOS:000356422700002

Degradation of PLA fibers at elevated temperature and humidity								POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE				55	7			1652	1660		10.1002/pen.24003			JUL 2015	2015	The hydrolytic degradation of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) devices has previously been reported as size dependent for devices such as plates, microspheres, and films between 2 and 0.3 mm in thickness or diameter. In this study, the effect of fiber diameter on the degradation characteristics of PLA fiber of two diameters, 32 mu m (PLA32) and 118 mu m (PLA118), aged at 40, 60, and 80 degrees C with 100% relative humidity, was investigated. Additionally, both PLA32 and PLA118 were aged at 40 and 60 degrees C under nitrogen purge. The degradation of the fibers was evaluated based on changes in the total weight, crystallinity, and molecular weight of the samples. Both diameters exhibited similar total weight loss, crystallinity, and molecular weight loss profiles under each set of degradation conditions. Two models for the change in molecular weight were compared: a first order model and an autocatalytic model. For the obtained data, both models provided a reasonable fit of the molecular weight data. Based on the rate constants obtained for each model, the activation energy for PLA degradation was calculated (26.3 kcal mol(-1) for the first order model and 22.4 kcal mol(-1) for the autocatalytic model). The activation energies obtained were close to other values reported in the literature for PLA hydrolysis. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 55:1652-1660, 2015.

Previous research has shown that drowsy drivers produce systematic errors (variability) in vehicle behavior which are detectable using vehicle monitoring technology. The current study developed a new methodological approach using a vehicle heading difference metric to detect drowsy driving more effectively than other more commonly used methods. Twenty participants completed a driving scenario as well as several measures of fatigue in five testing sessions across a night of sleep deprivation. Each simulated highway driving session lasted 20 min, and was analyzed for lateral lane position variability and vehicle heading difference variability with two statistical methods. Fatigue measures monitored reaction time, attention, and oculomotor movement. The results showed that examining lane heading difference using the absolute value of the raw data detected driving variability better across the night than other statistical models. The results from the fatigue measures indicated an increase in reaction time and response lapses, as well as a decrease in oculomotor reactivity across the night. These results suggest that in fatigued drivers the statistical model using the absolute value of lane heading could be an improved metric for drowsy driving detection that could accurately detect detriments in driving ability at lower levels of fatigue.

In this work, three phenolics were isolated from litchi leaf by column chromatography. Their structures were identified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as secoisolariciresinol 9'-O-beta-D-xyloside (1), 4,7,7',8',9,9'-hexahydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-8,4'-oxyneolignan (2), and cinnamtannin B1 (3). Cinnamtannin B1 showed better extra- and intracellular antioxidant activities than Compounds 1 and 2. The intracellular antioxidant activity of cinnamtannin B1 was related to the upregulation of endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase), and inhibition of ROS generation. Furthermore, cinnamtannin B1 exhibited strong antiproliferative effects against HepG(2) and Siha cell lines with no significant cytotoxicities. In the case of the HepG(2) cell line, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction were the underlying anticancer mechanisms of cinnamtannin B1. The results indicated that cinnamtannin B1 was a potent cancer cell proliferation inhibitor and a good intracellular antioxidant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Hydrologic Drought Atlas for Texas								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING				20	7					05014023	10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001074			JUL 2015	2015	This paper presents a hydrologic drought atlas for the state of Texas. The atlas depicts the spatial variation of drought severity for durations of 3, 6, 12, and 24months corresponding to the return periods of 10, 25, 50, and 100years. Using the variable infiltration capacity model which is a large-scale land surface model, drought characteristics were derived from monthly stream flow simulated at 1/8 degrees resolution over the state of Texas. Appropriate marginal distributions of drought severity and duration were selected from amongst exponential, gamma, log-normal, and Weibull distributions, whereas the joint distribution of severity and duration was selected from the Archimedean, extreme value, Plackett, and elliptical families. Then, severity-duration-frequency (SDF) curves were obtained which were used for preparing the drought atlas that depicts the drought severity for any drought duration and return period at any location in Texas. Results indicate a decreasing pattern of severities from west to east. Humid and semihumid regions show a concave pattern in the SDF curves, whereas arid and semiarid regions show a convex pattern. The nonparametric Mann Kendall test was used to analyze the long-term drought trend that indicated a downward trend in arid and continental regions and an upward trend along the Gulf Coast, humid, and semihumid regions.									5	0	0	2	0	5			1084-0699	1943-5584		WOS:000356238600006

It has a significant impact on water quantity and quality and influences food, water, and energy security. The consequences of drought vary in space and time, from the local scale (e.g. county level) to regional scale (e.g. state or country level) to global scale. Within the regional scale, there are multiple socio-economic impacts (i.e., agriculture, drinking water supply, and stream health) occurring individually or in combination at local scales, either in clusters or scattered. Even though the application of aggregated drought information at the regional level has been useful in drought management, the latter can be further improved by evaluating the structure and evolution of a drought at the local scale. This study addresses a local-scale agricultural drought anatomy in Story County in Iowa, USA. This complex problem was evaluated using assimilated AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data into a crop model to generate surface and sub-surface drought indices to explore the anatomy of an agricultural drought. Quantification of moisture supply in the root zone remains a gray area in research community, this challenge can be partly overcome by incorporating assimilation of soil moisture and leaf area index into crop modeling framework for agricultural drought quantification, as it performs better in simulating crop yield. It was noted that the persistence of subsurface droughts is in general higher than surface droughts, which can potentially improve forecast accuracy. It was found that both surface and subsurface droughts have an impact on crop yields, albeit with different magnitudes, however, the total water available in the soil profile seemed to have a greater impact on the yield. Further, agricultural drought should not be treated equal for all crops, and it should be calculated based on the root zone depth rather than a fixed soil layer depth. We envisaged that the results of this study will enhance our understanding of agricultural droughts in different parts of the world. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Rajsekhar, Deepthi; Singh, Vijay. P.; Mishra, Ashok. K.								Multivariate drought index: An information theory based approach for integrated drought assessment								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY				526		SI		164	182		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.11.031			JUL 2015	2015	Most of the existing drought indices are based on a single variable (e.g. precipitation) or a combination of two variables (e.g., precipitation and streamflow). This may not be sufficient for reliable quantification of the existing drought condition. It is possible that a region might be experiencing only a single type of drought at times, but multiple drought types affecting a region is quite common too. To have a comprehensive representation, it is better to consider all the variables that lead to different physical forms of drought, such as meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts. Therefore, we propose to develop a multivariate drought index (MDI) that will utilize information from hydroclimatic variables, including precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration and soil moisture as indicator variables, thus accounting for all the physical forms of drought. The entropy theory was utilized to develop this proposed index, that led to the smallest set of features maximally preserving the information of the input data set. MDI was then compared with the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) for all climate regions within Texas for the time period 1950-2012, with particular attention to the two major drought occurrences in Texas, viz. the droughts which occurred in 1950-1957, and 2010-2011. The proposed MDI was found to represent drought conditions well, due to its multivariate, multi scalar, and nonlinear properties. To help the user choose the right time scale for further analysis, entropy maps of MDI at different time scales were used as a guideline. The MDI time scale that has the highest entropy value may be chosen, since a higher entropy indicates a higher information content. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

They have also been recently exploited to achieve a fast microfluidic mixing through magnetic field-induced flow instabilities at the ferrofluid/water interface. This work presents the first demonstration of electric field-induced instabilities in electroosmotic ferrofluid/water co-flows through a T-shaped microchannel. With the increase in electric field, instability waves and even chaotic flows can be formed when the two fluids merge at the T-junction due to the significant mismatch of their electrical conductivities. The experimentally observed dynamic behaviors of the ferrofluid/water interface are qualitatively captured by the ferrofluid concentration distribution obtained from a 2D numerical model. The measured threshold electric field for observing sustainable flow instabilities is found to decrease with the increase in ferrofluid concentration. While this trend is correctly predicted by the numerical model, the threshold electric field values are substantially under-predicted. The parametric effects that may be responsible for this discrepancy are discussed.									2	1	0	0	0	2			1613-4982	1613-4990		WOS:000356146300005

The Case of Sexual Aggression								PSYCHOLOGY OF VIOLENCE				5	3			305	313		10.1037/a0038316			JUL 2015	2015	Objective: Most frequency data on violence are non-normally distributed, which can lead to faulty conclusions when not modeled appropriately. And, we can't prevent what we can't accurately predict. We therefore review a series of methods specifically suited to analyze frequency data, with specific reference to the psychological study of sexual aggression. In the process, we demonstrate a model comparison exercise using sample data on college men's sexual aggression. Method: We used a subset (n = 645) of a larger longitudinal dataset to demonstrate fitting and comparison of 6 analytic methods: OLS regression, OLS regression with a square-root-transformed outcome, Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, zero-inflated Poisson regression, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Risk and protective factors measured at Time 1 predicted frequency of sexual aggression at Time 2 (8 months later) within each model. Models were compared on overall fit, parsimony, and interpretability based upon previous findings and substantive theory. Results: As we predicted, OLS regression assumptions were untenable. Of the count-based regression models, the negative binomial model fit the data best; it fit the data better than the Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson models, and it was more parsimonious than the zero-inflated negative binomial model without a significant degradation in model fit. Conclusion: In addition to more accurately modeling violence frequency data, count-based models have clear interpretations that can be disseminated to a broad audience. We recommend analytic steps investigators can use when analyzing count outcomes as well as further avenues researchers can explore in working with non-normal data on violence.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2152-0828	2152-081X		WOS:000356166600010	26925298

Little is known, however, about how the popular phenomenon of small groups factors into this equation. In the present study, we examine relationships between small group participation at individual and congregation levels and civic engagement. Using multilevel modeling and national data on congregations and individuals from the U.S. Congregational Life Study (n = 82,044), we find that: (1) individual-level small group involvement is associated with four measures of civic engagement; (2) congregation-level small group participation is associated with both lower and higher civic engagement in the case of two outcomes; and (3) in the case of three civic outcomes, congregation-level small group participation moderates individual-level small group involvement such that small group members' civic activity more closely resembles the lower civic engagement of small group nonparticipants. In the case of one civic outcome, at high levels of overall small group participation, small group members' civic engagement drops below that of small group nonparticipants. Explanations for these findings, including a "crowding out" effect, are examined including their complex implications for debates regarding small groups, religious involvement, and civic engagement.

We report our recent findings on non-invasive deep tissue imaging of polyester degradation, stability and integrity using an iodinated-polycaprolactone (i-P(CLcoOPD)) X-ray imaging contrast agent. The results of experiments performed with i-P(CLcoOPD) demonstrate the feasibility to quantify in-situ polyester degradation in vitro and in vivo using rats. We also demonstrate that X-ray imaging could be used to identify and quantify physical defects, such as cracks, in polymeric implants using rabbit animal models. This approach enables non-invasive monitoring of polyester materials and is expected to become an important technology for improving the imaging of polymers at clinically relevant depths.

The one-, two-, and three-parameter logistic (1PL, 2PL, and 3PL) models are nested, and as such can be compared using likelihood ratio (LR) tests. The null hypothesis in the LR test for selection among the 2PL and 3PL models sets the guessing parameters to their lower bound of 0. This violates one of the assumptions of the LR test and renders the usual chi(2) reference distribution inappropriate for the comparison. A review of the current literature revealed that this problem is not well understood in the educational measurement field. Ignoring this issue can lead to selection of an overly simplified model, with implications for the ability estimates. In this article, the use of the LR test for item response model selection is investigated, with the goal of providing practitioners with an appropriate method of selecting the most parsimonious model. The results of simulation studies indicate the nature of the problem, with inaccurate Type I error rates for cases where the inappropriate null distribution was used. An analysis of data from a statewide mathematics test showed differences pertinent to subsequent analyses.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0146-6216	1552-3497		WOS:000355619200001

A long-debated aspect of assessment use, consequential validity, plays an important role in public interpretation of assessment use whether for individual students or for state policy. The purpose of this survey study was to explore stakeholders' perceptions of the variety of tests used in classrooms and schools, especially how testing is used to improve teaching and learning. Results indicated that the majority of stakeholders do not value state assessments and do not see the assessments as useful in the teaching and learning process. However, a proportion of minority respondents were optimistic that state assessments have potential for school improvement.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0895-9048	1552-3896		WOS:000355689800001

In particular, the timing of entry decisions, drawing primarily on the first-mover advantage (FMA) perspective, has emerged as a prominent area of study. While previous research confirms that entry timing is critical, a large number of contingencies create conceptual and methodological complexities that undermine the formation of a rigorous theory of entry timing. In this article, we review and synthesize management and marketing research on entry timing published in top-tier outlets from 1989 through 2013the 25-year period that followed the publication of Lieberman and Montgomery's seminal article on FMA. Distilling key lessons from this literature, our review tries to establish a foundational understanding of the conditions, methods, implications, and strategies of entry timing so that research might be reinvigorated in this domain. Our article concludes by offering a conceptual model of entry based on the lessons gleaned from the articles that we reviewed.									1	0	0	0	1	2			0149-2063	1557-1211		WOS:000355379100005		
J	Gong, Liang; Jiang, Yueming; Chen, Feng								Molecular strategies for detection and quantification of mycotoxin-producing Fusarium species: a review								JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE				95	9			1767	1776		10.1002/jsfa.6935			JUL 2015	2015	Fusarium contamination is considered a major agricultural problem, which could not only significantly reduce yield and quality of agricultural products, but produce mycotoxins that are virulence factors responsible for many diseases of humans and farm animals. One strategy to identify toxigenic Fusarium species is the use of modern molecular methods, which include the analysis of DNA target regions for differentiation of the Fusarium species, particularly the mycotoxin-producing Fusarium species such as F. verticillioides and F. graminearum. Additionally, polymerase chain reaction assays are used to determine the genes involved in the biosynthesis of the toxins in order to facilitate a qualitative and quantitative detection of Fusarium-producing mycotoxins. Also, it is worth mentioning that some factors that modulate the biosynthesis of mycotoxins are not only determined by their biosynthetic gene clusters, but also by environmental conditions. Therefore, all of the aforementioned factors which may affect the molecular diagnosis of mycotoxins will be reviewed and discussed in this paper.

This study was aimed at investigating THM hydrolysis pertaining to the storage of hot boiled water in enclosed containers. The water pH value was in the range of 6.1-8.2 and the water temperature was varied from 65 to 95 degrees C. The effects of halide ions, natural organic matter, and drinking water matrix were investigated. Results showed that the hydrolysis rates declined in the order following CHBrCl2>CHBr2Cl>CHBr3>CHCl3. THM hydrolysis was primarily through the alkaline pathway, except for CHCl3 in water at relatively low pH value. The activation energies for the alkaline hydrolysis of CHCl3, CHBrCl2, CHBr2Cl and CHBr3 were 109, 113, 115 and 116 kJ/mol, respectively. No hydrolysis intermediates could accumulate in the water. The natural organic matter, and probably other constituents, in drinking water could substantially decrease THM hydrolysis rates by more than 50%. When a drinking water was at 90 degrees C or above, the first order rate constants for THM hydrolysis were in the magnitude of 10(-2)-10(-1) 1/h. When the boiled real tap water was stored in an enclosed container, THMs continued increasing during the first few hours and then kept decreasing later on due to the competition between hydrolysis and further formation. The removal of THMs, especially brominated THMs, by hydrolysis would greatly reduce one's exposure to disinfection by-products by consuming the boiled water stored in enclosed containers.

Beliefs and Attributions toward Computing Technology: The Moderating Role of Social Cues in Interfaces								JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND END USER COMPUTING				27	3			27	54		10.4018/joeuc.2015070102			JUL-SEP 2015	2015	This study critiques and extends the work of Johnson, Marakas and Palmer (2006), who investigated the relations between social cues in an interface, user personality, user beliefs about the social role and capabilities of computers, and the attributions of responsibility users made for their interactions and outcomes with a computer. In this study, rather than examining the simple, direct effects investigated previously, we examine the moderating role of social cues in the interface. In addition, building upon recent findings from psychology, the authors assess personality traits individually, rather than aggregating them. To evaluate the theorized relations, 152 individuals participated in a controlled laboratory experiment, where social cues in two computer interfaces were manipulated. Results indicate that social cues moderate the relations between personality, beliefs about the social role of computing, and the attributions made. In addition, the results suggest that disaggregating personality traits is theoretically and practically richer than aggregating them.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1546-2234	1546-5012		WOS:000353300300002

From this result and a numerical experiment, we show the importance of discrete mass conservation in long-time simulations of the NSE. That is, we show that using elements that strongly enforce mass conservation can provide significantly more accurate solutions over long times, compared to those that enforce it weakly.

Here we developed a simple methodology for direct self-assembly of metals (pure or alloy) and nanoparticles into hierarchical metallic nanocomposites core/metal shell nanostructures in immiscible molten salt, driven by the minimization of interfacial energy of the system. The core metals and nanoparticles firstly assemble into metal-nanoparticle nanocomposite microspheres. The formed nanocomposite microspheres could be utilized as new building blocks for a subsequent self-assembly procedure to be coated form a metal shell. This work provide a novel and simple method to fabricate hierarchical nanocomposites core/metal shell nanostructures for numerous applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000348489200129	26373164

Despite well-established efforts on the fabrication of IR fibers in past decades, a number of remarkable breakthroughs have recently rejuvenated the field-just as related areas in IR optical technology are reaching maturation. In this review, we describe both the history and recent developments in the design and fabrication of IR fibers, including IR glass and single-crystal fibers, multimaterial fibers, and fibers that exploit the transparency window of traditional crystalline semiconductors. This interdisciplinary review will be of interest to researchers in optics and photonics, materials science, and electrical engineering.

Linear and nonlinear characterization of the resonator properties have shown it to exhibit advantageous properties associated with both materials, with the low loss cladding supporting high quality (Q) factor whispering gallery modes which can be tuned through the nonlinear response of the crystalline core. By exploiting the large wavelength shift associated with the Kerr nonlinearity, we have demonstrated all-optical modulation of a weak probe on the timescale of the femtosecond pump pulse. This novel geometry offers a route to ultra-low loss, high-Q silica-based resonators with enhanced functionality.

Their effective thermal conductivity depends on both the thermal conductivity of graphene and the conductance of the thermal transport across graphene-matrix interfaces. Here, we report on molecular dynamics simulations of the thermal transport across the interfaces between defected graphene and soft materials in two different modes: in the "across" mode, heat enters graphene from one side of its basal plane and leaves through the other side; in the "non-across" mode, heat enters or leaves graphene simultaneously from both sides of its basal plane. We show that as the density of vacancy defects in graphene increases from 0% to 8%, the conductance of the interfacial thermal transport in the "across" mode increases from 160.4 +/- 16 to 207.8 +/- 11 MW/m(2) K, while that in the "non-across" mode increases from 7.2 +/- 0.1 to 17.8 +/- 0.6 MW/m(2) K. The molecular mechanisms for these variations of thermal conductance are clarified using the phonon density of states and structural characteristics of defected graphene. On the basis of these results and effective medium theory, we show that it is possible to enhance the effective thermal conductivity of thermal nanocomposites by tuning the density of vacancy defects in graphene despite the fact that graphene's thermal conductivity always decreases as vacancy defects are introduced.

Molecular analyses on host-seeking black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) reveal a diverse assemblage of Leucocytozoon (Apicomplexa: Haemospororida) parasites in an alpine ecosystem								PARASITES & VECTORS				8						343	10.1186/s13071-015-0952-9			JUN 25 2015	2015	Background: Molecular studies have suggested that the true diversity of Leucocytozoon (Apicomplexa: Haemospororida) species well exceeds the approximately 35 currently described taxa. Further, the degree of host-specificity may vary substantially among lineages. Parasite distribution can be influenced by the ability of the parasite to infect a host, vector preferences for certain avian hosts, or other factors such as microhabitat requirements that increase the probability that vertebrate hosts and vectors are in frequent contact with each other. Whereas most studies of haemosporidians have focused on passerine hosts, sampling vectors in the same habitats may allow the detection of other lineages affecting other hosts.Methods: We sampled abundant, ornithophilic black flies (Simuliidae) across a variety of sites and habitats in the Colorado Rocky Mountains throughout the summer of 2007. Black flies were screened with PCR using Leucocytozoon-specific primers that amplify a portion of the cytochrome b gene, and the sequences were compared to the haplotypes in the MalAvi database. Infections of Leucocytozoon from birds sampled in the same area were also included.Results: We recovered 33 unique haplotypes from the black flies in this study area, which represented a large phylogenetic diversity of Leucocytozoon parasites. However, there were no clear patterns of avian host species or geography for the distribution of Leucocytozoon haplotypes in the phylogeny.Conclusions: Sampling host-seeking vectors is a useful way to obtain a wide variety of avian haemosporidian haplotypes from a given area and may prove useful for understanding the global patterns of host, parasite, and vector associations of these ubiquitous and diverse parasites.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1756-3305			WOS:000357003900001	26108211	
J	Adler, Peter H.; Crosskey, Roger W.								Cytotaxonomy of the Simuliidae (Diptera): a systematic and bibliographic conspectus								ZOOTAXA				3975	1			1	139					JUN 25 2015	2015	An annotated compilation of all chromosomal works (cytoconspectus) on the Simuliidae is presented, covering 577 species including 541 formally named species-24.8% of the world's extant nominal species-and 36 formally unnamed species. The first published record of polytene chromosomes in a simuliid appeared in 1919, followed by an imposing body of chromosomal research, most notably since 1956. The bibliography assembled here includes 653 works containing novel chromosomal information on the Simuliidae. Cytotaxonomy of the Simuliidae began in 1951 in the Canadian laboratory of Klaus Rothfels and subsequently expanded worldwide. Although chromosomal study has been uneven across species, it has provided a rich database of the genetics of natural populations and much of the foundation for the modern taxonomy and systematics of the family. After peaking in the late 1980s, cytotaxonomic productivity became more sporadic as the molecular movement gained popularity, despite the potential that an integrated chromosomal and molecular approach holds.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1175-5326	1175-5334		WOS:000356826800001	26249931

Previously, we induced reproductive buds using a hormone solution in juvenile Metasequoia trees as young as 5-to-7 years old. In the current study, hormone-treated shoots found in female and male buds were used to identify candidate genes involved in reproductive bud transition in Metasequoia. Samples from hormone-treated cone reproductive shoots and naturally occurring non-cone setting shoots were analyzed using 24 digital gene expression (DGE) tag profiles using Illumina, generating a total of 69,520 putative transcripts. Next, 32 differentially and specifically expressed transcripts were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, including the upregulation of MADS-box transcription factors involved in male bud transition and flowering time control proteins involved in female bud transition. These differentially expressed transcripts were associated with 243 KEGG pathways. Among the significantly changed pathways, sugar pathways were mediated by hormone signals during the vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and sucrose and starch metabolism pathways. Key enzymes were identified in these pathways, including alcohol dehydrogenase (NAD) and glutathione dehydrogenase for the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, and glucanphosphorylase for sucrose and starch metabolism pathways. Our results increase our understanding of the reproductive bud transition in gymnosperms. In addition, these studies on hormone-mediated sugar pathways increase our understanding of the relationship between sugar and hormone signaling during female and male bud initiation in Metasequoia.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1664-462X			WOS:000358416100001	26157452	
J	Dimitrova, Elena S.; Yordanov, Oleg I.; Matache, Mihaela T.								Difference equation for tracking perturbations in systems of Boolean nested canalyzing functions								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				91	6					062812	10.1103/PhysRevE.91.062812			JUN 23 2015	2015	This paper studies the spread of perturbations through networks composed of Boolean functions with special canalyzing properties. Canalyzing functions have the property that at least for one value of one of the inputs the output is fixed, irrespective of the values of the other inputs. In this paper the focus is on partially nested canalyzing functions, in which multiple, but not all inputs have this property in a cascading fashion. They naturally describe many relationships in real networks. For example, in a gene regulatory network, the statement "if gene A is expressed, then gene B is not expressed regardless of the states of other genes" implies that A is canalyzing. On the other hand, the additional statement "if gene A is not expressed, and gene C is expressed, then gene B is automatically expressed; otherwise gene B's state is determined by some other type of rule" implies that gene B is expressed by a partially nested canalyzing function with more than two variables, but with two canalyzing variables. In this paper a difference equation model of the probability that a network node's value is affected by an initial perturbation over time is developed, analyzed, and validated numerically. It is shown that the effect of a perturbation decreases towards zero over time if the Boolean functions are canalyzing in sufficiently many variables. The maximum dynamical impact of a perturbation is shown to be comparable to the average impact for a wide range of values of the average sensitivity of the network. Percolation limits are also explored; these are parameter values which generate a transition of the expected perturbation effect to zero as other parameters are varied, so that the initial perturbation does not scale up with the parameters once the percolation limits are reached.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1539-3755	1550-2376		WOS:000356660800002	26172759

Therefore, detecting such a signature would be strong evidence for dark matter annihilation or decay. We search for spectral lines in the Fermi Large Area Telescope observations of the Milky Way halo in the energy range 200 MeV-500 GeV using analysis methods from our most recent line searches. The main improvements relative to previous works are our use of 5.8 years of data reprocessed with the Pass 8 event-level analysis and the additional data resulting from the modified observing strategy designed to increase exposure of the Galactic center region. We search in five sky regions selected to optimize sensitivity to different theoretically motivated dark matter scenarios and find no significant detections. In addition to presenting the results from our search for lines, we also investigate the previously reported tentative detection of a line at 133 GeV using the new Pass 8 data.									56	0	0	0	0	56			2470-0010	2470-0029		WOS:000356583600002

Molecular-Level Details about Liquid H2O Interactions with CO and Sugar Alcohol Adsorbates on Pt(111) Calculated Using Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				119	24			13642	13651		10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b02333			JUN 18 2015	2015	Catalytic fuel production and energy generation from biomass-derived compounds generally involve the aqueous phase, and water molecules at the catalyst interface have energetic and entropic consequences on the reaction free energies. These effects are difficult to elucidate, hindering rational catalyst design for these processes and inhibiting their widespread adoption, In this work, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to garner molecular-level insights into H2O-adsorbate interactions. We obtain ensembles of liquid configurations with classical MD and compute the electronic energies of these systems with DFT. We examine CO, CH2OH, and C(3)H(7)O3 intermediates, which are critical in biomass reforming and direct methanol electrooxidation, on the Pt(111) surface under various explicit and explicit/implicit water configurations. We find that liquid H2O molecules arrange around surface intermediates in ways that favor hydrogen bonding, with larger and more hydrophilic intermediates forming significantly more hydrogen bonds With H2O. For example, CO hydrogen-bonds with 1.5 +/- 0.4 nearest neighbor H2O molecules and exhibits an interaction energy With these H2O molecules near 0 (-0.01 +/- 0.09 eV), while CH2OH forms 2.2 +/- 0.6 hydrogen bonds and exhibits an interaction energy of -0.43 +/- 0.07 eV. C(3)H(7)O3 farms 6.7 +/- 0.9 hydrogen bonds and exhibits an interaction energy of -1.18 +/- 0.21 eV. The combined MD/DFT method identifies the number of liquid H2O molecules that are strongly bound to surface adsorbates, and we find that these H2O molecules influence the energies and entropies of the aqueous systems. This information will be useful in future calculations aimed at interrogating the surface thermodynamics and kinetics of reactions involving these adsorbates.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447			WOS:000356754900031		
J	Khoshnevisan, Sara; Juang, Hsein; Zhou, Yan-Guo; Gong, Wenping								Probabilistic assessment of liquefaction-induced lateral spreads using CPT - Focusing on the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence								ENGINEERING GEOLOGY				192				113	128		10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.04.001			JUN 18 2015	2015	Strong earthquake events often result in liquefaction-induced ground movements such as settlements and lateral spreads that are a major cause of damage to buildings, bridges, and lifelines. This paper focuses on the subject of liquefaction-induced lateral spreads. Case histories with detailed cone penetration test (CPT) data are derived from the 2010-2011 Canterbury, New Zealand earthquake sequence and used to examine an existing empirical model for liquefaction-induced lateral spreads. The results confirmed the existence of a substantial discrepancy between the predicted and observed lateral spreads, indicating a need for improved models that consider uncertainties in the input parameters. Using a maximum likelihood analysis of the derived case histories, a new empirical probabilistic Model was developed for the estimation of lateral spreads in the Christchurch, New Zealand area. Emphasis is placed on assessing the probability of exceedance of limiting displacements for design against the threat of lateral spreads. The new CPT-based probabilistic model with detailed formulations is presented along with an illustrative example. The limitations of the model are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

IRSE is a highly sensitive nondestructive technique that allows protein adsorption on polymer brushes to be investigated in an aqueous environment as external stimuli, such as temperature and pH, are varied. These changes are relevant to conditions for regulation of protein adsorption and desorption for biotechnology, biocatalysis, and bioanalytical applications. Here brushes are used as model surfaces for controlling protein adsorption of human serum albumin and human fibrinogen. The important finding of this work is that IRSE in the in situ experiments in protein solutions can distinguish between contributions of polymer brushes and proteins. The vibrational bands of the polymers provide insights into the hydration state of the brushes, whereas the protein-specific amide bands are related to changes of the protein secondary structure.									7	0	0	2	0	7			1944-8244			WOS:000356753500017	25668395

The complexes feature the ligands L1 and L2 [L1 = (N,N-bis(pyridine-2-yl)benzylidene)-2,2'-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine; L2 = (N,N-bis(pyridine-2-yl)benzylidene)butane-1,4-diamine], and are either dinuclear, namely complex [Hg(L1)(mu-Cl)HgCl3] (1), mononuclear, namely [Hg(L1)Br-2] (2), [Hg(L1)I-2] (3), [Hg(L1)(SCN)(2)] (4), polynuclear polymeric, namely [Hg-8(mu-L2)(2)(mu-Cl)(6)(mu(3)-Cl)(4)Cl-4](n) (5), [Hg-2(L2)Br-4](n) (6) or molecular dimeric, namely [Hg-2(L2)I-4] (7). The syntheses of these complexes were achieved using mild solvothermal conditions, in a locally-developed apparatus. The microanalyses and spectroscopic results corroborate the structural data from single crystal X-ray diffraction; the latter proved the versatility of Hg(II) coordination chemistry, since simple variation of the Schiff base chelate or the halide/pseudohalide counterion resulted in distinctively different complexes. In the dinuclear compound 1, the asymmetric unit contains two different mercury(II) centers with tetrahedral and square pyramidal geometries, whereas in 2-4 the metal ion adopts a distorted octahedral geometry. The coordination polymers 5 and 6 have 3D and 1D structures, respectively, in which each mercury(II) center is five-coordinate with a square pyramidal geometry, whereas both Hg(II) centers in 7 are tetrahedral.

J	Lu, Xinyu; Xuan, Xiangchun				Xuan, Xiangchun/B-9174-2009; Lu, Xinyu/R-8879-2016				Continuous Microfluidic Particle Separation via Elasto-Inertial Pinched Flow Fractionation								ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				87	12			6389	6396		10.1021/acs.analchem.5b01432			JUN 16 2015	2015	Many of the fluids encountered in chemical and biomedical, applications exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. However, the majority of current particle separation methods have been demonstrated in Newtonian fluids only. This work presents an experimental study of continuous particle separation in viscoelastic solutions via a combined action of elastic and inertial lift forces, which we term elasto-inertial pinched flow fractionation (eiPFF). The parametric effects on eiPFF are systematically investigated in terms of dimensionless numbers. It is found that eiPFF offers much higher particle throughput and separation resolution than the traditional steric effects-based PFF. Moreover, eiPFF works most efficiently when the Reynolds number, Re, is of order 1 and hence fills perfectly into the gap of our recently proposed inertiaenhanced PFF (iPFF) technique (Anal. Chem. 2015, 87, 4560-4565) that favors Re of the order 10 or more. However, the particle separation via eiPFF does not increase monotonically with the elasticity number at higher polymer concentrations and is strongly affected by the aspect ratio of channel width to height, both of which have not been previously reported. More surprisingly, the elasto-inertial deflection of small particles can be even greater than that of large particles in a high-aspect-ratio channel for Re less than 1.									18	1	0	8	0	18			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000356755100072	26005774

Using a pantropical tree inventory database from closed canopy forests, consisting of 657,630 trees belonging to 11,371 species, we use a fitted value of Fisher's alpha and an approximate pantropical stem total to estimate the minimum number of tropical forest tree species to fall between similar to 40,000 and similar to 53,000, i.e., at the high end of previous estimates. Contrary to common assumption, the Indo-Pacific region was found to be as species-rich as the Neotropics, with both regions having a minimum of similar to 19,000-25,000 tree species. Continental Africa is relatively depauperate with a minimum of similar to 4,500-6,000 tree species. Very few species are shared among the African, American, and the Indo-Pacific regions. We provide a methodological framework for estimating species richness in trees that may help refine species richness estimates of tree-dependent taxa.									26	1	0	25	0	26			0027-8424			WOS:000356251800047	26034279

The approach is implemented in an open-source software program that is described and evaluated here. The program allows a data custodian to select a level of de-identification based on the K-anonymity statistic. The program converts a file of true farm locations and attributes into a file appropriate for use in disease spread modeling with the locations randomly modified to prevent re-identification based on location. Important epidemiological relationships such as clustering are preserved to as much as possible to allow modeling similar to those using true identifiable data. The software implementation was verified by visual inspection and basic descriptive spatial analysis of the output. Performance is sufficient to allow de-identification of even large data sets on desktop computers available to any data custodian. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The PIT metamaterial exhibits a sharp-induced transparency peak resulting from the destructive interference between the direct-excited plasmon resonance in the graphene patch acting as the bright mode and the coupling-excited inductive-capacitive resonance in the SRR pair acting as the dark mode. Tuning the Fermi energy in graphene results in the modulation of the PIT window, allowing for the active control of the group index. These results may lead to promising applications in tunable terahertz devices, slow light, and sensing technology.									5	1	0	0	0	6			1041-1135	1941-0174		WOS:000355758500012

The main purpose is the development of a robust and efficient numerical scheme. To enforce crack irreversibility as a constraint, we use a primal-dual active set strategy, which can be identified as a semi-smooth Newton method. The active set iteration is merged with the Newton iteration for solving the fully-coupled nonlinear partial differential equation discretized using finite elements, resulting in a single, rapidly converging nonlinear scheme. It is well known that phase-field models require fine meshes to accurately capture the propagation dynamics of the crack. Because traditional estimators based on adaptive mesh refinement schemes are not appropriate, we develop a predictor-corrector scheme for local mesh adaptivity to reduce the computational cost. This method is both robust and efficient and allows us to treat temporal and spatial refinements and to study the influence of model regularization parameters. Finally, our proposed approach is substantiated with different numerical tests for crack propagation in elastic media and pressurized fracture propagation in homogeneous and heterogeneous media.

Journal of diabetes science and technology				9	6			1275	81		10.1177/1932296815589755			2015 Jun 12	2015	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes is increasing in low-resource settings; however, accessing glucose monitoring is extremely difficult and expensive in these regions. Work is being done to address the multitude of issues surrounding diabetes care in low-resource settings, but an affordable glucose monitoring solution has yet to be presented. An inkjet-printed test strip solution is being proposed as a solution to this problem.METHODS: The use of a standard inkjet printer is being proposed as a manufacturing method for low-cost glucose monitoring test strips. The printer cartridges are filled with enzyme and dye solutions that are printed onto filter paper. The result is a colorimetric strip that turns a blue/green color in the presence of blood glucose.RESULTS: Using a light-based spectroscopic reading, the strips show a linear color change with an R(2) = .99 using glucose standards and an R(2) = .93 with bovine blood. Initial testing with bovine blood indicates that the strip accuracy is comparable to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 15197 for glucose testing in the 0-350 mg/dL range. However, further testing with human blood will be required to confirm this. A visible color gradient was observed with both the glucose standard and bovine blood experiment, which could be used as a visual indicator in cases where an electronic glucose meter was unavailable.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that an inkjet-printed filter paper test strip is a feasible method for monitoring blood glucose levels. The use of inkjet printers would allow for local manufacturing to increase supply in remote regions. This system has the potential to address the dire need for glucose monitoring in low-resource settings.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1932-2968		MEDLINE:26071426	26071426

Additionally, we have expanded the substrate scope of the reaction with the aim of evaluating the functional group tolerance of the transformation. Further, we present preliminary data of a related halogenation of beta-diketones with our optimal conditions. Finally, we probed the role of urea in the transformation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, this phenomenology is found to depend on the relative tilt of magnetic field and on the SOC type: (a) when only Rashba SOC exists and the magnetic field is tilted in the direction of the superlattice (b) Dresselhaus SOC exists and the magnetic field is tilted in the direction perpendicular to the superlattice. Consequently, measurable properties of the modulated system become anisotropic in a tilted magnetic field when the field is conically rotated around the z axis, at a fixed polar angle, as we demonstrate by calculating the resistivity and the magnetization.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000355253600005	25984760

We examine mullite microfibers formed by electrospinning of sol-gel precursors. The formed fibers have diameters smaller than 10 mu m. A magnetic drop was placed on the free end of a dangling fiber, and the fiber was flexed by applying a non-uniform magnetic field. By applying different magnetic fields, we generated a series of different fiber profiles and filmed the process of fiber bending. Mullite microfibers were found to follow the Bernoulli-Euler predictions, and the shear deformations in the material were insignificant. This was confirmed by employing the Euler elastica model to describe the fiber profiles.

A large softening in C-44 over a wide temperature range is observed for Ba2FeReO6 below its Curie temperature (T-C approximate to 311 K), which is indicative of a structural distortion. This softening is partially suppressed upon application of a low magnetic field. For Ca2FeReO6, both the longitudinal and shear moduli show a softening starting at T approximate to 160 K. In addition, magnetoelastic coupling constants have been estimated from elastic constants and magnetostriction data, which provide direct evidence of pronounced coupling between magnetism and the lattice degrees of freedom present in both compounds.

J	Liu, Wei								Dispersive multidomain pseudospectral time-domain method for full-wave analysis of radio-frequency invisible cloaks								IET MICROWAVES ANTENNAS & PROPAGATION				9	8			762	768		10.1049/iet-map.2014.0690			JUN 5 2015	2015	To implement full-wave simulation of electromagnetic wave impinging invisible cloaks, an efficient multidomain pseudospectral time-domain algorithm is developed in this study. The proposed method solves the same forms of Maxwell's equations in both the regular and cloaking areas, and then applies different methods to update the electric and magnetic field components, respectively. The new method requires less grid points per wavelength, meanwhile, the multidomain strategy relieves the complicated treatment of electric and magnetic field components based on Yee grids within finite-difference time-domain methods, and shows advantage of dealing with internal inhomogeneities within the cloaking materials. The results validated feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method in left-hand materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-8725	1751-8733		WOS:000355255800008

Journal of applied polymer science				132	21			1	7					2015-Jun-5	2015	This work details the design and testing of affinity membrane adsorbers for lectin purifications that incorporate glucose-containing glycopolymers. It is the selective interaction between the sugar residues of the glycopolymer and the complementary carbohydrate-binding domain of the lectin that provides the basis for the isolation and purification of lectins from complex biological media. The design approach used in these studies was to graft glycopolymer 'tentacles' from macroporous regenerated cellulose membranes by atom transfer radical polymerization. As shown in earlier studies, this design approach can be used to prepare high-productivity membrane adsorbers. The model lectin, concanavalin A (conA), was used to evaluate membrane performance in bind-and-elute purification, using a low molecular weight sugar for elution. The membrane capacity for binding conA was measured at equilibrium and under dynamic conditions using flow rates of 0.1 and 1.0 mL/min. The first Damkohler number was estimated to relate the adsorption rate to the convective mass transport rate through the membrane bed. It was used to assess whether adsorption kinetics or mass transport contributed the primary limitation to conA binding. Analyses indicate that this system is not limited by the accessibility of the binding sites, but by the inherent rate of adsorption of conA onto the glycopolymer.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8995			MEDLINE:25866416	25866416

The smart surface network: A bus-based approach to dense sensing								COMPUTER NETWORKS				83				167	183		10.1016/j.comnet.2015.03.009			JUN 4 2015	2015	We present the Smart Surface Network (SSN), a hardware and software platform designed for dense sensing. Sensor nodes connected to the SSN communicate using a serial bus integrated within a mountable physical surface. The hardware architecture and bus access and communication mechanisms are implemented in a self-stabilizing manner, providing robust handling of unannounced arrivals and departures of network devices. An associated API supports a peer-to-peer communication paradigm, providing access to the physical, data link, and application layers of the bus. In this paper, we describe the SSN hardware architecture and present the bus access and peer discovery algorithms. We also discuss the design of the API and describe experimental results characterizing the fairness of the bus algorithm, the efficiency of the peer discovery algorithm, and the performance of the SSN system under varying load conditions.

H.; Richardson, Kathleen A.; Luzinov, Igor; Agarwal, Anu				Richardson, Kathleen/A-6012-2011				Label-Free Water Sensors Using Hybrid Polymer-Dielectric Mid-Infrared Optical Waveguides								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				7	21			11189	11194		10.1021/acsami.5b01013			JUN 3 2015	2015	A chip-scale mid-IR water sensor was developed using silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides coated with poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA). The label-free detection was conducted at lambda = 2.6-2.7 mu m because this spectral region overlaps with the characteristic O-H stretch absorption while being transparent to PGMA and SiN. Through the design of a hybrid waveguide structure, we were able to tailor the mid-IR evanescent wave into the PGMA layer and the surrounding water and, consequently, to enhance the light-analyte interaction. A 7.6 times enhancement of sensitivity is experimentally demonstrated and explained by material integration engineering as well as waveguide mode analysis. Our sensor platform made by polymer-dielectric hybrids can be applied to other regions of the mid-IR spectrum to probe other analytes and can ultimately achieve a multispectral sensor on-a-chip.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244			WOS:000355891700018	25924561

Corn mash (200 g) was prepared from POET ground corn and POET corn slurry and was ozonated in 250 mL polypropylene bottles. Lactic and acetic acid levels were monitored daily during the fermentation of ozonated, aerated, and nontreated corn mash samples to evaluate bacterial activity. Glycerol and ethanol contents of fermentation samples were checked daily to assess yeast activity. No yeast supplementation, no addition of other antimicrobial agents (such as antibiotics), and spiking with a common lactic acid bacterium found in corn ethanol plants, Lactobacillus plantarum, amplified the treatment effects. The laboratory-scale ozone dosages ranged from 26-188 mg/L, with very low estimated costs of $0.0008-0.006/gal ($0.21-1.6/m(3)) of ethanol. Ozonation was found to decrease the initial pH of ground corn mash samples, which could reduce the sulfuric acid required to adjust the pH prior to ethanol fermentation. Lactic and acetic acid levels tended to be lower for samples subjected to increasing ozone dosages, indicating less bacterial activity. The lower ozone dosages in the range applied achieved higher ethanol yields. Preliminary experiments on ozonating POET corn slurry at low ozone dosages were not as effective as using POET ground corn, possibly because corn slurry samples contained recycled antimicrobials from the backset. The data suggest additional dissolved and suspended organic materials from the backset consumed the ozone or shielded the bacteria.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000355890900019	25966035	
J	Rottinghaus, Brandon; Warber, Adam L.								Unilateral Orders as Constituency Outreach: Executive Orders, Proclamations, and the Public Presidency								PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY				45	2			289	309		10.1111/psq.12188			JUN 2015	2015	Scholarship on the unilateral presidency has focused on presidential policy making with the stroke of a pen. However, such studies overlook the influence that the public presidency can have on shaping the president's unilateral strategies. Our research question seeks to link these two elements by exploring the following question: under what conditions do presidents issue executive orders and proclamations as part of their public presidency? Using new data charting the use of these directives to target populations in society, we analyze the role of the political environment on engendering both more constituency-based executive orders and proclamations. The results suggest presidents issue more constituency-based proclamations, but not executive orders, when Congress and the executive branch are more likely to disagree on policy or when Congress is institutionally stronger compared to the president. Presidents are less likely to issue these orders during election years (for proclamations), in changing popularity, or when their party has returned to office. The implications suggest the importance of broadening the study of unilateral orders to link the public and administrative presidencies.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0360-4918	1741-5705		WOS:000371117200004

To better understand how Coyote food habits in the Southeast may differ on an extremely small spatial scale, we collected a total of 305 Coyote scats from 2009 to 2011 on 2 islands separated by a 1.4-2.5-km-wide expanse of low saltwater-marsh on the coast of Georgetown, SC. We identified diagnostic remains of prey items to the lowest possible taxonomic level. A multi-response permutation procedure revealed differences in Coyote diet composition between islands (A = 0.0090, P < 0.0001). Subsequent indicator-species analysis revealed a total of 4 food items that served to differentiate diet between islands: birds, Sus scrofa (Wild Hog), Ilex sp. (holly) fruit, and lagomorphs. Our results demonstrate that Coyote food habits and their potential ecosystem effects may vary widely on a very local scale. This finding may be of particular concern to biologists attempting to utilize published diet studies to inform Coyote management strategies. Our study also documented some of the highest levels of bird consumption by Coyotes published to date; we detected bird remains found in 42.45-59.80% of scats.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1528-7092	1938-5412		WOS:000371105000007

How Are Perceived Stigma, Self-Stigma, and Self-Reliance Related to Treatment-Seeking? A Three-Path Model								PSYCHIATRIC REHABILITATION JOURNAL				38	2	SI		109	116		10.1037/prj0000138			JUN 2015	2015	Objective: Many college students may experience mental health problems but do not seek treatment from mental health professionals. The present study examined how perceived stigma and self-stigma toward seeking mental health treatment, as well as perceptions of self-reliance for coping with mental health problems, relate to college student treatment-seeking. Method: In total, 246 students completed a self-report survey that included measures of perceived stigma and self-stigma for treatment-seeking, self-reliance for addressing mental health concerns, self-reported mental health problems, symptoms of depression and alcohol-related problems, attitudes toward treatment-seeking, and treatment-seeking behavior. Results: Regression analyses revealed that higher perceived stigma, self-stigma, and self-reliance were all related to a more negative attitude toward treatment-seeking. In a 3-path mediation model, bootstrapping results indicated an indirect effect where perceived stigma was related to attitude toward treatment-seeking and treatment-seeking behaviors through self-stigma and self-reliance. Specifically, higher perceived stigma was related to higher self-stigma, higher self-stigma was related to higher self-reliance, and higher self-reliance was associated with a more negative attitude toward treatment seeking in the overall sample, and a decreased probability of having sought treatment among those who screened positive for a mental health problem. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Perceived stigma may influence whether or not college students seek treatment for mental health problems by potentially increasing stigmatizing attitudes toward themselves and increasing preferences for handling problems on their own. Researchers and practitioners are recommended to seek a better understanding of the complex treatment bathers to reduce stigma and facilitate treatment-seeking.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1095-158X	1559-3126		WOS:000370392900003	25844914

The Role of Different Stigma Perceptions in Treatment Seeking and Dropout Among Active Duty Military Personnel								PSYCHIATRIC REHABILITATION JOURNAL				38	2	SI		142	149		10.1037/prj0000120			JUN 2015	2015	Objective: Many military personnel with mental health problems do not seek treatment from mental health professionals, and if they do seek treatment, they drop out of treatment before receiving the recommended number of sessions. The present study examined the role of 4 different stigma perceptions on these outcomes: perceived stigma to career, perceived stigma of differential treatment, self-stigma from seeking treatment, and stigmatizing perceptions of soldiers who seek treatment. Method: One thousand three hundred twenty-four active duty soldiers completed a self-report survey assessment that included measures of the 4 different stigma perceptions, indices of mental health symptoms, receipt of mental health treatment, and whether they had dropped out of treatment before it was completed. Results: Participants screening positive for a mental health problem reported higher scores on all 4 stigma perceptions. All 4 stigma perceptions were each associated with a reduced likelihood of treatment seeking when considered individually, but only stigmatizing beliefs about those who seek treatment were uniquely associated with treatment seeking. Perceived stigma for one's career and differential treatment from others, along with self-stigma from treatment seeking, were associated with an increased probability of dropping out of mental health treatment. Self-stigma from treatment seeking was the only unique predictor of dropout. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Different stigma perceptions were associated with treatment seeking and dropout. Further longitudinal research is needed to examine how stigma perceptions influence these important outcomes. Practitioners need to be aware of how different stigma perceptions can influence treatment seeking and potentially target stigma perceptions during treatment to prevent dropout.									8	0	0	2	0	8			1095-158X	1559-3126		WOS:000370392900008	25799296

Visualizing Time-Specific Hurricane Predictions, with Uncertainty, from Storm Path Ensembles								COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM				34	3			371	380		10.1111/cgf.12649			JUN 2015	2015	The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) issues advisories every six hours during the life of a hurricane. These advisories describe the current state of the storm, and its predicted path, size, and wind speed over the next five days. However, from these data alone, the question What is the likelihood that the storm will hit Houston with hurricane strength winds between 12:00 and 14:00 on Saturday? cannot be directly answered. To address this issue, the NHC has recently begun making an ensemble of potential storm paths available as part of each storm advisory. Since each path is parameterized by time, predicted values such as wind speed associated with the path can be inferred for a specific time period by analyzing the statistics of the ensemble. This paper proposes an approach for generating smooth scalar fields from such a predicted storm path ensemble, allowing the user to examine the predicted state of the storm at any chosen time. As a demonstration task, we show how our approach can be used to support a visualization tool, allowing the user to display predicted storm position - including its uncertainty - at any time in the forecast. In our approach, we estimate the likelihood of hurricane risk for a fixed time at any geospatial location by interpolating simplicial depth values in the path ensemble. Adaptivelysized radial basis functions are used to carry out the interpolation. Finally, geometric fitting is used to produce a simple graphical visualization of this likelihood. We also employ a non-linear filter, in time, to assure frame-to-frame coherency in the visualization as the prediction time is advanced. We explain the underlying algorithm and definitions, and give a number of examples of how our algorithm performs for several different storm predictions, and for two different sources of predicted path ensembles.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0167-7055	1467-8659		WOS:000358328200040

However, large dimensions and limited working distances of objective lenses in traditional fluorescence microscopes have limited their imaging applications mostly to superficial tissues. To overcome these disadvantages, researchers have developed the graded-index (GRIN) probes with small diameters for imaging internal organs of small animals in a minimally invasive fashion. However, dynamic imaging based on GRIN lens has not been studied extensively. Here, this paper presented a fluorescence endoscopic imaging system based on GRIN lenses using one-photon and two-photon excitation. GRIN lenses with 1.15 mm diameter and 7.65 mm length were used in the system. The images were acquired by a compact laser scanning imaging system with a resonant galvo-mirror system to scan the laser beam and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to detect fluorescence signals. Experimental results showed that this system using two-photon excitation could implement dynamic fluorescence microendoscopic imaging and monitor the movement of blood flow beneath the skin in anesthetized mice while producing images with higher contrast and signal to noise ratio (SNR) than those using one photon excitation. It would be a useful tool for studying biological processes of small animals or plants in vivo.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2095-2759	2095-2767		WOS:000366808000008

To date, the independence of these axioms has not been a serious point of study. The aim of this paper is to provide the missing answers. The independent subsets of these five axioms are determined precisely and examples provided in each case on arbitrary median graphs. There are three cases that stand out. Here nontrivial examples and proofs are needed to give a full answer. Extensive use of the structure of median graphs is used throughout.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1793-8309	1793-8317		WOS:000365767400008

A split root system was used to investigate systemic autoregulation of nodulation (AON) in Medicago truncatula and the role of the AON genes RDN1 and SUNN in the regulatory circuit. Developing nodule primordia did not trigger AON in plants carrying mutations in RDN1 and SUNN genes, while wild type plants had fully induced AON within three days. However, despite lacking an early suppression response, AON mutants suppressed nodulation when roots were inoculated 10 days or more apart, correlated with the maturation of nitrogen fixing nodules. In addition to correlation between nitrogen fixation and suppression of nodulation, suppression by extreme nutrient stress was also observed in all genotypes and may be a component of the observed response due to the conditions of the assay. These results suggest there is more than one systemic regulatory circuit controlling nodulation in M. truncatula. While both signals are present in wild type plants, the second signal can only be observed in plants lacking the early repression (AON mutants). RDN1 and SUNN are not essential for response to the later signal.									6	0	0	6	0	6						BCI:BCI201600060446	27135324

Wildlife Biology in Practice				11	1			12	25					Jun 2015	2015	Stress hormone measures have proven useful for assessing effects of human disturbance on wildlife populations. However, most studies are of short duration or limited geographic scope (i.e., without spatial replication), leading to concerns about confounding effects of biotic conditions. Previous research correlated fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) of elk (Cervus elaphus) with human disturbance, but this factor also co-varied with seasonal climatic conditions, making it difficult to make broader inference regarding the role of human disturbance. In this study we attempted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of climatic conditions and human disturbance by comparing the year-round physiological stress response of elk to varying levels of human disturbance at three study sites in south-central Washington State. FGMs were consistently elevated throughout the year at the study site receiving the greatest amount of human disturbance. We observed support for a positive effect of precipitation and increasing temperature on FGMs at the low-disturbance site, but less support for importance of climatic variables in explaining FGMs at the high-disturbance sites - suggesting that climatic variables were likely of secondary importance compared to anthropogenic stressors in elk at those sites. Collectively, while we were unable to disentangle the effects of site-specific stressors, our findings suggest that in this environment, humans were a dominant stressor influencing FGM levels. Therefore, interpreting results of physiological studies requires that researchers account for a broad combination of biotic and abiotic stressors at a particular study location. We particularly encourage future investigators to account for the potential confounding effect of human disturbance that could override other stressors.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1646-2742			ZOOREC:ZOOR15112085069

J	Grover, Varun; Lyytinen, Kalle								NEW STATE OF PLAY IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH: THE PUSH TO THE EDGES								MIS QUARTERLY				39	2			271	U310					JUN 2015	2015	The dominant way of producing knowledge in information systems (IS) seeks to domesticate high-level reference theory in the form of mid-level abstractions involving generic and atheoretical information technology (IT) components. Enacting such epistemic scripts squeezes IS theory to the middle range, where abstract reference theory concepts are directly instantiated or slightly modified to the IS context, whereas IT remains exogenous to theory by being treated as an independent variable, mediator, or moderator. In this design, IT is often operationalized using proxies that detect the presence of IT or its variation in use or cost. Our analysis of 143 articles published in MIS Quarterly and Information Systems Research over the past 15 years demonstrates that over 70 percent of published theory conforms to this mode of producing IS knowledge. This state of play has resulted in two negative consequences: the field (1) agonizes over the dearth of original and bold theorizing over IT and (2) satisfices when integrating theory with empirics by creating incommensurate mid-range models that are difficult to consolidate. We propose that one way to overcome these challenges is to critically examine and debate the negative impacts of the field's dominant epistemic scripts and relax them by permitting IS scholarship that more fluidly accommodates alternative forms of knowledge production. This will push IS inquiry to the "edges" and emphasize, on the one hand, inductive, rich inquiries using innovative and extensive data sets and, on the other hand, novel, genuine, high-level theorizing around germane conceptual relationships between IT, information and its (semiotic) representations, and social behaviors. We offer several exemplars of such inquiries and their results. To promote this push, we invite alternative institutionalized forms of publishing and reviewing. We conclude by inviting individual scholars to be more open to practices that permit richer theorizing. These recommendations will broaden the field's knowledge ecology and permit the creation of good IS knowledge over just getting "hits." We surmise that, if such changes are carried out, the field can look confidently toward its future as one of the epicenters of organizational inquiry that deal with the central forces shaping human enterprise in the 21st century.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0276-7783			WOS:000361601700002

J	Hu, Meng-Jun; Grabke, Anja; Schnabel, Guido								Investigation of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Species Complex Causing Peach Anthracnose in South Carolina								PLANT DISEASE				99	6			797	805		10.1094/PDIS-10-14-1076-RE			JUN 2015	2015	Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. truncatum are causal agents of anthracnose disease of peach in South Carolina, but more recent investigations show that C. gloeosporioides is a species complex that has not yet been investigated among peach isolates. A total of 28 Colletotrichum spp. isolates associated with peach fruit anthracnose were collected in 2012 from Chesnee (10 isolates), McBee (10 isolates), Monetta (2 isolates), and Ridge Spring (6 isolates), South Carolina. Morphological characteristics indicated that all 28 isolates belonged to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Phylogenetic analysis of the combined calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and beta-tubulin (TUB2) gene sequences identified two species, C. siamense and C. fructicola. Cultural characteristics such as colony growth rate, shape and size of conidia, and appressoria from representative isolates of the two species largely matched previous descriptions for C. siamense and C. fructicola. Koch's postulates for C. siamense and C. fructicola were fulfilled, confirming pathogenicity of the two species on peach. A new, two-step multiplex PCR assay was developed to facilitate differentiation of the four known Colletotrichum spp. causing anthracnose of peach in South Carolina, including C. acutatum, C. truncatum, C. siamense, and C. fructicola. The first step distinguished C. acutatum from C. truncatum and the two members of the C. gloeosporioides species complex. The second assay distinguished C. siamense from C. fructicola isolates.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000360866000008		
J	Hu, Meng-Jun; Grabke, Anja; Dowling, Madeline E.; Holstein, Helen J.; Schnabel, Guido								Resistance in Colletotrichum siamense From Peach and Blueberry to Thiophanate-Methyl and Azoxystrobin								PLANT DISEASE				99	6			806	814		10.1094/PDIS-10-14-1077-RE			JUN 2015	2015	Anthracnose fruit rot was observed in some late-season peach cultivars in South Carolina in the 2012 and 2013 production seasons as well as increased anthracnose leaf spot of blueberry in a commercial operation of the same state in 2012. Single-spore isolates of Colletotrichum siamense were either sensitive or resistant to both thiophanate-methyl and azoxystrobin with the concentration of the fungicide at which fungal development is inhibited by 50% of >= 100 mu g/ml. Resistant isolates revealed the E198A mutation in beta-tubulin and the G143A mutation in cytochrome b. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the complete CYTB gene from genomic DNA of C. siamense isolates revealed an intronless genotype (CsI) and a genotype revealing two introns (CsII) at amino acid positions 131 and 164. Resistance to thiophanate-methyl or azoxystrobin was not found in isolates of C. fructicola collected from peach fruit. The CYTB gene of isolates of this species was of the CfII genotype or revealed a unique CfIIa genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of C. siamense isolates from different locations and different crops showed that the resistant isolates were genetically closer to each other than to sensitive isolates, suggesting that field resistance to thiophanate-methyl and azoxystrobin fungicides is derived from a common ancestor.									7	0	0	7	0	7			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000360866000009		
J	Keinath, Anthony P.								Baseline Sensitivity of Didymella bryoniae to Cyprodinil and Fludioxonil and Field Efficacy of these Fungicides Against Isolates Resistant to Pyraclostrobin and Boscalid								PLANT DISEASE				99	6			815	822		10.1094/PDIS-09-14-0993-RE			JUN 2015	2015	To prevent yield reductions from gummy stem blight, fungicides often must be applied to watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and muskmelon (Cucumis melo). Didymella bryoniae, the ascomycete fungus that causes gummy stem blight, is resistant to thiophanate-methyl, quinone-outside inhibitors (QoI), boscalid, and penthiopyrad. In place of these fungicides, premixtures of cyprodinil and fludioxonil (Switch 62.5WG) or cyprodinil and difenoconazole (Inspire Super 2.82SC) are used. The objectives of this study were to examine baseline isolates of D. bryoniae for sensitivity to cyprodinil and fludioxonil and to determine the efficacy of cyprodinil-fludioxonil and cyprodinil-difenoconazole against isolates resistant to QoI fungicides and boscalid. Colony diameters of 146 isolates of D. bryoniae collected in South Carolina and other U.S. states prior to 2008 were measured on glucose minimal medium amended with cyprodinil or fludioxonil. Mean effective concentration values that reduced relative colony diameter by 50% were 0.052 and 0.099 mg/liter cyprodinil and fludioxonil, respectively. In autumn 2008, 2009, and 2011, field-grown watermelon inoculated with isolates resistant to QoI fungicides and boscalid was treated with boscalid-pyraclostrobin alternated with chlorothalonil, cyprodinil-fludioxonil alternated with chlorothalonil, cyprodinil-difenodonazole alternated with chlorothalonil, tebuconazole alternated with chlorothalonil, chlorothalonil, or water. In 2008 and 2011, both cyprodinil treatments reduced disease severity compared with the water control treatment and chlorothalonil alone. In 2008 and 2009, cyprodinil-fludioxonil reduced severity compared with boscalid-pyraclostrobin and, in 2008, cyprodinil-difenoconazole and tebuconazole also did. Use of cyprodinil-fludioxonil should control gummy stem blight effectively and may delay development of resistance to cyprodinil and fludioxonil in D. bryoniae. However, because Botrytis cinerea became resistant to both cyprodinil and fludioxonil after multiple applications of cyprodinil-fludioxonil per season, prudent fungicide rotations should be followed when using cyprodinil-containing fungicides against D. bryoniae.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000360866000010

German astronomer Wilhelm Olbers pondered that question in the 1820s, and the riddle became known as Olbers's paradox. By then, astronomers and philosophers had wondered for centuries why the sky was dark and what the darkness implied about the nature of the universe. It turns out that these scholars were on to something truly profound.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0036-8733			WOS:000355049600030	26336684

Roost selection by Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) in a pristine habitat at three spatial scales								ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA				17	1			131	141		10.3161/15081109ACC2015.17.1.011			JUN 2015	2015	Although several studies have described roost use by Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii), few studies have examined roost selection. We examined roost use and selection by Rafinesque's big-eared bat at the tree, stand, and landscape scales during the maternity season in pristine old-growth habitat in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina. We located 43 roosts (14 maternity, 29 solitary) through cavity searches and radio-telemetry. Maternity colonies and solitary individuals selected roosts based on similar characteristics. The best model explaining roost selection by all bats included tree and stand characteristics; landscape factors had little influence on roost use. Bats selected large diameter trees in areas with a high density of trees with cavities in the surrounding area. Most roosts (67.4%) were in water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) in semi-permanently flooded and saturated areas. Half of maternity roost cavities had upper bole openings whereas only 25.8% of solitary roosts had upper bole openings. Bats that roosted with maternity groups stayed in roosts for significantly shorter periods of time (1.3 +/- 0.1 days) and used significantly more roost trees (5.0 +/- 0.6 roosts) than adult males (3.8 +/- 1.10 days, 2.3 +/- 0.4 roosts, respectively). Maternity colony use of cavities with upper bole openings and shorter residency times suggest that predator avoidance may have been an important factor governing roosting behavior of maternity colonies in this area. Our results suggest that retention of large diameter, hollow trees in wetland areas will benefit Rafinesque's big-eared bat individuals and maternity colonies in this area.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1508-1109	1733-5329		WOS:000359298700011		
J	Dey, Kakan C.; Mishra, Ashok; Chowdhury, Mashrur								Potential of Intelligent Transportation Systems in Mitigating Adverse Weather Impacts on Road Mobility: A Review								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				16	3			1107	1119		10.1109/TITS.2014.2371455			JUN 2015	2015	Adverse weather conditions for roads, which cause transportation systems to perform far below capacity, can severely affect society's economic output. As elimination of road weather events is not possible, transportation agencies perform proactive and reactive maintenance activities to minimize adverse impacts to keep roadways in optimum condition. While reactive maintenance activities are conducted to clear roadways after the occurrence of extreme weather events, proactive activities minimize these impacts beforehand. The success of proactive activities solely depends on the availability of accurate road weather information, however. Traditional road weather forecasting techniques rely on governmental weather services, which are not appropriate to predict route-specific road weather conditions. In this paper, the authors reviewed current intelligent transportation systems (ITS)-based solutions for minimizing road weather impacts and possible ITS innovations to incorporate diverse data sources to improve road weather management activities. ITS-based initiatives, such as road weather information system (RWIS), allow transportation agencies obtain accurate road weather assessments. Location-specific infrastructures such as RWIS are cost prohibitive for system-wide deployments. Connected vehicles equipped with weather sensors could enhance mobile road weather data collection. This strategy could improve proactive maintenance programs and reduce adverse effects of weather to the surface transportation system.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000359252700004

The environment has been used for both research experimentation and education. It has been used in undergraduate computer science courses to teach modular software development and analytical reasoning principles at multiple institutions. In the process, the environment has undergone many refinements to meet demands for improved functionality and to leverage rapidly changing underlying technology for the improvements. The environment is tailored to present formal specifications and alternative implementations of components, and enable correctness checking through a server-side verifying compiler. This paper presents a detailed account of the development and evolution of the environmentits functionality, user interface, and underlying technologythat we hope will serve as a model for others, especially as the benefits of online learning systems are becoming increasingly obvious.

The basic protein characteristics considered are stability, dynamics, and the binding of proteins and methods for assessing effects of mutations on these macromolecular characteristics are briefly outlined. It is emphasized that the above entities mostly reflect global characteristics of considered macromolecules, while given mutations may alter the local structural features such as salt bridges and hydrogen bonds without affecting the global ones. Furthermore, it is pointed out that disease-causing mutations frequently involve a drastic change of amino acid physicochemical properties such as charge, hydrophobicity, and geometry, and are less surface exposed than polymorphic mutations.									14	1	0	10	0	15			0959-440X	1879-033X		WOS:000359032300005	25658850

Recently, we reported on dry-spinning of a partially acetylated softwood kraft lignin to produce carbon fibers with superior properties, but the thermo-oxidative stabilization step required a long time due to a slow heating rate needed to prevent the fibers from being heated too rapidly and sticking to each other. Here we report a rapid strategy of dual UV-thermoxidative stabilization (crosslinking) of dry-spun lignin fibers that significantly reduces the stabilization time. The fibers undergo reaction close to the surface such that they can be subsequently thermally stabilized at a rapid heating rate without fibers fusing together, which reduces the total stabilization time significantly from 40 to 4 h. Consequently, the glass transition temperature of UV irradiated fibers was about 15 degrees C higher than that of fibers without UV treatment. Stabilized fibers were successfully carbonized at 1000 degrees C and resulting carbon fibers displayed a tensile strength of 900 +/- 100 MPa, which is amongst the highest reported for carbon fibers derived from softwood lignin-based precursors. These results establish that UV irradiation is a rapid step that can effectively shorten the total stabilization time for production of lignin-derived carbon fibers.									5	0	0	1	0	5			2079-6439			WOS:000357933900006

Fluorescence properties of fluor molecules confined within nanoscale pores in a polymer matrix								MRS COMMUNICATIONS				5	2			347	352		10.1557/mrc.2015.38			JUN 2015	2015	We demonstrate that fluorescence properties of organic fluors embedded in a porous polystyrene matrix are highly sensitive to the average pore size and pore-size distribution of the matrix. The effect can be understood as two different types of confinement imposed to the fluor molecules by the matrix. First, there is geometrical confinement that restricts the fluor oscillations due to its physical contact with a pore wall. Second, there is an electronic confinement due to a local polarization of the wall material by molecular dipoles. The effects lead to a spectral shift and enhancement of the fluorescence intensity of the material.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2159-6859	2159-6867		WOS:000358147300028

Analysis of Algaecide Exposures: an Evaluation of the I-3(-) Method to Measure Sodium Carbonate Peroxyhydrate Algaecides								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				226	6					170	10.1007/s11270-015-2439-x			JUN 2015	2015	Algaecides are commonly used to control noxious algal growths in water resources. In order to make accurate predictions about responses of target and non-target species to algaecide exposures, reliable methods are needed to confirm exposures in the laboratory and the field. The focus of this research was to evaluate the I-3(-) method for measuring hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposures associated with applications of a sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate (SCP)-based algaecide. To meet this overall objective, method detection limits, interferences from field waters (turbidity, color, and algal cell density), and storage stability of samples were measured. The method detection limits were 0.2 (p< 0.0001) and 0.25 mg H2O2/L (p= 0.0002) for laboratory and field waters, respectively. The upper method detection limit was 7.5 mg H2O2/L for both waters. Turbidity (25.3 NTU) and color of field-collected water did not interfere with measurements. Algal cell densities of 10(4), 10(5), and 10(6) cells/mL of two planktonic algal species in laboratory water did not interfere with measurements. Measurements of samples stored in dark refrigeration and on ice remained stable over 4 days, while measurements of samples stored in direct sunlight in ambient temperatures were altered after 1 day. The I-3(-) method accurately measured H2O2 exposures in the laboratory water, field water, and laboratory water containing planktonic algae used in this experiment within the range of concentrations that would be applied in a field setting. These data demonstrated that this method has utility for confirming exposures after laboratory and field treatments of SCP-based algaecides.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000354498300004

Geoff								Effects of dispersal on total biomass in a patchy, heterogeneous system: Analysis and experiment								MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES				264				54	62		10.1016/j.mbs.2015.03.005			JUN 2015	2015	An intriguing recent result from mathematics is that a population diffusing at an intermediate rate in an environment in which resources vary spatially will reach a higher total equilibrium biomass than the population in an environment in which the same total resources are distributed homogeneously. We extended the current mathematical theory to apply to logistic growth and also showed that the result applies to patchy systems with dispersal among patches, both for continuous and discrete time. This allowed us to make specific predictions, through simulations, concerning the biomass dynamics, which were verified by a laboratory experiment. The experiment was a study of biomass growth of duckweed (Lemna minor Linn.), where the resources (nutrients added to water) were distributed homogeneously among a discrete series of water-filled containers in one treatment, and distributed heterogeneously in another treatment. The experimental results showed that total biomass peaked at an intermediate, relatively low, diffusion rate, higher than the total carrying capacity of the system and agreeing with the simulation model. The implications of the experiment to dynamics of source, sink, and pseudo-sink dynamics are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J	Young, Vanessa K. Hilliard; Blob, Richard W.								Limb bone loading in swimming turtles: changes in loading facilitate transitions from tubular to flipper-shaped limbs during aquatic invasions								BIOLOGY LETTERS				11	6					20150110	10.1098/rsbl.2015.0110			JUN 1 2015	2015	Members of several terrestrial vertebrate lineages have returned to nearly exclusive use of aquatic habitats. These transitions were often accompanied by changes in skeletal morphology, such as flattening of limb bone shafts. Such morphological changes might be correlated with the exposure of limb bones to altered loading. Though the environmental forces acting on the skeleton differ substantially between water and land, no empirical data exist to quantify the impact of such differences on the skeleton, either in terms of load magnitude or regime. To test how locomotor loads change between water and land, we compared in vivo strains from femora of turtles (Trachemys scripta) during swimming and terrestrial walking. As expected, strain magnitudes were much lower (by 67.9%) during swimming than during walking. However, the loading regime of the femur also changed between environments: torsional strains are high during walking, but torsion is largely eliminated during swimming. Changes in loading regime between environments may have enabled evolutionary shifts to hydrodynamically advantageous flattened limb bones in highly aquatic species. Although circular cross sections are optimal for resisting torsional loads, the removal of torsion would reduce the advantage of tubular shapes, facilitating the evolution of flattened limbs.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000357685300003	26085496

Three irrigation treatments were applied: 1) Control: trees were irrigated with 100% of their evapotranspirative needs (ETc); 2) 60 sustained deficit irrigation (SDI): 60% ETc; and 3) partial root-zone drying (PRD): 100% ETc needs, applied to only one-half of root zone. Maximum daily shrinkage (MDS), trunk growth rate (TGR), and MDS ratio (ratio between MDS of stressed trees and control trees) were determined. Day-to-day MDS values varied largely and could not be used to determine tree water deficit. TGR did not show significant differences among treatments at this level of stress. Nevertheless, the MDS ratio was a reliable indicator to measure tree water status, and it was more sensitive for detecting water deficit at the onset of a water deficit in trees under SDI than in trees under PRD.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-3452	2211-3460		WOS:000357749600005		
J	Ward, Brian; Smith, Powell; James, Susan; Stansell, Zachary; Farnham, Mark								Increasing Plant Density in Eastern United States Broccoli Production Systems to Maximize Marketable Head Yields								HORTTECHNOLOGY				25	3			330	334					JUN 2015	2015	Increased demand for fresh market crown-cut broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) has led to increased production along the eastern seaboard of the United States. Maximizing broccoli yields is a primary concern for quickly expanding eastern markets. Thus, a plant density study was carried out in Fall 2012 and 2013 using the hybrid cultivar Emerald Crown on a commercial farm in Summerton, SC, and in Fall 2013 using 'Emerald Crown' and another hybrid, 'Durapak 19', on a research farm in Charleston, SC. The objective was to determine the effect of variable within-row spacings of 4, 6, and 8 inches (using a system with double rows spaced 12-inches apart) on marketable yields and quality in the three environments. Our results indicated that increasing plant density by reducing within-row spacing to 4 inches significantly increased overall yield per hectare over the 6- and 8-inch spacing treatments at two of three environments. Stem diameter and average head weight were unaffected by plant density; however, heads harvested from plots with the highest plant densities had significantly (P < 0.01) lower bead uniformity in the Summerton 2012 trial, and significantly (P < 0.05) larger bead size in the two trials conducted in 2013. In general, the highest total marketable yields were from the 4-inch within-row spacing, but increased competition at the highest density may increase the risk of plants producing heads with lower quality characteristics. With the increased risk of producing lower quality marketable heads along with the increased production costs associated with the 4-inch spacing, yield and head quality attributes may be optimized at the 6-inch within-row spacing.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1063-0198	1943-7714		WOS:000357770600007

Effect of channel shape on selection of time marching scheme in the discontinuous Galerkin method for 1-D open channel flow								JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS				27	3			413	426		10.1016/S1001-6058(15)60499-1			JUN 2015	2015	One-dimensional open channel flows are simulated using the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. Three different explicit time marching schemes, including multistep/multistage schemes, are,evaluated for different channel shapes for accuracy and efficiency. the Forward Euler, second-order Adam-Bashforth (multistep) and second-order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta (multistage) time marching schemes are utilized. The role of monotonized central, minmod, and zero TVD slope limiters for each of the time marching scheme is investigated. The numerical flux is approximated using HLL function. The accuracy and robustness of different time marching schemes are evaluated for steady and unsteady flows using analytical and measured data. The unsteady flows include dam break tests with wet and dry beds downstream of the dam in prismatic (rectangular, trapezoidal, triangular, and parabolic cross-sections) and non-prismatic (natural river) channels. The steady flow test involves simulation of hydraulic jump in a diverging rectangular channel. The various schemes are evaluated by comparing accuracy using statistical measures and efficiency using maximum possible time step size as well as CPU runtime. The second-order Adam-Bashforth time marching scheme is found to have the best accuracy and efficiency among the time stepping schemes tested.									1	1	0	0	0	1			1001-6058	1878-0342		WOS:000357626300011

Upon addition, copolymers are linked through a new fluorinated arylene vinylene ether (FAVE) bond. Resulting copolymers were characterized by ATR-FTIR, H-1, and F-19 NMR analysis. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) showed a number-average molecular weights (M(n)s) of polymers from 9000 to 16,000. A moderated increase in Mns was observed compared to corresponding oligomers. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms revealed glass transition temperatures (T(g)s) from -25 to 127 degrees C. All copolymers showed one copolymer-specific T-g. All T(g)s were compared to the theoretical values calculated from the Fox equation. Comparisons showed T(g)s became more agreeable at the lowest and highest PEG weight fractions. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) studies showed a two-stage degradation in nitrogen and air that corresponded to copolymer weight percent. The onsets of degradations were from 343 to 360 degrees C for copolymers in air and from 333 to 343 degrees C for copolymers in nitrogen.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0170-0839	1436-2449		WOS:000357538100010		
J	Calomeni, Alyssa J.; Iwinski, Kyla J.; Kinley, Ciera M.; McQueen, Andrew; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								Responses of Lyngbya wollei to algaecide exposures and a risk characterization associated with their use								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				116				90	98		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.03.004			JUN 2015	2015	To make informed decisions regarding management of noxious algal growths, water resource managers require information on responses of target and non-target species to algaecide exposures. Periodic treatments of Phycomycin (R)-SCP (sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate) followed by Algimycin (R)-PWF (gluconate and citrate chelated copper) to control Lyngbya wollei growths for ten years provided an opportunity for a risk evaluation of treated coves in Lay Lake, AL. Abiotic sediment characteristics (acid soluble copper concentrations, acid volatile sulfides, percent organic matter and cation exchange capacity) and survival of Hyalella azteca and Chironomus dilutus were measured in sediment samples from treated and untreated coves to assess the bioavailability of potential copper-residuals. In laboratory studies to seek a more effective approach for managing the growth of Lyngbya, six algaecide treatments consisting of combinations of copper-based algaecides (Cutrine (R)-Ultra, Clearigate and Algimycin (R)-PWF), a hydrogen peroxide based algaecide (Phycomycin (R)-SCP) and an adjuvant (Cide-Kick II) were assessed for efficacy in controlling L. wollei sampled from Lay Lake. The most efficient algaecide treatment was determined based on post-treatment algal wet weight and visual observations of responses to exposures. To estimate the margin of safety for non-target organisms, Pimephales promelas was exposed to the most efficacious treatment and a treatment of Phycomycin (R)-SCP followed by Algimycin (R)-PWF. Results from sediment experiments demonstrated that there were no measureable copper residuals and no adverse effects on H. azteca and C. dilutus from sediments following ten years of copper-based algaecide treatments. Based on the laboratory results, a treatment of Phycomycin (R)-SCP at 10.1 mg H2O2/L followed by Cide-Kick II at 0.2 mg/L and Algimycin (R)-PWF at 0.26 mg Cu/L could control the growth of Lyngbya wollei from Lay Lake, AL and enhance the margin of safety for non-target species (e.g. P. promelas).

Based on the first 4 yr of science data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission, it is the deepest yet in this energy range. Relative to the Second Fermi LAT catalog, the 3FGL catalog incorporates twice as much data, as well as a number of analysis improvements, including improved calibrations at the event reconstruction level, an updated model for Galactic diffuse.-ray emission, a refined procedure for source detection, and improved methods for associating LAT sources with potential counterparts at other wavelengths. The 3FGL catalog includes 3033 sources above 4 sigma significance, with source location regions, spectral properties, and monthly light curves for each. Of these, 78 are flagged as potentially being due to imperfections in the model for Galactic diffuse emission. Twenty-five sources are modeled explicitly as spatially extended, and overall 238 sources are considered as identified based on angular extent or correlated variability (periodic or otherwise) observed at other wavelengths. For 1010 sources we have not found plausible counterparts at other wavelengths. More than 1100 of the identified or associated sources are active galaxies of the blazar class; several other classes of non-blazar active galaxies are also represented in the 3FGL. Pulsars represent the largest Galactic source class. From source counts of Galactic sources we estimate that the contribution of unresolved sources to the Galactic diffuse emission is similar to 3% at 1 GeV.									221	6	0	0	0	225			0067-0049	1538-4365		WOS:000357122200009

Parameterization of the IFF was performed to achieve agreement between experimental and calculated adsorption free energies of small TGTG-X-GTGT host-guest peptides (T = threonine, G - glycine, and X - variable amino-acid residue) on HDPE, with +/- 0.5 kcal/mol agreement. This IFF parameter set consists of tuned nonbonded parameters (i.e., partial charges and Lennard-Jones parameters) for use with an in-house-modified CHARMM molecular dynamic program that enables the use of an independent set of force field parameters to control molecular behavior at a solid-liquid interface. The R correlation coefficient between the simulated and experimental peptide adsorption free energies increased from 0.00 for the standard CHARMM force field parameters to 0.88 for the tuned IFF parameters. Subsequent studies are planned to apply the tuned IFF parameter set for the simulation of protein adsorption behavior on an HDPE surface for comparison with experimental values of adsorbed protein orientation and conformation.

Effect of precision feeding high- and low-quality forage with different rumen protein degradability levels on nutrient utilization by dairy heifers								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				93	6			3066	3075		10.2527/jas.2014-8260			JUN 2015	2015	One approach to improving efficiency of protein and nitrogen use for optimal productivity in dairy heifers is to provide adequate levels of protein with differing rumen degradabilities. The objective of this experiment was to determine effects of manipulating RDP in diets of dairy heifers precision fed low-and high-quality forage. Eight rumen-cannulated Holstein heifers (448 +/- 19 kg BW) were randomly used and assigned to an 85% forage diet with 2 forage qualities, low quality (LQ, 48% NDF) and high quality (HQ, 38% NDF), and to 4 RDP levels (62%, 68%, 74%, and 81% of CP as RDP) within forage quality administered according to a split-plot two 4 x 4 Latin square design (20-d periods). Similar N intake was provided (1.70 g N/kg BW0.75), and alterations of RDP levels were made by exchanging canola meal with heat-treated soy protein with slow-release urea. Heifers offered the HQ diet had greater apparent total tract DM and OM digestibilities than those fed the LQ diet. Apparent N digestibility tended to be higher for the HQ diet but was not affected by the levels of RDP in diets. No difference was observed for rumen VFA concentration between forage treatments, but acetate to propionate ratio was higher for LQ-fed heifers. No difference in rumen carbohydrate fermentation was detected with increasing levels of RDP. Feeding HQ forage improved DM, OM, and N apparent digestibility. Increasing RDP in LQ and HQ had no effects on apparent digestibility of any measured parameter or N dynamics in dairy heifers.

J	Nguyen, Khuong X.; Tong, Chenning								Investigation of subgrid-scale physics in the convective atmospheric surface layer using the budgets of the conditional mean subgrid-scale stress and temperature flux								JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS				772				295	329		10.1017/jfm.2015.171			JUN 2015	2015	The subgrid-scale (SGS) physics in the convective atmospheric surface layer is studied using the SGS stress and SGS scalar flux. We derive the budget equations for the conditional mean SGS stress and SGS temperature flux and show that, for transport-equation-based SGS models, the budget terms must be correctly predicted by the SGS model in order for large-eddy simulation (LES) to reproduce the resolvable-scale velocity and temperature probability density functions. Field data from the Advection Horizontal Array Turbulence Study, which notably includes measurements of the fluctuating pressure and the advection of the velocity and temperature fields, are then used to analyse the budget equations. The results reveal the complex behaviour of the dynamics of the convective atmospheric surface layer. The budgets of the conditional mean SGS shear stress and SGS temperature flux are an approximate balance between the conditional mean production and pressure destruction, with the latter causing return to isotropy. The budgets of the normal SGS stress components are more complex. For strongly convective surface layers, energy is redistributed from the (smaller) vertical to the (larger) horizontal stress components during downdrafts, resulting in generation of anisotropy by the conditional mean SGS pressure-strain-rate correlation; wall pressure reflections can also enhance the anisotropy. The conditional mean SGS pressure transport, meanwhile, is a significant source of energy during updrafts as a result of the near-wall pressure minima. The vertical advection also plays a significant role in the transfer of SGS energy. For weakly convective surface layers, pressure transport is small while the SGS pressure-strain-rate correlation reverts to its usual role of causing return to isotropy. The results of the present study, particularly for the conditional mean SGS pressure-strain-rate correlation, provide new insights into the SGS physics first educed in a recent analysis of the mean SGS budgets by Nguyen et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 729, 2013, pp. 388-422) and have important implications for near-wall models utilizing SGS transport equations in the convective atmospheric surface layer.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-1120	1469-7645		WOS:000357029100015

On farm prevention of Campylobacter and Salmonella: lessons learned from basic biosecurity interventions								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POULTRY RESEARCH				24	2			222	232		10.3382/japr/pfv016			JUN 2015	2015	An observational study examining prevalence of Campylobacter and Salmonella in environmental samples and biosecurity interventions to mitigate these 2 pathogens was performed for 3 consecutive flocks on a commercial broiler farm in northeast Georgia. Monitoring was performed first on a baseline flock for which no interventions or treatments were undertaken. The same monitoring was performed for 2 subsequent flocks which underwent biosecurity interventions and pest management treatments designed to prevent introduction and transmission of Campylobacter and Salmonella. In addition to environmental sampling for the 2 treatment flocks, fly, darkling beetle, water line, and cecal samples were collected. No management interventions were instituted within or between flocks other than those prescribed by study design. Complete prevention of Campylobacter and Salmonella was unsuccessful in the treated flocks but differences in prevalence were apparent although only 2 statistically significant differences were found between study flocks. Study data also revealed interesting patterns with respect to location and timing of positive isolations of Campylobacter and Salmonella.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1056-6171	1537-0437		WOS:000355144000014

The directional sensitivity of the acoustic radiation force to particle diameter								JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				137	6			3288	3298		10.1121/1.4921296			JUN 2015	2015	When viscous corrections to the inviscid acoustic radiation force theory are implemented and applied to a standing wave field, the direction of the acoustic radiation force on particles varies from theory to theory. Specifically, some theories predict that the direction of the force depends on the particle diameter, while others reveal that the direction of the force is independent of particle diameter. The present study is an experimental investigation of the direction of the acoustic radiation force which suggests that particle diameter does affect the direction. Experiments were conducted in air using an ultrasonic standing wave field with a nominal frequency of 30 kHz. Smoke particles and fine water droplets having a range of diameters were flowed into the region of a standing wave field. The direction of the acoustic radiation force was determined by observing whether the particles accumulated in the nodes or the anti-nodes of the standing wave. Results show a change in the direction of the acoustic radiation force at a particle diameter of 0.3 +/- 0.1 mu m, which corresponds to a particle diameter to acoustic-boundary-layer thickness ratio of 0.023 +/- 0.008.

Modal methods have been used in many disciplines from finite element methods to structural analysis to approximate complex and nonlinear parametric variations with simple mathematical functions. Given certain constraints and required accuracy, this helps to simplify complex phenomena with numerically efficient implementations leading to fast computations. A successful application of the modal approximation techniques to develop a new modal kinematic model for general variable length multisection continuum arms is discussed. The proposed method solves the limitations associated with previous models and introduces a new approach for readily deriving exact, singularity-free and unique MSF ' s that simplifies the approach and avoids mode switching. The model is able to simulate spatial bending as well as straight arm motions (i.e., pure elongation/contraction), and introduces inverse position and orientation kinematics for multisection continuum arms. A kinematic decoupling feature, splitting position and orientation inverse kinematics is introduced. This type of decoupling has not been presented for these types of robotic arms before. The model also carefully accounts for physical constraints in the joint space to provide enhanced insight into practical mechanics and impose actuator mechanical limitations onto the kinematics thus generating fully realizable results. The proposed method is easily applicable to a broad spectrum of continuum arm designs.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1748-3182	1748-3190		WOS:000356312300003	25969947

The potential in breast tissue engineering for the combined effects of linoleic acid and tamoxifen								JOURNAL OF HISTOTECHNOLOGY				38	2			39	44		10.1179/2046023614Y.0000000052			JUN 2015	2015	Literature to date has strongly suggested that linoleic acid (LA) enhances mammary cancer cell proliferation when used in the range of 0.5-20 mu g/ml. In contrast, the current in vitro studies show that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) MCF7 breast cancer cells were diminished following treatment with 30 mu g/ml (100 mu M) LA. MCF7 cells, when treated for 6 days with LA, consumed significantly less glucose than untreated controls (P-value < 0.01). MFC7 cells treated with 30 mu g/ml LA and 10 mM tamoxifen had even lower levels of DNA and lower glucose uptake. The same combination treatment of tamoxifen and LA was applied to a noncancerous mammary cell line, MCF10A, and did not have a significant effect on MCF10A DNA concentrations. Linoleic acid and its byproducts are important to cell proliferation and tissue reconstruction and, in combination with tamoxifen, can provide a uniquely different approach to soft tissue engineering. That is, LA and tamoxifen-loaded scaffolds may provide a viable reconstructive approach for patients undergoing lumpectomy and mastectomy by encouraging natural breast healing while limiting the ability of ER+ cancer cells to regrow. This approach could allow the suppression of estrogen-dependent mammary carcinomas while allowing natural cell proliferation after a mastectomy or lumpectomy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0147-8885	2046-0236		WOS:000356790600002

Separation/extraction methods must be employed for the isolation of target species at relevant concentrations. Micropipette tips packed with capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are employed for the SPE of proteins from a synthetic and a certified urine matrix.Experimental design: Extractions are performed utilizing a very simple centrifugation method to spin-down species through the C-CP fiber tips. Proteins adsorb to the hydrophobic polypropylene fibers and are eluted in a solvent suitable for MALDI-MS analysis. Figures of merit are determined for representative compounds beta 2-microglobulin, retinol binding protein, and transferrin.Results: The optimum protein processing included a 100 mu L aqueous rinse and an elution solvent composition was 10 mu L of 55:45 ACN:water (with triflouroacetic acid).

Impact of kudzu and puerarin on sperm function								REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY				53				54	62		10.1016/j.reprotox.2015.03.010			JUN 2015	2015	The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of kudzu (Pueraria mirifica) and the isoflavone puerarin in functional toxicological tests on spermatozoa and to assess the affinity of extracts and pure isoflavones for estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and -beta (ER alpha, ER beta) in receptor binding assays. Capacitation, acrosome reaction and chromatin decondensation in spermatozoa were analyzed using microscopic analysis. Kudzu, but not puerarin, reduced motility of sperm. Puerarin reduced the percent spontaneous acrosome reaction in spermatozoa. The pathways used by kudzu that affect sperm function are not fully mirrored by puerarin. Puerarin, kudzu and its other phytoestrogenic components displayed preferential affinity for ER beta, however the diverse effects of kudzu and puerarin on sperm function implicate the involvement of multiple signaling systems.

Three puzzles, Puzzles 5, 6, and 10, represented sequences of three large RNA structures with limited or no homology with previously solved RNA molecules. A lariat-capping ribozyme, as well as riboswitches complexed to adenosylcobalamin and tRNA, were predicted by seven groups using RNAComposer, ModeRNA/SimRNA, Vfold, Rosetta, DMD, MC-Fold, 3dRNA, and AMBER refinement. Some groups derived models using data from state-of-the-art chemical-mapping methods (SHAPE, DMS, CMCT, and mutate-and-map). The comparisons between the predictions and the three subsequently released crystallographic structures, solved at diffraction resolutions of 2.5-3.2 A, were carried out automatically using various sets of quality indicators. The comparisons clearly demonstrate the state of present-day de novo prediction abilities as well as the limitations of these state-of-the-art methods. All of the best prediction models have similar topologies to the native structures, which suggests that computational methods for RNA structure prediction can already provide useful structural information for biological problems: However, the prediction accuracy for non-Watson-Crick interactions, key to proper folding of RNAs, is low and some predicted models had high Clash Scores. These two difficulties point to some of the continuing bottlenecks in RNA structure prediction.

Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is a cool season food legume rich in protein and a range of micronutrients including minerals (iron and zinc), folates, and carotenoids. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of field application of two Se forms on lentil grain yield, seed Se concentration, and antioxidant activity. The experiment was conducted at Carrington Research and Extension Center, ND, USA in 2012 and 2013 with five lentil genotypes and three Se treatments (control, 30 g ha(-1) of selenite, and 30 g ha(-1) of selenate) applied at seeding and at 50% flowering. Application of selenite and selenate increased the lentil grain yield by 10% and 4%, respectively, compared to the control. Seed Se concentration was significantly higher in lentils treated with selenate (1.4 mg kg(-1)) compared to selenite (0.9 mg kg(-1)) and the control (0.6 mg kg(-1)). Selenate increased the antioxidant activity (66% inhibition) of lentils compared to the selenite (64% inhibition) and control (59% inhibition). Overall, Se fertilization is beneficial in increasing lentil seed yield; however selenate will be more beneficial in increasing seed Se concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Day, Brian M.; Wagman, Jeffrey B.; Smith, Peter J. K.								Perception of maximum stepping and leaping distance: Stepping affordances as a special case of leaping affordances								ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA				158				26	35		10.1016/j.actpsy.2015.03.010			JUN 2015	2015	Successfully performing everyday behaviors requires perceiving affordances-possibilities for behavior that depend on the fit between environmental properties and action capabilities. Whereas affordances for some behaviors are primarily constrained by relatively static geometric properties of the perceiver (non-launching behaviors such as stepping), others are additionally constrained by dynamic force production capabilities of the perceiver (launching behaviors such as leaping). This experiment used a transfer of calibration paradigm to investigate whether visual perception of launching and non-launching behaviors represent independent perception-action tasks. In particular, we investigated whether calibration of visual perception of maximum leaping distance transferred to visual perception of maximum stepping distance, and/or vice versa. The results showed that calibration of perception of maximum leaping distance transferred to perception of maximum stepping distance, suggesting that perception of launching and non-launching are not independent. Rather, perception of stepping affordances may be a special case of perception of leaping affordances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When cardiovascular complications e.g., collateral vessel formation occur during the inter-stage periods, further treatments are required. An 8-month-old patient, who underwent second stage (i.e., bi-directional Glenn, BDG) surgery at 4 months, was diagnosed with a major veno-venous collateral vessel (VVC) which was endovascularly occluded to improve blood oxygen saturations. Few clinical data were collected at 8 months, whereas at 4 months a more detailed data set was available. The aim of this study is threefold: (i) to show how to build a patient-specific model describing the hemodynamics in the presence of VVC, using patient-specific clinical data collected at different times; (ii) to use this model to perform virtual VVC occlusion for quantitative hemodynamics prediction; and (iii) to compare predicted hemodynamics with post-operative measurements. The three-dimensional BDG geometry, resulting from the virtual surgery on the first stage model, was coupled with a lumped parameter model (LPM) of the 8-month patient's circulation. The latter was developed by scaling the 4-month LPM to account for changes in vascular impedances due to growth and adaptation. After virtual VVC closure, the model confirmed the 2 mmHg BDG pressure increase, as clinically observed, suggesting the importance of modeling vascular adaptation following the BDG procedure.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0090-6964	1573-9686		WOS:000355924000005	25344350

Although many factors have emerged as possible contributors, the degree to which each impacts the overall hemodynamics is largely unknown. Computational modeling provides a means to test hypotheses of causes of exercise intolerance via precisely controlled virtual experiments and measurements. We quantified the physiological impacts of commonly encountered, clinically relevant dysfunctions introduced to the exercising Fontan system via a previously developed lumped-parameter model of Fontan exercise. Elevated pulmonary arterial pressure was observed in all cases of dysfunction, correlated with lowered cardiac output (CO), and often mediated by elevated atrial pressure. Pulmonary vascular resistance was not the most significant factor affecting exercise performance as measured by CO. In the absence of other dysfunctions, atrioventricular valve insufficiency alone had significant physiological impact, especially under exercise demands. The impact of isolated dysfunctions can be linearly summed to approximate the combined impact of several dysfunctions occurring in the same system. A single dominant cause of exercise intolerance was not identified, though several hypothesized dysfunctions each led to variable decreases in performance. Computational predictions of performance improvement associated with various interventions should be weighed against procedural risks and potential complications, contributing to improvements in routine patient management protocol.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-6964	1573-9686		WOS:000355924000007	25260878

Crystal Chemistry of Alkali Thorium Silicates Under Hydrothermal Conditions								CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN				15	6			2643	2651		10.1021/cg5017164			JUN 2015	2015	An investigation into the crystal chemistry of the alkali thorium silicates resulted in the formation of five novel materials by hydrothermal synthesis. Of these, Rb4Th2Si12O30, and K2ThSi4O10F2 are new structure types crystallizing in space groups P (1) over bar and Pnma, respectively. The structure of Rb4Th2Si12O30 reveals a silicate sheet structure with eight-, six-, five-, and four-membered silicate rings. Crystals of a related composition, Cs2ThSi6O15, were also synthesized. They crystallize in space group Cmc2(1) and have a silicate sheet containing eight-, six-, and four-membered silicate rings. The structure of K2ThSi4O10F2 consists of a tubular silicate column comprised of eight-, six-, and four-membered silicate rings and features chains of fluorine-bridged Th atoms. Two new wadeite analogues Cs2ThSi3O9 and Rb2ThSi3O9 were also discovered and constitute the first actinide representatives in this mineral family. All products were crystallized from reactions of ThO2 and silica with alkali fluorides or hydroxides in hydrothermal fluids at 575 degrees C. They were all characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy, and detailed structural comparisons are provided. The work significantly expands the field of synthetic thorium silicates.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000355890400015

This report presents genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mining utilizing resequencing data with BAC-end sequences as a reference by alignment of 12 G. hirsutum L. lines, one G. barbadense L. line, and one G. longicalyx Hutch and Lee line. A total of 132,262 intraspecific SNPs have been developed for G. hirsutum, whereas 223,138 and 470,631 interspecific SNPs have been developed for G. barbadense and G. longicalyx, respectively. Using a set of interspecific SNPs, 11 randomly selected and 77 SNPs that are putatively associated with the homeologous chromosome pair 12 and 26, we mapped 77 SNPs into two linkage groups representing these chromosomes, spanning a total of 236.2 cMin an interspecific F2 population (G. barbadense 3-79 x G. hirsutum TM-1). The mapping results validated the approach for reliably producing large numbers of both intraspecific and interspecific SNPs aligned to BAC-ends. This will allow for future construction of high-density integrated physical and genetic maps for cotton and other complex polyploid genomes. The methods developed will allow for future Gossypium resequencing data to be automatically genotyped for identified SNPs along the BAC-end sequence reference for anchoring sequence assemblies and comparative studies.									2	1	0	2	0	3			2160-1836			WOS:000356176000009	25858960	
J	Shen, Haiying; Lin, Yuhua; Li, Jin								A Social-Network-Aided Efficient Peer-to-Peer Live Streaming System								IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING				23	3			987	1000		10.1109/TNET.2014.2311431			JUN 2015	2015	In current peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming systems, nodes in a channel form a P2P overlay for video sharing. To watch a new channel, a node depends on the centralized server to join in the overlay of the channel. In today's live streaming applications, the increase in the number of channels triggers users' desire of watching multiple channels successively or simultaneously. However, the support of such watching modes in current applications is no better than joining in different channel overlays successively or simultaneously through the centralized server, which if widely used, poses a heavy burden on the server. In order to achieve higher efficiency and scalability, we propose a Social-network-Aided efficient liVe strEaming system (SAVE). SAVE regards users' channel switching or multichannel watching as interactions between channels. By collecting the information of channel interactions, nodes' interests, and watching times, SAVE forms nodes in multiple channels with frequent interactions into an overlay, constructs bridges between overlays of channels with less frequent interactions, and enables nodes to identify friends sharing similar interests and watching times. Thus, a node can connect to a new channel while staying in its current overlay, using bridges or relying on its friends, reducing the need to contact the centralized server. We further propose the channel-closeness-based chunk-pushing strategy and capacity-based chunk provider selection strategy to enhance the system performance. Extensive experimental results from the PeerSim simulator and PlanetLab verify that SAVE outperforms other systems in system efficiency and server load reduction, as well as the effectiveness of the two proposed strategies.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1063-6692	1558-2566		WOS:000356298800023

Na8AlxSi46-x compositions with x <= 8 were also synthesized by SPS from precursor mixtures of different ratios. The crystal structure of Na8Al8Si38 was investigated using both Rietveld and single-crystal refinements. Temperature-dependent transport and UV/vis measurements were employed in the characterization of Na8Al8Si38, with diffuse-reflectance measurement indicating an indirect optical gap of 0.64 eV. Our results indicate that, when more than one precursor is used, both SPS and KCTD are effective methods for the synthesis of multinary inorganic phases that are not easily accessible by traditional solid-state synthesis or crystal growth techniques.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000355638100037	25985168

At early times during infiltration into a soil, the zone above the wetting front may act as a low-velocity waveguide that traps GPR waves, thereby causing dispersion and making interpretation of the data using standard methods difficult. In this work, we show that the dispersion is dependent upon the distribution of water within the waveguide, which is controlled by soil hydrologic properties. Simulations of infiltration were performed by varying the n-parameter of the Mualem-van Genuchten equation using HYDRUS-1D; the associated GPR data were simulated to evaluate the influence of dispersion. We observed a notable decrease in wave dispersion as the sharpness of the wetting front profile decreased. Given the sensitivity of the dispersion effect to the wetting front profile, we also evaluated whether the water content distribution can be determined through inversion of the dispersive GPR data. We found that a global grid search combined with the simplex algorithm was able to estimate the average water content when the wetted zone is divided into 2 layers. This approach was incapable, however, of representing the gradational nature of the water content distribution behind the wetting front. In contrast, the shuffled complex evolution algorithm was able to constrain a piece-wise linear function to closely match the shallow gradational water content profile. In both the layered and piece-wise linear case, the sensitivity of the dispersive data dropped sharply below the wetting front, which in this case was around 20 cm, i.e., twice the average wavelength, for a 900 MHz GPR survey. This study demonstrates that dispersive GPR data has significant potential for capturing the early-time dynamics of infiltration that cannot be obtained with standard GPR analysis approaches.

J	Delmas, Candice								False Convictions and True Conscience								OXFORD JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES				35	2			403	425		10.1093/ojls/gqv001			SUM 2015	2015	Society typically shows conscientious objectors more deference than civil disobedients, on the grounds that they appear more conscientious and less strategically minded than the latter. Kimberley Brownlee challenges this standard picture in Conscience and Conviction: The Case for Civil Disobedience, where she claims that civil disobedience is more conscientious than conscientious objection, in virtue of its communicativeness. Brownlee conceives of conscientious conviction as necessarily communicative, and distinguishes it from 'conscience'-the set of practical moral skills involved in adequately responding to complex situations. This review article argues that Brownlee's account of conviction is too narrow, as it excludes many core beliefs which we would want to classify as convictions although they violate one or more of the criteria of communicativeness, while her account of conscience is incomplete, because it ignores some of the persistent obstacles for the development of conscience produced by structural injustice. The article identifies these obstacles and offers some strategies for protecting against them, namely, vigilance, self-scrutiny, empathy and collaborative ambivalence.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0143-6503	1464-3820		WOS:000355931000009

China is revised based on the reliability theory. With quality static load test data, both within-site and cross-site variabilities for design methods of piles in Shanghai are characterized. It is found that the amount of uncertainties associated with the design of piles in Shanghai is less than the typical values reported in the literature. With the partial factors specified in the previous design code, the reliability indexes of piles designed with empirical methods are in the range of 3.08-4.64, while those of piles designed with the load test-based method are in the range of 5.67-5.89. The load factors in the revised local design code have been reduced according to the national design code. As a result, the resistance factors have been increased in the revised code based on a combination of a reliability analysis and engineering judgment. In the revised design code, the reliability level of piles designed with the empirical methods is similar to that in the previous design code; the reliability level of piles designed with the load test-based method is lowered to achieve cost-effectiveness. Partial factors have been suggested for side and toe resistances based on the reliability theory considering their relative importance as well as the uncertainties involved.

In this essay I consider his arguments against speciesism generally and the species-norm account of deprivation in particular. I argue that McMahan's ethical framework (as outlined in The Ethics of Killing) is more nuanced and more open to the incorporation of speciesist intuitions regarding deprivation than he himself suggests. Specifically, I argue that, given his willingness to include a comparative dimension in his Intrinsic Potential Account he ought to recognize species as a legitimate comparison class. I also argue that a sensible speciesism can be pluralist and flexible enough to accommodate many of McMahan's arguments in defense of moral individualist intuitions. In this way, I hope to make the case for at least a partial reconciliation between McMahan and the Wittgensteinian speciesists, e.g. Cora Diamond, Stephen Mulhall, and Raimond Gaita.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0038-4283	2041-6962		WOS:000356091700005

Temperature Effects on the Molecular Properties of Liquid Lignin Recovered from Kraft Black Liquor								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				3	6			1032	1038		10.1021/sc500703m			JUN 2015	2015	The effect of temperature on the molecular properties of a "liquid-lignin" phase recovered from Kraft black liquor via CO, acidification at elevated temperatures was investigated. For softwood black liquors, up to a 4-fold increase in the molecular weight (mol wt) of the recovered liquid-lignin phase was observed as the acidification temperature was increased from 100 to 150 degrees C. Thus, experiments were carried out in which the CO2-acidification steps of preheating, acidification, and phase separation were decoupled from each other in order to elucidate the mechanisms for the observed changes in molecular weight. Results indicate that some lignin cleavage and a corresponding decrease in molecular weight occur during the black-liquor preheating step. However, a significant net increase in molecular weight occurs after the lignin has phase-separated from the black liquor in the form of a new, denser liquid phase, pointing to condensation reactions as the most likely cause. Minimal changes in lignin aromatic content were observed in the new liquid-lignin phase. Because elevated-temperature, CO2 acidification can be carried out continuously via the SLRP process, adjusting residence times in the black liquor liquid lignin phase separator would be an effective method for controlling the molecular weight of the recovered lignin for a given product application.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000355645000001

Explorations in statistics: the analysis of change								ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION				39	2			49	54		10.1152/advan.00018.2015			JUN 1 2015	2015	Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This tenth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores the analysis of a potential change in some physiological response. As researchers, we often express absolute change as percent change so we can account for different initial values of the response. But this creates a problem: percent change is really just a ratio, and a ratio is infamous for its ability to mislead. This means we may fail to find a group difference that does exist, or we may find a group difference that does not exist. What kind of an approach to science is that? In contrast, analysis of covariance is versatile: it can accommodate an analysis of the relationship between absolute change and initial value when percent change is useless.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1043-4046	1522-1229		WOS:000355533100002	26031718

The FBG was inscribed on a piece of double-clad fiber with a center wavelength of 1032 nm. Due to the selective reflection of the backward Yb-band amplified spontaneous emission (Yb ASE) by the FBG, a co-pump-propagating Yb-band auxiliary signal was generated. Because of the stimulated amplification and reabsorption of the auxiliary signal, the Yb ASE was dramatically suppressed and the pump conversion efficiency (PCE) of the EYDFA was notably improved. An output power of 6.48 W was achieved at a pump power of 16.5 W, which is equivalent to a PCE of similar to 39%. The slope efficiency relative to applied pump power was similar to 40%. The maximum output power was improved similar to 20% because of the introduction of the FBG.

J	Cai, Yuanqiang; Sun, Qi; Guo, Lin; Juang, C. Hsein; Wang, Jun								Permanent deformation characteristics of saturated sand under cyclic loading								CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL				52	6			795	807		10.1139/cgj-2014-0341			JUN 2015	2015	The loading path involving principal stress rotation (PSR) during shear is an important phenomenon encountered in many field conditions. Typically for traffic loading, both the magnitude and direction of principal stresses may vary with time due to the motion of vehicles, and the stress path can be mimicked by a heart shape in the deviatoric stress space. Conventional triaxial tests are not suitable to recreate this type of stress path in that no torsional shear stress can be applied on the test samples. To overcome this limitation, a series of tests using a hollow cylinder apparatus were conducted on sand to investigate the permanent deformation characteristics under drained conditions with different levels of confining pressure (sigma(c)), cyclic vertical stress ratio (CVSR), and cyclic torsional stress ratio (eta). The results clearly show an increase in the permanent deformation with eta, indicating that the PSR effect on permanent deformation cannot be ignored. Both sigma(c) and CVSR were found to also affect permanent deformation, which was more pronounced when PSR was coupled into the test. A five-parameter formulation that accounted for the effect of confining pressure, deviatoric stress, torsional shear stress, and number of loading cycles was subsequently established to analyze the permanent strain. The formulation coefficients were first determined and then used to explain the effects of stress variables on the permanent deformation. Validation studies were performed to address the adequacy of the formulation to predict permanent deformation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-3674	1208-6010		WOS:000355255400012		
J	Davies, B. E.								The UK geochemical environment and cardiovascular diseases: magnesium in food and water								ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH				37	3			411	427		10.1007/s10653-014-9671-y			JUN 2015	2015	Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) contribute approximately one-third to noncommunicable diseases in the UK. The central role of magnesium in CVDs (enzyme activity, cardiac signalling, etc.) is well established. Mortality and morbidity rates for CVDs may be inversely related to water hardness, suggesting a role for environmental magnesium. Published official and quasi-official data sources were evaluated to establish a model magnesium intake for a representative adult: standardised reference individual (SRI), standardised reference male (SRM) or standardised reference female (SRF). For typical dietary constituents, only tap water is probably locally derived and bottled water may not be. Fruits and vegetables are imported from many countries, while meat, dairy and cereal products represent a composite of UK source areas. Alcoholic beverages provide magnesium, there is doubt about its absorptive efficiency, and they are not locally derived. A simple model was devised to examine the effect of varying dietary contributions to total daily intake of magnesium. Omitting tap or bottled water, the combined intake, solid food plus alcoholic beverages, is 10.57 mmol Mg (84.5 % RNI) for the SRM and for the SRF, 8.10 mmol Mg (71.7 % RNI). Consumers drinking water derived from reservoirs or rivers, or supplementing it with the purest bottled water, improve their magnesium intake only slightly compared with water containing no magnesium. Choosing bottled water with high magnesium content when the public supply derives from rivers or reservoirs partially satisfies magnesium needs. Real improvement in SRI magnesium nutrition is seen only where water is hard. However, this conclusion cannot be validated until new measurement technologies for body magnesium become available.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0269-4042	1573-2983		WOS:000355317500001	25528218

The Health Belief Model (HBM) was used as a theoretical framework to explore beliefs, attitudes, socio-economic, and cultural factors influencing Hispanic women's decisions about cervical cancer screening. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Hispanic women 18-65 years old (n = 205) in the Upstate of South Carolina. Generalized Linear Modeling was used. Across all models, perceived threats (susceptibility and severity), self-efficacy, and the interaction of benefits and barriers were significant predictors. Significant covariates included age, marital status, income, regular medical care, and familism. A modified HBM was a useful model for examining cervical cancer screening in this sample of Hispanic women. The inclusion of external, or social factors increased the strength of the HBM as an explanatory model. The HBM can be used as a framework to design culturally appropriate cervical cancer screening interventions.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1557-1912	1557-1920		WOS:000355254500009

Understanding the decision of conservation easement granting								LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING				138		SI		11	19		10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.01.005			JUN 2015	2015	In the United States, the amount of land protected by conservation easements dramatically increased between 2000 and 2010. As this mechanism for private land conservation continues to draw the attention of scientists, professionals, and policy makers, more information is needed on the landowner motivations and the variables affecting the placement of conservation easements. We surveyed landowners in the Midwest who had placed conservation easements on their properties in order to explore how nine various motive-values and exogenous variables, such as land characteristics and demographics, affected the decision to place conservation easements. The results suggested that those receiving monetary benefits from their land indicated were less likely to adopt a conservation easement without the accompanying financial incentives and did not share the same level of environmental motives as those receiving predominantly non-monetary benefits. In addition, absentee landowners appear less affected by financial incentives than those with permanent residences on or adjacent to the protected properties. Overall, our findings demonstrate the variation in motive-values of those receiving monetary vs. non-monetary benefits from their land, as well as highlight the differences in absentee vs. permanent landowners.

Increased physical activity may be more protective for metabolic syndrome than reduced caloric intake. An analysis of estimated energy balance in US adults: 2007-2010 NHANES								NUTRITION METABOLISM AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES				25	6			535	540		10.1016/j.numecd.2015.03.006			JUN 2015	2015	Background and aim: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between physical activity (PA), caloric intake, and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) in a representative sample of the United States population.Methods and results: Data for 4327 adults from 2007 to 2010 NHANES were analyzed. MetS was defined using both ATPIII and AHA/NHLBI criteria. Weekly moderate and vigorous physical activity (PA) minutes from work, leisure-time, and transportation PA were used to estimate Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) from Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the Harris-Benedict equation. Average total calories (KCAL) from two 24-h dietary recalls were used to compare energy intake and expenditure between subjects with and without MetS. An alpha of 0.05 was used to determine statistical differences.The age adjusted prevalence of MetS was 21.9% (95% CI 20.1-23.6) and 36.8% (34.7-39.0) using ATPIII and AHA/NHLBI criteria, respectively. The estimated population mean for KCAL/TEE was 0.83 (95% CI 0.82-0.84), and the mean for KCAL/BMR was 1.25 (95% CI 1.23-1.27). Subjects without MetS (MetS-) reported 36 +/- 13 (ATPIII) and 45 +/- 18 (AHA/NHLBI) more daily moderate PA minutes than subjects with MetS (MetS+). At each level of PA, MetS- consumed more calories relative to BMR and TEE than MetS+. For both normal and overweight adults, KCAL/BMR was higher for MetS- than MetS+. For all BMI groups, there were no differences between MetS- and MetS+ with respect to KCAL/TEE. Though MetS+ adults in either MetS criteria were generally less physically active, MetS- adults maintained a higher caloric intake relative to estimated energy needs.Conclusions: These results suggest energy needs may be distorted in Metabolic Syndrome and increased physical activity may be more protective than reduced caloric intake.

Answers provide a platform where users can post questions and receive answers. These systems take advantage of the collective intelligence of users to find information. In this paper, we analyze the online social network (OSN) in Yahoo! Answers. Based on a large amount of our collected data, we studied the OSN's structural properties, which reveals strikingly distinct properties such as low link symmetry and weak correlation between indegree and outdegree. After studying the knowledge base and behaviors of the users, we find that a small number of top contributors answer most of the questions in the system. Also, each top contributor focuses only on a few knowledge categories. In addition, the knowledge categories of the users are highly clustered. We also study the knowledge base in a user's social network, which reveals that the members in a user's social network share only a few knowledge categories. Based on the findings, we provide guidance in the design of spammer detection algorithms and distributed Q&A systems. We also propose a friendship-knowledge oriented Q&A framework that synergistically combines current OSN-based Q&A and web Q&A. We believe that the results presented in this paper are crucial in understanding the collective intelligence in the web Q&A OSNs and lay a cornerstone for the evolution of next-generation Q&A systems.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0018-9340	1557-9956		WOS:000354414500017

Subsequently, the test measurements have been "replayed" using multiple sub-networks, which enabled the analysis of various scenarios beyond the tests. We present a particle filter algorithm that combines measurements from gamma counters across the network to detect radiation sources. Using replays from an outdoor test, we construct a border monitoring scenario that consists of twelve 2 in. x 2 in. NaI detectors or counters deployed on the periphery to monitor a 42 x 42 m(2) region. A Cs-137 source is moved across this region, starting several meters outside and finally moving away from it The measurements from individual, pairs and boundary detectors are replayed using the particle filter algorithm. The algorithm outputs demonstrate, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the benefits of networking all boundary counters: the source is detected meters before it enters the region, while being inside, and until moving several meters away. On the other hand, when counters are used individually or in pairs, the source is detected for much shorter durations, and sometimes not detected at all while inside the region.

Yet, these appointments are important because they have global implications, dealing with such basic issues as trade, diplomacy, war, and peace. We examine one type of foreign policy appointment, the ambassadorial appointments of Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.MethodsWe employ data provided by the U.S. Department of State and data collected from various sources on the background characteristics of their U.S. ambassadors.ResultsWe find that while both presidents promoted loyalty over competence in their ambassadorial appointments, they did so in different ways. The first President Bush used a personal friends and neighbors approach, while Clinton rewarded former campaign officials. Though it generally is assumed that presidents reward key contributors from their presidential campaign with key assignments, we find that Clinton was more likely than Bush to reward contributors with appointments to choice countries. Finally, we demonstrate that women and minorities received appointments of lesser quality during the Bush administration.ConclusionsThe determinants of ambassadorial appointments are more complex than previously assumed. While presidents appoint ambassadors on the basis of campaign contributions, they do not reward them equally with plum assignments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-4941	1540-6237		WOS:000354744800013

It now persists in two geographically isolated mountainous regions, with an 800 km disjunction. Using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II DNA sequences from museum and field-sampled specimens, we found greater mtDNA diversity and more widespread differentiation among eastern populations than western ones. In addition, using coalescent-based population divergence models we dated the earliest splitting of eastern and western populations at least 20,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum. Therefore, the recent range collapse across the center of the historical species distribution may have exacerbated an ancient genetic differentiation between eastern and western populations. Finally, the loss of lowland haplotypes and the relatively large variation among local populations suggests that dispersal is low and lowland populations did not move to higher elevations, perhaps in response to climate change but, rather, appear to have vanished. Our results highlight the value of incorporating genetic data from preserved specimens when investigating the phylogeographic history and conservation status of a threatened species.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1566-0621	1572-9737		WOS:000354375500017		
J	Shen, Haiying; Liu, Guoxin; Ward, Lee								A Proximity-Aware Interest-Clustered P2P File Sharing System								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				26	6			1509	1523		10.1109/TPDS.2014.2327033			JUN 2015	2015	Efficient file query is important to the overall performance of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems. Clustering peers by their common interests can significantly enhance the efficiency of file query. Clustering peers by their physical proximity can also improve file query performance. However, few current works are able to cluster peers based on both peer interest and physical proximity. Although structured P2Ps provide higher file query efficiency than unstructured P2Ps, it is difficult to realize it due to their strictly defined topologies. In this work, we introduce a Proximity-Aware and Interest-clustered P2P file sharing System (PAIS) based on a structured P2P, which forms physically-close nodes into a cluster and further groups physically-close and common-interest nodes into a sub-cluster based on a hierarchical topology. PAIS uses an intelligent file replication algorithm to further enhance file query efficiency. It creates replicas of files that are frequently requested by a group of physically close nodes in their location. Moreover, PAIS enhances the intra-sub-cluster file searching through several approaches. First, it further classifies the interest of a sub-cluster to a number of sub-interests, and clusters common-sub-interest nodes into a group for file sharing. Second, PAIS builds an overlay for each group that connects lower capacity nodes to higher capacity nodes for distributed file querying while avoiding node overload. Third, to reduce file searching delay, PAIS uses proactive file information collection so that a file requester can know if its requested file is in its nearby nodes. Fourth, to reduce the overhead of the file information collection, PAIS uses bloom filter based file information collection and corresponding distributed file searching. Fifth, to improve the file sharing efficiency, PAIS ranks the bloom filter results in order. Sixth, considering that a recently visited file tends to be visited again, the bloom filter based approach is enhanced by only checking the newly added bloom filter information to reduce file searching delay. Trace-driven experimental results from the real-world PlanetLab testbed demonstrate that PAIS dramatically reduces overhead and enhances the efficiency of file sharing with and without churn. Further, the experimental results show the high effectiveness of the intra-sub-cluster file searching approaches in improving file searching efficiency.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000354526000002		
J	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying; Yan, Li								Multicent: A Multifunctional Incentive Scheme Adaptive to Diverse Performance Objectives for DTN Routing								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				26	6			1643	1653		10.1109/TPDS.2014.2323057			JUN 2015	2015	In Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), nodes meet opportunistically and exchange packets only when they meet with each other. Therefore, routing is usually conducted in a store-carry-forward manner to exploit the scarce communication opportunities. As a result, different packet routing strategies, i.e., which packet to be forwarded or stored with priority, can lead to different routing performance objectives, such as minimal average delay and maximal hit rate. On the other hand, incentive systems are necessary for DTNs since nodes may be selfish and may not be cooperative on packet forwarding/storage. However, current incentive systems for DTNs mainly focus on encouraging nodes to participate in packet forwarding/storage but fail to further encourage nodes to follow a certain packet routing strategy to realize a routing performance objective. We name the former as the first aspect of cooperation and the latter as the second aspect of cooperation in DTN routing. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the routing strategy that can realize different performance objectives when nodes are fully cooperative, i.e., are willing to follow both aspects of cooperation. We then propose Multicent, a game theoretical incentive scheme that can encourage nodes to follow the two aspects of cooperation even when they are selfish. Basically, Multicent assigns credits for packet forwarding/storage in proportional to the priorities specified in the routing strategy. Multicent also supports adjustable Quality of Service (QoS) for packet routing between specific sources and destinations. Extensive trace-driven experimental results verify the effectiveness of Multicent.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000354526000013

Variables in the program included confinement reinforcement configuration, presence/lack of steel bearing plate, strand shielding pattern, and strand layout. Specimen behavior and capacity were found to be significantly affected by end region detailing, especially placement of fully bonded strands. Experimental results were compared with theoretical models for web-shear, bond-shear, and lateral-splitting capacity. By considering multiple models, calculations were able to accurately identify the failure mode of each test specimen.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1084-0702	1943-5592		WOS:000354542600003

Drivers' judgments of the effect of headlight glare on their ability to see pedestrians at night								JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH				53				31	37		10.1016/j.jsr.2015.03.001			JUN 2015	2015	Introduction: Several studies have concluded that pedestrians typically overestimate their own conspicuity to approaching drivers at night. The present experiments extended this research by exploring the accuracy of drivers' judgments of pedestrian conspicuity while facing varying degrees of headlight glare. Method: In Experiment 1, participants on an open road estimated their ability to see a roadside pedestrian in each of two clothing configurations and with each of three different glare intensities present. In Experiment 2, participants responded to a roadside pedestrian under the same open road conditions; the participants were naive with regard to both the position of the pedestrian and to the clothing and glare manipulations. Results: Consistent with earlier research, estimates of response distance were, on the average, over three times greater than actual recognition distance. The extent to which participants overestimated conspicuity was greater when the pedestrian wore a retroreflective vest, and participants incorrectly judged that headlight glare would not degrade drivers' ability to see a pedestrian wearing a retroreflective vest. Conclusions and Practical Applications: These results confirm that road users' understanding of issues involving drivers' night vision is limited. These misunderstandings may result in road users behaving in ways that increase the risk of nighttime collisions with pedestrians. (C) 2015 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bibo, Amin; Abdelkefi, Abdessattar; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Modeling and Characterization of a Piezoelectric Energy Harvester Under Combined Aerodynamic and Base Excitations								JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				137	3					031017	10.1115/1.4029611			JUN 2015	2015	This paper develops and validates an aero-electromechanical model which captures the nonlinear response behavior of a piezoelectric cantilever-type energy harvester under combined galloping and base excitations. The harvester consists of a thin piezoelectric cantilever beam clamped at one end and rigidly attached to a bluff body at the other end. In addition to the vibratory base excitations, the beam is also subjected to aerodynamic forces resulting from the separation of the incoming airflow on both sides of the bluff body which gives rise to limit-cycle oscillations when the airflow velocity exceeds a critical value. A nonlinear electromechanical distributed-parameter model of the harvester under the combined excitations is derived using the energy approach and by adopting the nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, linear constitutive relations for the piezoelectric transduction, and the quasi-steady assumption for the aerodynamic loading. The resulting partial differential equations of motion are discretized and a reduced-order model is obtained. The mathematical model is validated by conducting a series of experiments at different wind speeds and base excitation amplitudes for excitation frequencies around the primary resonance of the harvester. Results from the model and experiment are presented to characterize the response behavior under the combined loading.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1048-9002	1528-8927		WOS:000354038400017

The 24-month intervention addressed safety and access for physical activity (PA) and utilized social marketing to enhance environmental supports for PA. African-Americans (N = 434; 62 % females; aged 51 +/- 16 years) provided accelerometry and psychosocial measures at baseline and 12, 18, and 24 months. Walking attendance and trail use were obtained over 24 months.There were no significant differences across communities over 24 months for moderate-to-vigorous PA. Walking attendance in the social marketing community showed an increase from 40 to 400 walkers per month at 9 months and sustained similar to 200 walkers per month through 24 months. No change in attendance was observed in the walking-only community.Findings support integrating social marketing strategies to increase walking in underserved African-Americans (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01025726).									4	0	0	3	0	4			0883-6612	1532-4796		WOS:000354206300012	25385203

CLINICAL OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY				58	2			380	391					JUN 2015	2015	Group prenatal care is an emerging trend in obstetrics, and for medically low-risk women has been shown to result in lower rates of preterm birth, higher rates of breastfeeding, and higher rates of participation in postpartum family planning. Significant cost savings to the health care system are seen when the lower rates of preterm birth and neonatal intensive care unit admissions are considered. More research is needed about patients' health outcomes as well as the economic and workforce implications to outpatient obstetric practices before widely transitioning prenatal care into group settings.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0009-9201	1532-5520		WOS:000353971800019	25775438

High-Performance Three-Stage Cascade Thermoelectric Devices with 20% Efficiency								JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS				44	6			1936	1942		10.1007/s11664-014-3600-9			JUN 2015	2015	The use of advanced materials has resulted in a significant improvement in thermoelectric device conversion efficiency. Three-stage cascade devices were assembled, consisting of nano-bulk Bi2Te3-based materials on the cold side, PbTe and enhanced TAGS-85 [(AgSbTe2)(15)(GeTe)(85)] for the mid-stage, and half-Heusler alloys for the high-temperature top stage. In addition, an area aspect ratio optimization process was applied in order to account for asymmetric thermal transport down the individual n- and p-legs. The n- and p-type chalcogenide alloy materials were prepared by high-energy mechanical ball-milling and/or cryogenic ball-milling of elementary powders, with subsequent consolidation by high-pressure uniaxial hot-pressing. The low-temperature stage materials, nano-bulk Bi2Te3-x Sb (x) and Bi2Te3-x Se (x) , exhibit a unique mixture of nanoscale features that leads to an enhanced Seebeck coefficient and reduced lattice thermal conductivity, thereby achieving an average ZT of similar to 1.26 and similar to 1.7 in the 27A degrees C to 100A degrees C range for the n-type and p-type materials, respectively. Also, the addition of small amounts of selected rare earth elements has been shown to improve the ZT of TAGS-85 by 25%, compared with conventional or neat TAGS-85, resulting in a ZT = 1.5 at 400A degrees C. The incorporation of these improved materials resulted in a peak device conversion efficiency of similar to 20% at a temperature difference of 750A degrees C when corrected for radiation heat losses and thermal conduction losses through the lead wires. These high-efficiency results were shown to be reproducible across multiple cascade devices.

Dual Residual for Centralized Augmented Lagrangian Coordination Based on Optimality Conditions								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				137	6					061401	10.1115/1.4029788			JUN 2015	2015	Centralized augmented Lagrangian coordination (ALC) has drawn much attention due to its parallel computation capability, efficiency, and flexibility. The initial setting and update strategy of the penalty weights in this method are critical to its performance. The traditional weight update strategy always increases the weights and research shows that inappropriate initial weights may cause optimization failure. Making use of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions for the all-in-one (AIO) and decomposed problems, the terms "primal residual" and "dual residual" are introduced into the centralized ALC, and a new update strategy considering both residuals and thus guaranteeing the unmet optimality condition in the traditional update is introduced. Numerical tests show a decrease in the iteration number and significant improvements in solution accuracy with both calculated and fine-tuned initial weights using the new update. Additionally, the proposed approach is capable to start from a wide range of possible weights and achieve optimality, and therefore brings robustness to the centralized ALC.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1050-0472			WOS:000353918100001

To understand the linkage between traditional macro-elemental and morphological traits of roots and their molecular-level carbon chemistry, we analyzed seasonal variations in monomeric yields of the free, bound, and lignin phenols in fine roots (distal five orders) and leaves of Ardisia quinquegona. Fine roots contained two-fold higher concentrations of bound phenols and three-fold higher concentrations of lignin phenols than leaves. Within fine roots, the concentrations of free and bound phenols decreased with increasing root order, and seasonal variation in the phenolic profile was more evident in lower order than in higher order roots. The morphological and macro-elemental root traits were decoupled from the quantity, composition and tissue association of phenolic compounds, revealing the potential inability of these traditional parameters to capture the molecular identity of phenolic carbon within the fine-root architecture and between fine roots and leaves. Our results highlight the molecular-level heterogeneity in phenolic carbon composition within the fine-root architecture, and imply that traits that capture the molecular identity of the root construct might better predict the decomposition dynamics within fine-root orders.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000354257400010	25858344

Conjugated polymers with regularly spaced m-phenylene units and post-polymerization modification to yield stimuli-responsive materials								POLYMER INTERNATIONAL				64	6			730	739		10.1002/pi.4877			JUN 2015	2015	Two -conjugated polymers featuring main-chain m-phenylene linkers as well as iodo substituents were initially prepared. The presence of the iodo functionality allowed for the preparation of six additional polymers from the initial two iodo-substituted polymers via facile post-polymerization modification using Sonogashira-type coupling chemistry. The post-polymerization modification led to crosslinking, to the incorporation of a pyridyl-bearing functionality for potential use as a ligand for transition metals or to the introduction of a ferrocenyl substituent as a possible redox-active unit. The m-phenylene units were incorporated into the polymer main-chain structure in order to periodically disrupt conjugation, thereby allowing for more uniformity in the effective conjugation length and thus in absorption and emission profiles. The thermal stability and photophysical properties of all eight polymers, as well as the stimuli-responsiveness of relevant materials to nitroaromatics and metal ions, are reported.

Using minimum driving information, such as the total trip length and the average cycle speed, the proposed algorithm relies on adaptation of the control parameter from state of charge feedback. The proposed strategy is referred in the paper to as Adaptive-PMP (A-PMP). The new controller is applied to a detailed forward vehicle simulator of the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt manufactured by General Motors, where an experimentally validated LG Chem battery model is used. The strategy we propose aims at achieving a blended trajectory of the state of charge to minimize the consumed fuel, resulting in an overall better performance than the actual Charge Depleting/Charge Sustaining (CD/CS) strategy currently used on-board of the vehicle. A comparative analysis of three strategies, i.e., the optimal one (PMP), the proposed one (A-PMP) and the in-vehicle one (CD/CS), is conducted in simulation which shows that improvement above 20% in fuel consumption may be achieved when the proposed algorithm is used instead of the current on-board strategy.

The modes were detected when the extinction spectra of the nanostructures were studied as a function of the incident angle and polarization of the incident light. Two previously known surface plasmon collective modes, namely T and P, associated with particle dipoles parallel and perpendicular to plane of the layer were identified for the polymer films containing one, two, and three monolayers of the particles. The extinction bands of T and P modes exhibited different intensity and frequency dependences on the angle of incidence. More pronounced angular dependences for P mode band indicated the stronger coupling of dipoles for P mode than for T one. A new N mode was observed for the structures consisting of three nanoparticle layers. This mode originated from surface plasmon coupling between adjacent layers. The additional mode significantly increases amount of information that can be obtained from optical response of the nanostructures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1557-1955	1557-1963		WOS:000353827400020

Moreover, the erosion wear mechanism of 5YSZ ceramics at different temperatures was discussed. The solid particle impact erosion wear rate of 5YSZ ceramics was increased from 0.10 mm(3)/g to 0.81 mm(3)/g when the temperature rose from room temperature to 1200 degrees C, and then decreased to 0.64 mm(3)/g at 1400 degrees C. The plastic deformation erosion mechanism of 5YSZ ceramics was observed from room temperature to 1400 degrees C, and the erosion wear mechanism of cracking in irregular crisscross patterns lead to the stepwise heightened flaky exfoliation of the material from 600 degrees C to 1200 degrees C, which became the main erosion wear mechanism. These results provide the theoretical base for extension of service life of 5YSZ ceramics by avoiding the conditions that lead to erosion wear mechanisms.

Journal of safety research				53				31	7		10.1016/j.jsr.2015.03.001			2015-Jun	2015	INTRODUCTION: Several studies have concluded that pedestrians typically overestimate their own conspicuity to approaching drivers at night. The present experiments extended this research by exploring the accuracy of drivers' judgments of pedestrian conspicuity while facing varying degrees of headlight glare.METHOD: In Experiment 1, participants on an open road estimated their ability to see a roadside pedestrian in each of two clothing configurations and with each of three different glare intensities present. In Experiment 2, participants responded to a roadside pedestrian under the same open road conditions; the participants were naive with regard to both the position of the pedestrian and to the clothing and glare manipulations.RESULTS: Consistent with earlier research, estimates of response distance were, on the average, over three times greater than actual recognition distance. The extent to which participants overestimated conspicuity was greater when the pedestrian wore a retroreflective vest, and participants incorrectly judged that headlight glare would not degrade drivers' ability to see a pedestrian wearing a retroreflective vest.CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: These results confirm that road users' understanding of issues involving drivers' night vision is limited. These misunderstandings may result in road users behaving in ways that increase the risk of nighttime collisions with pedestrians.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1879-1247		MEDLINE:25933995	25933995	
J	Sengupta, Namrata; Litoff, Elizabeth J.; Baldwin, William S.								The HR96 activator, atrazine, reduces sensitivity of D-magna to triclosan and DHA								CHEMOSPHERE				128				299	306		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.02.027			JUN 2015	2015	HR96 is a CAR/PXR/VDR ortholog in invertebrates, and a promiscuous endo- and xenobiotic nuclear receptor involved in acclimation to toxicants. Daphnia HR96 is activated by chemicals such as atrazine and linoleic acid (LA) (n-6 fatty acid), and inhibited by triclosan and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (n-3 fatty acid). We hypothesized that inhibitors of HR96 may block the protective responses of HR96 based on previously performed luciferase assays. Therefore, we performed acute toxicity tests with two-chemical mixtures containing a HR96 inhibitor (DHA or triclosan) and a HR96 activator (LA or atrazine). Surprisingly, results demonstrate that triclosan and DHA are less toxic when co-treated with 20-80 mu M atrazine. Atrazine provides concentration-dependent protection as lower concentrations have no effect and higher concentrations cause toxicity. LA, a weaker HR96 activator, did not provide protection from triclosan or DHA. Atrazine's protective effects are presumably due to its ability to activate HR96 or other toxicologically relevant transcription factors and induce protective enzymes. Atrazine did not significantly induce glucosyltransferase, a crucial enzyme in triclosan detoxification. However, atrazine did increase antioxidant activities, crucial pathways in triclosan's toxicity, as measured through GST activity and the TROLOX equivalence assay. The increase in antioxidant capacity is consistent with atrazine providing protection from a wide range of toxicants that induce ROS, including triclosan and unsaturated fatty acids predisposed to lipid peroxidation.

However, the performance of single mammal species in terms of (1) their strength, (2) spatial and (3) temporal variability for predicting large mammal species richness has rarely been assessed. Drawing upon data from multiple vehicle-based surveys in four study sites with varying conservation management approaches in the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem, we assessed the performance of thirteen candidate indicator species. Overall, we found that the association strength between the distribution of single large mammal species and overall large mammal species richness varied (1) considerably across four management units within the same ecosystem, (2) between seasons and (3) years. In contrast to a study carried out in central Tanzania, elephants performed poorly as an indicator of large mammal species richness. Applying our findings to conservation planning, we suggest that information on zebra and wildebeest distribution should be used for delineating corridors for large mammals between protected areas in this ecosystem. The distribution of these two species had a high correlation with overall large mammal species richness, and these correlations were relatively constant throughout time and space. More generally, our study suggests that the performance of indicator species (1) should be assessed across multiple seasons because snapshot surveys may provide biased estimates of indicator performance, (2), cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other ecosystems and (3) should be supplemented by ecological or functional considerations.

SmartParks refer to parking lots for charging/discharging PEVs. The objective of the SPP is to cooperate with the local distribution company (DISCO) in order to improve system reliability, and also to participate in energy market transactions considering several economic and technical aspects over a definite planning horizon. Herein, the behavior of PEVs fleet is modeled from the aggregator's viewpoint. In addition, the percentage of PEVs' owners participating in SmartPark programs based on the amount of charging cost discount (as an incentive) is modeled and then the optimal value of the discount is investigated. Furthermore, in order to be realistic, time-varying load and realistic customers' load type are applied in the system load modeling, and load model-based power flow is performed rather than a simplified power flow. Results obtained illustrates that optimal SPP and smart decision-making on the incentive value can remarkably raise the aggregator's profit and improve the system reliability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The feasibility of using near infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy (800-2500 nm) and multispectral imaging (MSI) system (405-970 nm) for prediction of total polyphenols contents (TPC) of Iron Buddha tea was investigated in this study. The results revealed that the predictive model by MSI using partial least squares (PLS) analysis for tea leaves was considered to be the best in non-destructive and rapid determination of TPC. Besides, the ability of MSI to classify tea leaves based on storage period (year of 2004, 2007, 2011, 2012 and 2013) was tested and the classification accuracies of 95.0% and 97.5% were achieved using LS-SVM and BPNN models, respectively. These overall results suggested that MSI together with suitable analysis model is a promising technology for rapid and non-destructive determination of TPC and classification of storage periods in tea leaves.

We suggest that conspecificity can be concluded in these cases when data from four character sets-chromosomal, ecological, molecular, and morphological-express variation no greater between the allopatric populations than between corresponding sympatric populations. We use this approach to test the conspecificity of Simulium nodosum Puri on the mainland of Southeast Asia and Simulium shirakii Kono & Takahasi in Taiwan. The validity of these two putative species has long been disputed given that they are morphologically indistinguishable.Findings: The mitochondria-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), 12S rRNA, and 16S rRNA genes and the nuclear-encoded 28S rRNA gene support the conspecific status of S. nodosum from Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam and S. shirakii from Taiwan; 0 to 0.19 % genetic differences between the two taxa suggest intraspecific polymorphism. The banding patterns of the polytene chromosomes of the insular Taiwanese population of S. shirakii and mainland populations of S. nodosum are congruent. The overlapping ranges of habitat characteristics and hosts of S. nodosum and S. shirakii corroborate the chromosomal, molecular, and morphological data.Conclusions: Four independent sources of evidence (chromosomes, DNA, ecology, and morphology) support the conspecificity of S. nodosum and S. shirakii. We, therefore, synonymize S. shirakii with S. nodosum. This study provides a guide for applying the procedure of testing conspecificity to other sets of allopatric vectors.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1756-3305			WOS:000355408600001	26022092

For sweet cherry, linkage maps have been constructed using mainly microsatellite markers (SSRs) and, recently, using single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs) from a cherry 6K SNP array. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), a new methodology based on high-throughput sequencing, holds great promise for identification of high number of SNPs and construction of high density linkage maps. In this study, GBS was used to identify SNPs from an intra-specific sweet cherry cross. A total of 8,476 high quality SNPs were selected for mapping. The physical position for each SNP was determined using the peach genome, Peach v1.0, as reference, and a homogeneous distribution of markers along the eight peach scaffolds was obtained. On average, 65.6% of the SNPs were present in genic regions and 49.8% were located in exonic regions. In addition to the SNPs, a group of SSRs was also used for construction of linkage maps. Parental and consensus high density maps were constructed by genotyping 166 siblings from a 'Rainier' x 'Rivedel' (Ra x Ri) cross. Using Ra x Ri population, 462, 489 and 985 markers were mapped into eight linkage groups in 'Rainier', 'Rivedel' and the Ra x Ri map, respectively, with 80% of mapped SNPs located in genic regions. Obtained maps spanned 549.5, 582.6 and 731.3 cM for 'Rainier', 'Rivedel' and consensus maps, respectively, with an average distance of 1.2 cM between adjacent markers for both 'Rainier' and 'Rivedel' maps and of 0.7 cM for Ra x Ri map. High synteny and co-linearity was observed between obtained maps and with Peach v1.0. These new high density linkage maps provide valuable information on the sweet cherry genome, and serve as the basis for identification of QTLs and genes relevant for the breeding of the species.									11	0	0	10	1	11			1932-6203			WOS:000355183900138	26011256	
J	Matsebatlela, Thabe M.; Anderson, Amy L.; Gallicchio, Vincent S.; Elford, Howard; Rice, Charles D.								3,4-Dihydroxy-benzohydroxamic acid (Didox) suppresses pro-inflammatory profiles and oxidative stress in TLR4-activated RAW264.7 murine macrophages								CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS				233				95	105		10.1016/j.cbi.2015.03.027			MAY 25 2015	2015	Didox (3,4-dihydroxy-benzohydroxamic acid), is a synthetic ribonucleotide reductase (RR) inhibitor derived from polyhydroxy-substituted benzohydroxamic acid, and originally developed as an anti-cancer agent. Some studies indicate that didox may have anti-oxidative stress-like properties, while other studies hint that didox may have anti-inflammatory properties. Using nitric oxide production in response to LPS treatment as a sensitive screening assay for anti-inflammatory compounds, we show that didox is very potent at levels as low as 6.25 mu M, with maximal inhibition at 100 mu M. A qRT-PCR array was then employed to screen didox for other potential anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress-related properties. Didox was very potent in suppressing the expression of these arrayed mRNA in response to LPS, and in some cases didox alone suppressed expression. Using qRT-PCR as a follow up to the array, we demonstrated that didox suppresses LPS-induced mRNA levels of iNOS, IL-6, IL-I, TNF-alpha, NF-kappa beta (p65), and P38-alpha, after 24 h of treatment. Treatment with didox also suppresses the secretion of nitric oxide, 1L-6, and IL-10. Furthermore, oxidative stress, as quantified by intracellular ROS levels in response to macrophage activators LPS and phorbol ester (PMA), and the glutathione depleting agent BSO, is reduced by treatment with didox. Moreover, we demonstrate that nuclear translocation of NF-kappa beta (p65) in response to LPS is inhibited by didox. These findings were supported by qRT-PCR for oxidative stress genes SOD1 and catalase. Overall, this study supports the conclusion that didox may have a future role in managing acute and chronic inflammatory diseases and oxidative stress due to high production of ROS.

Comparison of the UVOT grism spectra of SN 2014J with Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN2011fe or UVOT grism spectra of SN 2012fr are consistent with an extinction law with a low value of R-V similar to 1.4. The high reddening causes the detected photon distribution in the broadband UV filters to have a much longer effective wavelength than for an unreddened SN. The light curve evolution is consistent with this shift and does not show a flattening due to photons being scattered back into the line of sight (LOS). The light curve shapes and color evolution are inconsistent with a contribution scattered into the LOS by circumstellar dust. We conclude that most or all of the high reddening must come from interstellar dust. We show that even for a single dust composition, there is not a unique reddening law caused by circumstellar scattering. Rather, when considering scattering from a time-variable source, we confirm earlier studies that the reddening law is a function of the dust geometry, column density, and epoch. We also show how an assumed geometry of dust as a foreground sheet in mixed stellar/dust systems will lead to a higher inferred RV. Rather than assuming the dust around SNe is peculiar, SNe may be useful probes of the interstellar reddening laws in other galaxies.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000354991300074

DETECTION OF A LIGHT ECHO FROM THE OTHERWISE NORMAL SN 2007af								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				805	1					71	10.1088/0004-637X/805/1/71			MAY 20 2015	2015	We present the discovery of a light echo from SN 2007af, a normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 5584. Hubble Space Telescope images taken three years post explosion reveal two separate echoes: an outer echo and an extended central region, which we propose to be an inner echo for which details are unresolved. Multiple images were obtained in the F160W, F350LP, F555W, and F814W using the Wide Field Camera 3. If the outer echo is produced by an interstellar dust sheet perpendicular to the line of sight, it is located similar to 800 pc in front of the SN. The dust for the inner echo is 0.45 pc < d < 90 pc away from the SN. The inner echo color is consistent with typical interstellar dust wavelength-dependent scattering cross-sections, while the outer echo is redder than predicted. Both dust sheets, if in the foreground, are optically thin for scattering, and the outer echo sheet thickness is consistent with the inferred extinction from peak brightness. Whether the inner echo is from interstellar or circumstellar dust is ambiguous. Overall, the echo characteristics are quite similar to previously observed SN Ia echoes.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000354991300071

Will selenium increase lentil (Lens culinaris Medik) yield and seed quality?								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				6						356	10.3389/fpls.2015.00356			MAY 19 2015	2015	Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik), a nutritious traditional pulse crop, has been experiencing a declining area of production in South East Asia, due to lower yields, and marginal soils. The objective of this study was to determine whether selenium (Se) fertilization can increase lentil yield, productivity, and seed quality (both seed Se concentration and speciation). Selenium was provided to five lentil accessions as selenate or selenite by foliar or soil application at rates of 0, 10, 20, or 30 kg Se/ha and the resulting lentil biomass, grain yield, seed Se concentration, and Se speciation was determined. Seed Se concentration was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) after acid digestion. Seed Se speciation was measured using ICP-mass spectrometry with a high performance liquid chromatography (ICP-MS-LC) system. Foliar application of Se significantly increased lentil biomass (5586 vs. 7361 kg/ha), grain yield (1732 vs. 2468 kg/ha), and seed Se concentrations (0.8 vs. 2.4 mu g/g) compared to soil application. In general, both application methods and both forms of Se increased concentrations of organic Se forms (selenocysteine and selenomethionine) in lentil seeds. Not surprisingly, the high yielding CDC Redberry had the highest levels of biomass and grain yield of all varieties evaluated. Eston, ILL505, and CDC Robin had the greatest responses to Se fertilization with respect to both grain yield, seed Se concentration and speciation; thus, use of these varieties in areas with low-Se soils might require Se fertilization to reach yield potentials.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1664-462X			WOS:000356961500001	26042141

The effects of Wildfire on drinking water quality are not well understood, especially in terms of terrestrial dissolved organic Matter (DOM) and DOM-associated formation of disinfection by-products (DBP). As the forest floor layer is a major source of terrestrial DOM, We investigated characteristics and DBP formation of water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from the 0-5 cm depth of nonburned detritus (control) and burned detritus with black ash (moderate severity) and white ash (high severity) associated with the 2013 Rim Fire in California. Spectroscopic results suggested that the aromaticity of WEOM followed white ash > control > black: ash and fluorescence region II (excitation 220-250 nm; emission 330-380 nm) of the emission-excitation-matrix was identified as a potential burn severity indicator. Compared to the control, WEOM from white and black ashes had lower reactivity in forming trihalomethanes (55%-of-control) and haloacetic acids (67%-of-control), but higher reactivity in forming the more carcinogenic haloacetonitrile after chlorination (244%-of-control) and N-nitrosodimethylamine after chloramination (229%-of-control). There was no change in reactivity for chloral hydrate formation, while WEOM from black ash showed a higher reactivity for haloketone formation (150%-of-control): Because wildfire consumed a large portion of organic matter from the detritus layer, there Was lower water extractable organic carbon (27%-of-control) and organic nitrogen (19%-of-control) yields in ashes. Consequently, the wildfire caused an overall reduction in water extractable terrestrial DBP precursor yield from detritus materials.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000355058300011	25894116

The fiber possesses all-solid microstructures embedded in the cladding and a core composed of phosphosilicate with a diameter of similar to 50 mu m. As the signal power is pushed beyond 450 W, there is degradation in the beam quality due to the modal instability. We briefly discuss techniques to alleviate this problem in future designs. To the best of our knowledge, the 400-W single-frequency near diffraction-limited output far exceeds the current state-of-the-art from such type of fiber amplifier.

The results demonstrated a sensitivity of -1.32 GHz/degrees C and a detection resolution of <0.0017 degrees C.

The feasibility of interrogating THz FBGs using narrow interrogation bandwidths was also experimentally shown.									9	1	0	0	0	10			1041-1135	1941-0174		WOS:000353894000013

Peptide conjugated chitosan foam as a novel approach for capture-purification and rapid detection of hapten - Example of ochratoxin A								BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS				67		SI		634	641		10.1016/j.bios.2014.09.084			MAY 15 2015	2015	A novel bioassay for the detection and monitoring of Ochratoxin A (OTA), a natural carcinogenic mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium fungi, has been developed and applied for the screening of red wine. Here we report the immobilization and orientation of NOF4, a synthetic peptide, onto 3-D porous chitosan supports using a N-terminal histidine tag to allow binding to M++ ions that were previously adsorbed onto the high surface area biopolymer. Three divalent cations (M++ = Zn++, Co++, Ni++) were evaluated and were found to adsorb via a Langmuir model and to have binding capacities in the order Zn++ > Co++ > Ni++. Following Zn++ saturation and washing, C-terminus vs. the N-terminus His-tagged NOF4 was evaluated. At 1000 mu g L-1 OTA the N-terminus immobilization was more efficient (2.5 times) in the capture of OTA. HRP labeled OTA was added to the antigen solutions (standards or samples) and together competitively incubated on biospecific chitosan foam. The chemiluminescence substrate luminol was then added and after 5 min of enzymatic reaction, light emission signals (lambda(max)=425 nm) were analyzed. Calibration curves of %B/B-0 vs. OTA concentration in PBS showed that half-inhibition occurred at 1.17 mu g L-1, allowing a range of discrimination of 0.25 and 25 mu g L-1. In red wine, the minimum concentration of OTA that the system can detect was 0.5 mu g L-1 and could detect up to 5 mu g L-1. Assay validation was performed against immunoaffinity column (IAC) tandem reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) and provided quite good agreement. The association of chitosan foam and specific peptide represents a new approach with potential for both purification-concentration and detection of small molecules. In the future this assay will be implemented in a solid-sate bioelectronic format. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The amino acid composition of peptides was also analyzed by amino acid analyzer on the basis of ninhydrin reaction. Three novel peptides with molecular weights of 628.64 Da, 630.71 Da, and 684.1 Da were identified as Asp-His-Thr-Lys-Glu (DHTKE), Phe-Phe-Glu-Phe-His (FFGFN) and Met-Pro-Asp-Ala-His-Leu (MPDAHL), respectively. DHTKE exhibited the best oxygen radical absorbance capacity (P< 0.05). The concentration of FFGFN and MPDAHL to scavenge 50% of DPPH radicals was 80 mM and 60 mM, respectively. Thus, the three peptides may have potential applications as a functional food, which could also be used as nutraceutical compounds. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we look at incident kinetic energy and potential energy effects in the low keV regime for alkali ions (Na+) and multicharged ions (MCIs) of ArQ+ (Q = 1, 4, 8, and 11) incident on the as-grown layers of SiO2 on Si. With the irradiated oxide encapsulated under Al top contacts, we record an electronic signature of the incident ionic radiation through capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Both kinetic and potential energy depositions give rise to shifted C-V signatures that can be directly related to internal electron-hole pair excitations. The MCI data reveal an apparent power law dependence on charge state, which is at odds with some prior thin foil studies obtained at higher incident energies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000355283500020

Interactions between sleep habits and self-control								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				9						284	10.3389/fnhum.2015.00284			MAY 11 2015	2015	Good sleep habits and effective self-control are important components of successful functioning. Unfortunately chronic sleep loss and impaired self-control are common occurrences for many individuals which can lead to difficulty with daily self-control issues such as resisting impulses and maintaining attentive behavior. Understanding how self-control is depleted and how good sleep habits may help replenish and maintain the capacity for self-control is an important issue. A sleep-deprived individual who has expended the necessary resources for self-control is at an increased risk for succumbing to impulsive desires, poor attentional capacity, and compromised decision making. To date, few studies have investigated how sleep and self-control are inter-related. The goal of this mini-review is to explore the intersection between sleep habits and self-control and encourage researchers to focus on a new area of research that integrates what are at present largely separate areas in psychology and human neurosciences.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1662-5161			WOS:000356013600001	26029094

The 40 new half-lives follow robust systematics and highlight the persistence of shell effects. The new data have direct implications for r-process calculations and reinforce the notion that the second (A approximate to 130) and the rare-earth-element (A approximate to 160) abundance peaks may result from the freeze-out of an (n, gamma) reversible arrow (gamma, n) equilibrium. In such an equilibrium, the new half-lives are important factors determining the abundance of rare-earth elements, and allow for a more reliable discussion of the r process universality. It is anticipated that universality may not extend to the elements Sn, Sb, I, and Cs, making the detection of these elements in metal-poor stars of the utmost importance to determine the exact conditions of individual r-process events.									37	2	0	1	0	39			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000354347300001	26024165

Rather than employing chemical modification to alter device behavior, we achieved control of conductance directly by electrically biasing the gold portion of the nanopore. By stepping through a range of bias potentials under a constant trans-pore electric field, we observed a gating phenomenon in the trans-pore current response in a variety of solutions including potassium chloride (KCl), sodium chloride (NaCl), and potassium iodide (KI). A computational model with a conical nanopore was developed to examine the effect of the Gouy-Chapman-Stern electrical double layer along with nanopore geometry, work function potentials, and applied electrical bias on the ionic current. The numerical results indicated that the observed modulation and gating behavior was due to dynamic reorganization of the electrical double layer in response to changes in the electrical bias. Specifically, in the conducting state, the nanopore conductance (both numerical and experimental) is linearly proportional to the applied bias due to accumulation of charge in the diffuse layer. The gating effect occurs due to the asymmetric charge distribution in the fluid induced by the distribution of potentials at the nanopore surface. Time dependent changes in current due to restructuring of the electrical double layer occur when the electrostatic bias is instantaneously changed.

Measurements are reported of the electromagnetic emission during the pulsing current using the state-of-the-art Tektronix MDO4104B-6 to obtain voltage vs time and simultaneously radio frequency (rf) emission in selected power vs frequency regions. The results show strong rf emission over the selected frequency region 0-160 kHz during pulsing and nearly an order of magnitude decrease of power during pulsing but in the gap (no pulse). These measurements showed no rf emission dependence on the electrical conductivity of the specimen or with current levels between 0-500A and support the conclusion that no sparking or plasma production takes place in the specimen. The steep slope of the current vs time profile is demonstrated to produce the rf emission in a manner described by Hertz and is suggested to provide forces on the sintering material that encourage densification.

Low-intensity, short-duration thermal stimulation during the late phase of incubation alters secondary sex ratio in favour of males								BRITISH POULTRY SCIENCE				56	3			381	388		10.1080/00071668.2015.1041099			MAY 4 2015	2015	1. In two experiments, two setters and hatchers, with a capacity of 42 240 eggs each, were used to investigate the effect of low-intensity, short-duration thermal stimuli during the late phase of incubation on hatchability, sex ratio and grow-out performance of broilers under field conditions.2. Eggs in the test group had the same physical environment as eggs in the control group except that incubation temperature was increased by 0.5 degrees C for 2h/d above the control group from 18 to 20d of incubation.3. Thermal stimulation significantly increased the proportion of males hatched in both experiments. In experiment 2, evaluation at 7d of age showed that the proportion of males in the test group was still significantly higher than in the control group.4. In experiment 2, hatch residue was examined and the proportion of unhatched male embryos was significantly greater in the control group than in the test group.5. Thermal stimulation did not have a significant influence on post-hatch performance of broiler chickens to market age.6. The results demonstrated that thermal stimulation of 0.5 degrees C for 2h/d above the control during late incubation shifted the sex ratio at hatch and at 7d in favour of males. The difference in secondary sex ratio was due to increased survival of male embryos in the test group.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0007-1668	1466-1799		WOS:000355676500014	25929286

However, this material class has not been widely utilized in energy conversion and storage applications due to the blocking behavior of the grain boundary proton conduction. A better understanding of proton conduction in these materials requires a systematic study of the sintering conditions that determine microstructure and ultimately the electrical properties. In this work, spark plasma sintering with high heating rates was employed to prepare a state-of-the-art BaZr0.9Y0.1O3-delta (BZY) proton conductor for studies focused on the behavior of proton conduction at the grain boundary interfaces. The ceramics prepared by the SPS method resulted in an ultra-fine grain size of approximately 200 nm. The large grain boundary interfacial area was used as a "tool" to investigate the interfacial conduction in these materials systems. Samples displayed a lowered grain boundary conductivity and a higher activation energy compared with the literature results on conventionally prepared materials. The lower bulk conductivity is interpreted with reference to polymorphs of BZY sintered at different temperatures. The combined effect led to a lower total conductivity of the SPS densified BZY ceramics. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Cultural community-based tourism in Tanzania: Lessons learned and way forward								DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA				32	3	SI		377	391		10.1080/0376835X.2015.1010710			MAY 4 2015	2015	Cultural tourism programmes (CTPs) provide opportunities for rural communities to supplement their income. While these programmes are intended to empower local people and reduce poverty, the mechanisms used for choosing the targeted 'communities' remain largely unexamined. This paper analyses the planning, structure and implementation of CTPs as a form of community-based tourism in selected areas in Tanzania. Data were collected from two CTP groups (10 people in total) and five government officials at the national level using in-depth interviews. Analysis was carried out using NVIVO for theme generation. Major themes derived include lack of clear description of who constitutes CTPsand that existing CTPs differ greatly in terms of structure, size, development leveland resource capacity, and many lack clear benefit-sharing mechanisms. There is a need for the government to continue supporting these initiatives at all levels, to nurture newly created CTPs and to provide continual technical support for the existing ones.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0376-835X	1470-3637		WOS:000352308200009

Knowledge of the distribution patterns of RN is essential for selecting sampling strategies and for site-specific management. A 3-year study was conducted in two fields in South Carolina with the purpose of characterizing the distribution of RN using a fine-scale sampling scheme in plots representing different soil textures (field 1), and using a largescale arbitrary sampling scheme (field 2). Horizontal distribution data showed an aggregated pattern of RN densities at planting and after harvest in both fields each year, with patches ranging from 8 to 12 m. However, a significant neighborhood structure was only detected when suitable hosts (cotton and soybean) were planted. Correlations between RN densities and percent sand and silt were detected, showing nematode densities peaked when sand content was around 60% and declined when sand content increased above 60 to 65%. When fewer samples were taken in the field with more uniform sand content, percentage of sand was a less reliable predictor of RN densities. Vertical sampling showed the highest numbers of RN were found at 15 to 30 cm deep after cotton, but were deeper after a nonhost crop. Understanding distribution patterns of RN within a field may improve the effectiveness of management practices.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0031-949X	1943-7684		WOS:000355311500011	25412010

Evangelical Elites' Anti-Homosexuality Narratives as a Resistance Strategy Against Attribution Effects								JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION				54	2			345	362		10.1111/jssr.12188			MAY 2015	2015	While attribution theory expects that beliefs about the origins of homosexuality are directly related to beliefs about the moral acceptability of homosexual behavior, we use content analysis of the popular evangelical magazineChristianity Todayto show that evangelical elites have developed a series of anti-homosexuality narratives that allow them to resist attribution effects. In particular, we find that even when evangelical elites have expressed belief in the physiological origins of homosexuality, such as the influence of genetics and/or prenatal hormones, their negative beliefs about the moral acceptability of homosexual behavior have not varied. We argue, then, that evangelical elites' anti-homosexuality narratives provide them with a strategy for influencing rank-and-file evangelicals, so that while allowing for a diversity of beliefs about the origins of homosexuality, rank-and-file evangelicals still have a viable mechanism for connecting these beliefswhatever they may beto negative beliefs about the moral acceptability of homosexual behavior. Our findings thus extend attribution theory, illuminate the potential power of moral narratives, and amplify the need for future research.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0021-8294	1468-5906		WOS:000363333500011

Gestures furthermore play an important role in our daily interactions, and humans are particularly skilled at perceiving and interpreting detailed signals in communications. Creating believable hand motions for virtual characters is an important and challenging task. Many new methods have been proposed in the Computer Graphics community within the last years, and significant progress has been made towards creating convincing, detailed hand and finger motions. This state of the art report presents a review of the research in the area of hand and finger modeling and animation. Starting with the biological structure of the hand and its implications for how the hand moves, we discuss current methods in motion capturing hands, data-driven and physics-based algorithms to synthesize their motions, and techniques to make the appearance of the hand model surface more realistic. We then focus on areas in which detailed hand motions are crucial such as manipulation and communication. Our report concludes by describing emerging trends and applications for virtual hand animation.					36th Annual Conference of the European-Association-for-Computer-Graphics36th Annual Conference of the European-Association-for-Computer-Graphics	MAY 04-08, 2015MAY 04-08, 2015	European Assoc Comp GraphEuropean Assoc Comp Graph	Zurich, SWITZERLANDZurich, SWITZERLAND	1	0	0	0	0	1			0167-7055	1467-8659		WOS:000358326600064

Brominated SWNTs (SWNT-Br) were dispersed in dimethyl formamide (DMF) and cast onto the interdigit space of microlithographically fabricated interdigitated microsensor electrodes (IMEs) of gold (Au) or platinum (Pt) that were unmodified or chemically modified with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). The resulting devices (receptors) were characterized by two-electrode impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with equivalent circuit modeling and by direct current (DC)-based current-voltage (IV) characterization in various gases/vapors. The chemoresistive responses to these same gases/vapors were determined under DC conditions by continuous monitoring following flow injection of gas/vapor. The EIS and I-V characterization produced similar results that averaged 40.7 +/- 1.1 ohms at the Au-electrode devices and 73.9 +/- 1.9 ohms at the Pt- electrode devices confirming that the choice of metal greatly influences the magnitude of DC and AC responses. Exposure to vapors via flow injection results in ethanol (EtOH) > methyl isoamyl ketone (MIAK) > octane > toluene and with higher relative and more reproducible responses at Au compared to Pt devices. Surface modification influences the reproducibility of both devices.

J	Bauer, Philip J.; Stone, Kenneth C.; Foulk, Jonn A.; Dodd, Roy B.								Irrigation and cultivar effect on flax fiber and seed yield in the Southeast USA								INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS				67				7	10		10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.12.053			MAY 2015	2015	Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a potential winter crop for the Southeast USA that can be grown for both seed and fiber. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of irrigation on flax straw, fiber, and seed yield of fiber-type and seed-type cultivars at different flax growth stages. The study was conducted during the winter growing seasons of 2010/2011, 2011/2012, and 2012/2013 near Florence, SC. Four fiber-type cultivars and one seed-type cultivar were grown with and without irrigation for two years. The four fiber-types were evaluated for straw and fiber yield in the third year. Soil water was monitored to trigger irrigations. Irrigation was applied before all four harvests in 2010/2011, before only the last harvest in 2011/2012, and was not applied in 201212013. Straw harvests were made at the onset of flowering, 10 days past the onset of flowering, 20 days past the onset of flowering, and when seeds were mature. Seed harvests were made at the end of the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 growing seasons. In 2010/2011, plots had to be replanted in February so crop development was delayed. Irrigation increased straw yield at the last three harvests in that year. In the other two years, when planting occurred at normal times in the fall, irrigation did not influence straw or fiber yield. Irrigation had no significant effect on seed yield. The fiber-type cultivars did not differ for straw or fiber yield. At the onset of flowering harvest, the seed-type cultivar had similar fiber content to the fiber-type cultivars. The fiber-type cultivars had higher fiber content in later harvests. The results support previous research in that fiber-type cultivars appear viable for production as fiber winter crops in the region. The results also suggest that high straw yielding seed-type cultivars could be used, especially in systems with early straw harvests.

J	Riddell, Eric A.; Sears, Michael W.								Geographic variation of resistance to water loss within two species of lungless salamanders: implications for activity								ECOSPHERE				6	5					86	10.1890/ES14-00360.1			MAY 2015	2015	For many organisms, constraints on activity increase energetic costs, which ultimately reduce the suitability of a particular habitat. Mechanistic species distribution models often use estimates of activity to predict how organisms will respond to climate change. These models couple physiology and morphology with climatic data to estimate potential activity. In turn, the duration of activity is used to estimate the energetic balance of individuals at a given location. Whether individuals remain in positive net energetic balance determines if a given location is suitable for the species. However, because these models often assume that physiology does not vary across the species range, estimates of activity (and consequently energetics) are potentially misleading. To test the consequence of this assumption, we measured total resistance to water loss (R) within two species of lungless salamanders (Plethodon metcalfi and P. teyahalee) collected from locations along their elevational extent in southwestern North Carolina. Because hydration state constrains the activity of salamanders, increasing R would increase potential activity. Here, we leveraged the natural changes in environmental conditions along an elevational gradient to determine if salamanders modify R in different environments. We predicted that salamanders collected from low elevations would have higher R to compensate for the warmer, drier conditions at low elevations that may limit activity. We determined R in the laboratory using a flow-through system at two temperatures (12 degrees C, 18 degrees C) and at three vapor pressure deficits (0.2 kPa, 0.35 kPa, 0.5 kPa). For P. metcalfi, individuals collected from low elevations exhibited the highest R, suggesting either acclimatization or adaptation to local conditions. For P. teyahalee, individuals collected from high elevations exhibited the highest R, but these results may reflect alternative pressures due to differences in behavior. The results also suggest that salamanders might use temperature as a cue to increase R, but the capacity to do so depends upon the temperatures experienced in nature. Moreover, we show that variation in R has the potential to alter the duration of activity over the elevational ranges of these species, illustrating the importance of incorporating geographic variation of physiological traits for predicting a species' response to climate.									4	0	0	4	0	4			2150-8925			WOS:000358433000007

Unlike previous work, this technique does not make assumptions about the functional form of the wind field and instead uses inverse theory to find the smoothest wind field that agrees with the measurements. This technique is general and applies to any network making radial velocity measurements. We show reconstructions of the thermospheric wind field over the eastern United States and over eastern Brazil, using data from two distinct networks of Fabry-Perot interferometers measuring the Doppler shift of the 630.0 nm airglow emission. In Brazil, we find direct evidence of a convergent wind field during the period of rapid thermospheric temperature increase associated with the equatorial midnight temperature maximum.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000357869600049

RNAi technology is an attractive approach to silence genes responsible for disease onset and progression. Currently, the critical challenge facing the clinical success of RNAi technology is in the difficulty of delivery of RNAi inducers, due to low transfection efficiency, difficulties of integration into host DNA and unstable expression. Using the macromolecule polyglycidal methacrylate (PGMA) as a platform to graft multiple polyethyleneimine (PEI) chains, we demonstrate effective delivery of small oligos (anti-miRs and mimics) and larger DNAs (encoding shRNAs) in a wide variety of cancer cell lines by successful silencing/activation of their respective target genes. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this therapy was validated for in vivo tumor suppression using two transgenic mouse models; first, tumor growth arrest and increased animal survival was seen in mice bearing Brca2/p53-mutant mammary tumors following daily intratumoral treatment with nanoparticles conjugated to c-Myc shRNA. Second, oral delivery of the conjugate to an Apc-deficient crypt progenitor colon cancer model increased animal survival and returned intestinal tissue to a non-wnt-deregulated state. This study demonstrates, through careful design of nonviral nanoparticles and appropriate selection of therapeutic gene targets, that RNAi technology can be made an affordable and amenable therapy for cancer.

Improving the Recognition of Eating Gestures Using Intergesture Sequential Dependencies								IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS				19	3			825	831		10.1109/JBHI.2014.2329137			MAY 2015	2015	This paper considers the problem of recognizing eating gestures by tracking wrist motion. Eating gestures are activities commonly undertaken during the consumption of a meal, such as sipping a drink of liquid or using utensils to cut food. Each of these gestures causes a pattern of wrist motion that can be tracked to automatically identify the activity. Previous works have studied this problem at the level of a single gesture. In this paper, we demonstrate that individual gestures have sequential dependence. To study this, three types of classifiers were built: 1) a K-nearest neighbor classifier which uses no sequential context, 2) a hidden Markov model (HMM) which captures the sequential context of subgesture motions, and 3) HMMs that model intergesture sequential dependencies. We built first-order to sixth-order HMMs to evaluate the usefulness of increasing amounts of sequential dependence to aid recognition. On a dataset of 25 meals, we found that the baseline accuracies for the KNN and the subgesture HMM classifiers were 75.8% and 84.3%, respectively. Using HMMs that model intergesture sequential dependencies, we were able to increase accuracy to up to 96.5%. These results demonstrate that sequential dependencies exist between eating gestures and that they can be exploited to improve recognition accuracy.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2168-2194			WOS:000356511900006	24919205

BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS				40	3			184	195					MAY 2015	2015	Using large-sample, archival data from the state of South Carolina's juvenile justice agency, we examine the question of race differences in predictors of repeat offending for a sample of approximately 100,000 youth who had been referred for criminal offenses. Independent variables relating to background, adverse parenting, mental health, school-related disabilities, and features of first offenses contributed to more than 25% of the variance in recidivism for both Black and White youth. Male gender, eligibility for free or reduced school lunch, diagnoses based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; text rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), placement in Child Protective Services, and school identification as having a classification of emotional or behavioral disorders or learning disabilities were all predictive of juvenile recidivism. In addition, early age of first offense, status offenses, and being prosecuted for a first offense were significant predictors. Magnitudes of prediction were similar across racial groups, suggesting similar vulnerability of both Black and White youth to these early adversities. Interactions between race and other independent variables accounted for only .001 of the variance in recidivism. However, there were several significant interactions. Mental health history and characteristics of the first offense were stronger predictors for White youth than for Black youth. Gender, poverty (free or reduced lunch), and school identification of having a classification of emotional or behavioral disorders were stronger predictors for Blacks than for Whites. Implications for prevention are addressed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0198-7429	2163-5307		WOS:000356988600003

Anatomy and propagation dynamics of continuous-flux release bottom gravity currents through emergent aquatic vegetation								PHYSICS OF FLUIDS				27	5					056603	10.1063/1.4919783			MAY 2015	2015	The anatomy and propagation dynamics of non-Newtonian fluid mud gravity currents through emergent aquatic vegetation were investigated experimentally. The motivation of this study was related to the pipeline disposal of the dredged fluid mud into vegetated wetlands and near-shore areas, during which bottom gravity currents form. Our experimental observations showed that the presence of vegetation affects the propagation dynamics, hence the anatomy, of the gravity currents significantly. Vegetation-induced drag force dominated the resisting forces acting on the gravity current, forcing the current to transition into a drag-dominated propagation phase. During this transition, the gravity current profile evolved into a well-defined triangular/wedge shape. The onset of the fully established drag-dominated propagation phase was marked by the establishment of an equilibrium slope angle for the upper interface of the current with the ambient fluid. This equilibrium/terminal slope angle value remained constant throughout the rest of the drag-dominated propagation phase. Parameterizations for the required propagation distance for the onset of the fully established drag-dominated propagation phase, the array-averaged drag coefficient at the onset of this propagation phase, and the value of the terminal slope angle were proposed. Our experimental observations on the anatomy of gravity currents during the drag-dominated propagation phase were discussed in detail. This study documented significant effects of the vegetation in the propagation dynamics and anatomy of gravity currents, which warrants future detailed studies.

The Use of Structural Behavioral Assessment to Develop Interventions for Secondary Students Exhibiting Challenging Behaviors								EDUCATION AND TREATMENT OF CHILDREN				38	2			149	174					MAY 2015	2015	Structural behavioral assessment (SBA) involves a series of heuristic approaches similar to those used with functional behavioral assessment (FBA). It involves assessing contextual variables that precede the occurrence of a behavior. These variables have also been termed antecedents, setting events, or establishing operations. Once these variables have been assessed, contextually based manipulations are developed and implemented, and interventions are developed from the results to reduce or prevent challenging behaviors from occurring. A major advantage of structural assessment is that teachers may find interventions based on the results easy to implement and relevant to the classroom. However, most of the research on SBA has been conducted with younger children with autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities, and those with emotional or behavioral disorders (EBD). Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to extend the research by training a general education teacher to use SBA to develop interventions for secondary students displaying challenging behaviors who are at risk in general education classrooms. An alternating treatments design was used with four at-risk middle school students. Results indicated that a brief SBA can easily be conducted in general education classrooms, and interventions developed from manipulations can not only decrease (a) verbal outbursts (e.g., talking out of turn, arguing, laughing at inappropriate times); (b) inappropriate contact with others (e.g., touching, pushing, hitting, kicking, braiding hair); (c) taking other's belongings; (d) being out of the student's assigned seat without permission; and (e) passing notes but also increase writing and eyes on materials or eyes on the teacher during a language arts class. Implications for practice and future research are described.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0748-8491	1934-8924		WOS:000355773300001		
J	Triebwasser-Freese, Daniella J.; Tharayil, Nishanth; Preston, Caroline M.; Gerard, Patrick G.					Tharayil, Nishanth /0000-0001-6866-0804			Catalytic kinetics and activation energy of soil peroxidases across ecosystems of differing lignin chemistries								BIOGEOCHEMISTRY				124	1-3			113	129		10.1007/s10533-015-0086-3			MAY 2015	2015	Factors regulating the persistence of lignin in terrestrial ecosystems are highly debated, and recently lignin has been proposed to have a low residence time in soils. The catalytic efficiency and activation energy of the oxidoreductase enzymes regulate the residence time of lignin in soils. We characterized the spatial and seasonal changes in the apparent Michaelis-Menten kinetics and activation energy of soil peroxidases in three ecosystems of differing litter chemistries- pine forest, deciduous forest, and agricultural ecosystem. Peroxidases rarely follow true Michaelis-Menten kinetics, hence we measured the apparent K (m) ( (App) K (m) ) and apparent V (max) ( (App) V (max) ) of soil peroxidases under potentially H2O2 non-limiting conditions using 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as the reducing substrate. The (App) V (max) and (App) K (m) measured in this study, when used independently, exhibited only a weak relationship with total quantity and composition of lignins. Hence, we adopted the ratio of these two parameters ( (App) V (max) / (App) K (m) ) to define the apparent catalytic efficiency ( (App) CE) of peroxidases. Across the three ecosystems and seasons, the (App) CE of peroxidase was ecosystem specific, and exhibited a strong correlation with the monolignol composition of the resident plant species. The (App) CE of peroxidase was higher in agricultural soils that had lower lignin content. Pine soils with a higher relative proportion of vanillyl units that contribute to more recalcitrant inter-unit linkages in lignins exhibited the highest (App) V (max) and (App) K (m) , resulting in the lowest (App) CE. This decoupling of (App) CE of peroxidases from chemistry of the native lignin observed in our assay-system could indicate a relatively longer persistence of lignin in ecosystems receiving recalcitrant litter inputs. Even though the apparent activation energy ( (App) Ea) of peroxidases varied by depth and seasons across ecosystems, the (App) Ea did not relate to the chemistry or quantity of lignins, probably due to the substrate-saturated assay conditions. Our study captures the apparent kinetics of peroxidases in soils, which was ecosystem specific, and in part regulated by the composition of monolignols, thus providing a preliminary linkage between lignin chemistry and enzyme properties in natural systems.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0168-2563	1573-515X		WOS:000355620200008

The site factors are plotted versus average shear wave velocity in the top 30 m (V-S30) of soil and grouped by spectral acceleration and period. Median relationships for the site factors are expressed by a linear model for lower values of V-S30 and a linear or exponential model for higher values. The computed factors are found to be somewhat different from the factors recommended in design codes. It is also found that amplifications greater than predicted by the common (or three-point) acceleration design response spectrum method can occur at periods greater than 1.0 s, particularly when V-S30 < 200 m/s. Thus, when V-S30 < 200 m/s, it is recommended that a multipoint response spectrum be constructed and compared with the three-point spectrum.									2	0	0	0	0	2			8755-2930	1944-8201		WOS:000355576000005

We use the Chandra X-ray Observatory to localize the sources and then archival near-IR images to identify the counterparts. Both sources have counterparts in the catalogue of extended 2 Micron All-Sky Survey sources, and the counterpart to IGR J04059+5416 has been previously identified as a galaxy. Thus, we place IGR J04059+5416 in the class of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and we suggest that IGR J08297-4250 is also an AGN. If this identification is correct, the near-IR images suggest that the host galaxy of IGR J08297-4250 may be merging with a smaller nearby galaxy. For IGR J04059+5416, the 0.3-86 keV spectrum from Chandra and INTEGRAL is consistent with an absorbed power-law with a column density of N-H = (3.1(-1.5)(+2.0)) x 10(22) cm(-2) and a photon index of Gamma = 1.4 +/- 0.7, and we suggest that it is a Seyfert galaxy. For IGR J08297-4250, the photon index is similar, Gamma = 1.5 +/- 0.8, but the source is highly absorbed (N-H = (6.1(-4.3)(+10.1)) x 10(23) cm(-2)).									2	0	0	0	0	2			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000355345600044

To address this, scaffold-based tissue engineering approaches have been utilized to mimic heart development in vitro and promote maturation of cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells. While scaffolds can provide 3D microenvironments, current scaffolds lack the matched physical/chemical/biological properties of native extracellular environments. On the other hand, scaffold-free, 3D cardiac spheroids (i.e., spherical-shaped microtissues) prepared by seeding cardiomyocytes into agarose microwells were shown to improve cardiac functions. However, cardiomyocytes within the spheroids could not assemble in a controlled manner and led to compromised, unsynchronized contractions. Here, we show, for the first time, that incorporation of a trace amount (i.e. similar to 0.004% w/v) of electrically conductive silicon nanowires (e-SiNWs) in otherwise scaffold-free cardiac spheroids can form an electrically conductive network, leading to synchronized and significantly enhanced contraction (i.e., >55% increase in average contraction amplitude), resulting in significantly more advanced cellular structural and contractile maturation.									9	0	0	6	0	9			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000354906000001	25826336

Antibacterial activities of the PA library, on 13 bacterial strains (seven Gram-positive and six Gram-negative bacterial strains), and binding affinities of the PA library for a 27-base model of the bacterial 16S ribosomal A-site RNA were evaluated using high-throughput screening. The results of the two assays were correlated using Ribosomal Binding-Bacterial Inhibition Plot (RB-BIP) analysis to provide structure-activity relationship (SAR) information. From this work, we have identified PAs that can discriminate the E. coli A-site from the human A-site by up to a 28-fold difference in binding affinity. Aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme activity studies indicate that APH(2")-Ia showed nearly complete removal of activity with a number of PAs. The synthesis of the compound library and screening can both be performed rapidly, allowing for an iterative process of aminoglycoside synthesis and screening of PA libraries for optimal binding and antibacterial activity for lead identification.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1554-8929	1554-8937		WOS:000354907400015	25706406

Semi-structured individual, coupled, and group interviews were conducted in 12 coastal communities to investigate residents' perceptions about gender ideology as it intersects with the employment of women in tourism. The findings reveal tourism employment as a source of opportunity, with women gaining economic and social independence, but also conflict as women and men negotiate new gender roles and identities. Emphasizing issues such as the double workload, negotiating domestic tasks with partners, and tension resulting from employment, this study illuminates the pressing practical needs of Dominican women.

The mechanisms underlying spontaneous beating in developing cardiomyocytes are thought to resemble those of adult heart, but have not been directly tested. Contributions of sarcoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2+-signaling vs. I-f-channel in initiating spontaneous beating were tested in human induced Pluripotent Stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM) and rat Neonatal cardiomyocytes (rN-CM). Whole-cell and perforated-patch voltage-clamping and 2-D confocal imaging showed: (1) both cell types beat spontaneously (60-140/min, at 24 degrees C); (2) holding potentials between -70 and 0 mV had no significant effects on spontaneous pacing, but suppressed action potential formation; (3) spontaneous pacing at 50 mV activated cytosolic Ca2+-transients, accompanied by in-phase inward current oscillations that were suppressed by Na+-Ca2+-exchanger (NCX)- and ryanodine receptor (RyR2)-blockers, but not by Ca2+- and If-channels blockers; (4) spreading fluorescence images of cytosolic Ca2+-transients emanated repeatedly from preferred central cellular locations during spontaneous beating; (5) mitochondrial un-coupler, FCCP at non-depolarizing concentrations (similar to 50 nM), reversibly suppressed spontaneous pacing; (6) genetically encoded mitochondrial Ca2+-biosensor (mitycam-E31Q) detected regionally diverse, and FCCP-sensitive mitochondrial Ca2+-uptake and release signals activating during I-NCX oscillations; (7) I-f-channel was absent in rN-CM, but activated only negative to 80 mV in hiPS-CM; nevertheless blockers of If-channel failed to alter spontaneous pacing.

Survey questions alone cannot fully identify the qualitative traits of design thinkers, but these nine questions do enable basic exploration of compelling relationships between design thinking traits and other variables. Our analyses found design thinking traits correlated with higher achievement; with a desire for careers helping others and solving societal problems; and with recognition of and desire to address sustainability obligations.

We motivate the new model by discussing the difficulties in efficient and stable algorithm construction for the usual NS-alpha model, and then derive rNS-alpha by using deconvolution as an approximation to the filter inverse, which reduces the fourth order NS-alpha formulation to a second order model. After proving the new model is well-posed, we propose a C-0 finite element spatial discretization together with an IMEX BDF2 timestepping to create a linearized algorithm that decouples the conservation of mass and momentum equations from the filtering. We rigorously prove the algorithm is well-posed, and provided a very mild timestep restriction, is also stable and converges optimally to the model solution. Finally, we give results of several benchmark computations that confirm the theory and show the proposed model/scheme is effective at efficiently finding accurate coarse mesh solutions to flow problems.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0764-583X	1290-3841		WOS:000354794100002

J	Li, Yingbo; Lund, Robert								Multiple Changepoint Detection Using Metadata								JOURNAL OF CLIMATE				28	10			4199	4216		10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00442.1			MAY 2015	2015	This paper examines multiple changepoint detection procedures that use station history (metadata) information. Metadata records are available for some climate time series; however, these records are notoriously incomplete and many station moves and gauge changes are unlisted (undocumented). The shift in a series must be comparatively larger to declare a changepoint at an undocumented time. Also, the statistical methods for the documented and undocumented scenarios radically differ: a simple t test adequately detects a single mean shift at a documented changepoint time, while a t(max) distribution is appropriate for a single undocumented changepoint analysis. Here, the multiple changepoint detection problem is considered via a Bayesian approach, with the metadata record being used to formulate a prior distribution of the changepoint numbers and their location times. This prior distribution is combined with the data to obtain a posterior distribution of changepoint numbers and location times. Estimates of the most likely number of changepoints and times are obtained from the posterior distribution. Simulation studies demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. The methods, which are applicable with or without a reference series, are applied in the analysis of an annual precipitation series from New Bedford, Massachusetts.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0894-8755	1520-0442		WOS:000354370100018

While a variety of socially relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) have been examined, we argue that studying them in isolation is no longer sufficient, as individuals require a repertoire of KSAs that must be utilized in combination to be effective in complex social situations. Thus, we propose the construct critical social thinking (CST), a holistic, integrated approach to understanding the processes that enable individuals to function in such settings, and the KSAs that are necessary for each process. Because the significance of the CST construct is closely tied to the growing need for it in practice, we also integrate disparate training findings and link them to components of our conceptual model, enabling us to put forth initial insights regarding the approaches through which CST can be trained effectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-3866	2041-3874		WOS:000354824200001

Population dynamics of redbay (Persea borbonia) after laurel wilt disease: an assessment based on forest inventory and analysis data								BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS				17	5			1371	1382		10.1007/s10530-014-0799-6			MAY 2015	2015	Laurel wilt disease (LWD) is a lethal fungal infection of woody plants in the Lauraceae, including redbay (Persea borbonia). We used forest inventory and analysis (FIA) data from 2003 to 2011 to estimate redbay populations and see if any decline could be observed since the introduction of LWD. Throughout its entire range, the population estimate of redbay was about 862.2 +/- 89.8 million in 2003, increasing to 951.8 +/- 87.1 million in 2011. However, population estimates from 2003 to 2011 displayed a significant negative curvature, suggesting that the population might start to decline. The population in Georgia significantly decreased from 241.1 +/- 11.9 million stems in 2003 to 150.3 +/- 7.9 million in 2011. Results at the range-wide scale should be taken with caution, since the FIA estimates are based on a 5-year moving average. However, we show that the FIA data can also be used on a smaller scale. Redbay densities decreased significantly in plots surveyed before and after the reported infection by an average of 89.6 live redbay stems/ha. Density in plots without reported LWD were not statistically different between survey years. We developed a logistic regression model to predict the probability of redbay mortality due to LWD. Number of years since LWD infection was the most significant variable, with every increase in 1 year resulting in a 153.7 % increase in odds of death. Diameter was also a significant predictor, with an increase of 1 cm DBH resulting in a 5.0 % increase in odds of death.									0	0	0	1	0	1			1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000352438800008

JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				80	5			C975	C982		10.1111/1750-3841.12840			MAY 2015	2015	Mulberry (Morus atropurpurea Roxb.) is a popular and desirable fruit that is widely cultivated in China. Despite its popularity, the free volatile chemicals and glycosidically bound volatiles (GBVs) of mulberry have been minimally studied. To this end, we have investigated these compounds in 4 mulberry cultivars via solid phase extraction (SPE) and headspace solid phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). A total of 55 free volatile chemicals and 57 GBVs were identified and quantified. In 3 of the cultivars ("YFS," "T10," and "D10"), the GBVs were found in higher amounts than their free counterparts, corresponding to a ratio of 1.2 to 1.8. The characteristic aromas were determined by their odor activity values (OAVs) and by generating an aroma series (AS). A total of 20 volatile compounds had OAVs >= 1.0. In particular, ethyl butanoate, hexanal, (Z)-3-hexenal (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-nonenal, and eugenol had relatively high OAVs and were considered to be the key aromas contributing to the mulberry flavor. Consequently, mulberry was characterized by a variety of herbaceous scents having a background of sweet, spicy, fruity, and floral notes. The free volatiles exhibited strong herbaceous notes, whereas the GBVs were responsible for the sweet and spicy qualities of the fruit. Based on our results, 2 cultivars ("YFS" and "D10") are proposed to be good candidates suitable for the further development of mulberry-based food products due to their complex and desirable aromas.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0022-1147	1750-3841		WOS:000354297800006	25817411

Jane; Sapp, Stephanie A.; Van Puymbroeck, Marieke								Fear of Falling in People With Chronic Stroke								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY				69	3					6903350020	10.5014/ajot.2015.016253			MAY-JUN 2015	2015	OBJECTIVE. We assessed the prevalence of fear of falling (FoF) in a sample of people with chronic stroke and compared multiple variables (balance, anxiety, depression, activity and participation, and stroke severity) in people with and without FoF.METHOD. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected from a cross-sectional study of mobility after stroke in 77 participants with chronic stroke (>6 mo poststroke).RESULTS. Of the 77 participants, 51(66%) reported experiencing FoF. People with FoF had significantly decreased balance (p<.001) and activity and participation (p=.006) and significantly increased anxiety (p=.007). People with FoF also had significantly worse stroke severity (p=.001).CONCLUSION. FoF is a prevalent concern in the chronic stroke population. The presence of FoF was associated with a variety of negative consequences. Occupational therapy practitioners should address FoF to help clients manage FoF and possibly improve recovery.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0272-9490	1943-7676		WOS:000354071500015	25871606	
J	Cornell, Dewey; Limber, Susan P.								Law and Policy on the Concept of Bullying at School								AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST				70	4	SI		333	343		10.1037/a0038558			MAY-JUN 2015	2015	The nationwide effort to reduce bullying in U.S. schools can be regarded as part of larger civil and human rights movements that have provided children with many of the rights afforded to adult citizens, including protection from harm in the workplace. Many bullied children find that their schools are hostile environments, but civil rights protections against harassment apply only to children who fall into protected classes, such as racial and ethnic minorities, students with disabilities, and victims of gender harassment or religious discrimination. This article identifies the conceptual challenges that bullying poses for legal and policy efforts, reviews judicial and legislative efforts to reduce bullying, and makes some recommendations for school policy. Recognition that all children have a right to public education would be one avenue for broadening protection against bullying to all children.									10	0	0	1	0	10			0003-066X	1935-990X		WOS:000354319600005	25961314	
J	DeWalt, Saara J.; Taylor, Benton N.; Ickes, Kalan								Density-dependent Survival in Seedlings Differs among Woody Life-forms in Tropical Wet Forests of a Caribbean Island								BIOTROPICA				47	3			310	319		10.1111/btp.12216			MAY 2015	2015	Negative density dependence contributes to seedling dynamics in forested ecosystems, but the relative importance of this factor for different woody plant life-forms is not well-understood. We used 1yr of seedling survivorship data for woody seedlings in 17 different plots of lower to mid-montane rain forests on the island of Dominica to examine how seedling height, abiotic factors, and biotic factors such as negative density dependence are related to seedling survival of five different life-forms (canopy, midstory, and understory trees; shrubs; and lianas). Across 64 species, taller seedlings in seedling plots with higher canopy openness, greater seedling density, lower relative abundance of conspecific seedlings, and lower relative abundance of conspecific adults generally had a greater probability of surviving. Height was the strongest predictor of seedling survival for all life-forms except lianas. Greater seedling density was positively related to survival for canopy and midstory trees but negatively related to survival for the other life-forms. For trees, the relative abundance of conspecific seedling and adult neighbors had weak and strong negative effects on survival respectively. Neither shrub nor liana seedling survival was affected by the relative abundance of conspecific neighbors. Thus, negative density dependence is confirmed as an important structuring mechanism for tree seedling communities but does not seem to be important for lianas and shrubs in Dominican rain forests. These results represent the first direct assessment of controls on seedling survival of all woody life-forms - an important step in understanding the dynamics and structure of the entire woody plant community.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-3606	1744-7429		WOS:000353993300007

Toxicity of noradrenaline, a novel anti-biofouling component, to two non-target zooplankton species, Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia								COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY				171				49	54		10.1016/j.cbpc.2015.01.006			MAY 2015	2015	Noradrenaline (NA) is the active component of novel antifouling agents and acts by preventing attachment of fouling organisms. The goal of this study was to examine the toxicity of NA to the non-target zooplankton D. magna and C cubic. Neonates were exposed to one of five concentrations of NA and effects on survival, reproduction and molting were determined. Calculated LC50 values were determined to be 46 and 38 mu M in C dubia and D. magna, respectively. A 10-day C. dubia study found that reproduction metrics were significantly impacted at non-lethal concentrations. In D. magna, concentrations greater than 40 mu M significantly impacted molting. A toxicity test was conducted with D. magna using oxidized NA, which yielded similar results. These data indicate that both NA and oxidized NA are toxic to non-target zooplankton. Results obtained from this study can be used to guide future ecological risk assessments of catecholamine-based antifouling agents.

Isolation of Onchocerca lupi in Dogs and Black Flies, California, USA								EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES				21	5			789	796		10.3201/eid2105.142011			MAY 2015	2015	In southern California, ocular infections caused by Onchocerca lupi were diagnosed in 3 dogs (1 in 2006, 2 in 2012). The infectious agent was confirmed through morphologic analysis of fixed parasites in tissues and by PCR and sequencing of amplicons derived from 2 mitochondrially encoded genes and 1 nuclear-encoded gene. A nested PCR based on the sequence of the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene of the parasite was developed and used to screen Simullum black flies collected from southern California for O. lupi DNA. Six (2.8%; 95% Cl 0.6%-5.0%) of 213 black flies contained O. lupi DNA. Partial mitochondril 16S rRNA gene sequences from the infected flies matched sequences derived from black fly larvae cytotaxonomically identified as Simulium tribulatum. These data implicate S. tribulatum flies as a putative vector for O. lupi in southern California.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1080-6040	1080-6059		WOS:000353610400007	25897954

A nonlinear mechanistic force model-based control framework attempts to control the cutting force at a designated set point, with material properties changing over the cut. The force coefficients for the material are calculated offline using experimental data and Bayesian inference methods. Since the hardened part of the bar will shift the force coefficient values, an online estimation strategy (Bayesian recursive least square estimator) is used to learn the new coefficients as well as satisfying the control objective. With the newly learned coefficients passed downstream, the subsequent operation experiences no compromise of control objective as well as reduces the maximum values of force encountered. Numerical analyses presented show the adaptation and control scheme performance. Finally, the experimental analysis show the open-loop and closed-loop model adaptation and effective force set point regulation using experimental apparatus and partially hardened MS (AISI1045) bar.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-3768	1433-3015		WOS:000353512900052

Family physicians must often select pediatric imaging without any decision support. We hypothesized that point-of-care decision support would lead to the selection of imaging that lowered radiation exposure and improved guideline congruence.Methods: Our double-blind, randomized simulation included family physicians in the Military Health System. Participants initially reviewed a pediatric hematuria scenario and selected imaging without decision support. Participants were subsequently randomized to either receive imaging-appropriateness guidelines and then estimated radiation exposure information or receive estimated radiation information then guidelines; imaging selections were required after each step. The primary outcome was the selected imaging modality with point-of-care decision support.Results: The first arm increased CT ordering after viewing the guidelines (P = .008) but then decreased it after reviewing radiation exposure information (P = .007). In the second arm radiation information decreased CT and plain film use (P = not significant), with a subsequent increase in ultrasound and CT after the guideline presentation (P = .05).Conclusions: Decision support during a simulated pediatric scenario helped family physicians select imaging that lowered radiation exposure and was aligned with current guidelines, especially when presented with radiation information after guideline review. This information could help inform electronic medical record design.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1557-2625	1558-7118		WOS:000354277700009	25957367

TM-1) provides a resource for fiber improvement								NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY				33	5			531	U252		10.1038/nbt.3207			MAY 2015	2015	Upland cotton is a model for polyploid crop domestication and transgenic improvement. Here we sequenced the allotetraploid Gossypium hirsutum L. acc. TM-1 genome by integrating whole-genome shotgun reads, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-end sequences and genotype-by-sequencing genetic maps. We assembled and annotated 32,032 A-subgenome genes and 34,402 D-subgenome genes. Structural rearrangements, gene loss, disrupted genes and sequence divergence were more common in the A subgenome than in the D subgenome, suggesting asymmetric evolution. However, no genome-wide expression dominance was found between the subgenomes. Genomic signatures of selection and domestication are associated with positively selected genes (PSGs) for fiber improvement in the A subgenome and for stress tolerance in the D subgenome. This draft genome sequence provides a resource for engineering superior cotton lines.									135	32	0	124	0	158			1087-0156	1546-1696		WOS:000354314500035	25893781

Maximal increasing sequences in fillings of almost-moon polyominoes								ADVANCES IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS				66				1	21		10.1016/j.aam.2014.12.005			MAY 2015	2015	It was proved by Rubey that the number of fillings with zeros and ones of a given moon polyomino that do not contain a northeast chain of a fixed size depends only on the set of column lengths of the polyomino. Rubey's proof uses an adaption of jeu de taquin and promotion for arbitrary fillings of moon polyominoes and deduces the result for 01-fillings via a variation of the pigeonhole principle. In this paper we present the first completely bijective proof of this result by considering fillings of almost-moon polyominoes, which are moon polyominoes after removing one of the rows. More precisely, we construct a simple bijection which preserves the size of the largest northeast chain of the fillings when two adjacent rows of the polyomino are exchanged. This bijection also preserves the column sum of the fillings. In addition, we also present a simple bijection that preserves the size of the largest northeast chains, the row sum and the column sum if every row of the filling has at most one 1. Thereby, we not only provide a bijective proof of Rubey's result but also two refinements of it. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J	Beebe, Donald A.; Castle, James W.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								Biogeochemical-Based Design for Treating Ammonia Using Constructed Wetland Systems								ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE				32	5			397	406		10.1089/ees.2014.0475			MAY 1 2015	2015	Constructed wetlands have been used to treat contaminants, including ammonia and nitrate, with varying degrees of success; however, no study has been performed to evaluate ammonia treatment performance of a constructed wetland specifically designed to promote biogeochemical conditions controlling nitrification and denitrification. Therefore, this research aims to improve the design of treating ammonia using constructed wetlands by targeting biogeochemical conditions needed for nitrification and denitrification. A pilot-scale constructed wetland was designed and constructed to meet targeted ranges of dissolved oxygen concentration, hydrosoil redox potential, pH, alkalinity, and organic carbon availability to enhance nitrification and denitrification. Design features included aeration, sucrose, and oyster shell addition. The constructed wetland decreased ammonia-N from similar to 20 mg/L in inflow to nondetectable levels (<0.1 mg/L) in outflow during three of the four treatment months. Measured biogeochemical conditions indicate that nitrification continued to occur while hydrosoil redox potential, dissolved oxygen concentration, and pH were lower than the targeted ranges. Conversely, denitrification continued to occur while pH was lower than the targeted range, and dissolved oxygen concentration was higher than the targeted range. The success of the constructed wetland in removing ammonia and nitrate under conditions outside of target ranges was attributed to the existence of heterogeneous macro- and microenvironments within individual wetland cells that allow both reactions to occur simultaneously under a wider range of conditions than previously expected. Results from this study demonstrated the advantage of designing constructed wetlands to promote biogeochemical conditions for improved ammonia treatment and also provide the basis for treatment of ammonia-contaminated produced waters.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1092-8758	1557-9018		WOS:000353967400005

This paper evaluates labor productivity of RFID adopted retailers. This paper uses data from financial statements and explains the association between RFID technology and adopted retailer's labor productivity. The regression analysis using the Cobb-Douglas production function shows that RFID retailers have a higher labor to gross income elasticity than their non-RFID counterpart, indicating that RFID retailers have higher labor productivity.

A robust optimization approach to volunteer management in humanitarian crises								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS				163				97	111		10.1016/j.ijpe.2015.02.018			MAY 2015	2015	In the aftermath of a disaster, humanitarian organizations quickly assemble a workforce that can immediately serve a community's needs. However, these needs change over time, and the volunteer base (and their skill sets) also changes over time. In this paper, we develop a flexible optimization framework to dynamically allocate volunteers in order to minimize the cumulative unmet demand and maximize volunteers' preference. We use a robust optimization approach to handle the uncertainty in task demands because in the scenarios of interest it is unlikely that demand distributions are available for decision makers. We consider maximizing volunteers' preference by introducing a constraint into the model which enables decision makers to derive Pareto optimality and allocation decisions for any degree of conservativeness. Our numerical results show that volunteer managers should consider matching volunteers to their task assignment preferences up to a critical percentage, above which needs fulfillment decrease quickly due to overly strict adherence to volunteer task assignment preferences. Moreover, one can estimate the complete price of volunteers' preference by a difference between the objective function when the matching threshold is 1 and 0. Our sensitivity analyses shed light on the effect of conservativeness in the objective function and allocation decisions as well as the model's tractability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Modeling of Flow and Transport Induced by Production of Hydrofracture-Stimulated Gas Wells Near the Rulison Nuclear Test								TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA				108	1	SI		23	42		10.1007/s11242-013-0264-5			MAY 2015	2015	The Project Rulison test in Western Colorado was conducted in 1969 to determine if a nuclear device could be used to fracture low permeability, gas-bearing rock to enhance natural gas production. The presence of radionuclides (specifically tritium) in the produced gas persisted above acceptable levels, and the test was abandoned. Advances in hydraulic fracturing technology have made it feasible to extract natural gas from low-permeability reservoirs, and drilling activity near the Rulison site has raised concerns that remnant radioactivity in the detonation zone could migrate to nearby producing wells and enter the natural gas distribution system. The site was modeled using the massively parallel version of TOUGH2, TOUGH2_MP-EOS7R, with over 1,000,000 elements. The majority of the tritium is present as tritiated water, and since the gas permeability of the native formation is several orders of magnitude higher than the liquid permeability, any significant migration occurs with the gas phase. In the model, tritium partitions between the aqueous and vapor phases in relation to the Henry's Law constant. The Henry's constant for tritiated water vapor is simply the water vapor pressure. The model domain includes the entire targeted gas-bearing section and gas production wells installed in 2010 1.2 km (0.75 mile) from the Rulison site. The model was calibrated to historical production and pressure data from the Rulison reentry well and to data from the recently installed gas wells. The model was used to simulate the effects of current wells and of future wells that could potentially be installed nearer the Rulison site.

In this study, the volatiles of the fresh, naringinase-treated and resin-absorbed juices of pummelo were investigated by gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and sensory evaluation. The fresh juice was analyzed to have 24 volatiles, among which (E)-3-hexen-1-ol and 1-hexanol had the highest concentrations. After the naringinase treatment, the juice showed 32 volatiles, among which (Z)- and (E)-linalool oxides were the most dominant in concentration; while the resin adsorption captured most of the volatiles. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that naringinase treatment led to an increase in some compounds, particularly aldehydes, whereas resin adsorption decreased the amounts of a lot of volatile compounds. The sensory evaluation demonstrated the fresh and naringinase-treated juices had similar aroma profiles, whereas the resin-adsorbed juice had a much weaker aroma intensity than its counterparts. These results indicated that the naringinase treatment is more desirable than the resin adsorption for debittering citrus juice because the naringinase treatment could maintain the aroma profile close to the original, fresh juice.

Seasonal weather patterns drive population vital rates and persistence in a stream fish								GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				21	5			1856	1870		10.1111/gcb.12837			MAY 2015	2015	Climate change affects seasonal weather patterns, but little is known about the relative importance of seasonal weather patterns on animal population vital rates. Even when such information exists, data are typically only available from intensive fieldwork (e.g., mark-recapture studies) at a limited spatial extent. Here, we investigated effects of seasonal air temperature and precipitation (fall, winter, and spring) on survival and recruitment of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) at a broad spatial scale using a novel stage-structured population model. The data were a 15-year record of brook trout abundance from 72 sites distributed across a 170-km-long mountain range in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, USA. Population vital rates responded differently to weather and site-specific conditions. Specifically, young-of-year survival was most strongly affected by spring temperature, adult survival by elevation and per-capita recruitment by winter precipitation. Low fall precipitation and high winter precipitation, the latter of which is predicted to increase under climate change for the study region, had the strongest negative effects on trout populations. Simulations show that trout abundance could be greatly reduced under constant high winter precipitation, consistent with the expected effects of gravel-scouring flows on eggs and newly hatched individuals. However, high-elevation sites would be less vulnerable to local extinction because they supported higher adult survival. Furthermore, the majority of brook trout populations are projected to persist if high winter precipitation occurs only intermittently (3 of 5years) due to density-dependent recruitment. Variable drivers of vital rates should be commonly found in animal populations characterized by ontogenetic changes in habitat, and such stage-structured effects may increase population persistence to changing climate by not affecting all life stages simultaneously. Yet, our results also demonstrate that weather patterns during seemingly less consequential seasons (e.g., winter precipitation) can have major impacts on animal population dynamics.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000353220500010	25523515

At an amino acid sequence level, it was shown that the disease-causing variants frequently involve drastic changes in amino acid physicochemical properties of proteins such as charge, hydrophobicity, and geometry. Structural analysis of variants involved in diseases and being frequently observed in human population showed similar trends: disease-causing variants tend to cause more changes in hydrogen bond network and salt bridges as compared with harmless amino acid mutations. Analysis of thermodynamics data reported in the literature, both experimental and computational, indicated that disease-causing variants tend to destabilize proteins and their interactions, which prompted us to investigate the effects of amino acid mutations on large databases of experimentally measured energy changes in unrelated proteins. Although the experimental datasets were linked neither to diseases nor exclusory to human proteins, the observed trends were the same: amino acid mutations tend to destabilize proteins and their interactions. Having in mind that structural and thermodynamics properties are interrelated, it is pointed out that any large change in any of them is anticipated to cause a disease.									13	0	0	10	0	13			1059-7794	1098-1004		WOS:000353357300005	25689729

But analytical results are still lacking on the collective oscillation period of inter-coupled gene regulatory oscillators, which, as has been reported, may be different from that of an autonomous oscillator. Based on cyclic feedback oscillators, we analyze the collective oscillation pattern of coupled cellular oscillators. First we give a condition under which the oscillator network exhibits oscillatory and synchronized behavior. Then we estimate the collective oscillation period based on a novel multivariable harmonic balance technique. Analytical results are derived in terms of biochemical parameters, thus giving insight into the basic mechanism of biological oscillation and providing guidance in synthetic biology design.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0018-9286	1558-2523		WOS:000353508100020

Moderating Roles of Self-Control and Perceived Aggressive Work Culture in Predicting Responses to Psychological Contract Breach								JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT				41	4			1132	1154		10.1177/0149206312443557			MAY 2015	2015	The authors develop and test a moderated mediation model that accounts for employee emotions (psychological contract violation), employee motivation (revenge cognitions), employee personality (self-control), and context (perceived aggressive culture) in the relationship between psychological contract breach and workplace deviance. In Sample 1, involving 146 hospitality workers and their peers, the authors found support for a conditional indirect effect of psychological contract violation in predicting workplace deviance via revenge cognitions for those employees who perceive a high as opposed to low aggressive work culture. In addition, they found that at high levels of perceived aggressive work culture, the conditional indirect effects of psychological contract violation in predicting workplace deviance via revenge cognitions were statistically significant for those employees with low as opposed to high self-control. These results were replicated in Sample 2 using an independent sample of 168 hospitality workers in a different cultural context. Overall, the results suggest that self-control and perceived aggressive culture, taken together, influence the enactment of deviant acts. Implications for research and practice are discussed.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0149-2063	1557-1211		WOS:000353465500005

This paper's purpose was to describe and illustrate a framework of the challenges of contextual data collection.A framework is presented based on prior work in community-based participatory research and organizational science, comprised of ten types of challenges across four broader categories. Illustrations of challenges and suggestions for addressing them are drawn from two mixed method, contextual studies of patients with chronic disease in two regions of the USA.The first major category of challenges was concerned with the researcher-participant partnership, for example, the initial lack of mutual trust and understanding between researchers, patients, and family members. The second category concerned patient characteristics such as cognitive limitations and a busy personal schedule that created barriers to successful data collection. The third concerned research logistics and procedures such as recruitment, travel distances, and compensation. The fourth concerned scientific quality and interpretation, including issues of validity, reliability, and combining data from multiple sources. The two illustrative studies faced both common and diverse research challenges and used many different strategies to address them.Collecting less structured data from patients and others in the community is potentially very productive but requires the anticipation, avoidance, or negotiation of various challenges. Future work is necessary to better understand these challenges across different methods and settings, as well as to test and identify strategies to address them.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0962-9343	1573-2649		WOS:000353209500003	25154464

When used for sensors, the interactions between RF waves and material-under-test (MUT) can be significantly strengthened due to enhanced RF fields and longer interaction time when compared with uniform transmission lines. In this paper, a microstrip resonator (MR) and a coupled line (CL) filter are designed and incorporated into an interferometer. The obtained results are compared with that of a coplanar waveguide-based interferometer. Both simulated and measured results show that the MR and CL can significantly enhance RF interferometer sensitivity, e.g., by >5 times of frequency shift and up to 40-dB more of transmission coefficient change similar to 2 GHz. Further work is needed to fully understand the physical processes and obtain quantitative MUT permittivity properties from the measured scattering parameters.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1530-437X	1558-1748		WOS:000352624600010

These ceramics were characterized for their luminescence and thermal lensing behaviors, and the results compared to data on single crystals reported in literature. Thermal diffusivity, D, and conductivity, K, values of D=26 x 10(-3) cm(2)/s and K=5.8 W/m K, respectively, for 1.0 mol% Eu3+ and 0.5 mol% Tm3+ singly-doped Y2O3 transparent ceramics were obtained. These values are about half of those for single crystal analogs. A small temperature coefficient of the optical path length change, ds/dT=3 x 10(-6) K-1, was determined, making these materials suitable for applications requiring nearly athermal response. Selected spectroscopic properties were obtained by means of Judd-Ofelt analysis and together with thermal lens results provided absolute values for the fluorescence quantum efficiency of several levels, particularly 62% for the D-5(0) level of Eu3+ and 84% for the F-3(4) level of Tm3+.

Extensive research about how to improve compliance has been conducted.METHODOLOGY: Patients' perceptions of proper hand hygiene were evaluated when caregivers used soap and water, waterless hand cleaner, or a combination of these.RESULTS: No significant differences were observed, but many patients reported they did not notice whether their providers cleaned their hands.DISCUSSION: Educating patients and their caregivers about the protection afforded by proper, consistent hand hygiene practices is important.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Engaging patients to monitor healthcare workers may increase compliance, reduce the spread of infection, and lead to better overall patient outcomes.IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: This study revealed a need to investigate the effects of patient education on patient perceptions of hand hygiene.CONCLUSION: Results of this study appear to indicate a need to focus on patient education and the differences between soap and water versus alcohol-based hand sanitizers as part of proper hand hygiene. Researchers could be asking: "Why have patients not been engaged as members of the healthcare team who have the most to lose?"									0	0	0	0	0	0				1538-8689		MEDLINE:25871755	25871755	
J	Kingree, J. B.; Thompson, Martie								A Comparison of Risk Factors for Alcohol-Involved and Alcohol-Uninvolved Sexual Aggression Perpetration								JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE				30	9			1478	1492		10.1177/0886260514540806			MAY 2015	2015	Much research has found that alcohol use is associated with sexual aggression (SA) perpetration among male college students. To increase understanding of this association, the present study examined whether other established risk factors for SA perpetration in this population were associated differentially with incidents that were preceded by alcohol use and incidents that were not preceded by alcohol use. The sample included 638 male college students who completed self-report measures of seven risk factors and SA perpetration during their first and second years of enrollment at a large, public university in the southeastern United States. A multivariate, multinomial logistic regression model revealed none of the seven factors increased risk for both alcohol-involved and alcohol-uninvolved SA perpetration. The model did identify binge drinking as a risk factor for alcohol-involved SA perpetration and impulsivity, rape myth attitudes, and hostility toward women as risk factors for alcohol-uninvolved perpetration. If these results can be replicated, then they would suggest that different risk factors should be targeted to optimize the effect of preventive interventions on the occurrence of the two types of SA perpetration.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0886-2605	1552-6518		WOS:000352003900002	24997103

Antiferromagnetic order in a semiconductor quantum well with spin-orbit coupling								PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES				69				34	38		10.1016/j.physe.2015.01.016			MAY 2015	2015	An argument is made on the existence of a low-temperature itinerant antiferromagnetic (AF) spin alignment, rather than persistent helical (PH), in the ground state of a two dimensional electron gas in a semiconductor quantum well with linear spin-orbit Rashba-Dresselhaus interaction at equal coupling strengths, alpha. This result is obtained on account of the opposite-spin single-particle state degeneracy at k = 0 that makes the spin instability possible. A theory of the resulting magnetic phase is formulated within the Hartree-Fock approximation of the Coulomb interaction. In the AF state the direction of the fractional polarization is obtained to be aligned along the displacement vector of the single-particle states. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

With the primary ion beam oriented along the [110] crystal direction, distinct peaks in the energy distributions of the scattered beam flux that correspond to single or multiple collisions with target atoms are observed. A classical trajectory simulation reveals that these collisions can occur either at the surface or within the [110] channels, depending on incident beam energy. Within the simulation we probe the role of finite temperature and thermally displaced atoms on specific scattering events and show that contributions to the scattered distributions from single and double collisions dominate within the [110] channels. We also report velocity dependent measurements of the neutral/ion ratio of the scattered beam flux. A deviation between the data and simulated charge transfer results is observed for Na trajectories which penetrate the surface. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The ground and tunnel settlements, which were caused by water leaking into the tunnel, significantly degraded both the serviceability and safety of the tunnel and its surroundings. In a typical analysis, such leakage is commonly assumed to be uniform along the tunnel circumference with a soil permeability that is isotropic. Numerical simulation results obtained in this paper indicated that partial tunnel leakage in only one side of the shield tunnel caused a greater pore pressure reduction at the tunnel spring line and a larger ground surface settlement than otherwise caused by uniform tunnel leakage with the same rate of water inflow. Indeed, observations showed that partial leakage in only one side of the shield tunnel caused remarkable lateral movements of the tunnel. Our analysis showed that coupling leakage boundary conditions with favorable soil permeability anisotropy could significantly decrease the maximum ground settlements induced by the leakage, which leads to an increase in the width of the surface settlement trough. Furthermore, the effect of soil permeability anisotropy on ground settlement was found more profound for cases involving partial tunnel leakage boundary conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Among such nanomaterials that have attracted tremendous recent interest are carbon dots, which ate small carbon nanoparticles with some form of surface passivation, and graphene quantum dots in various configurations. In this article, we highlight these carbon-based QDs by focusing on their syntheses, on their photoexcited state properties and redox processes, and on their applications as photocatalysts in visible-light carbon dioxide reduction and in water-splitting, as well as on their mechanistic similarities and differences.									55	3	0	7	0	56			1944-8244			WOS:000353931300002	25845394

X-Ray Excited Luminescence Chemical Imaging of Bacterial Growth on Surfaces Implanted in Tissue								ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS				4	6			903	910		10.1002/adhm.201400685			APR 22 2015	2015	A pH sensor film is developed that can be coated on an implant surface and imaged using a combination of X-ray excitation and visible spectroscopy to monitor bacterial infection and treatment of implanted medical devices (IMDs) through tissue. X-ray scintillators in the pH sensor film generate light when an X-ray beam irradiates them. This light first passes through a layer containing pH indicator that alters the spectrum according to pH, then passes through and out of the tissue where it is detected by a spectrometer. A reference region on the film is used to account for spectral distortion from wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering in the tissue. pH images are acquired by moving the sample relative to the X-ray beam and collecting a spectrum at each location, with a spatial resolution limited by the X-ray beam width. Using this X-ray excited luminescence chemical imaging (XELCI) to map pH through ex vivo porcine tissue, a pH drop is detected during normal bacterial growth on the sensor surface, and a restoration of the pH to the bulk value during antibiotic treatment over the course of hours with millimeter resolution. Overall, XELCI provides a novel approach to noninvasively image surface pH for studying implant infections and treatments.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2192-2640	2192-2659		WOS:000353353500011	25611007

Autism and Intellectual Disability-Associated KIRREL3 Interacts with Neuronal Proteins MAP1B and MYO16 with Potential Roles in Neurodevelopment								PLOS ONE				10	4					e0123106	10.1371/journal.pone.0123106			APR 22 2015	2015	Cell-adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily play critical roles in brain development, as well as in maintaining synaptic plasticity, the dysfunction of which is known to cause cognitive impairment. Recently dysfunction of KIRREL3, a synaptic molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental conditions including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and in the neurocognitive delay associated with Jacobsen syndrome. However, the molecular mechanisms of its physiological actions remain largely unknown. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that the KIRREL3 extracellular domain interacts with brain expressed proteins MAP1B and MYO16 and its intracellular domain can potentially interact with ATP1B1, UFC1, and SHMT2. The interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization analyses of proteins expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, mouse neuronal cells, and rat primary neuronal cells. Furthermore, we show KIRREL3 colocalization with the marker for the Golgi apparatus and synaptic vesicles. Previously, we have shown that KIRREL3 interacts with the X-linked intellectual disability associated synaptic scaffolding protein CASK through its cytoplasmic domain. In addition, we found a genomic deletion encompassing MAP1B in one patient with intellectual disability, microcephaly and seizures and deletions encompassing MYO16 in two unrelated patients with intellectual disability, autism and microcephaly. MAP1B has been previously implicated in synaptogenesis and is involved in the development of the actin-based membrane skeleton. MYO16 is expressed in hippocampal neurons and also indirectly affects actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with WAVE1 complex. We speculate KIRREL3 interacting proteins are potential candidates for intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, our findings provide further insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological action of KIRREL3 and its role in neurodevelopment.									4	0	0	3	0	10			1932-6203			WOS:000353331500042	25902260

Pinched flow fractionation (PFF) is a microfluidic technique that utilizes the laminar flow profile to continuously separate particles by size. We demonstrate that the flow-induced inertial lift force in microchannels can be exploited to significantly increase the particle displacement in PFF due to its strong size dependence. This inertia-enhanced PFF (iPFF) technique can offer at least one-order-of-magnitude higher particle throughput than PFF does at the same sheath flow rate. Moreover, it is able to work effectively in a large range of Reynolds number that spans more than 1 order of magnitude in the current study. In addition, iPFF is found to work most effectively in a rectangular microchannel with a width-to-height aspect ratio of around 2.									9	1	0	2	0	10			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000353429200072	25837725

We manufactured Bragg gratings in high (30 mol.%) and low (4 mol.%) alumina content optical fiber using 800 nm femtosecond pulse duration radiation and a phase mask. Grating spectral characteristics and thermal behavior are presented. Index modulations >10(-3) were generated for fundamental pitched Bragg gratings, and >10(-4) for higher-order gratings. Gratings were annealed at temperatures up to 900 C. Type II gratings written in fibers with lower alumina content showed better thermal stability than gratings written in fibers with higher alumina content. Bragg gratings in these fibers would be well suited as laser cavity mirrors in high-energy laser systems, as well as in telecommunication and sensor systems where Brillouin scattering restricts power scaling.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2334-2536			WOS:000354867300007

As a major drawback quantification based on CARS images is compromised by the appearance of a nonresonant background. In this paper we propose and demonstrate a wide-field CARS vibrational phase imaging scheme that allows for nonresonant background suppression. Several CARS images at a few consecutive planes perpendicular to the propagation direction were recorded to reconstruct a phase map utilizing the iteration phase retrieval method. Experimental results verify that the CARS background is efficiently suppressed by the phase imaging approach, as compared to traditional CARS imaging without background correction. The proposed background correction method is robust against environmental disturbance, since the experimental implementation of the suggested detection scheme requires no reference beam.

These new thermoplastics were characterized by H-1 and F-19 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis displayed number average molecular weights (M(n)s) from 9000 to 13,000. Thermal properties of the polymers were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). DSC chromatograms displayed glass transition temperatures (T(g)s) from 11 to 1 degrees C. The onsets of degradations were observed by TGA analysis between 313 to 333 degrees C in air and 326 to 363 degrees C in nitrogen, respectively. A second onset of degradation was observed from 452 to 470 degrees C for all polymers. In addition, crystalline morphologies were studied by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM) and showed needle-like crystallites.

The current study aims to investigate critical Ga-ion dose for Ni-alloy where a transition from grain surface imaging to sputtering dominated Ga-ion channeling occurs. It is observed that critical dose is in the vicinity of 10(15) ions/cm(2). Strong orientation dependent Ga-ion channeling effects were observed at dose values higher than 10(17) ions/cm(2). When a normalized orientation dependent grain transparency factor was estimated for each grain in a limited sampling volume, it was observed that despite low sampling volume for a random polycrystalline orientations and variation in Ga-ion dose, the range of sputter depth variation during Ga-ion channeling remains above 80% indicating dose or sampling volume (for randomly oriented poly-crystals) independency in the sputter dominated dose region. This study attempts to establish a correlation between high resolution imaging, applied Ga-ion dose and orientation dependent Ga-ion beam channeling effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In order to explain the temporal, spatial and compositional variation of water quality of seasonal wetlands, we collected water quality data from forty seasonal wetlands in the lower Blue Ridge and upper Piedmont ecoregions of South Carolina, USA during the wet season of February to April 2011. Results indicated that the surficial hydrological connectivity and surrounding land-use were two key factors controlling variation in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in these seasonal wetlands. In the sites without obvious land use changes (average developed area <0.1%), the DOC (p <0.001, t-test) and TDN (p < 0.05, t-test) of isolated wetlands were significantly higher than that of connected wetlands. However, this phenomenon can be reversed as a result of land use changes. The connected wetlands in more urbanized areas (average developed area = 12.3%) showed higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) (DOC: 11.76 +/- 6.09 mg L-1, TDN: 0.74 +/- 0.22 mg L-1, mean +/- standard error) compared to those in isolated wetlands (DOC: 7.20 +/- 0.62 mg L-1, TDN: 0.20 +/- 0.08 mg L-1). The optical parameters derived from UV and fluorescence also confirmed significant portions of protein-like fractions likely originating from land use changes such as wastewater treatment and livestock pastures. The average of C/N molar ratios of all the wetlands decreased from 77.82 +/- 6.72 (mean standard error) in February to 15.14 +/- 1.58 in April, indicating that the decomposition of organic matter increased with the temperature. Results of this study demonstrate that the water quality of small, seasonal wetlands has a direct and close association with the surrounding environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in adipose tissue metabolism and function in adult male offspring from obese and control fed mothers subjected to an ad libitum feeding challenge. We developed a model in which obese ewes were fed 150% of feed provided for controls from 60 days before mating to term. All ewes were fed to requirements during lactation. After weaning, F1 male offspring were fed only to maintenance requirements until adulthood (control = 7, obese = 6), when they were fed ad libitum for 12 weeks with intake monitored. At the end of the feeding challenge offspring were given an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), necropsied, and adipose tissue collected. During the feeding trial F1obese males consumed more (P < 0.01), gained more weight (P < 0.01) and became heavier (P < 0.05) than F1control males. During IVGTT, Obese F1 offspring were hyperglycemic and hypoinsulinemic (P < 0.01) compared to F1 control F1. At necropsy perirenal and omental adipose depots weights were 47% and 58% greater respectively and subcutaneous fat thickness 41% greater in F1obese vs F1control males (P < 0.05). Adipocyte diameters were greater (P <= 0.04) in perirenal, omental and subcutaneous adipose depots in F1obese males (11, 8 and 7% increase vs. control, respectively). When adipose tissue was incubated for 2 hrs with C-14 labeled acetate, subcutaneous, perirenal, and omental adipose tissue of F1 obese males exhibited greater incorporation (290, 83, and 90% increase vs. control, respectively P < 0.05) of acetate into lipids. Expression of fatty acid transporting, binding, and syntheses mRNA and protein was increased (P < 0.05) compared to F1 control offspring. Maternal obesity increased appetite and adiposity associated with increased adipocyte diameters and increased fatty acid synthesis in over-nourished adult male offspring.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1932-6203			WOS:000353015800043	25875659

However, the combined use of finely ground glass powders with crushed glass aggregates has not been previously explored, as this presents a unique opportunity to not only maximize the use of waste glass in concrete but also potentially address the alkali-silica reaction issues, often associated with the use of crushed glass aggregates in concrete. This study focused on studying the influence of fineness of glass powder in mitigating alkali-silica reaction in mortar specimens containing crushed glass aggregate and a natural reactive aggregate. In these studies the glass powders were used both as a cement replacement material and as an aggregate replacement material. Two different fineness of glass powder were evaluated in this study, with an average particle size of 17 and 70 microns. Mortar bars prepared with glass powder as aggregate replacement material at 10%, 20% and 30% replacement levels were evaluated in the standard ASTM C1260 test method. Mortar bars prepared with glass powder as cement replacement material at 10% and 20% were evaluated in the standard ASTM C1567 test method. The results from these studies showed that the finer glass powder showed significantly improved ability to mitigate ASR, particularly when used as an aggregate replacement material, both in the case of crushed glass and natural reactive aggregates. This study shows that an aggregate comprised of 100% glass material can be produced without any deleterious consequences of alkali-silica reaction, provided sufficient quantity of fine glass powder is used in the mixture.

In this work, we report the preparation and thermoelectric study of SiGe-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) nanocomposites prepared by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). We experimentally investigated the reduction of lattice thermal conductivity (kappa(L)) in the temperature range (30-800 K) of n-type Si80Ge20P2 alloys with the incorporation of YSZ nanoparticles (20-40 nm diameter) into the Si-Ge matrix. These samples synthesized by using the SPS technique were found to have densities > 95% of the theoretical density. The thermal conductivity, at both low and high temperatures, was measured by steady state and laser flash techniques, respectively. At room temperature, we observed approximately a 50% reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity as result of adding 10% YSZ by volume to the Si80Ge20P2 host matrix. A phenomenological model developed by Callaway was used to corroborate both the temperature dependence and reduction of kappa(L) over the measured temperature range (30-800 K) of both Si80Ge20P2 and Si80Ge20P2 + YSZ samples. The observed kappa(L) is discussed and interpreted in terms of various phonon scattering mechanisms such as alloy disorder, the Umklapp phonon scattering, and boundary scattering. In addition, a contribution from the phonon scattering by YSZ nanoparticles was further included to account for the kappa(L) of Si80Ge20P2 + YSZ sample. The theoretical calculations are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental results for both the Si80Ge20P2 and Si80Ge20P2 + YSZ alloys.

Rather than using the traditional portmanteau tests based on the sample autocorrelation function, we propose a test based on the Cauchy estimator of correlation. A goodness-of-fit statistic for fitted autoregressive moving average models is also derived and the asymptotic distribution of this statistic is quantified. The test can be employed using either this asymptotic distribution or by using Monte-Carlo quantiles. The small sample behaviour is studied via simulation and the Monte-Carlo-based test seems to be more precise. The method is demonstrated on monthly asset returns for Facebook, Incorporated.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0094-9655	1563-5163		WOS:000347703300012

Specifically, we investigate 3(rd)-6(th) generation (G3-G6) PAMAM dendrimers and GrO with different levels of oxidation. The work is motivated by the potential applications of these emerging nanomaterials in removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants from water. Our experimental results indicate that GrO outperforms dendrimers in removing naphthalene from water. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the prominent factors driving naphthalene association to these seemingly disparate materials are similar. Interestingly, we find that cooperative interactions between the naphthalene molecules play a significant role in enhancing their association to the dendrimers and GrO. Our findings highlight that while selection of appropriate materials is important, the interactions between the contaminants themselves can also be important in governing the effectiveness of a given material. The combined use of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations allows us to comment on the possible factors resulting in better performance of GrO in removing polyaromatic contaminants from water.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000352659000058	25786141

On account of the accidental degeneracy that appears in the single-particle spectrum, the Coulomb interaction favors the apparition of an itinerant antiferromagnetic (IAF) order characterized by a fractional polarization of fixed spatial orientation. Within the Hartree-Fock approximation, we obtain numerical results that describe the temperature evolution of the order parameter in the IAF state and determine the critical temperature of the transition to the paramagnetic state.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000352256300005

It is well known that incorporation of additional smaller cores in the cladding can be used to resonantly out-couple higher-order modes from a main core to suppress higher-order-mode propagation in the main core. Using a novel design with multiple coupled smaller cores in the cladding, we have successfully demonstrated a single-mode photonic bandgap fiber with record effective mode area of similar to 2650 mu m(2). Detailed numeric studies have been conducted for multiple cladding designs. For the optimal designs, the simulated minimum higher-order-mode losses are well over two orders of magnitudes higher than that of fundamental mode when expressed in dBs. To our knowledge, this is the best higher-order-mode suppression ever found in fibers with this large effective mode areas. We have also experimentally validated one of the designs. M-2<1.08 across the transmission band was demonstrated. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America									8	0	0	0	0	8			1094-4087			WOS:000352290000114	25968749

As models of the strongly and weakly interacting graphene, we investigated two systems, graphene on Ru(0001) and Pt(111), respectively. The experimental data for Ar and Xe are compared with the results from theoretical simulations based on the classical smooth surface model. For gr/Pt(111) we find that the scattering pattern of the rare-gas beam, including the Debye-Waller attenuation of the He beam, are quite similar to that from highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG); this suggests that the graphene-Pt(111) interaction is much like a van der Waals interaction. On the contrary, for the gr/Ru(0001) system, we find a smaller Debye-Waller attenuation and a larger surface effective mass, indicating that graphene on Ru(0001) is tightly bonded to the substrate. Furthermore, asymmetrical spectral shapes in the Ar and Xe scattering spectra from gr/Ru(0001) are interpreted as a result of the lateral distribution of the interlayer interaction corresponding to the moire pattern. It is found that the "valley" region of the moire pattern has high effective mass reflecting stronger bonding to the substrate, contributing to the high reflectivity of the He beam reported for this system. On the other hand, the effective mass of the "hill" region is found to be similar to that of HOPG, indicating that this region is well decoupled from the substrate. These results demonstrate a unique capability of atom scattering to probe and evaluate the molecule-substrate interaction and its spatial distributions.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000352188700005

Journal of Insect Science (Tucson)				15				23	23					Apr 5 2015	2015	A 3-yr study (2009-2011) was conducted to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of stink bugs in three commercial farmscapes. Study locations were replicated in South Carolina and Georgia, in an agriculturally diverse region known as the southeastern coastal plain. Crops included wheat, Triticum aestivum (L.), corn, Zea mays (L.), soybean, Glycine max (L.), cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.), and peanut, Arachis hypogaea (L.). Farmscapes were sampled weekly using whole-plant examinations for corn, with all other crops sampled using sweep nets. The predominant pest species of phytophagous stink bugs were the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say), the green stink bug, Chinavia hilaris (Say), and the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.). Chi-square tests indicated a departure from a normal distribution in 77% of analyses of the variance to mean ratio, with 37% of slopes of Taylor's power law and 30% of coefficient [beta] of Iwao's patchiness regression significantly greater than one, indicating aggregated distributions. Spatial Analyses by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) indicated aggregated patterns of stink bugs in 18% of year-end totals and 42% of weekly counts, with 80% of adults and nymphs positively associated using the SADIE association tool. Maximum stink bug densities in each crop occurred when the plants were producing fruit. Stink bugs exhibited greater densities in crops adjacent to soybean in Barnwell and Lee Counties compared with crops adjacent to corn or fallow areas. The diversity of crops and relatively small size of fields in the Southeast leads to colonization of patches within a farmscape. The ecological and management implications of the spatial and temporal distribution of stink bugs within farmscapes are discussed.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1536-2442			ZOOREC:ZOOR15107047412

This article presents two different retrofit designs based directly on the FEMA P-807 Guidelines that were examined at several different seismic intensity levels. The effects of the retrofits on damage to the upper stories were investigated. The results from the hybrid testing verify that designs following the FEMA P-807 Guidelines meet specified performance levels and appear to successfully prevent collapse at significantly higher seismic intensity levels well beyond for which they were designed. Based on the test results presented in this article, it is recommended that the soft-story-only retrofit procedure can be followed when financial or other constraints limit the retrofit from bringing the soft-story building up to current code or applying performance-based procedures.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1363-2469	1559-808X		WOS:000352298500003

Practitioners need examples to better understand conditions necessary to move forward with digital media and learning (DML) in schools. This article provides examples and supports research proposing that context and culture matter when innovating in schools. Three classroom cases using Web 2.0, app development, and game design are discussed, offering educators a pathway to consider similar pedagogical and participatory approaches to foster learning. Classroom contexts, teachers' perspectives, district supports, technical requirements, and scalability are highlighted. The examples suggest innovative DML initiatives can flourish within schools when participants are mindful of context and when a participatory culture is supported (Jenkins, Clinton, Purushotma, Robison, & Weigel, 2006).									2	0	0	0	0	2			0040-5841	1543-0421		WOS:000353493200005

A total of 36 volatile compounds of the mangosteen wines were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-pulsed flame photometric detection. A total of 35 odour-active compounds were identified by gas chromatography-olfactometry analysis and by the detection frequency (DF) method. The compounds with high DF values included ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate and 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol. Principal component analysis was used to characterise the differences of the flavour profiles of those mangosteen wines. The result demonstrated that the samples could be divided into three groups that were associated closely with aroma-active compounds.									2	1	0	1	0	3			1478-6419	1478-6427		WOS:000351907000011	25428208

Participants: The sample was composed of 331 student clients who utilized a college counseling center from August 2007 to August 2009. The college is a public, mid-size, urban university in the Southeast. Methods: Motivation was measured at intake by a self-report of change readiness item. A quantitative study that employed a 5-group, pretest-posttest design included 331 student participants. Counseling outcome was measured using the Outcome Questionnaire 45.2. Results: As assigned by the clients' self-report of change readiness, counseling outcome for 5 motivation groups differed significantly (p = .004; alpha < .05). Compulsory participation in counseling was treated as a possible confound and was not a significant factor in counseling outcome (p = .268; alpha < .05). Conclusions: Participants' initial self-report of motivation was significantly associated with counseling outcome.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0744-8481	1940-3208		WOS:000350954900001	25580833

To do so, I have studied the Quartiere Tiburtino in Rome, one of the most influential housing developments of Italian-neorealism, from an expanded cultural perspective, understanding it as an design exercise that recovers the realm of everyday life for architecture, through the pre-modern concept of mimesis and, simultaneously, incorporating the notion of the simulacrum as a legitimate cultural construction. I have examined in detail the various mimetic processes - linguistic, technological and typological-, through which the Quartiere Tiburtino deals with the living conditions of urban immigrants from rural areas of Italy; and the creation of a social simulation of great complexity - the invention of a shared urban identity for the new inhabitants of the neighborhood, which becomes the most significant contribution of the project to the debate about the possibilities of architecture as a social and politically engaged practice.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2341-3050	2341-2747		WOS:000361699100005

Advancements in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have led to increased testing of transplantation recipients' children and parents as potential donors related to an increase in the use of haploidentical transplantations. This testing opens the door for an increased incidence of misattributed paternity findings.Objectives: This article attempts to address the ethical conflicts and provide potential solutions to assist in the transition from individual-focused care to family-focused care.Methods: The principlist approach was used.Findings: Healthcare providers should be educated on methods of incidental finding disclosure and how to provide adequate support for those individuals.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1092-1095	1538-067X		WOS:000352449700020	25840388	
J	Crouch, Elizabeth; Dickes, Lori A.								A Prediction Model of Childhood Immunization Rates								APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY				13	2			243	251		10.1007/s40258-015-0157-6			APR 2015	2015	Background This research begins by providing background on the status and literature of childhood immunization in the USA. Vaccine-preventable diseases have been on the rise in Europe and the USA in the last few years. Cases of measles and pertussis have all been increasing at alarming rates. The article begins with a discussion of the use of immunization exemptions across the states and a brief history of US immunization policy. A review of the literature confirms that socioeconomic status and other demographic characteristics can be important predictors of childhood vaccine uptake.Aim Given the seriousness of this public health issue, the primary objective of this research is to analyze the determinants of a child in the USA being fully vaccinated.Methods A range of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, along with data from the National Immunization Survey, are used to develop an immunization prediction model. Logistic regression is the chosen method in determining whether a preschool-age child in the USA today is likely to be vaccinated based on various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.Results Model results reveal a number of significant socioeconomic and demographic characteristics that contribute to the likelihood of a child being immunized. The overall logistic regression model was highly significant at the 5 % level and model parameters are significant. Significant variables in the model include categories of educational attainment, first born child, race and ethnicity, age of mother, and census region. This model does not definitively reveal that later born children are less likely to get fully vaccinated than first born children but does confirm the significance of geography in immunization outcomes. All levels of education were found to be significant along with all census regions.Conclusions Overall, these models reveal that demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are predictors of childhood immunization and if leveraged appropriately can assist policy makers and public health officials to understand immunization rates and craft policy to improve them.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1175-5652	1179-1896		WOS:000360468600013	25672824

A collection in the Florida Panhandle in 1954 represented the first record east of the Mississippi River; the first record from peninsular Florida was 2001. The membracid has remained known in southeastern states only from Florida and Louisiana, with scant data available on its bionomics. We give the first records of V. segmentata from Alabama and Georgia, noting features that distinguish it from other species of Vanduzea in the Southeast, and review its previously published U.S. distribution and plant associations. We found nymphs and adults mainly on mimosa, or silk tree (Albizia julibrissin Durazz.; Fabaceae), but other fabaceous species and composites (Asteraceae) also were hosts. Periodic sampling of mimosa in southeastern Georgia indicated that the membracid is trivoltine, with overwintered eggs beginning to hatch in mid-March and first-generation adults appearing by late April. Early instars of the first generation fed initially on buds and later on unfolded leaflets and young stems. Nymphs of following generations also fed on vegetative parts and on surfaces of green fruits (pods) and peduncles (stalks) of brown pods. Adults, and in some years nymphs, were present until late November. Vanduzea segmentata primarily was tended by the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr). On mimosa, it was typically found in small aggregations of 2-6 individuals, although considerably larger aggregations can be found on herbaceous hosts. The membracid's eastern range expansion might have been facilitated by the abundance of mimosa and other adventive plants with extrafloral nectaries, and the presence of L. humile, a South American ant that establishes mutualisms with honeydew-producing hemipterans and might be more efficient at protecting them from predators and competitors than are native ants.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000356158100005

(R.) faceta (Say, 1825) are infrequently collected pentatomine stink bugs. They have been assumed to be grass feeders, but specific hosts in the Poaceae were unknown. During fieldwork (North Dakota to Oklahoma) from 2011 to 2014, nymphs and adults of C. belfragii were taken on a chloridoid grass, prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Bosc ex Link), in saline wetlands. Chlorochroa faceta developed on another chloridoid, saltgrass (Distichlis spicata [L.] Greene), and was syntopic with C. belfragii in four saline wetlands in eastern Nebraska. Oklahoma is a new state record for C. faceta. Fieldwork and historical collection records indicate that both pentatomids are found mainly in inland saline communities. Because C. belfragii can be found in and under cordgrass leaf litter, the bug seldom can be collected by sweeping, which probably accounts for the small numbers of specimens in museum collections. Chlorochroa faceta can be collected by sweeping saltgrass when stems of this sod former mostly are erect rather than reclining (mat-forming). Color images of the fifth instar and adult of both pentatomids are provided.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000356158100013

Among species of Cedusa, only the nymph and nymphal habitat of C. inflata (Ball) is currently known. Here we report fifth-instar nymphs of Cedusa hedusa McAtee, subsequently reared to adult, collected from mats of the moss Polytrichum commune Hedw. (Bryophyta: Polytrichaceae) in Alabama. We describe and illustrate the fifth instar and provide information on the nymphal habitat. Additional study is needed to determine if nymphs of C. hedusa feed on fungi within mats of P. commune or the moss itself, as well as oviposition sites and feeding preferences of the adults.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000356158100014

Relevant diagnostic concepts								APPLIED ACOUSTICS				90				74	80		10.1016/j.apacoust.2014.10.014			APR 1 2015	2015	Recycling and retreading is critical for reducing costs and energy consumption for the manufacture of tire casings. An effective retread requires tire casings with good structural integrity and no internal damage. This paper presents an impulse-acoustic nondestructive technique to investigate internal defects in rubber steel composites such as truck tires. The technique employs a light impactor that taps the structure to be inspected, measuring the impact force with a load cell and analyzing the resulting sound recorded with a microphone in order to discriminate defective regions from defect free regions. Acoustic signatures of both the defective and non-defective side walls of a tire were recorded. The acoustic signatures of were analyzed and the peak amplitude and decay rates demonstrated a suitable correlation in the presence of internal delaminations. This paper seeks to presents an understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the individual measurement and analysis techniques. The results of this investigation show that the acoustic responses can be used to identify the presence of internal delaminations and also may potentially be used to determine their size and location. The effort is part of a project to develop an automated inspection system for truck tires to determine the integrity of the base structure before a retreading operation is performed.

An Empirical Examination of IT Professionals								JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS				16	4			281	313					APR 2015	2015	This paper investigates the role of professionalism in the information technology (IT) workforce. We develop a model that describes how professionalism relates to attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors among IT professionals. Specifically, we hypothesize that dimensions of professionalism influence attitudes (including intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment), perceived job alternatives, job performance, and turnover. We test the research model with data, which includes supervisor evaluations and actual turnover data drawn from 214 IT professionals. Results show that some dimensions of professionalism demonstrate a positive relationship with intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, and job performance. Other dimensions have no effect or positively influence awareness of job alternatives, driving turnover intention. As the IT workforce grows increasingly professional, managers may benefit from more satisfied, harder-working IT personnel at the cost of having a workforce more connected to the labor market.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1536-9323	1558-3457		WOS:000357681300003

Effects of the in ovo injection of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on the yolk and serum characteristics of male and female broiler embryos								POULTRY SCIENCE				94	4			734	739		10.3382/ps/pev017			APR 2015	2015	Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D-3] in broiler embryos at 19 d of incubation (doi) have been shown to increase 3 times by the in ovo injection of 0.60 mu g 25(OH)D-3 on 18 doi. In this trial, effects of the injection of 25(OH)D-3 at 18 doi on the yolks and sera of male and female Ross x Ross 708 broiler embryos were assessed. On 18 doi, embryonated eggs that were set in a single stage incubator were assigned to 6 replicate trays within each of 2 injection treatment groups. Treatments included those injected with 100 mu L commercial diluent (control) and those injected with 0.60 mu g 25(OH)D-3 in 100 mu L commercial diluent. On 19 doi, embryos and their yolk sacs were extracted for determination of sex, yolk weight, BW, serum CA and phosphorous concentrations, and yolk CA, phosphorous, moisture, dry matter, and lipid concentrations. The weight of female embryos with their attached yolk sacs as a percentage of set egg weight was greater than that of males (P = 0.03). There were treatment x sex interactions for the weight of embryos with their attached yolk sacs relative to 19 doi egg weight (P = 0.05) and for yolk CA concentration (P = 0.004). In eggs that received 25(OH)D-3, the weight of female embryos with their attached yolk sacs relative to 19 doi egg weight was higher than that of males (P = 0.005), and percentage yolk CA was higher in control eggs containing female embryos in comparison to those containing males (P = 0.007). An injection of 0.60 mu g 25(OH)D-3 at 18 doi eliminated yolk CA differences associated with embryo sex, suggesting that 25(OH)D-3 may influence sex-related differences in the rate of yolk CA absorption by broiler embryos and may be related to subsequent sex-related differences in posthatch bone strength.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000353347100022	25691758

The effect of wicking fibres in tissue-engineered bone scaffolds								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				9	4			469	472		10.1002/term.1937			APR 2015	2015	The major limitation of large tissue-engineered constructs used for bone regeneration is the lack of vasculature and, therefore, lack of transport of essential nutrients, chemical factors and progenitor cells. Research approaches to improve the transport properties of large scaffolds focus on using angiogenic factors and vasculogenic cells to create new vasculature; however, the slow rate of vessel formation and reliance on vessel self-assembly in these approaches is problematic. In this study, a novel approach has been proposed, using proprietary engineered wicking' fibres of non-circular cross-section that provide highly efficient transport for fluid and cells. The effect of wicking fibres on the movement of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated protein in a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel system was analysed. The results indicated that the rate of diffusion of the fluorescent protein was greatly enhanced in hydrogels that contained wicking fibres in comparison to those that did not. The movement of progenitor cells along wicking fibres and round fibres was assessed. This study demonstrated that wicking fibres enhance the movement of critical growth factors and progenitor cells central for bone regeneration. The results suggested that the incorporation of wicking fibres into large tissue-engineered constructs may improve the transport of growth factors and progenitor cells essential for bone formation.

J	Kahn, Bruce E.								Patterning Processes for Flexible Electronics								PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE				103	4	SI		497	517		10.1109/JPROC.2015.2401553			APR 2015	2015	Patterning functional materials is one of the key technologies to enable flexible electronics. In almost every flexible electronic device, individual materials and layers need to be patterned. Moreover, the importance of patterning is probably second only to materials properties in fabricated flexible functional devices. Frequently, patterning is one of the limiting factors in device performance. Flexible electronics depends upon the ability to construct layers of materials having precisely defined architectures and relationships on flexible supports. These structures require the ability to either deposit (additive) or remove (subtractive) materials in a locally controlled fashion (patterning). There are many techniques that have been used to accomplish the patterning of materials on flexible supports. In general, these patterning techniques have either been derived or adapted from conventional electronics processing, from printing processes, or from a hybrid of both. The appropriate choice of patterning technique will depend upon many considerations, including feature size, area of coverage, throughput, registration, environment, position in the overall device structure, and material considerations. Many, if not most device structures will require the use of multiple different patterning techniques. The purpose of this paper is to review the major patterning techniques that have been used for flexible electronics, and to discuss the unique features, advantages, and disadvantages of each. The focus will be on large area, high throughput, additive deposition techniques that can be performed in ambient conditions.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0018-9219	1558-2256		WOS:000355250200003

The influence of erosive temperature on the erosion wear resistance and erosion mechanism of 3 mol-% yttria-stabilised zirconia ceramic at the impact angle of 90 degrees is investigated. The results show that material removal rate of volume erosion wear of 3 mol-% yttria-stabilised zirconia ceramics increases with rising temperature. The erosion rate increases slowly between room temperature and 600 degrees C. The 3 mol-% increases rapidly between 800 and 1200 degrees C. The maximum erosion rate of 0.55 mm(3) g(-1) is found at 1200 degrees C. The increase of the erosion wear rate is because of the decrease of the mechanical properties at high temperatures. The erosion wear mechanism of 3 mol-% yttria-stabilised zirconia ceramics is temperature-dependent, which is mainly plastic deformation below 800 degrees C and mainly cracking in irregular crisscross patterns leading to the flaky exfoliation of material, between 800 and 1400 degrees C. The results provide an insight into the mechanism of material damage and failure of advanced ceramics by high temperature erosion.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8917	1433-075X		WOS:000354957900080

Simulator-Based Assessment of Haptic Surgical Skill: A Comparative Study								SURGICAL INNOVATION				22	2			183	188		10.1177/1553350614537119			APR 2015	2015	The aim of this study was to examine if the forces applied by users of a haptic simulator could be used to distinguish expert surgeons from novices. Seven surgeons with significant operating room expertise and 9 novices with no surgical experience participated in this study. The experimental task comprised exploring 4 virtual materials with the haptic device and learning the precise forces required to compress the materials to various depths. The virtual materials differed in their stiffness and force-displacement profiles. The results revealed that for nonlinear virtual materials, surgeons applied significantly greater magnitudes of force than novices. Furthermore, for the softer nonlinear and linear materials, surgeons were significantly more accurate in reproducing forces than novices. The results of this study suggest that the magnitudes of force measured using haptic simulators may be used to objectively differentiate experts' haptic skill from that of novices. This knowledge can inform the design of virtual reality surgical simulators and lead to the future incorporation of haptic skills training in medical school curricula.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1553-3506	1553-3514		WOS:000354569300012	25053621

In particular, the newly on market Microsoft Windows 8 (TM) operating system adopts such an alternative authentication to complement its traditional text-based authentication. We present an empirical analysis of picture gesture authentication on more than 10,000 picture passwords collected from more than 800 subjects through online user studies. Based on the findings of our user studies, we propose a novel attack framework that is capable of cracking passwords on previously unseen pictures in a picture gesture authentication system. Our approach is based on the concept of selection function that models users' thought processes in selecting picture passwords. Our evaluation results show the proposed approach could crack a considerable portion of picture passwords under different settings. Based on the empirical analysis and attack results, we comparatively evaluate picture gesture authentication using a set of criteria for a better understanding of its advantages and limitations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1094-9224	1557-7406		WOS:000354046900002

One of the most common sources of oxidative damage is metal-generated hydroxyl radical; however, very little research has focused on determining the metal-binding abilities and structural attributes that affect oxidative damage prevention by sulfur and selenium compounds. In this review, we describe our ongoing investigations into sulfur and selenium antioxidant prevention of iron- and copper-mediated oxidative DNA damage. We determined that many sulfur and selenium compounds inhibit Cu-I-mediated DNA damage and that DNA damage prevention varies dramatically when Fe-II is used in place of Cu-I to generate hydroxyl radical. Oxidation potentials of the sulfur or selenium compounds do not correlate with their ability to prevent DNA damage, highlighting the importance of metal coordination rather than reactive oxygen species scavenging as an antioxidant mechanism. Additional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and UV-visible studies confirmed sulfur and selenium antioxidant binding to Cu-I and Fe-II. Ultimately, our studies established that both the hydroxyl-radical-generating metal ion and the chemical environment of the sulfur or selenium significantly affect DNA damage prevention and that metal coordination is an essential mechanism for these antioxidants.

J	Freeman, Paul; Rodriguez, Julio; Wagner, John; Switzer, Fred; Alexander, Kim; Pidgeon, Philip								Validation of a fixed-base automotive simulator for run-off-road safety and recovery training								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING				229	5			574	589		10.1177/0954407014547747			APR 2015	2015	Traffic fatalities and injuries continue to demand the attention of researchers and governments across the world as they remain significant factors in public health and safety. Enhanced legislature, together with vehicle and roadway technology, has helped to reduce the impact of traffic crashes in many scenarios. However, one specifically troublesome area of traffic safety which persists is the run-off-road crash where a vehicle's wheels leave the paved portion of the roadway and begin to travel on the shoulder or side of the road. Large percentages of fatal and injury traffic crashes are attributed to run-off-road events. One of the most critical reasons why run-off-road scenarios quickly evolve into serious crashes is poor driver performance. Drivers are unprepared to handle the situation safely and often execute dangerous maneuvers, such as overcorrection, which can lead to devastating results. One countermeasure which directly addresses the driver performance is driver education and training. In this article, a simulator-based driving environment is proposed specifically for run-off-road recovery training. A human subject study is used to validate the simulator as an effective tool for replicating the run-off-road experience with the additional benefit of receiving insight into driver reactions to run-off-road events. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results of subjective questionnaire data and objective performance evaluation parameters show strong correlations to run-off-road crash data and previous run-off-road study conclusions. In particular, higher vehicle velocities, curved roads, and larger differences between the friction coefficient of the road and the friction coefficient of the shoulder all negatively impacted drivers' recoveries from run-off-road scenarios. The only nonsignificant impact found was that of the roadway edge, indicating a possible limitation of the simulator system with respect to that particular environment variable. The validation study provides a foundation for further evaluation and development of a simulator-based run-off-road recovery training program to help to equip drivers with the skills to recognize and recover safely from this dangerous and often deadly scenario.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0954-4070	2041-2991		WOS:000353986400004

Age and Productivity: An Empirical Study of Early American Artists								SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL				81	4			1096	1116		10.1002/soej.12050			APR 2015	2015	Economist David Galenson, using both statistical and anecdotal methods, divides artists into two types, innovative or conceptual (who peak at younger ages) and experimental (peaking at older ages), to investigate how age is related to creativity. This well-known distinction has met with criticism and alternative theories of artistic productivity. We here extend Galenson's formal statistical methods to a new sample of American artists born prior to 1900, a period when according to Galenson, most American artists can be identified as experimental. Specifically, we explore the use of quantitative and qualitative analysis to shed light on the relationship between age and artistic productivity. We investigate whether this classification has substantial explanatory power for the age at which the most important artistic work is achieved over the life cycle. Our results do not support the bifurcation but indicate that a number of factors must be used in any life cycle investigation linking age to artistic creativity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-4038	2325-8012		WOS:000353962600014

Bench-scale evaluation of aerosol delivery for biostimulation and bioaugmentation in the vadose zone								BIODEGRADATION				26	2			91	103		10.1007/s10532-015-9718-5			APR 2015	2015	Aerosol delivery was evaluated for distributing biostimulation and bioaugmentation amendments in vadose zones. This technique involves transporting amendments as micron-scale aerosol droplets in injected gas. Microcosm experiments were designed to characterize reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene (TCE) under unsaturated conditions when delivering components as aerosols. Delivering amendments and/or microbes as aqueous aerosols resulted in complete dechlorination of TCE, similar to controls operated under saturated conditions. Reductive dechlorination was achieved with manual injection of a bioaugmentation culture suspended in soybean oil into microcosms. However, aerosol delivery of the culture in soybean oil induced little reductive dechlorination activity. Overall, the results indicate that delivery as aqueous aerosols may be a viable option for delivery of amendments to enhance vadose zone bioremediation at the field-scale.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0923-9820	1572-9729		WOS:000352279300001	25636240

J	Dwyer, Gerald P.								The economics of Bitcoin and similar private digital currencies								JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY				17		SI		81	91		10.1016/j.jfs.2014.11.006			APR 2015	2015	Recent innovations have made it feasible to transfer private digital currency without the intervention of an organization such as a bank. Any currency must prevent users from spending their balances more than once, which is easier said than done with purely digital currencies. Current digital currencies such as Bitcoin use peer-to-peer networks and open source software to stop double spending and create finality of transactions. This paper explains how the use of these technologies and limitation of the quantity produced can create an equilibrium in which a digital currency has a positive value. This paper also summarizes the rise of 2417 trading on computerized markets in Bitcoin in which there are no brokers or other agents. The average monthly volatility of returns on Bitcoin is higher than for gold or a set of foreign currencies in dollars, but the lowest monthly volatilities for Bitcoin are less than the highest monthly volatilities for gold and the foreign currencies.

Grain boundaries in these materials have nanoscale spatial dimensions, which can generate substantial resistance to ionic transport due to dopant segregation. Here, we report the concept of targeted phase formation in a Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta-CoFe2O4 composite that serves to enhance the grain boundary ionic conductivity. Using transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy approaches, we probe the grain boundary charge distribution and chemical environments altered by the phase reaction between the two constituents. The formation of an emergent phase successfully avoids segregation of the Gd dopant and depletion of oxygen vacancies at the Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta-Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta grain boundary. This results in superior grain boundary ionic conductivity as demonstrated by the enhanced oxygen permeation flux. This work illustrates the control of mesoscale level transport properties in mixed ionic-electronic conductor composites through processing induced modifications of the grain boundary defect distribution.									28	0	0	0	0	28			2041-1723			WOS:000353703200003	25857355

First, the cultural and structural features of one striving' institution are outlined. Then, I illustrate how faculty members asserted agency inside their striving university in ways intended to disrupt the structures and cultures that striving universities produce. Forms of faculty agency included negotiating, critiquing and resisting. The work is relevant to those who study the academic profession; those who provide support and professional development to contemporary academics, especially academics serving inside striving universities; and, finally, to those interested in the study and possibility of human agency inside a higher education field that is marked by the pressures of both fiscal and cultural markets.									1	0	1	0	0	1			0141-1926	1469-3518		WOS:000353243800007

This paper introduces a new compact design for cancelling this parasitic inductance that makes use of magnetic coupling between vias, as well as between coplanar traces. This design is intended for use on PCBs with more than two layers, and is an extension of the designs presented in the recent paper by the authors, "Parasitic Inductance Cancellation for Surface Mount Shunt Capacitor Filters." Implementations of the new design are shown to exhibit similar filtering performance to comparable implementations of previously published designs, while requiring nearly 40% less board area. Additionally, implementations of the design are demonstrated to be effective in the practical situation of filtering the noise due to crosstalk on a four-layer board.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9375	1558-187X		WOS:000353065900014

The pay raise is larger when incumbent executives have greater employment mobility in the labor market, when companies lose senior executives, and when job-hopping executives receive favorable job offers in their new firms. A company's subsequent pay raise to incumbent executives after losing an executive diminishes its deficiency in executive compensation relative to its industry peer firms, and is effective at retaining its incumbent executives. Overall, our evidence suggests that executive job-hopping activity has significant effects on firms' compensation policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As part of a region-wide resistance-monitoring program that investigated 1,890 B. cinerea isolates from 189 fields in 10 states of the United States, we identified seven isolates (0.4%) from five locations in four different states with unprecedented resistance to all seven Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) codes with single-site modes of action including FRAC 1, 2, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 17 registered in the United States for gray mold control. Resistance to thiophanate-methyl, iprodione, boscalid, pyraclostrobin, and fenhexamid was based on target gene mutations that conferred E198A and F200Y in P-tubulin, I365N/S in Bosl, H272R/Y in SdhB, G143A in Cytb, and T63I and F412S in Erg27. Isolates were grouped into MDRI and MDRlh phenotypes based on sensitivity to fludioxonil and variations in transcription factor mrrl. MDRlh isolates had a previously described 3-bp deletion at position 497 in mrrl. Expression of ABC transporter atrB was increased in MDRI isolates but highest in MDRlh isolates. None of the isolates with seven single resistances (SR) had identical nucleotide variations in target genes, indicating that they emerged independently. Multifungicide resistance phenotypes did not exhibit significant fitness penalties for the parameters used in this study, but MDRlh isolates produced more sclerotia at low temperatures and exhibited increased sensitivity to salt stress. In this study we show that current resistance management strategies have not been able to prevent the geographically independent development of resistance to all seven site-specific fungicides currently registered for gray mold control in the United States and document the presence of MDRlh in North America.									11	0	0	7	0	11			0031-949X	1943-7684		WOS:000352979600003	25317841

However, transportation of large amounts of sludge from wastewater treatment facilities to a biorefinery is expensive. The objective of this paper is to identify the proper transportation mode to use as a function of the volume shipped and transportation distances. Currently, sludge is mainly shipped by truck and pipeline. We estimated that the fixed and variable cost components of pipeline transportation for a volume such as 480 m(3)/day and a distance of 100 miles are $0.116/m(3) and $0.089/m(3)/mile, respectively. We estimated the biomass (sludge) transportation cost per gallon of biodiesel, and observed the changes in these costs as a function of distance traveled and volume shipped. The outcomes of this study have the potential to help biofuel plants make better biomass transportation decisions, and consequently reduce the price of biodiesel significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, newborn lambs born to OB vs control-fed (CON, 100% of NRC) ewes exhibited greater adiposity, increased blood cortisol, insulin and glucose and the elimination of the postnatal leptin spike seen in lambs born to CON ewes. This early postnatal leptin peak is necessary for the development of hypothalamic circuits, which program appetite in later life. This study evaluated the multigenerational impact of OB on insulin: glucose dynamics of mature female F1 offspring fed only to requirements throughout gestation and on their lambs (F2 generation).DESIGN AND METHODS: Adult F1 female offspring born to OB (n = 10) or CON (n = 7) ewes were utilized. All F1 ewes were subjected to a glucose tolerance test at midgestation and late gestation. Jugular blood was obtained from F2 lambs at birth (day 1) through postnatal day 11, and plasma glucose, insulin, cortisol and leptin concentrations were determined. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was utilized to determine bone mineral density, bone mineral content, lean tissue mass and fat tissue mass.RESULTS: Fasted blood glucose and insulin concentrations were greater (P<0.05) in OBF1 than CONF1 ewes at midgestation and late gestation. Further, after glucose infusion, both glucose and insulin concentrations remained higher in OBF1 ewes (P<0.05) than CONF1 ewes, demonstrating greater insulin resistance. Blood concentrations of glucose, insulin and cortisol and adiposity were higher (P<0.01) in OBF2 lambs than CONF2 lambs at birth. Importantly, OBF2 lambs failed to exhibit the early postnatal leptin peak exhibited by CONF2 lambs.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that these OBF2 lambs are predisposed to exhibit the same metabolic alterations as their mothers, suggesting a multigenerational programming effect.									7	0	0	7	0	7			0307-0565	1476-5497		WOS:000352557500021	25354845	
J	Simar, Leopold; Wilson, Paul W.								Statistical Approaches for Non-parametric Frontier Models: A Guided Tour								INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW				83	1			77	110		10.1111/insr.12056			APR 2015	2015	A rich theory of production and analysis of productive efficiency has developed since the pioneering work by Tjalling C. Koopmans and Gerard Debreu. Michael J. Farrell published the first empirical study, and it appeared in a statistical journal (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society), even though the article provided no statistical theory. The literature in econometrics, management sciences, operations research and mathematical statistics has since been enriched by hundreds of papers trying to develop or implement new tools for analysing productivity and efficiency of firms. Both parametric and non-parametric approaches have been proposed. The mathematical challenge is to derive estimators of production, cost, revenue or profit frontiers, which represent, in the case of production frontiers, the optimal loci of combinations of inputs (like labour, energy and capital) and outputs (the products or services produced by the firms). Optimality is defined in terms of various economic considerations. Then the efficiency of a particular unit is measured by its distance to the estimated frontier. The statistical problem can be viewed as the problem of estimating the support of a multivariate random variable, subject to some shape constraints, in multiple dimensions. These techniques are applied in thousands of papers in the economic and business literature. This guided tour' reviews the development of various non-parametric approaches since the early work of Farrell. Remaining challenges and open issues in this challenging arena are also described.

J	Czech, Christopher; Guarneri, Paolo; Thyagaraja, Niranjan; Fadel, Georges								Systematic Design Optimization of the Metamaterial Shear Beam of a Nonpneumatic Wheel for Low Rolling Resistance								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				137	4					041404	10.1115/1.4029518			APR 2015	2015	Systematic engineering of components that employ metamaterials has expanded the mechanical design field in recent years. Yet, topology optimization remains a burdensome tool to utilize within a systematic engineering paradigm. In this work, the design of a metamaterial shear beam for a nonpneumatic wheel using a systematic, two-level design approach is discussed. A top-level design process is used to determine the geometric and effective material properties of the shear beam, and linking functions are established and validated for the design of a shear layer mesoscale structure. At the metamaterial design level, innovative homogenization and topology optimization methods are employed to determine a set of locally optimal geometric designs for the shear layer. One geometry, the auxetic honeycomb, is shown to be an optimum to the minimum volume topology optimization problem for materials subjected to pure shear boundary conditions. As such, this geometry is identified as a candidate for the shear layer.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1050-0472			WOS:000352573500006

Viscoelastic shear properties of porcine temporomandibular joint disc								ORTHODONTICS & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH				18		SI		156	163		10.1111/ocr.12088		1	APR 2015	2015	Structured AbstractObjectivesTo investigate the intrinsic viscoelastic shear properties in porcine TMJ discs.Materials and methodsTwelve fresh porcine TMJ discs from young adult pigs (6-8months) were used. Cylindrical samples (5mm diameter) with uniform thickness (similar to 1.2mm) were prepared from five regions of the TMJ disc. Torsional shear tests were performed under 10% compressive strain. Dynamic shear was applied in two methods: 1) a frequency sweep test over the frequency range of 0.1-10rad/s with a constant shear strain amplitude of 0.05rad and 2) a strain sweep test over the range of 0.005-0.15rad at a constant frequency of 10rad/s. Transient stress relaxation tests were also performed to determine the equilibrium shear properties.ResultsAs the frequency increased in the frequency sweep test, the dynamic shear complex modulus increased, with values ranging from 7 to 17kPa. The phase angle, ranging from 11 to 15 degrees, displayed no pattern of regional variation as the frequency increased. The dynamic shear modulus decreased as the shear strain increased. The equilibrium shear modulus had values ranging from 2.6 to 4kPa. The posterior region had significantly higher values for dynamic shear modulus than those in the anterior region, while no significant regional difference was found for equilibrium shear modulus.ConclusionOur results suggest that the intrinsic region-dependent viscoelastic shear characteristics of TMJ disc may play a crucial role in determining the local strain of the TMJ disc under mechanical loading.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1601-6335	1601-6343		WOS:000352788700017	25865544

J	Shen, Sijun; Neyens, David M.								The effects of age, gender, and crash types on drivers' injury-related health care costs								ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION				77				82	90		10.1016/j.aap.2015.01.014			APR 2015	2015	There are many studies that evaluate the effects of age, gender, and crash types on crash related injury severity. However, few studies investigate the effects of those crash factors on the crash related health care costs for drivers that are transported to hospital. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between drivers' age, gender, and the crash types, as well as other crash characteristics (e.g., not wearing a seatbelt, weather condition, and fatigued driving), on the crash related health care costs. The South Carolina Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (SC CODES) from 2005 to 2007 was used to construct six separate hierarchical linear regression models based on drivers' age and gender. The results suggest that older drivers have higher health care costs than younger drivers and male drivers tend to have higher health care costs than female drivers in the same age group. Overall, single vehicle crashes had the highest health care costs for all drivers. For males older than 64-years old sideswipe crashes are as costly as single vehicle crashes. In general, not wearing a seatbelt, airbag deployment, and speeding were found to be associated with higher health care costs. Distraction-related crashes are more likely to be associated with lower health care costs in most cases. Furthermore this study highlights the value of considering drivers in subgroups, as some factors have different effects on health care costs in different driver groups. Developing an understanding of longer term outcomes of crashes and their characteristics can lead to improvements in vehicle technology, educational materials, and interventions to reduce crash-related health care costs.

ABUNDANCES IN THE SUPER-METAL-RICH OPEN CLUSTER NGC 6253 FROM HYDRA SPECTROSCOPY OF THE 7774 angstrom OXYGEN TRIPLET REGION								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				149	4					141	10.1088/0004-6256/149/4/141			APR 2015	2015	We present a spectroscopic abundance analysis of the old, super-metal-rich open cluster NGC 6253, with emphasis on its O abundance. High-dispersion, 7774 angstrom O I triplet region spectra of 47 stars were obtained using Hydra II on the CTIO Blanco 4 m. Radial velocity analysis confirms 39 stars consistent with single star membership, primarily at the turnoff. Thirty-six of these are included in our abundance analysis. Our differential analysis relative to the Sun yields primarily scaled-solar values, with weighted cluster averages of [O/H] = +0.440 +/- 0.020, [Fe/H] = +0.445 +/- 0.014, [Al/H] = +0.487 +/- 0.020, [Si/H] = +0.504 +/- 0.018, and [Ni/H] = +0.702 +/- 0.018 (where the errors are sigma(mu)). We discuss possible origins for the three known super-metal-rich clusters based upon their abundance patterns, Galactic locations, and space motions. The abundance patterns of NGC 6253 are very similar to those of NGC 6791 and NGC 6583. With the possible exception of oxygen, the abundances of these clusters are all close to scaled-solar, and they are similar to patterns seen in metal-rich disk dwarfs and giants. However, they also seem to differ from those of metal-rich bulge stars. We demonstrate that NGC 6253 is unusually oxygen rich (in [O/H]) for its 3.3 Gyr age. While we find [O/Fe] to be scaled-solar for NGC 6253, the more recently reported values for NGC 6791 show a large variation, from values close to scaled-solar down to values at least a factor of two below scaled-solar. We discuss the possibility that the scaled-solar [O/Fe] abundances of NGC 6253 and NGC 6791 might reflect a flattening of the Galactic [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relationship. This possibility may be consistent with disk star abundance data, which show an apparent "floor" at [O/Fe] similar to -0.1 for [Fe/H] > 0, and with chemical evolution model results, which may predict such a flattening due to a decrease in supernova Fe yields at supersolar-metallicities. Orbit solutions for NGC 6791 allow that it may have formed in the inner disk and was then kicked out, but the origins of the other two much younger clusters remain mysterious. We re-evaluate the age of NGC 6583 in view of the evidence that the cluster is super-metal-rich, and confirm a probable age less than 1 Gyr (best range: 500-900 Myr). We also argue that it is unlikely the cluster is more than 3 kpc away (best range: 2-3 kpc) if the apparent turnoff, main sequence, and giants are all cluster members.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0004-6256	1538-3881		WOS:000352336800025		
J	Wray, Austin T.; Klaine, Stephen J.								MODELING THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES ON GOLD NANOPARTICLE UPTAKE AND ELIMINATION BY DAPHNIA MAGNA								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				34	4			860	872		10.1002/etc.2881			APR 2015	2015	Monitoring the distribution and subsequent effects of nanoparticle contaminants in aquatic ecosystems will be pivotal to developing regulations that minimize their environmental footprint. The present study focused on the link between nanoparticle characteristics and Daphnia magna body burden using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with different size, shape, and surface charge configurations as model particles. Uptake followed first-order kinetics across the entire concentration range for all particles except the cationic rods, which demonstrated 2 distinct uptake patterns. Elimination followed the 2-compartment model for all particle configurations. Multiple regression analysis identified size and surface charge as controlling influences over AuNP uptake and elimination, whereas shape was regarded as inconsequential to both processes. Examination of the lumen-microvilli interface produced no evidence to indicate assimilation of the AuNPs used in the present study. Instead, these nanoparticles were restricted to the gut lumen and the carapace, where ingestion efficiency and adsorption were the primary determinants of total body burden. Models developed from the present data predict that D. magna will amass a higher body burden of larger cationic AuNPs at high concentration exposures and larger anionic AuNPs at low concentration exposures. A survey of the nanoparticle literature revealed that these trends were consistent with observations for certain nanomaterial exposures but could not be applied indiscriminately to all nanoparticle types and species.

J	Kuttolamadom, Mathew; Mehta, Parikshit; Mears, Laine; Kurfess, Thomas								Correlation of the Volumetric Tool Wear Rate of Carbide Milling Inserts With the Material Removal Rate of Ti-6Al-4V								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				137	2					021021	10.1115/1.4029649			APR 2015	2015	The objective of this paper is to assess the correlation of volumetric tool wear (VTW) and wear rate of carbide tools on the material removal rate (MRR) of titanium alloys. A previously developed methodology for assessing the worn tool material volume is utilized for quantifying the VTW of carbide tools when machining Ti-6Al-4V. To capture the tool response, controlled milling experiments are conducted at suitable corner points of the recommended feed-speed design space, for constant stock material removal volumes. For each case, the tool material volume worn away, as well as the corresponding volumetric wear profile evolution in terms of a set of geometric coefficients, is quantified-these are then related to the MRR. Further, the volumetric wear rate and the M-ratio (volume of stock removed to VTW) which is a measure of the cutting tool efficiency, are related to the MRR-these provide a tool-life based optimal MRR for profitability. This work not only elevates tool wear from a 1D to 3D concept, but helps in assessing machining economics from a stock material-removal-efficiency perspective as well.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1087-1357	1528-8935		WOS:000352440900022

ACCURACY OF A VERTICAL JUMP CONTACT MAT FOR DETERMINING JUMP HEIGHT AND FLIGHT TIME								JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH				29	4			877	881					APR 2015	2015	Whitmer, TD, Fry, AC, Forsythe, CM, Andre, MJ, Lane, MT, Hudy, A, and Honnold, DE. Accuracy of a vertical jump contact mat for determining jump height and flight time. J Strength Cond Res 29(4): 877-881, 2015-Several devices are available to measure vertical jump (VJ) height based on flight time, VJ reach height, or ground reaction forces. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of a VJ mat for measuring flight time and VJ height compared with a VJ tester or a force plate. Seventeen men and 18 women (X +/- SD; age = 20.9 +/- 0.7 years, height = 176.1 +/- 0.9 cm, weight = 72.6 +/- 13.5 kg) served as subjects. Subjects performed counter-movement vertical jumps while standing on both a force plate (1,000 Hz) and a VJ mat. A Vertec VJ tester was used to measure jump reach. Compared with the force plate, the VJ mat reported greater VJ height (VJ mat = 0.50 +/- 0.12 m, force plate = 0.34 +/- 0.10 m) and flight time (VJ mat = 0.629 +/- 0.078 seconds, force plate = 0.524 +/- 0.077 seconds). Comparison of VJ heights from the VJ mat and the Vertec revealed no significant differences (Vertec = 0.48 +/- 0.11 m). Regression analyses indicated strong relationships between testing methods and suggested that high VJ performances may be underestimated with the VJ mat. This particular VJ mat compared favorably with the Vertec but not the force plate. It seems that the different flight times derived from the VJ mat may permit the VJ mat to be in closer agreement with VJ heights from the Vertec. Also, the VJ mat may not be an appropriate tool for assessing high VJ performances (i.e., >= 0.70 m; approximate to 28 inches). Practitioners and researchers using similar VJ mats may not obtain accurate flight times and may underestimate high performers.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1064-8011	1533-4287		WOS:000352076600002	24852256

In Vitro Growth of Curcuma longa L. in Response to Five Mineral Elements and Plant Density in Fed-Batch Culture Systems								PLOS ONE				10	4					e0118912	10.1371/journal.pone.0118912			APR 1 2015	2015	Plant density was varied with P, Ca, Mg, and KNO3 in a multifactor experiment to improve Curcuma longa L. micropropagation, biomass and microrhizome development in fed-batch liquid culture. The experiment had two paired D-optimal designs, testing sucrose fed-batch and nutrient sucrose fed-batch techniques. When sucrose became depleted, volume was restored to 5% m/v sucrose in 200 ml of modified liquid MS medium by adding sucrose solutions. Similarly, nutrient sucrose fed-batch was restored to set points with double concentration of treatments' macronutrient and MS micronutrient solutions, along with sucrose solutions. Changes in the amounts of water and sucrose supplementations were driven by the interaction of P and KNO3 concentrations. Increasing P from 1.25 to 6.25 mM increased both multiplication and biomass. The multiplication ratio was greatest in the nutrient sucrose fed-batch technique with the highest level of P, 6 buds/vessel, and the lowest level of Ca and KNO3. The highest density (18 buds/vessel) produced the highest fresh biomass at the highest concentrations of KNO3 and P with nutrient sucrose fed-batch, and moderate Ca and Mg concentrations. However, maximal rhizome dry biomass required highest P, sucrose fed-batch, and a moderate plant density. Different media formulations and fed-batch techniques were identified to maximize the propagation and storage organ responses. A single experimental design was used to optimize these dual purposes.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1932-6203			WOS:000352135600005	25830292
