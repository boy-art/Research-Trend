Geographic patterns of introgressive hybridization between native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri) and introduced rainbow trout (O-mykiss) in the South Fork of the Snake River watershed, Idaho								CONSERVATION GENETICS				9	1			49	64		10.1007/s10592-007-9302-6			FEB 2008	2008	Throughout its native range, the Yellowstone cutthroat trout (YCT), Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri, is declining dramatically in both abundance and distribution as a result of introgression with introduced rainbow trout (RBT), O. mykiss. We sampled over 1,200 trout from the South Fork of the Snake River (SFSR) watershed, in southeastern Idaho and western Wyoming, and measured the extent of introgression of RBT genes into native gene pools of YCT using seven species-specific, co-dominant nuclear genetic markers. We also used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype differences between the two parental trout species to determine the directionality of the hybridization. We found low levels of RBT introgression (only 7% of sampled individuals had one or more RBT alleles) into YCT gene pools, with the majority of hybrids (78%) occurring in mainstem localities of the SFSR and in lower elevation reaches of certain tributaries. Hybridization was bidirectional with respect to mtDNA haplotype, but the majority of hybrids (75%) had YCT maternal haplotypes, indicative of the greater proportion (90%) of YCT-genotypes in the SFSR watershed. The primary factor influencing the geographic distribution of RBT introgressed individuals was fluvial distance from localities of stocking origin. To a lesser extent, elevation, also influenced the distribution of hybrid genotypes, with several entire tributaries and all upper elevation reaches within tributaries harboring only YCT-genotypes. Important management implications of the study suggest targeting particular tributaries and upper reaches within tributaries for YCT protection and exclusion of RBT hybrid colonization.									36	0	0	36	0	37			1566-0621			WOS:000252223100005		
J	Quartin, Andrew A.; Calonge, Ricardo O.; Schein, Roland M. H.; Crandall, Lee A.								Influence of critical illness on physicians' prognoses for underlying disease: A randomized study using simulated cases								CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE				36	2			462	470		10.1097/01.CCM.0B013E3181611F968			FEB 2008	2008	Objective: During critical illness, physicians often provide estimates of the severity of underlying disease to aid patients and families when formulating care directives. We sought to determine whether factors such as the superimposed acute illness, the prognoses of other patients cared for by the same physician, or the phrasing of inquiry influence these assessments of underlying disease.Design, Setting, and Subjects: Internal medicine attending and resident physicians participated in a computerized, Web-available survey that described two case vignettes, one with cardiomyopathy and the other with lung cancer as underlying diseases. Using random assignment, each respondent was presented one case as having septic shock, and the other as an uneventful clinic visit. Respondents were explicitly asked to ignore the context and to assess the severity of the underlying disease alone to predict survival time and quality of life. The order in which subjects encountered the cases and phrasing of the survival question also were varied through randomization.Measurements and Main Results. Mortality predictions for the cardiomyopathy case at 5 yrs were sensitive to both context (predicted survival, 39% +/- 23% when presented as septic vs. 52% +/- 24% when presented as a clinic patient; p < .001) and to whether a lung cancer case was presented before it (39% +/- 23% when presented after lung cancer vs. 52% +/- 24% when presented before; p < .001). These effects were independent and led to mean predicted 5-yr survival probabilities ranging from 31% to 59%. Predicted 1-yr survival from lung cancer was sensitive to phrasing (p < .05) but not to context. Quality of life predictions were also sensitive to context and case order.Conclusions: Physician appraisal of underlying disease severity is potentially vulnerable to a number of biases that may be relevant in the critical care setting. These biases appear to vary with the nature of the underlying disease.									7	0	0	1	0	7			0090-3493			WOS:000252794000013	18176316	
J	Marriott, Karla-Sue C.; Huffman, John W.								Recent advances in the development of selective ligands for the cannabinoid CB2 receptor								CURRENT TOPICS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY				8	3			187	204					FEB 2008	2008	Two subtypes of the mammalian cannabinoid receptor have been identified and successfully cloned since 1990. The CB1 receptor is primarily located in the central nervous system and the CB2 receptor is almost exclusively expressed in cells of the immune system. The CB1 and CB2 receptors are both G-protein coupled receptors and are involved in the inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The CB2 receptor is of particular importance due to its involvement in signal transduction in the immune system, making it a potential target for therapeutic immune intervention. A number of these selective ligands are derivatives of traditional dibenzopyran based cannabinoids. These include the very recently synthesized (2'R)-1- methoxy-3-(2'-methylbutyl)-Delta(8)-THC(JWH-359) which has a 224 fold selectivity for the CB2 receptor, readily comparable to the well known 1-deoxy-3-(1',1'-dimethylbutyl)-Delta(8)-THC(JWH-133)which has 200 fold selectivity for the CB2 receptor. Several 9-hydroxyhexahydrocannabinols have also been synthesized and are found to be selective high affinity ligands for the CB2 receptor. These are 1-deoxy-9 beta-hydroxy-dimethylhexylhexahydrocannabinol (JWH-361, K-i = 2.7 nM) and 1-deoxy-9 beta-hydroxy-dimethylpentylhexahydrocannabinol (JWH-300, K-i = 5.3 nM). CB2 selective cannabimimetic indoles include 1-(2,3-dichlorobenzoyl)-2-methyl-3-(2-[1-morpholine]ethyl)-5-methoxyindole(L768242), (R)-3(2-Iodo-5- nitrobenzoyl)-1-(1-methyl-2-piperidinylmethyl)-1H-indole(AM1241) and 1-propyl-2-methyl-3-(1-naphthoyl) indole (JWH-015), which exhibit significant selectivity for the CB2 receptor coupled with weak affinity for the CB1 receptor. Bristol-Meyer Squibb has produced a phenylalanine derived cannabimimetic indole which possesses high CB2 affinity (K-i = 8 nM) and very low affinity for the CB1 receptor (Ki = 4000 nM). This review will discuss the current advances and recent results in the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of selective ligands for the cannabinoid CB2 receptor.									53	1	0	46	0	55			1568-0266			WOS:000254078300003	18289088

Anaerobic biodegradation of ethylene dibromide and 1,2-dichloroethane in the presence of fuel hydrocarbons								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				42	3			864	870		10.1021/es0712773			FEB 1 2008	2008	Field evidence from underground storage tank sites where leaded gasoline leaked indicates the lead scavengers 1,2dibromoethane (ethylene dibromide, or EDB) and 1,2dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) may be present in groundwater at levels that pose unacceptable risk. These compounds are seldom tested for at UST sites. Although dehalogenation of EDB and 1,2-DCA is well established, the effect of fuel hydrocarbons on their biodegradability under-anaerobic conditions is poorly understood. Microcosms (2 L glass bottles) were prepared with soil and groundwater from a UST site in Clemson, South Carolina, using samples collected from the source (containing residual fuel) and less contaminated downgradient areas. Anaerobic biodegradation of EDB occurred in microcosms simulating natural attenuation, but was more extensive and predictable in treatments biostimulated with lactate. In the downgradient biostimulated microcosms, EDB decreased below its maximum contaminant level (MCL) (0.05 mu g/L) at a first order rate of 9.4 +/- 0.2yr(-1). The pathway for EDB dehalogenation proceeded mainly by dihaloelimination to ethene in the source microcosms, while sequential hydrogenolysis to bromoethane and ethane was predominant in the downgradient treatments. Biodegradation of EDB in the source microcosms was confirmed by carbon specific isotope analysis, with a delta C-13 enrichment factor of -5.6 parts per thousand. The highest levels of EDB removal occurred in microcosms that produced the highest amounts of methane. Extensive biodegradation of benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and ortho-xylene was also observed in the source and downgradient area microcosms. In contrast, biodegradation of 1,2-DCA proceeded at a considerably slower rate than EDB, with no response to lactate additions. The slower biodegradation rates for 1,2-DCA agree with field observations and indicate that even if EDB is removed to below its MCL 1,2-DCA may persist.									14	1	0	13	0	15			0013-936X			WOS:000252777600038	18323114

The method is based on a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor. A polymer of interest is cured around a glass FBG and the Bragg wavelength (BW) shift is measured and documented while polymerization progresses at the curing temperature. After complete polymerization, the BW shift is monitored continuously as the temperature of the cured polymer changes. The desired material properties are then found inversely from the relationship between the Bragg wavelength shift and the deformation of the polymer caused by the changes in the material properties.									17	0	0	1	0	17			0014-4851			WOS:000252277300009

Stand assessment through lidar-based forest visualization using immersive virtual environment technology								FOREST SCIENCE				54	1			1	7					FEB 2008	2008	This study examined the utility of light detection and ranging (lidar) remote sensing combined with immersive virtual environment technology for timber stand assessment. Lidar data were used to identify locations and extract dimensional information of trees in immature and mature loblolly pine (Pinas taeda, L) stands in northeast Mississippi. Computer visualized stands were built on the basis of lidar measurements and were projected with an interactive room-size stereoscopic display. Representational quality of lidar-based virtual forests was assessed through stand descriptions made by human subjects recruited from the Department of Forestry at Mississippi State University. Subjects examined either field-recorded videos or computer visualizations of immature and mature stands and estimated stocking, tree size class, height class, rotation stage, stand structure, and hardwood competition of each stand. Estimated stand characteristics by the two groups were compared. Significant viewer group differences were found in height class and rotation stage but not in other characteristics. Discussion includes how the immersive virtual environment technologies are potentially useful in natural resources management. Further study of economic aspects and interface development would be required to promote these technologies to an operational system.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0015-749X			WOS:000253306600001

Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 is disrupted in two patients with mental retardation and developmental disabilities								GENOMICS				91	2			195	202		10.1016/j.ygeno.2007.10.011			FEB 2008	2008	We have identified disruptions in the dedicator of cytokinesis 8 gene, DOCK8, in two unrelated patients with mental retardation (MR). In one patient, a mate with MR and no speech, we mapped a genomic deletion of approximately 230 kb in subtelomeric 9p. In the second patient, a female with mental retardation and ectodermal dysplasia and a balanced translocation, t(X;9) (q13. 1;p24), we mapped the 9p24 breakpoint to a region overlapping with the centromeric end of the 230-kb subtelomeric deletion. We characterized the DOCKS gene from the critical 9p deletion region and determined that the longest isoform of the DOCKS gene is truncated in both patients. Furthermore, the DOCKS gene is expressed in several human tissues, including adult and fetal brain. Recently, a role for DOCKS in processes that affect the organization of filamentous actin has been suggested. Several genes influencing the actin cytoskeleton have been implicated in human cognitive function and thus a possibility exists that the rare mutations in the DOCKS gene may contribute to some cases of autosomal dominant mental retardation.

J	Mahmoodi, Seyed Nima; Jalili, Nader; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Modeling, nonlinear dynamics, and identification of a piezoelectrically actuated microcantilever sensor								IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS				13	1			58	65		10.1109/TMECH.2008.915823			FEB 2008	2008	Nanomechanical cantilever sensors (NMCSs) have recently emerged as an effective means for label-free chemical and. biological species detection. They operate through the adsorption of species on the functionalized surface of mechanical cantilevers. Through this functionalization, molecular recognition is directly transduced into a micromechanical response. In order to effectively utilize these sensors in practice and correctly relate the micromechanical response to the associated adsorbed species, the chief technical issues related to modeling must be resolved. Along these lines, this paper presents a general nonlinear-comprehensive modeling framework for piezoelectrically actuated microcantilevers and validates it experimentally. The proposed model considers both longitudinal and flexural vibrations and their coupling in addition to the ever-present geometric and material nonlinearities. Utilizing Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and employing the inextensibility conditions, the coupled longitudinal-flexural equations of motion are reduced to one nonlinear partial differential equation describing the flexural vibrations of the sensor. Using a Galerkian expansion, the resulting equation is discretized into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The method of multiple scales is then implemented to analytically construct the nonlinear response of the sensor near the first modal frequency (primary resonance of the first vibration mode). These solutions are compared to experimental results demonstrating that the sensor exhibits a softening-type nonlinear response. Such behavior can be attributed to the presence of quadratic material nonlinearities in the piezoelectric layer. This observation is critical, as it suggests that unlike macrocantilevers where the geometric hardening nonlinearities dominate the response behavior, material nonlinearities dominate the response of microcantilevers yielding a softening-type response. This behavior should be accounted for when designing and employing such sensors for practical applications.									52	0	0	0	0	52			1083-4435			WOS:000253840800007		
J	Deng, Shaowei; Hubing, Todd; Beetner, Daryl					Hubing, Todd/0000-0003-0154-2189			Estimating maximum radiated emissions from printed circuit boards with an attached cable								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY				50	1			215	218		10.1109/TEMC.2007.915288			FEB 2008	2008	The common-mode current induced on cables attached to printed circuit boards can be a significant source of radiated emissions. Previous studies have shown that coupling from electric and magnetic field sources on circuit boards can be effectively modeled by placing equivalent voltage sources between the board and the cable. The amplitude of these equivalent sources can be estimated by using closed-form equations; however, estimates of the radiated emissions from these board-cable geometries have required full-wave simulations, and full-wave simulation results depend on the exact cable length and placement, which are not normally fixed during radiated emissions testing. This paper develops a closed-form equation to estimate the maximum radiated fields from a voltage source driving a board relative to an attached cable over a ground plane. This equation is evaluated for various cable and board geometries by comparing the calculated results to full-wave simulations. The maximum radiation calculated by using the closed-form expression generally predicts the peak full-wave simulation results within a few decibels for various board sizes and cable lengths.									20	1	0	0	0	21			0018-9375			WOS:000253504200026

This research addresses this question, focusing on university scientists who essentially bypass their institutions when they privately sell or license discoveries made at laboratories of said institutions directly to the market. Using a random sample of 54 U.S. universities and 23 394 faculty members, the study shows that bypassing activity is reduced when universities rely on autonomous technology licensing offices (TLOs) and when faculty departments receive greater shares of the royalties from the licensing of said discoveries. Conversely, bypassing activity is increased with more valuable discoveries and heightened entrepreneurial activities on university campuses.									36	0	0	0	1	37			0018-9391			WOS:000252782500006		
J	Kovach, Jami; Cho, Byung Rae; Antony, Jiju								Development of an experiment-based robust design paradigm for multiple quality characteristics using physical programming								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY				35	11-12			1100	1112		10.1007/s00170-006-0792-z			FEB 2008	2008	The well-known quality improvement methodology, robust design, is a powerful and cost-effective technique for building quality into the design of products and processes. Although several approaches to robust design have been proposed in the literature, little attention has been given to the development of a flexible robust design model. Specifically, flexibility is needed in order to consider multiple quality characteristics simultaneously, just as customers do when judging products, and to capture design preferences with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Physical programming, a relatively new optimization technique, is an effective tool that can be used to transform design preferences into specific weighted objectives. In this paper, we extend the basic concept of physical programming to robust design by establishing the links of experimental design and response surface methodology to address designers' preferences in a multiresponse robust design paradigm. A numerical example is used to show the proposed procedure and the results obtained are validated through a sensitivity study.									19	1	0	0	0	20			0268-3768			WOS:000252282800006

Alternative quenching agents and methods were also examined.Study results showed that using NH4Cl to preserve HAA samples obtained from chloraminated waters may result in positive errors for samples collected at short contact (or residence) time locations. The magnitude of these errors in practical applications will vary depending on several factors: including pH, reactivity of dissolved organic matter and concentration at the point of chloramination, and chlorine/ammonia application. Among various quenching agents or methods tested, sodium arsenite and stoichiometric amounts of sodium sulfate were found to be appropriate for chloramine samples but have some limitations for use in practical applications.Selection of sample quenching and preservation methods for HAA determination in chloramination systems must be carefully evaluated. In addition, better quenching methods for HAA determination in chloraminated waters are needed.									10	0	0	8	0	10			0003-150X			WOS:000253344600012

Conventional pathways of biohydrogenation traditionally ignored minor fatty acid intermediates, which led to the persistence of oversimplified pathways over the decades. Recent work is now being directed toward accounting for all possible trans-18:1 and CLA products formed, including the discovery of novel bioactive intermediates. Modern microbial genetics and molecular phylogenetic techniques for identifying and classifying microorganisms by their small-subunit rRNA gene sequences have advanced knowledge of the role and contribution of specific microbial species in the process of biohydrogenation. With new insights into the pathways of biohydrogenation now available, several attempts have been made at modeling the pathway to predict ruminal flows of unsaturated fatty acids and biohydrogenation intermediates across a range of ruminal conditions. After a brief historical account of major past accomplishments documenting biohydrogenation, this review summarizes recent advances in 4 major areas of biohydrogenation: the microorganisms involved, identification of intermediates, the biochemistry of key enzymes, and the development and testing of mathematical models to predict biohydrogenation outcomes.									246	13	0	215	25	265			0021-8812			WOS:000253443800019	18042812

The purpose of this study was to measure the electrical impedance of five experimental dental adhesives of increasing hydrophicities as 30-mu m films and as resin-bonded coatings on acid-etched dentin. Resin films or resin-coated dentin disks were placed in U-shaped chambers containing pairs of Ag-AgCI electrodes in 0.1M KCl. Electrical impedance spectra were run at day 0, 1, 7, 14, and 21 days. All resin films and resin-bonded dentin showed increases in capacitance during the first day of storage in electrolyte. This was usually associated with an increase in the pore resistance of the resins. Generally, resin-bonded dentin gave lower impedance values than their respective resins (resins 1-4) but solvated resin 5 bonded to water-saturated dentin gave higher capacitance and impedance values than resin 5 films. However, solvated resin 5 films gave higher impedance values than resin 5-bonded dentin. This behavior was confirmed by TEM examinations of silver uptake into films of neat resin 5 vs. ethanol-solvated resin 5, where water tree-like structures seen in the former were not seen in the latter. EIS is useful in examining changes in the capacitance and electrical impedance of very hydrophilic, ionic methacrylate resins. Its utility in detecting degradation in resin-bonded dentin interfaces remains to be determined in longer term studies.

As compared to the formerly reported recipe, the growth temperature has been lowered almost by half to 550 degrees C via using pure Co as the Co source and the NaOH/NaCl admixture as the flux. The issue of significant loss of Na due to its high vapor pressure at elevated temperatures is much better controlled. Various growth conditions, such as the NaOH to NaCl ratio in the flux, the ratio of Co element to the flux, the firing temperature,the soaking time,the warming/cooling rates and the atmosphere control, have been optimized. The as-grown NaxCo2O4 single-crystals, in form of platelets with growth direction along the ab-plane and with a typical size of similar to few mm on one edge, are found to be Na deficient (x similar to 0.3-0.8), which is consistent with the observed electrical resistivity, thermopower and magnetic susceptibility behavior. Despite the single-crystal nature, the directly measured in-plane thermal conductivity k exhibited an amorphous-like temperature dependence; with the room temperature k value is similar to 7W/m-K. In addition, the thermal stability and the associated surface micro-morphology changes have been studied by means of the differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetry analysis and scanning electron microscope. The results showed that the as-grown NaxCo2O4 single-crystals start losing Na above similar to 900 degrees C. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This investigation examined if Michaelis-Menten and other nonlinear kinetics might be useful for quantifying these processes. Data from 2 previously published in vitro experiments employing rumen fluid from sheep to investigate the lipolysis of trilinolein, the BH of cis-9, cis-12 linoleic acid (LA), and the BH of fatty acids derived from the lipolysis of trilinolein were used for the development of a multi-compartmental model. The model described the lipolysis of triacylglycerol well. The model also provided a good mathematical description of the resulting production of nonesterified fatty acids, the isomerization of nonesterified LA, and subsequent production of rumenic acid (RA), vaccenic acid (VA), and stearic acid (SA). However, the model described poorly the patterns of the concentrations of LA, RA, VA, and SA after incubation of trilinolein in rumen fluid. The model is consistent with known stoichiometry and biochemistry and is parsimonious in that it employs a minimal number of parameters to describe all of the major aspects of lipolysis and BH. The first step in the lipolysis of trilinolein was described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Vmax = 529 +/- 16 mg/L per h; Km = 698 +/- 41 mg/L). Both subsequent lipolysis steps were approximated by a first-order (linear kinetics) rate constant (k = 2.64 +/- 0.041/h). Isomerization of LA to RA was modeled by simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Vmax = 2,421 +/- 83 mg/L per h; Km = 440 +/- 22 mg/ L). The kinetics of the BH of RA to VA was described by a Michaelis-Menten-type process involving competitive inhibition by VA (Vmax = 492 +/- 6.5 mg/ L per h; Km = 1 mg/L). The final step, the BH of VA to SA, was modeled by a quasi-first-order process (k = 0.533 +/- 0.021/h), but as the concentration of VA increased, its BH appeared to be self-inhibited such that when the concentration of VA acid exceeded 517 +/- 10.4 mg/L, BH was completely inhibited. The major new insights and benefits afforded by this model are 1) lipolysis and BH are described by nonlinear kinetics; 2) high concentrations of VA appear to inhibit its own BH; and 3) BH of RA appears to proceed at a much greater rate when triglyceride is present in the incubation medium. This model provides a conceptual framework for researching ruminal lipolysis and BH.									9	0	0	9	1	10			0022-0302			WOS:000252638900032	18218761

Our models explain as much as 45% of the observed variation in board structure. Further, small and large firms have dramatically different board structures. For example, board size fell in the 1990s for large firms, a trend that reversed at the time of mandated reforms, while board size was relatively flat for small and medium-sized firms.

J	Kholodenko, Arkady L.								Towards physically motivated proofs of the Poincare and geometrization conjectures								JOURNAL OF GEOMETRY AND PHYSICS				58	2			259	290		10.1016/j.geomphys.2007.11.003			FEB 2008	2008	Although the Poincare and the geometrization conjectures were recently proved by Perelman, the proof relies heavily on properties of the Ricci flow previously investigated in great detail by Hamilton. Physical realization of such a flow can be found, for instance, in the work by Friedan [D. Friedan, Nonlinear models in 2 + epsilon dimensions, Ann. Phys. 163 (1985) 318-419]. In his work the renormalization group flow for a nonlinear sigma model in 2 + epsilon dimensions was obtained and studied. For epsilon = 0, by approximating the beta-function for such a flow by the lowest order terms in the sigma model coupling constant, the equations for Ricci flow are obtained. In view of such an approximation, the existence of this type of flow in Nature is questionable. In this work, we find totally independent justification for the existence of Ricci flows in Nature. This is achieved by developing a new formalism extending the results of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT's) to three and higher dimensions. Equations describing critical dynamics of these CFT's are examples of the Yamabe and Ricci flows realizable in Nature. Although in the original works by Perelman some physically motivated arguments can be found, their role in his proof remain rather obscure. In this paper, steps are made toward making these arguments more explicit, thus creating an opportunity for developing alternative, more physically motivated, proofs of the Poincare and geometrization conjectures.

Numerical simulation of equal and opposing subcritical flow junctions								JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE				134	2			267	273		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2008)134:2(267)			FEB 2008	2008	This study presents measured and computational results of a flow pattern at a junction with equal and opposing flows in the upstream channel that collide and turn 900 into the branch channel. The computational results are obtained using a two-dimensional, depth-averaged model with the k-epsilon turbulent closure scheme. The aim is to predict the recirculation zones that form as the flow turns into the branch channel. The simulated depth and velocity profiles in the upstream main and the downstream branch channels are found to compare well with the measurements made in the physical model for various inlet Froude numbers and width ratios of the main channel to the branch channel. The absolute relative error between the measured and computed contraction coefficient, a measure of the recirculation zone size, is less than 4.7%. The computational model is then used to develop curves for the contraction coefficient for various inlet Froude numbers and ratios of main channel width to the branch channel width for design purposes.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0733-9429			WOS:000252600000015

Different approaches are categorized as follows: (a) micro-scale polymer-to-metal mechanical interlocking; (b) in-coil or stamped-part pre-coating for enhanced adhesion; and (c) chemical modifications of the injection-molded thermoplastics for enhanced polymer-to-metal adhesion. For each of these approaches their suitability for use in load-bearing body-in-white (BIM components is discussed. In particular, the compatibility of these approaches with the BIW manufacturing process chain (i.e. pre-coated metal component stamping, BIW construction via different joining technologies, BIW pre-treated and painting operations) is presented. It has been found that while considerable amount of research has been done in the PMH direct-adhesion area, many aspects of these technologies which are critical from the standpoint of their use in the BIW structural applications have not been addressed (or addressed properly). Among the PMH technologies identified, the one based on micro-scale mechanical inter locking between the injection -molded thermoplastic polymer and stamped-metal structural rib component appears to be most promising.

We consider a model of frictionless matching on the marriage market in which men, as well as women, differ in their preferences for children; moreover, men, unlike women, must marry to enjoy fatherhood. We show that more efficient birth control technologies generally increase the "power," hence the welfare, of all women, including those who do not use them. This "empowerment" effect requires that the new technology be available to single women. An innovation reserved to married women may result in a " disempowerment" effect.					9th World Congress of the Econometric-Society9th World Congress of the Econometric-Society	AUG 19-24, 2005AUG 19-24, 2005	Econometr SocEconometr Soc	Univ Coll London, London, ENGLANDUniv Coll London, London, ENGLAND	15	0	0	0	0	15			0022-3808			WOS:000253817300004

In the present study, traditional cardiometabolic variables (CMV) associated with cardiovascular disease risk were examined in relation to hemostatic variables in a group of 36 White American (WA) and 30 African American (AA) overweight/obese women. There were 9 CMV significantly related to PA1-1 and/or the t-PA/PA1-1 ratio, but not fibrinogen. A significant race effect was found for 5 CMV in relation to fibrinogen and/or the t-PA/PA1-1 ratio, but not PAI-1. Significant race and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol interactions were found for fibrinogen (P = .021); and significant race and waist to hip ratio (P = .015), diastolic blood pressure (P = .013), and insulin (P = .037) interactions were found for PAI-1. No interactions were found for the t-PA/PA1-complex. Both PA1-1 and the t-PA/PA1-1 ratio are favored above fibrinogen in the diagnostic evaluation of health risk in both WA and AA women. Because of differences by race, independent consideration should be given in the clinical management of WA and AA women presenting with elevated CMV Our findings indicated the t-PA/PA1-1 complex to be the most global indicator of health risk in both WA and AA overweight/obese women.

Platelets are enucleated components of mammalian blood, while thrombocytes are nucleated blood leukocytes of chickens. Platelets and thrombocytes share characteristics that contribute to innate immunity. Experiments were conducted to determine if thrombocytes could respond in vitro to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Salmonella minnesota through Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). The aim was to activate the signal pathways leading to expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and to production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Chicken thrombocytes were found to express TLR4, and LPS-induced an increase in thrombocyte mRNA expression of IL-6 and COX-2 with release of PGE2 into culture media. An increase of COX-2 and PGE2 due to LPS stimulation was inhibited by MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, but IL-6 expression was unaffected by PD98059. The IKK-2 inhibitor BMS345541 inhibited IL-6 and COX-2 with reduction of PGE2 concentrations. Therefore, the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway activates expression of COX-2 and ultimately PGE2 production, but this pathway has little or no influence on IL-6 expression in thrombocytes. The NF-kappa B pathway also influences COX-2 expression and PGE2 production, and it is a primary activation signaling cascade for IL-6 gene expression in chicken thrombocytes. Thrombocytes represent a major component of the innate immune system of chickens in response to LPS and possibly other microbial products. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Addition of lead(II) oxide to the TZN glass increased the amount of lower coordination [TeO3]/[TeO3+1] units (765 cm(-1)) in the glass, and decreased the higher coordination [TeO4] units (665 cm(-1)) and Te-O-Te chains (440 cm(-1)). Addition of WO3 to the tungsten-tellurite glasses also resulted in the same trend as with PbO, and an additional band at around 925 cm(-1) was seen to increase in intensity due to [WO4+2] units. Finally, a band at around 370 cm(-1) was seen in the bismuth-doped tungsten tellurite glass, due to Te-O-Bi linkages. The calculated Raman gain of these tellurite glasses were found to be 20-30 times that of fused-silica (0.89 x 10-(13) m W-1). The calculated Raman gain of the PbO-doped TZN glass also showed good agreement with direct gain measurements previously made at 1064 nm. The minimum laser powers required to stimulate Raman amplification were calculated for one TZN glass and one tungsten-tellurite glass for optical fibre with a 10 pm core. The power densities required were of the order of MW cm(-2) for fibre with 2-3 dB m(-1) loss at 1550 nm and much lower than the surface optical damage thresholds of the glasses which are of the order of GW cm(-2).

J	Holb, Imre J.; Schnabel, Guido								The benefits of combining elemental sulfur with a DMI fungicide to control Monilinia fructicola isolates resistant to propiconazole								PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				64	2			156	164		10.1002/ps.1492			FEB 2008	2008	BACKGROUND: Management of demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide resistance in Monilinia fructicola (G. Winter) Honey is a priority in peach orchards of the southeastern United States, but DMI fungicides are still an important component of antiresistance strategies in view of the few effective alternatives. The goal of this study was to investigate potential benefits of a sulfur/propiconazole mixture for the control of propiconazole-resistant isolates.RESULTS: The mixture provided the best control for propiconazole-resistant isolates, regardless of protective or curative application timings, or the presence or absence of fruit injury. Propiconazole-resistant isolates developed disease on detached fruit after protective or curative applications of propiconazole or its mixture with sulfur, but protective applications of the mixture significantly reduced (P = 0.05) disease symptoms compared with the individual compounds. Additive to slightly synergistic effects were observed for the mixture in protective treatments of peaches inoculated with propiconazole-resistant isolates.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the addition of elemental sulfur to a DMI fungicide is likely to be a relatively inexpensive means to improve brown rot control in peach production areas where reduced sensitivity to DMI fungicides is suspected but has not led to noticeable control failure.

J	Luo, Chao-Xi; Schnabel, Guido								Adaptation to fungicides in Monilinia fructicola isolates with different fungicide resistance phenotypes								PHYTOPATHOLOGY				98	2			230	238		10.1094/PHYTO-98-2-0230			FEB 2008	2008	The ability to develop fungicide resistance was assessed in Monilinia fructicola isolates with different fungicide sensitivity phenotypes by adapting mycelium and conidia to increasing concentrations of selective fungicides and UV mutagenesis. Results showed that adaptation to Quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicide azoxystrobin and sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide propiconazole was more effective in conidial-transfer experiments compared to mycelial-transfer experiments. DMI-resistant (DMI-R) isolates adapted to significantly higher doses of azoxystrobin in both, mycelial- and conidial-transfer experiments compared to benzimidazole-resistant (BZI-R) and sensitive (S) isolates. Adaptation to propiconazole in conidial-transfer experiments was accelerated in BZI-R isolates when a stable, nonlethal dose of 50 mu g/ml thiophanate-methyl was added to the selection medium. One of two azoxystrobin-resistant mutants from DMI-R isolates did not show any fitness penalties; the other isolate expired before further tests could be carried out. The viable mutant caused larger lesions on detached peach fruit sprayed with azoxystrobin compared to the parental isolate. The azoxystrobin sensitivity of the viable mutant returned to baseline levels after the mutant was transferred to unamended medium. However, azoxystrobin resistance recovered quicker in the mutant compared to the corresponding parental isolate after renewed subculturing on medium amended with 0.2 and 1 mu g/ml azoxystrobin; only the mutant but not the parental isolate was able to adapt to 5 mu g/ml azoxystrobin. In UV mutagenesis experiments, the DMI-R isolates produced significantly more mutants compared to S isolates. All of the UV-induced mutants showed stable fungicide resistance with little fitness penalty. This study indicates the potential for QoI fungicide resistance development in M. fructicola in the absence of a mutagen and provides evidence for increased mutability and predisposition to accelerated adaptation to azoxystrobin in M. fructicola isolates resistant to DMI fungicides.									24	2	0	23	1	27			0031-949X			WOS:000252612300011	18943200

Transgenic rice plants expressing the FLP recombinase were crossed with plants harbouring the kanamycin resistance gene (neomycin phosphotransferase II, nptII) flanked by FRT sites, which also served to separate the corn ubiquitin promoter from a promoterless gusA. Hybrid progeny were tested for excision of the nptII gene and the positioning of the ubiquitin promoter proximal to gusA. While the hybrid progeny from various crosses exhibited beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression, the progeny of selfed parental rice plants did not show detectable GUS activity. Despite the variable GUS expression and incomplete recombination displayed in hybrids from some crosses, uniform GUS staining and complete recombination were observed in hybrids from other crosses. The recombined locus was shown to be stably inherited by the progeny. These data demonstrate the operation of FLP recombinase in catalysing excisional DNA recombination in rice, and confirm that the FLP/FRT recombination system functions effectively in the cereal crop rice. Transgenic rice lines expressing active FLP recombinase generated in this study provide foundational stock material, thus facilitating the future application and development of the FLP/FRT system in rice genetic improvement.									17	6	0	15	0	23			1467-7644			WOS:000252122100005	18021190

Effect of incorporation of Brassica spp. residues on population densities of soilborne microorganisms and on damping-off and Fusarium wilt of watermelon								PLANT DISEASE				92	2			287	294		10.1094/PDIS-92-2-0287			FEB 2008	2008	Incorporating Brassica spp. residue to reduce populations of soilborne fungi and manage damping-off and Fusarium wilt of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus) was studied in two field experiments. Treatments included incorporating flowering Brassica napus cv. Dwarf Essex canola or B. juncea cv. Cutlass mustard and laying black polyethylene mulch at incorporation or 1 month after incorporation, methyl bromide, and a nontreated control. In both years, glucosinolates were identified and quantified in the shoots and roots of the flowering plants. In both years, the total concentration of glucosinolates incorporated per square meter was significantly higher for B. juncea than for B. napus. Isothiocyanates were inconsistently detected in the amended soils and none were detected more than 12 days postincorporation. After incorporation in 2004 and 2005, amended plots had higher populations of Fusarium oxysporum and Pythium spp. than the methyl bromide treatment, and in some treatments, populations were higher than in the control. Fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. were not suppressed in amended soils, and their populations were significantly higher in some amended treatments than those in methyl bromide-treated soils or nontreated control soils. Incidence of damping-off and severity of Fusarium wilt on seedless watermelon cv. Tri-X 313, which is susceptible to Fusarium wilt, were not consistently lower in brassica-amended soils or methyl bromide-treated plots than in nontreated control plots. Therefore, under spring conditions and methods used in this study, neither biofumigation nor methyl bromide fumigation in coastal South Carolina was an effective disease management tool for two soilborne pathogens of watermelon.									31	0	0	28	1	32			0191-2917			WOS:000252507000013

Currently, L1 used for experimental studies is primarily mammalian-derived; however, the insect cell expression system described here provides an alternative source of recombinant L1 with equivalent bioactivity. A 140 kDa L1 fragment based on a physiological plasmin cleavage site in the extracellular domain was cloned and expressed with a C-terminal 6x histidine tag. Recombinant insect cell-derived L1 was analyzed by Western blot using an antibody to human L1 to confirm immunogenicity and to optimize infection conditions for recombinant L1 production. The recombinant protein was secreted by insect cells, efficiently purified under non-denaturing conditions using dialysis followed by metal affinity chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to produce a single band of the expected approximate 140 kDa size. The bioactivity of insect cell-derived L1 was compared to mammalian-derived L1-Fc and poly-L-lysine (PLL) using chick embryonic forebrain neurons. The results show comparable, robust neurite outgrowth at 24 h on insect cell-derived L1 and mammalian-derived L1-Fc, with significantly longer neurites than those observed on PLL. Future studies will examine the immobilization of L1 to biomaterial surfaces in physiologically appropriate orientation via the C-terminal 6x histidine tag and will investigate their application in promoting axonal regeneration in the injured nervous system.

We consider the problem of estimating the precision matrix Sigma(-1) under the squared loss L((Sigma) over cap (-1), Sigma(-1)) = tr((Sigma) over cap (-1)Sigma - I-p)(2). It is well known that the best lower triangular equivariant estimator of Sigma(-1) is minimax.

Tribological investigation of the polymer-based lubrication system using a laboratory reciprocating bench test								TRIBOLOGY & LUBRICATION TECHNOLOGY				64	2			38	45					FEB 2008	2008	Flooded oil lubrication systems are commonly utilized for many manufacturing processes. However, there is an increasing concern with the flooded lubrication systems due to their biological and environmental impact as well as their maintenance and disposal cost. Polymer-based material, a spongelike solid lubricant allowing the oil to weep out while in use, provides a promising alternative environmentally benign lubrication solution to satisfy the lubrication requirements for some manufacturing processes. In addition, it can minimize contamination of the coolant system, reduce waste processing and disposal costs, and alleviate the in-plant safety hazard from oil leakage on floor surfaces. The goal of this study is to develop and improve the current lubrication system by applying a polymer-based near-dry lubrication system in order to replace the oil flooded transfer line lubrication systems currently in production use. Using a laboratory reciprocating bench test based on the design of experiments, this study characterized the tribological performance of the polymer-based lubrication system under a variety of operating conditions, identified the main factor that impacts the tribological performance of the polymer-based lubrication system, and developed a model to predict the wear loss of the polymer-based lubricant plate. These results provide the guidelines for possible applications of the polymer-based lubrication system used in the manufacturing process.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1545-858X			WOS:000253387300009		
J	VanAntwerp, Darby J.; Falta, Ronald W.; Gierke, John S.								Numerical simulation of field-scale contaminant mass transfer during air sparging								VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL				7	1			294	304		10.2136/vzj2006.0126			FEB 2008	2008	Air sparging is a remediation technology for removing volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) from below the water table using air injection. Contaminant mass removal can be controlled by the mass transfer between liquid phases (aqueous and nonaqueous phase liquid [ NAPL]) and the injected gas phase. Traditional multiphase flow numerical models ignore subgridblock- scale effects of gas channel. flow on local mass transfer and assume local equilibrium between liquid and gas phases. This traditional, single-domain modeling approach tends to overpredict contaminant mass removal during sparging. A dual-domain multiphase flow approach for local interphase mass transfer may more accurately simulate contaminant removal, while still accounting for injected gas plume behavior. Mass transfer limitations are introduced through a numerical grid modi. cation where each traditional single-domain gridblock is split into two domains: one with very strong capillary pressures that remains mostly water saturated and one with weak capillary pressures that becomes mostly gas saturated during sparging. The two domains are coupled through a first-order mass transfer expression. This simple model can then approximate the localized (subgridblock- scale) gas channel effects on mass transfer that are limited by liquid phase difusion. In this study, data from a two-dimensional laboratory-scale experiment and a field-scale air sparging demonstration were used to test the capabilities of the dual- and single-domain approaches. It is the first time mass transfer has been simulated for air sparging at either of these scales using a multiphase flow kinetic interphase mass transfer model. Both experiments involved air sparging remediation of tetrachloroethylene, a NAPL. The single-domain local-equilibrium model resulted in an overprediction of mass removal rates in both cases. The dual- domain mass transfer approach provided a much better. t of the experimental data, and it is shown that the apparent interphase mass transfer coefficient becomes smaller with increasing scale.

(a subsidiary of ANSYS Inc.), 20071 in order to assess the suitability of this spraying technology for coating of metal stampings used in polymer metal hybrid (PMH) load-bearing automotive component applications. In addition, the suitability of the CGDS is assessed with respect to a need for metal stamping surface preparation/treatment, the ability to deposit polymeric material without significant material degradation, the ability to selectively overcoat the metal stamping, the resulting magnitude of the polymer-to-metal adhesion strength, durability of the polymer/metal bond with respect to prolonged exposure to high-temperature/high-humidity and mechanical/thermal fatigue service conditions, and compatibility with the automotive body-in-white (B/W) manufacturing process chain. The analysis revealed that CGDS can be considered as a viable technology for coating of metal stampings used in PMH load-bearing automotive component applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results serve as a validation on the widely held view that the carbon nanotubes are competitive in various technologies currently dominated by conductive inorganic materials (such as indium tin oxide).									114	1	0	0	0	114			0002-7863			WOS:000252634600053	18173271	
J	Cockrell, Gregory M.; Zhang, Gang; VanDerveer, Donald G.; Thummel, Randolph P.; Hancock, Robert D.								Enhanced metal ion selectivity of 2,9-di-(pyrid-2-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline and its use as a fluorescent sensor for cadmium(II)								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				130	4			1420	1430		10.1021/ja077141m			JAN 30 2008	2008	The metal ion complexing properties of the ligand DPP (2,9-di-(pyrid-2-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline) were studied by crystallography, fluorimetry, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Because DPP forms five-membered chelate rings, it will favor complexation with metal ions of an ionic radius close to 1.0 angstrom. Metal ion complexation and accompanying selectivity of DPP is enhanced by the rigidity of the aromatic backbone of the ligand. Cd2+, with an ionic radius of 0.96 angstrom, exhibits a strong CHEF (chelation enhanced fluorescence) effect with 10(-8) M DPP, and Cd2+ concentrations down to 10(-9) M can be detected. Other metal ions that cause a significant CHEF effect with DPP are Ca2+ (10(-3) M) and Na+ (1.0 M), whereas metal ions such as Zn2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+ cause no CHEF effect with DPIP. The lack of a CHEF effect for Zn2+ relates to the inability of this small ion to contact all four donor atoms of DIPP. The structures of [Cd(DPP)(2)](ClO4)(2) (1), [Pb(DPP)(ClO4)(2)H2O] (2), and [Hg(DPP)(ClO4)(2)] (3) are reported. The Cd(II) in 1 is 8-coordinate with the Cd-N bonds to the outer pyridyl groups stretched by steric clashes between the o-hydrogens on these outer pyridyl groups and the central aromatic ring of the second DPP ligand. The 8-coordinate Pb(II) in 2 has two short Pb-N bonds to the two central nitrogens of DPP, with longer bonds to the outer N-donors. The coordination sphere around the Pb(II) is completed by a coordinated water molecule, and two coordinated ClO4- ions, with long Pb-O bonds to ClO4- oxygens, typical of a sterically active lone pair on Pb(II). The Hg(II) in 3 shows an 8-coordinate structure with the Hg(II) forming short Hg-N bonds to the outer pyridyl groups of DPP, whereas the other Hg-N and Hg-O bonds are rather long. The structures are discussed in terms of the fit of large metal ions to DPP with minimal steric strain. The UV-visible studies of the equilibria involving DPP and metal ions gave formation constants that show that DPP has a higher affinity for metal ions with an ionic radius close to 1.0 angstrom, particularly Cd(II), Gd(III), and Bi(III), and low affinity for small metal ions such as Ni(II) and Zn(II). The complexes of several metal ions, such as Cd(II), Gd(III), and Pb(II), showed an equilibrium involving deprotonation of the complex at remarkably low pH values, which was attributed to deprotonation of coordinated water molecules according to: [M(DPP)-(H2O)](n+) reversible arrow [M(DPP)(OH)]((n-1)+) + H+. The tendency to deprotonation of these DPP complexes at low pH is discussed in terms of the large hydrophobic surface of the coordinated DPP ligand destabilizing the hydration of coordinated water molecules and the build-up of charge on the metal ion in its DPP complex because of the inability of the coordinated DPP ligand to hydrogen bond with the solvent.									123	1	0	17	0	123			0002-7863			WOS:000252634600054	18177045

Jawitz, James/G-5819-2013				Temporal evolution of DNAPL source and contaminant flux distribution: Impacts of source mass depletion								JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY				95	3-4			93	109		10.1016/j.jconhyd.2007.08.001			JAN 28 2008	2008	We investigated, using model simulations, the changes occurring in the distribution of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) mass (S(n)) within the source zone during depletion through dissolution, and the resulting changes in the contaminant flux distribution (J) at the source control plane (CP). Two numerical codes (ISCO3D and T2VOC) were used to simulate selected scenarios of DNAPL dissolution and transport in three-dimensional, heterogeneous, spatially correlated, random permeability fields with emplaced sources. Data from the model simulations were interpreted based on population statistics (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation) and spatial statistics (centroid, second moments, variograms). The mean and standard deviation of the S(n) and J distributions decreased with source mass depletion by dissolution. The decrease in mean and standard deviation was proportional for the J distribution resulting in a constant coefficient of variation (CV), while for the S(n) distribution, the mean decreased faster than the standard deviation. The spatial distributions exhibited similar behavior as the population distribution, i.e., the CP flux distribution was more stable (defined by temporally constant second moments and range of variograms) than the S(n) distribution. These observations appeared to be independent of the heterogeneity of the permeability (k) field (variance of the log permeability field = 1 and 2.45), correlation structure (positive vs. negative correlation between the k and S(n) domains) and the DNAPL dissolution model (equilibrium vs. rate-limited), for the cases studied. Analysis of data from a flux monitoring field study (Hill Air Force Base, Utah) at a DNAPL source CP before and after source remediation also revealed temporal invariance of the contaminant flux distribution. These modeling and field observations suggest that the temporal evolution of the contaminant flux distribution can be estimated if the initial distribution is known. However, the findings are preliminary and broader implications to sampling strategies for remediation performance assessment need to be evaluated in additional modeling and experimental studies.

PHYSIOL BEHAV Previous studies that examined the effects of knife cuts ventral to the septal area, or the pattern of anterograde degeneration after other obesity-inducing lesions or cuts, have implicated the septal area in feeding behavior. However, lesion studies have been inconsistent. In the present study, large electrolytic lesions that destroyed all or nearly all of the septal area resulted in excessive weight gain in female rats (25 g/20 days compared to 1 g/20 days for controls). Lesions confined to the ventral septum produced equal weight gains, but rats with lesions confined to the dorsal septum did not differ from controls. The excessive weight gains were accompanied by modest hyperphagia. The weight gains were not the result of incidental damage to adjacent structures such as the stria terminalis or the shell of the nucleus accumbens. It is concluded that the ventral portion of the septum is part. of a limbic-hypothalamic circuitry regulating food intake in female rats. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We previously found that recombinant TbHK1 (rTbHK1) has hexokinase activity, while rTbHK2 has not, a finding attributed to differences in the C-termini of the proteins. Sequence analysis suggests that the C-termini of TbHKs are part of a newly identified conserved motif found in other eukaryotic hexokinases. Here, we have explored the role of tail residues in the differences in catalytic activity between TbHK1 and TbHK2. Our studies reveal that tail residues D454, F462, M466, and N469 are essential for HK activity while both 1458 and V468 are required for catalysis and substrate specificity. To activate rTbHK2, all of the residues important for activity in rTbHK1 (13454, V458, F462, M466, V468, and N469) were required. These results indicate that the overall structure of the C-terminal tail influences the HK activity of rTbHK1. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

J	Song, Hocheol; Carraway, Elizabeth R.								Catalytic hydrodechlorination of chlorinated ethenes bly nanoscale zero-valent iron								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				78	1-2			53	60		10.1016/j.apcatb.2007.07.034			JAN 17 2008	2008	The reduction of six chlorinated ethenes by nanoscale iron (<100 mm diameter) synthesized by borohydride reduction was studied in order to determine reaction rates and product distributions and to gain insight into reaction pathways. The transformation of chlorinated ethenes by nanoscale iron proceeded to fully dechlorinated products (ethene and ethane), with no production of chlorinated intermediates, and the reaction rate constants for disappearance of chlorinated ethenes increased with decreasing chlorination (vinyl chloride (VC) > dichloroethenes (DCEs) > tritrichloroethene (TCE) > tetrachloroethene (PCE)). This trend suggests the reduction of chlorinated ethenes by nanoscale iron did not occur under thermodynamic control (e.g. reduction potential), rather, it proceeded via a catalytic pathway involving reactive hydrogen species. The reduction of TCE under five different conditions of initial dissolved hydrogen concentrations which varied from about 0.02 to 1.2 mM confirmed the importance of hydrogen in the reaction pathway and revealed an excellent linear correlation between rate constant and hydrogen concentration. Reduction of a chlorinated ethane (1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane) which produced 1,1-DCE as an intermediate, showed no dependence on hydrogen concentrations but the disappearance of the ethene intermediate did. TCE reduction by commercial grade micro-sized iron samples, in contrast, showed insignificant dependence on hydrogen concentration, suggesting the nanoscale iron synthesized by borohydride reduction of iron salts is particularly suited for hydrogen utilization through a catalytic reduction of chlorinated ethenes.

With Hurricane Katrina fresh on the public's mind, there is considerable interest in this topic. The return periods are estimated from historical data from the 1900 to 2006 period via extreme value methods and Poisson regression techniques. Despite the recent active 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, the authors do not find evidence of an increasing trend in hurricane strike frequencies.									11	0	0	3	0	11			0894-8755			WOS:000252704600014		
J	McMillen, Colin D.; Giesber, Henry G.; Kolis, Joseph W.								The hydrothermal synthesis, growth, and optical properties of gamma-LiBO2								JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH				310	2			299	305		10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2007.10.068			JAN 15 2008	2008	Large single crystals of the acentric, tetragonal lithium metaborate, gamma-LiBO2, have been grown using the hydrothermal method. Favorable conditions for the synthesis of gamma-LiBO2 were found over the course of a phase stability study of lithium borates in supercritical aqueous base. Hydrothermal synthesis was achieved by: (1) conversion of the alpha phase, (2) direct crystallization from B2O3 and LiOH or (3) recrystallization of previously crystallized gamma-phase crystallites. Solubility of gamma-LiBO2 in dilute aqueous LiOH was found to be 2-5 wt% from 460 to 75 degrees C with a positive solubility coefficient. Crystal growth experiments were designed to take advantage of the favorable solubility conditions within this range. Seeded growth occurred at a maximum rate of 2.1 mm/day when the dissolution zone temperature was 535 degrees C and the growth zone temperature was 495 degrees C. This permitted the routine growth of centimeter-size crystals in less than I week. These crystals possess an interesting combination of optical properties, including a band gap of about 9eV and high non-linear optical (NLO) susceptibility.

Its crystal structure was re-determined via X-ray single crystal structure studies to check for Sb/Te ordering. In a prior study Nb3Sb2Te5 was reported to crystallize in the Ir3Ge7 type, space group Im (3) over barm, with a = 9.8155(8) angstrom, with mixed Sb/Te occupancies. We found that complete Sb/Te ordering, which lowered the symmetry by removal of the inversion center, yielded improved residual factors, e.g. from R1 = 2.97% in Im (3) over barm (a = 9.8180(4) angstrom) to R1 = 2.47% in I (4) over bar 3m. Because of this ordering, no Te-Te contacts <3.4 angstrom prevail. Electronic structure calculations predicted nonmetallic properties, which were verified by temperature-dependent conductivity studies. The investigation of the thermoelectric properties yielded at 300 K a Seebeck coefficient of -29 mu V K-1, electrical conductivity of 75 Omega(-1) cm(-1), and thermal conductivity of 5.7 W m(-1) K-1. The thermoelectric figure-of-merit improves rapidly with increasing temperature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0925-8388			WOS:000252373600028

The chromosomes carry multiple rearrangements relative to other analyzed members of the S. quadrifidum species group in the sub-genus Psaroniocompsa. One-third of the chromosomal complement is rearranged relative to the sequence of S. ulyssesi, the species with the most similar banding pattern among studied members of the S. quadrifidum group.									3	0	0	3	1	3			1175-5326	1175-5334		WOS:000252281200006

Namely, poly(glycidyl methacrylate), PGMA, was used to form a reactive and fluorescent shell on the nanoparticle surface. Prior to deposition on the silica nanoparticle, the PGMA was fluorescently labeled with Rhodamine B via a reaction between the epoxy groups of the polymer and carboxyl groups of the dye. A strong fluorescence emission was observed for the colloidal suspension of the modified nanoparticles. Atomic force microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and thermogravimetric and elemental analysis were used to characterize the nanoparticles. The reactive nanoparticles are a convenient and straightforward platform to generate fluorescent particles with various molecules attached to their exterior, because epoxy groups (located on the particle exterior) are highly active in various chemical reactions. Reactivity of the particles was confirmed via modification of the surface of polyester fibers with the nanoparticles and synthesis of polymer grafted layers on their surface using "grafting to" and "grafting from" approaches. The newly designed technique will be applicable toward particles made from a wide variety of organic and inorganic materials, as long as the surface of material contains functional groups reactive with epoxy moiety.									53	1	0	2	0	54			0897-4756			WOS:000252047600047

We monitored Moxostoma robustum (Cope) (Robust Redhorse) in a Savannah River spawning aggregation during spring 2004 and 2005 to provide an estimate of the total number of adults and the number of males comprising the aggregation and to determine male residence time and movements within a spawning aggregation. Robust Redhorse were captured using prepostioned grid electrofishers, identified to sex, weighed, measured, and implanted with a passive integrated transponder. Spawning aggregation size was estimated using a multiple census mark-and-recapture procedure. The spawning aggregation seemed to consist of approximately the same number of individuals (82-85) and males (50-56) during both years of this Study. Individual males were present for a mean of 3.6 +/- 0.24 days (+/- SE) during the 12-day spawning period. The mean distance between successive recaptures of individual males was 15.9 +/- 1.29 in (+/- SE). We conclude that males establish spawning territories on a daily basis and are present within the spawning aggregation for at least 3-4 days. The relatively short duration of the aggregation may be the result of ail extremely small population of adults. However, the behavior of individuals has the potential to influence Population estimates made while fish arc aggregated for spawning.									4	0	0	4	1	4			1528-7092			WOS:000259879300007

Towards that end, we first develop an analytical model to describe the dependence of the constitutive parameters on the bias conditions. We validate this model experimentally and define a range for its validity. We obtain a one-dimensional lumped-parameter model of the energy harvester and optimize it with respect to the load resistance and frequency ratio. The optimal expressions are then used to study the effect of bias conditions on the optimal values. We observe that the bias conditions significantly affect the antiresonance frequency allowing for possible real time control to maximize the energy flow from the environment to the load. Furthermore, it is observed that, in the range of bias conditions for which our model is valid, the harvested power increases with magnetic bias and decreases with the prestress.

ASME					The affordance structure matrix - A concept exploration and attention directing tool for affordance based design								19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DESIGN THEORY AND METHODOLOGY/1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MICRO AND NANO SYSTEMS, VOL 3, PART A AND B								277	287					2008	2008	The theory of affordances has been adapted by the authors into a high-level approach to design known as affordance based design. One of the features that distinguishes the affordance based approach from function based approaches is that affordances are form dependent whereas functions are form independent. While delaying consideration of form can help maintain design freedom, considering the structure of multiple concept solutions early in the design process can preserve design freedom while allowing the designer to manipulate and refine concept structures and make prototypes early in the design process. In this paper we present a tool, the affordance-structure matrix, that aids the designer in mapping artifact structures to positive and negative affordances for the project. The affordance structure matrix can be used as an attention directing tool, focusing on the correlations within an individual concept architecture, or as a concept exploration tool, comparing the affordance-structure linkages across multiple concepts. The use of the affordance structure matrix is demonstrated using a case study examining two concept architectures for a household vacuum cleaner. The features of the affordance structure matrix are also contrasted with other existing matrix based tools for engineering design.

Specifically, the ontology analyzed in this research provides a basis for describing engineering design activities and subsequently design processes in an unambiguous manner. However, the proposed ontology lacks a computational representation and the information flow between activities is not adequately described. Thus, complex design processes cannot be represented using the ontology. The design activity ontology is modeled and analyzed using the DSM. First, the information flows between design activities are identified and their inter-relationships are described. Four different cases for representing the flow of information between design activities are modeled. In Case I and 2 feedback between information output and information input within an activity is captured. Whereas, in Case 3 and 4 it is assumed that no feedback between output and input exists within an activity. DSM analyses, including partitioning and tearing, are performed on the model. Observations and conclusions drawn from these analyses include the further decomposition of design activities, grouping of design activities, and lack of information flow between seemingly related activities. Based on these observations, recommendations are made to refine the ontology. Finally, additional research is required for developing a computational ontology of design activities.

DC drives incorporating regenerative bridges are particularly vulnerable, and will often fault during a short-duration voltage sag. These faults can result in blown fuses or damaged power electronic components, and cause extended downtime for the end-user. During a voltage sag, thyristors can fail to commutate properly, leading to a "shoot-through" fault or short circuit in the power electronic circuits. Commutation failure occurs chiefly because the thyristors are line commutated, and voltage sag can lead to insufficient voltage to commutate - causing a fault when a subsequent thyristor is fired. There are several possible scenarios that can cause commutation failure. This paper explores voltage sag situations that can cause commutation failure, simulations of DC drives operating in these situations, and experimental results that demonstrate commutation failure and faults in regenerative DC drives.					13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power	SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008		Wollongong, AUSTRALIAWollongong, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1540-6008		978-1-4244-1771-1	WOS:000262985500125

An arbitrary waveform generator was used to supply fundamental power along with a controllable third harmonic to three different types of capacitor motors. The motors were supplied with voltages containing fundamental-only, 2.5%, 5%, and 7.5% third harmonic content, and the phase angles of these harmonic voltages were varied relative to the fundamental. The distortion of the motor's current was found to be quite sensitive to the magnitude of the voltage distortion, and also was dependent upon the value of the run capacitor. The phase angle of the third harmonic voltage had a minor impact on the current distortion. This paper provides experimental results and summaries off the response of these three small capacitor motors to voltage distortion, and provides insight into a significant source of triplen harmonic distortion in single-phase residential AC power systems.					13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power	SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008SEP 28-OCT 01, 2008		Wollongong, AUSTRALIAWollongong, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1540-6008		978-1-4244-1771-1	WOS:000262985500126

Similar to cell phones, power generation by photovoltaics (PV) can reach over two billion people worldwide who have no access to clean energy. Only silicon based PV devices meet the criterion of clean energy conversion (abundance of raw material and no environmental health and safety issues). Using larger size glass substrates and manufacturing techniques similar to the one used by liquid crystal display industry, the manufacturing cost of amorphous silicon thin films of $1/watt can be achieved in the next one or two years. This will open a huge market for grid connected PV systems and related markets. With further R&D, this approach can provide a manufacturing cost goal of $0.50/watt in the next 10 years. At this cost level, PV electricity generation is competitive with any other technology and PV generation can be a dominant electricity generation technology in the 21(st) century. In the areas of thermoelectric devices and light emitting diodes, more focused research is required to penetrate the market in a dominant way. Based on silicon CMOS technology, ambient energy harvesting will create its own niche market driven by the desire to produce communication, sensing and computing integrated systems with small form factor and no battery.					26th International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL 2008)26th International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL 2008)	MAY 11-14, 2008MAY 11-14, 2008	IEEE Serbia & Montenegro Sect, ES SSC Chapter; IEEE Electron Devices Soc; IEEE Solid State Circuits SocIEEE Serbia & Montenegro Sect, ES SSC Chapter; IEEE Electron Devices Soc; IEEE Solid State Circuits Soc	Nis, SERBIANis, SERBIA	8	0	1	1	0	8			2159-1660		978-1-4244-1881-7	WOS:000257432600008

A rule-based control strategy is defined, which determines the power split between the engine and motor. Standard city-cycle simulations on a full-order model of the powertrain illustrate an improvement in fuel economy enabled by the ultracapacitor-based mild hybrid configuration and this control strategy. The deterministic dynamic programming is also applied to the reduced-order model of the powertrain to assess fuel economy potential of the hybrid system under pointwise-in-time and terminal constraints on the state of charge and motor power limits.

The departure of the tires from the prescribed road surface, labeled road runoff, represents a hazardous situation that must be properly handled to prevent unintended consequences. hi this instance, the recommended actions are for the driver to recognize the situation, reduce vehicle speed, and then return to the road way in a safe manner. However, drivers may command a large steering wheel angle to immediately return to the paved road surface which can result in vehicle yaw angles which precipitate accidents. In this paper, the potentially dangerous dynamics for a vehicle recovering from road runoff will be explored with an opportunity for steering system intervention. First, a basis for the importance of the problem will be established. Second, the vehicle dynamics and tire/road interface will be examined to demonstrate the "cause and effect" of large steer angles when returning to the road. Finally, the integration of a road runoff recovery strategy algorithm into a steer-by-wire control system will be discussed. Representative numerical results will be presented and discussed.

These microcantilevers have recently received widespread attention due to their extreme sensitivity and simplicity in a variety of sensing applications. Most of the current studies; however, focus on a simple lumped-parameters representation rather than modeling the piezoresistive microcantilever itself. Due to the applications of the piezoresistive microcantilevers in nanoscale force sensing or non-contact atomic force microscopy with nano-Newton to pico-Newton range force measurement requirement, precise modeling of the piezoresistive microcantilevers is essential. For this, a distributed-parameters modeling is proposed and developed here to arrive at the most complete model of the piezoresistive microcantilever with tip-mass, tip-force and base movement considerations. In order to have online control and real-time sensor feedback, an inverse model of piezoresistive microcantilever is needed which utilizes the output voltage of the piezoresistive layer as well as the base motion information to predict the force acting on the microcantilever's tip. Utilizing a novel approach, an inverse modeling framework and control algorithm are then proposed for the characterization of MEMS utilizing piezoresistive microcantilevers. Following the mathematical modeling and controller design, both numerical simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed distributed-parameters modeling when compared with the previously reported lumped-parameters approach. It is shown that by utilizing the distributed-parameters model rather than lumped-parameters approach and by predicting the exact motion of each point on the microcantilever, the precision of the piezoresistive microcantilever's model is significantly enhanced.

In this regard, the entire length of beam is partitioned into uniform segments between any two successive discontinuity points. Beam characteristics matrix can be derived based on the boundary conditions and the continuity conditions applied at the partitioned points. This matrix is particularly used to find beam natural frequencies and mode shapes. The governing ODE of motion and its state-space representation are then derived for the beam under a distributed dynamic loading condition. To clarify the implementation of the proposed method, a beam with two stepped discontinuities in the cross section is studied, and numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the mode shapes and frequency response of beam for different stepped values. Results indicate that the added mass and stiffness significantly affects the mode shapes and natural frequencies.

The work of Box and Jenkins was seminal in developing methods for identifying parameters associated with classical (r, s, k) transfer functions.Discrete event systems are often used for modeling hybrid control structures and high-level decision problems. Examples include discrete time, discrete strategy repeated games. For these games, a discrete transfer function in the form of an accurate hidden Markov model of input-output relations could be used to derive optimal response strategies.In this paper, we develop an algorithm for creating probabilistic Mealy machines that act as transfer function models for discrete event dynamic systems (DEDS). Our models are defined by three parameters, (l(1); l(2), k) just as the Box-Jenkins transfer function models. Here l(1) is the maximal input history lengths to consider, l(2) is the maximal output history lengths to consider and k is the response lag. Using related results, We show that our Mealy machine transfer functions are optimal in the sense that they maximize the mutual information between the current known state of the DEDS and the next observed input/output pair(1).

The paper extends previous methods developed to compensate bias in angular rate measurements by accounting for a more general class of disturbances, and by allowing uncertainty in the inertial parameters. By resorting to adaptive observers designed on the basis of the internal model principle, it is shown how converging estimates of the angular velocity can be obtained, and used effectively in a passivity-based certainty-equivalence controller yielding global convergence within the chosen parametrization of the group of rotations. Since a persistence of excitation condition is not required for the convergence of the state estimates, only an upper bound on the number of distinct harmonic components of the disturbance is needed for the applicability of the method.

IEEE					Adaptive QoS in 802.11e wireless networks for lunar communications								2008 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9		IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings						1022	+					2008	2008	Lunar surface communications present specific problems that can be solved with well established terrestrial networking standards such as 802.11. Unfortunately, 802.11 has limitations regarding high priority traffic such as voice and command data which are sensitive to jitter, delay, and loss. The IEEE 802.11e standard provides enhancements that allow traffic with specific needs to be differentiated from normal traffic. While these enhancements have been shown to effectively improve latency and throughput or high priority traffic, they do not offer precise nor consistent control of performance levels. In this paper capacity and priority are explored in the context of lunar communications using 802.11g with 802.11e. We present a method to dynamically optimize 802.11e contention parameters to provide more granular control over the network's quality of service (QoS) for the various flow types. A distributed adaptive algorithm that extends 802.11e's Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) is presented. We show that the enhancement provides more granular and consistent performance than that provided by the static algorithm used in standard 802.11e.					2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2008MAR 01-08, 2008	IEEEIEEE	Big Sky, MTBig Sky, MT	0	0	0	0	0	0			1095-323X		978-1-4244-1487-1	WOS:000258321200098

Unlike many existing algorithms for iris localzation which extensively, utilize eye geometry, the proposed approach is predominantly based oil image intensities. In a step-wise procedure, first eyelashes are segmented from the input images using image texture, then the it-is is segmented using grayscale information, followed by a post-processing step that utilizes eye geometry to refine the results. A preprocessing step removes specular reflections in the iris, and image gradients ill a pixel neighborhood are used to compute texture. The image is modeled as a Markov random field, and a graph cut based energy minimization algorithm [2] is used to separate textured and untextured regions for eyelash segmentation, as well as to segment the pupil, iris, and background using pixel intensity values. The algorithm is automatic, unsupervised, and efficient at producing smooth segmentation regions on many non-ideal iris images. A comparison of the estimated iris region parameters with the ground truth data is provided.

Using a combination of corridor ceiling lights, visual homing, and entropy, the robot is able to perform straight line navigation down the center of an unknown corridor Turning at the end of a corridor is accomplished using Jeffrey divergence and time-to-collision, while deflection from dead ends and blank walls uses a scalar entropy measure of the entire image. When combined, these metrics allow the robot to navigate in both textured and untextured environments. The robot can autonomously explore an unknown indoor environment, recovering from difficult situations like corners, blank walls, and initial heading toward a wall. While exploring, the algorithm constructs a Voronoi-based topo-geometric map with nodes representing distinctive places like doors, water fountains, and other corridors. Because the algorithm is based entirely upon low-resolution (32 x 24) grayscale images, processing occurs at over 1000 frames per second.

Most existing algorithms for door detection use range sensors or work ill limited environments because of restricted assumptions about color, pose, or lighting. We present a vision-based door detection algorithm that achieves robustness by utilizing a variety of features, including color; texture, and intensity edges. We introduce two novel geometric features that increase performance Significantly: concavity and bottom-edge intensity profile. The features are combined using Adaboost to ensure optimal linear weighting. Oil a large database of images collected ill a wide variety of conditions, the algorithm achieves more than 90% detection with a low false positive rate. Additional experiments demonstrate the suitability of the algorithm for real-time applications using a mobile robot equipped with all off-the-shelf camera and laptop.

We propose a framework in which features are tracked jointly. Combining ideas from Lucas-Kanade and Horn-Schunk, the estimated motion of a feature is influenced by the estimated motion of neighboring features. The approach also handles the problem of tracking edges in a unified way by estimating motion perpendicular to the edge, using the motion of neighboring features to resolve the aperture problem. Results are shown on several image sequences to demonstrate the improved results obtained by the approach.

First, the concepts of cores and peripheries in PINs are defined. Then, computational methods arc, proposed to identify cores from PINs. Application of these methods to a combined yeast PIN has identified 103 k-plex cores and 102 star cores. Based on more precise structural characteristics, our studies reveal new prospects of principles and roles of proteins. Our results show that, aside from connectivity the structural variations between different types of proteins are also related to the variation in biological properties. Two classes of peripheral proteins have been identified: party peripheries, which are more likely to be part of protein complex, and connector peripheries, which are more likely connected to different complexes or individual proteins. This study, may facilitate the understanding of the topological characteristics proteins in interaction network's and thus help elucidate the organization of cellular systems.

As component packaging technologies evolve enabling tighter integration and faster operation of electronic systems, it is important to develop better decoupling strategies. This paper describes several new or proposed packaging structures and evaluates the connection inductance associated with possible decoupling capacitor locations. As expected, connections made on the chip tend to have a. lower inductance than connections made on the package; and connections made on the package tend to have a lower inductance than connections made to the board. This illustrates the importance of providing decoupling capacitance as close to the chip as possible in order to maximize the effective bandwidth of the power distribution network.

Differences between the results generated by the software and the "correct" solution are the result of several potential sources of error including: approximations made in order to represent the actual configuration as a structure that the software can understand; approximations made during the discretization and solution of Maxwell's equations; and differences between what the modeler wants to analyze and what the software is actually modeling. Of these three potential error sources, the last one is usually the greatest source of error even when the analysis is being done by experienced modelers. In this paper, three full-wave time-domain EM modeling codes are evaluated by analyzing three simple canonical problems. These codes employ the three most common time-domain modeling techniques: the Transmission Line Matrix method (TLM), the Finite]Integration Technique (FIT) and the Finite Difference Time Domain technique (FDTD). The three canonical problems are a center-driven dipole, a circuit board power-bus structure, and a power-bus structure with a cable attached. All of the codes are capable of yielding accurate results, but the differences in the specific technique employed and the user interface have a significant effect on the simulation time and the likelihood of getting the correct answer.

Worst-case approximations using lumped element models are fast and easy to use, but run the risk of overestimating problems. Statistical methods that account for the random variation of wire position help prevent overdesign, but are often difficult and time-consuming to apply and lack a clear link between problems and their cause. Here we investigate the use of simple lumped-element models to predict the statistical variation of crosstalk in wire harness bundles. Models are based on lumped-element approximations, where inductance and capacitance values are calculated for a single bundle cross-section, and only the circuit position is varied. Accuracy was evaluated by comparing results to numerical simulations. The method does a good job of quickly predicting the reasonable worst-case values of crosstatk due to inductive or capacitive coupling.

Each transmitted block is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise that has one of two power spectral densities. The smaller of the two is the power spectral density of the thermal noise, and the difference between the two spectral densities is the power spectral density of the interference noise. The average power in the interference is constant, so the power spectral density of the interference is inversely proportional to the average fraction of the blocks that have interference. This block interference channel has been used to model partial-band interference in frequency-hop communications and to model pulsed interference in a number of communication systems. Throughput results for turbo-product and low-density parity-check codes that are used on Gaussian block interference channels are compared with the capacity bounds for such channels. For some code rates, we show that the throughput of the codes and the capacity bounds are both nonmonotonic functions of the fraction of the blocks that have interference. Applications to adaptive-rate coding are discussed.

We present an implementation of our approach on a Cray XD1 and discuss possible extensions to further increase throughput.

We describe and evaluate an adaptive scaling metric for soft-decision decoding in direct-sequence spread-spectrum receivers for tactical radio networks. The metric is derived from post-detection signal quality statistics that are developed in the demodulator, and it is applied to the demodulator's soft-decision outputs before they are sent to the decoder. To maintain efficient use of assigned channel and spectrum resources, our metric exploits the nature of the spread-spectrum signal to obtain demodulator statistics during the reception of the desired transmission and therefore requires no pilot symbols or channel measurements. We compare the performance of our proposed adaptive scaling metric with a fixed soft-decision metric and with the log-likelihood ratio metric.

The mesh backhaul is formed via an IEEE 802.16e mesh mode radio on each base station, while mobile units communicate with base stations via PMP mode radios. The scheduling approach consists of two phases. In the first phase where base stations are deployed, a centralized mesh scheduling algorithm is applied with collected information on network topology radio parameters, and initial QoS provision requirements. At the same time, each base station utilizes the initial mesh schedule to derive a PMP schedule for actual demands from associated mobile units. In the second phase, each base station monitors its carried PMP tragic load statistics; to accommodate traffic load changes in a distributed fashion, each base station lends or borrows time slots from nearby base stations to adjust its mesh and PMP radio schedules. The distributed schedule adaptation method not only allows individual base stations to accommodate short-term increases in bandwidth demands, it also provides the means for optimizing the mesh and PMP schedules with respect to actual bandwidth demands. Integrated with a previously proposed routing scheme, the method is evaluated with simulations in network simulator ns-2. In various mobile scenarios, increased overall network throughput and per-mobile throughput across handoffs are achieved with the proposed scheduling methods.

First, this paper presents a solution to the inverse kinematics problem for a single-section trunk. Assuming end-points for all sections of a multi-section trunk are known, this paper then details applying single-section inverse kinematics to each section of the multi-section trunk by compensating for resulting changes in orientation. Finally, an approach which computes per-section endpoints given only a final-section endpoint provides a complete solution to the multi-section inverse kinematics problem. The results of implementing these algorithms in simulation and on a physical continuum robot are presented and possible applications are discussed.

IEEE					Adapting Starburst for Elliptical Iris Segmentation								2008 IEEE SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMETRICS: THEORY, APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEMS (BTAS)								54	+					2008	2008	Fitting an ellipse to the iris boundaries accounts for the projective distortions present in off-axis images of the eye and provides the contour fitting necessary for the dimensionless mapping used in leading iris recognition algorithms. Previous iris segmentation efforts have either focused on fitting circles to pupillary and limbic boundaries or assigning labels to image pixels. This paper approaches the iris segmentation problem by adapting the Starburst algorithm to locate pupillary and limbic feature pixels used to fit a pair of ellipses. The approach is evaluated by comparing the fits to ground truth. Two metrics are used in the evaluation, the first based on the algebraic distance between ellipses, the second based on ellipse chamfer images. Results are compared to segmentations produced by ND_IRIS over randomly selected images from the Iris Challenge Evaluation database. Statistical evidence shows significant improvement of Starburst's elliptical fits over the circular fits on which ND_IRIS relies.					2nd IEEE International Conference on Biometrics - Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS 2008)2nd IEEE International Conference on Biometrics - Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS 2008)	SEP 29-OCT 01, 2008SEP 29-OCT 01, 2008	IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet SocIEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc	Washington, DCWashington, DC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-2729-1	WOS:000265595400010

IEEE					Scanning micro-interferometer array with sub-picometer resolution for MEMS inspection								2008 IEEE SENSORS APPLICATIONS SYMPOSIUM								113	+					2008	2008	Micro Scanning Grating interferometer (mu SGI) is a micromachined optical sensor to inspect MEMS. This paper presents the design fabrication, implementation and analysis of an array of such mu SGIs. The mu SGIs are capable of static and dynamic displacement measurements. The mu SGIs have phase sensitive micromachined gratings which are actuated by electrostatic force. The mu SGIs are fabricated on SOI wafers The fabricated tunable gratings exhibit the first resonance mode at 48kHz and a damping ratio of similar to 0.05. The gratings show sufficient (similar to 400nm) displacement range for tuning it to high sensitivity position, achieved with 30V operating voltage range. To actively tune the gratings a novel control algorithm is implemented real-time in a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). It adjusts the position of each grating with respect to corresponding sample, to achieve high sensitivity. Active control scheme is modeled using MATLAB and the performance results show good agreement with the experiments. The control algorithm is successfully used to characterize the tunable gratings and to demonstrate parallel operation of the mu SGIs. Experimental results demonstrate a vertical resolution of 0.2pm over 1Hz bandwidth.					3rd IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium3rd IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium	FEB 12-14, 2008FEB 12-14, 2008	IEEEIEEE	Atlanta, GAAtlanta, GA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-1962-3	WOS:000256382600024

The system employs orthogonal modulation, noncoherent demodulation, and error-control coding with iterative decoding. We find that the capacity limits for the system and the performance results for turbo product codes and low-density parity-check codes show that the throughput can be a nonmonotonic function of the bandwidth of the partial-band noise. We discuss how such nonmonotonicity affects the design of adaptive-rate coding systems.

These structures are often seen in a printed circuit board (PCB), or the space between a PCB and metal chassis. First, a SPICE model is proposed for these structures using 2-dimensional ladder networks and ideal transformers. Next, the model is expanded to structures including vertical connecting conductors, such as vias in a PCB and grounding posts connecting a PCB to a metal chassis. Coupling properties inside a PCB are calculated using the SPICE model and shown to be consistent with experimental data. Furthermore, radiated emissions from a PCB-chassis system are also calculated based on the SPICE and equivalent magnetic current source models. The results are consistent with experimental data to show the changes in radiated EMI due to the locations of grounding posts.

The principal scientific goal of POET is to measure GRB polarization between 2 and 500 keV. The payload consists of two wide FoV instruments: a Low Energy Polarimeter (LEP) capable of polarization measurements in the energy range from 2-15 keV and a high energy polarimeter (Gamma-Ray Polarimeter Experiment-GRAPE) that will measure polarization in the 60-500 keV energy range. Spectra will be measured from 2 keV up to 1 MeV. The POET spacecraft provides a zenith-pointed platform for maximizing the exposure to deep space. Spacecraft rotation will provide a means of effectively dealing with systematics in the polarization response. POET will provide sufficient sensitivity and sky coverage to measure statistically significant polarization for up to 100 GRBs in a two-year mission. Polarization data will also be obtained for solar flares, pulsars and other sources of astronomical interest.

Existing capacity studies for IEEE 802.11 networks have considered either stationary or statistical multipath fading channel conditions. In an environment with a high density of people and movement such as in a football stadium or a subway station, the radio characteristics vary much more vibrantly, and their impact on network capacity is not well understood. As a first step to better understand such network characteristics, the study examines the throughput of a mobile terminal over the stadium network in the presence of varying radio conditions due to movement of people and concurrent transmissions by other IEEE 802.11 devices. The study uses a novel approach to quantify network utilization by the experiment terminal as well as other contending terminals, using a recorded packet trace. From the measured utilization, throughput, and signal strengths key observations made include the fast variations in signal strength due to crowd movement, throughput's dependency on signal strength and chosen link rate, and contention with other terminals. Based on the findings, the paper discusses useful insights for performance assessment, protocol enhancements, and improvements in measurement methodology for such networks.					17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	AUG 03-07, 2008AUG 03-07, 2008	IEEE; IEICE; Microsoft; QualcommIEEE; IEICE; Microsoft; Qualcomm	St Thomas, VISt Thomas, VI	0	0	0	0	0	0			1095-2055		978-1-4244-2389-7	WOS:000263364400039

Many such components move rapidly and frequently in metallic containments with challenging radio propagation characteristics. For wireless sensors mounted on rotating structures, previous studies identified an eminent increase in packet transmission errors at higher rotation speeds. Such errors were found to occur at specific locations around the rotating spindle's periphery and such locations depended sensitively on sensor location and surrounding geometry. This paper studies a transmission error avoidance approach based on on-line error pattern inference and packet transmission time control for IEEE 802.15.4 compatible sensor radios to enhance the achievable data throughput. The method does not rely on sensor positioning support; instead, it infers the temporal error distribution using its local clock and avoids transmission in identified "error regions". Simulation studies showed a 50% reduction of errors and throughput increase up to 75%. Evaluated with different packet sizes and error distributions, the throughput gain was found to be most significant for higher rate and larger size transmissions.					17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	AUG 03-07, 2008AUG 03-07, 2008	IEEE; IEICE; Microsoft; QualcommIEEE; IEICE; Microsoft; Qualcomm	St Thomas, VISt Thomas, VI	1	0	0	0	0	1			1095-2055		978-1-4244-2389-7	WOS:000263364400141

Specifically, AL[epsilon][N] description logic is proposed as a formalism for modeling engineering knowledge and for enabling retrieval and reuse of archived models. Classification hierarchies are constructed using subsumption in DL. Retrieval of archived models is supported using subsumption and query concepts. In our methodology, design decision models are constructed using the base vocabulary and reuse is supported through reasoning and retrieval capabilities. Application of the knowledge representation for the design of a cantilever beam is demonstrated.

Such devices consist of engine section mockups for use with a real borescope. Our approach instead simulates engine sections in virtual reality, replacing the need for physical mockups. We model the engine casing as a "black box" where a simulated borescope tip is inserted (in practice a real borescope is used to provide tactile veridicality of the probe's braided sheath but the camera at its tip is not used). The probe's translational movement is mapped to the virtual camera's. The graphical engine representation can conceivably generalize to any engine section that can be modeled graphically. Since the interior chamber of the "black box" casing is empty, the critical component of our simulator is correct borescope tip navigation as well as force feedback response based on a mathematical model of collision detection of the tip in the computer generated environment.Haptic response is thought to be a key component of the simulator as it provides non-visual tactile awareness of the borescope tip within the engine under inspection and, more importantly, its contact with engine surfaces. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we design a novel motor-powered clamp that provides collision response to collision of the camera detected in virtual space. Second, we attempt to isolate the effect of the system's tactile response and provide empirical evaluation of its utility. In line with previous results, our empirical analysis reveals a trend toward a benefit in performance (speed), but suggests that the provision of haptic feedback, while preferred over a solely visual interface, may be perceived as extraneous in a visually-dominated discrimination task.

The novelty of this work is the transformation of the asymmetric inertia matrix into a symmetric, positive definite matrix. The asymmetry arises from the added mass common to practical surface vessels and creates a significant challenge for control design. The control design is further complicated by the parametric uncertainties in the dynamic model of the vessel. Two adaptive control schemes with a projection-based adaptation law are proposed: a full-state feedback controller and an output feedback controller. Both controllers are known to yield a uniformly ultimately bounded tracking result in the presence of parametric uncertainty. Numerical simulation results are shown to demonstrate the validity of the proposed controllers.					47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	DEC 09-11, 2008DEC 09-11, 2008	IEEE; Soc Ind & Appl Math (SIAM); Inst Operat Res & Management Sci (INFORMS); Japanese Soc Instrument & Control Engn (SICE); European Union Control Assoc (EUCA); Taylor & Francis Grp; StatoilHydroIEEE; Soc Ind & Appl Math (SIAM); Inst Operat Res & Management Sci (INFORMS); Japanese Soc Instrument & Control Engn (SICE); European Union Control Assoc (EUCA); Taylor & Francis Grp; StatoilHydro	IEEE Control Syst Soc (CSS), Cancun, MEXICOIEEE Control Syst Soc (CSS), Cancun, MEXICO	1	0	0	0	0	1			0743-1546		978-1-4244-3124-3	WOS:000307311601079

J	Ramaratnam, Karthik; Iyer, Swaminatha K.; Kinnan, Mark K.; Chumanov, George; Brown, Phil; Luzinov, Igor								Ultrahydrophobic textiles: Lotus approach								AATCC REVIEW				8	1			42	48					JAN 2008	2008	Solid surface wettability is a characteristic property of materials and strongly depends on both the surface energy and the surface roughness. Substrates that are rough on a nano-scale tend to be more hydrophobic than smooth ones because of the reduced contact area between the substrate and the liquid. A typical lotus plant exhibits superior water repellency making the surface self cleaning. An experimental method of mimicking the lotus effect on polyester fabrics using silver nanoparticles and a non-fluorinated hydrophobic polymer is discussed. The effect of the fabric roughness on obtaining the "lotus effect" is also reported.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1532-8813			WOS:000253282900005

The metals are all six-coordinate with distorted octahedral geometries. The [Co-II(dipicCl)(H2O)(3)] complexes are neutral, with one tridentate ligand and three water molecules. The [Co-II(dipicCl)(2)](2-) complexes each have two tridentate ligands. The [Na2CoII(H2O)(12)](4+) cluster has a central Co-II ion which is coordinated to six water molecules and lies on a crystallographic inversion center. Four of the water molecules bridge to two sodium ions, each of which have three other water molecules coordinated along with an O atom from the [Co-II(dipicCl)(2)](2-) complex. In the crystal structure, the various units are linked by O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds, forming a three-dimensional network.

The in-situ study of isotactic polypropylene with measurement of wide angle and small angle X-ray scattering (WAXS and SAXS), at varying distances from the exit of the extruder have been successfully completed using an X-ray system with a standard X-ray Source. The processing conditions. used were: 50, 100, 200 and 400m.min(-1) for the take up speed, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 cm(3) min(-1) hole(-1) for the melt flow rates, and a spinning temperature of 220 C. These experimental conditions produced draw down ratios ranging from 33 LIP to 1058. The X-ray characterization was carried in-situ at 15, 30, 45 and 60 cm from the exit of the spinneret and also ex-situ. The results obtained show the crystalinity index and the crystalline orientation to increase for the higher draw down rates, as expected under draw induced crystallization conditions, and a logarithmic relationship was observed within the experimental conditions used in this work. This communication reports the relationship between the crystallinity, crystalline orientation and lamellar long period and draw down ratio along the spin line.					13th Conference of the Sociedade-Portuguesa-de-Materiais/4th International Materials Symposium13th Conference of the Sociedade-Portuguesa-de-Materiais/4th International Materials Symposium	APR 01-04, 2007APR 01-04, 2007		Oporto, PORTUGALOporto, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0			0255-5476		*****************	WOS:000259898200114

We describe stabilizer codes which are the quantum analog of classical linear codes and discuss the binary and q-ary CSS construction. Then We focus on quantum codes from algebraic curves including the projective line, Hermitian curves, and hyperelliptic curves. In addition, we describe the asymptotic behaviors of quantum codes from the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower attaining the Drinfeld-Vladut bound.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1793-2238		978-981-279-400-0	WOS:000269519200012

A novel thermal conductivity measurement system called the parallel thermal conductance method has been developed in our lab, which allows us to measure the thermal conductivity of these needle-like single crystals along their elongated h axis from 10 K up 10 310 K. We observed a pronounced "dip" in the thermal conductivity at T(c), where a phase transition occurs. A close relation has been established between the Na/Mg concentration, the transition temperature T(c), the position and amplitude of the thermal conductivity dip and specific heat anomaly. The underlying mechanisms have been discussed in light of the disorder nature of this low-dimensional compound.					31st International Cocoa Beach Conference on Advanced Ceramics and Composites31st International Cocoa Beach Conference on Advanced Ceramics and Composites	JAN 21-26, 2007JAN 21-26, 2007		Daytona Beach, FLDaytona Beach, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0			0196-6219		978-0-470-19639-7	WOS:000281439000025

Traditionally, a VO can require access to computational backends that are suited for interactive applications, various levels of parallelism or highly distributed systems where users can contribute their own cycles. In this paper, we present a middleware integration and deployment strategy that builds a VO architecture which offers various computational tiers. The architecture offers interactive, real-time backends, batch operated small scale computational clusters, batch operated large scale remote supercomputers, and a wide area peer-to-peer network. All these middleware components are integrated into a cohesive system that accesses production resources and serves the nanotechnology community. We also present a middleware integration that meets the educational needs of the VO by integrating a course management system into the VO's portal.					3rd International Conference on Grid and Pervasive Computing3rd International Conference on Grid and Pervasive Computing	MAY 25-28, 2008MAY 25-28, 2008		Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINAKunming, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-540-68081-9	WOS:000256023000017		
S	Wang, James Z.; Ali, Farha; Srimani, Pradip K.						Wu, S; Yang, LT; Xu, TL		An efficient method to measure the semantic similarity of ontologies								ADVANCES IN GRID AND PERVASIVE COMPUTING, PROCEEDINGS		LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		5036				447	458					2008	2008	With the recent availability of large number of bioinformatics data sources, query from such databases and rigorous annotation of experimental results often use semantic frameworks in the form of an ontology. With the growing access to heterogeneous and independent data repositories, determining the semantic similarity or difference of two ontologies is critical in information retrieval, information integration and semantic web services. In this paper, a sense refinement algorithm is proposed to construct a refined sense set (RSS) for an ontology so that the senses (synonym words) in this refined sense set represent the semantic meanings of the terms used by this ontology. In addition, a semantic set that combines the refined sense set of ontology with the relationship edges connecting the terms in this ontology is proposed to represent the semantics of this ontology. With the semantic sets, measuring the semantic similarity or difference of two ontologies is simplified as comparing the commonality or difference of two sets. The experimental studies show that the proposed method of measuring the semantic similarity or difference of two ontologies is efficient and accurate.					3rd International Conference on Grid and Pervasive Computing3rd International Conference on Grid and Pervasive Computing	MAY 25-28, 2008MAY 25-28, 2008		Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINAKunming, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-540-68081-9	WOS:000256023000040

We utilize monodisperse fluorescent polymer spheres ranging from 1 mu m to 45 mu m diameter distributed on polycarbonate surfaces and muslin cloth. Particle removal efficiencies are determined from cloth that simulates clothing or fabrics, surfaces important for trace explosives detection. Optical images of the sample surface are taken using a fluorescence microscope (488 nm radiation) before and after being challenged by a pulsed air or nitrogen jet. The jet is oriented at 45 degrees with respect to the particle laden substrate and is precisely aligned onto the center of the optical axis of the microscope. Particle removal rates are determined by automated particle counting implemented by image processing and analysis. We found that the cloth surface has a release rate comparable to the rate for polycarbonate surface under similar jet conditions. As expected, there is a particle size dependence on removal efficiency, with larger particles being more easily removed.									8	0	0	1	0	8			0278-6826			WOS:000259644200008

J	Meriwether, J.; Faivre, M.; Fesen, C.; Sherwood, P.; Veliz, O.								New results on equatorial thermospheric winds and the midnight temperature maximum								ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE				26	3			447	466					2008	2008	Optical observations of thermospheric winds and temperatures determined with high resolution measurements of Doppler shifts and Doppler widths of the OI 630-nm equatorial nightglow emission have been made with improved accuracy at Arequipa, Peru (16.4 degrees S, 71.4 degrees W) with an imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer. An observing procedure previously used at Arecibo Observatory was applied to achieve increased spatial and temporal sampling of the thermospheric wind and temperature with the selection of eight azimuthal directions, equally spaced from 0 to 360 degrees, at a zenith angle of 60 degrees. By assuming the equivalence of longitude and local time, the data obtained using this technique is analyzed to determine the mean neutral wind speeds and mean horizontal gradients of the wind field in the zonal and meridional directions. The new temperature measurements obtained with the improved instrumental accuracy clearly show the midnight temperature maximum (MTM) peak with amplitudes of 25 to 200 K in all directions observed for most nights. The horizontal wind field maps calculated from the mean winds and gradients show the MTM peak is always preceded by an equatorward wind surge lasting 1-2h. The results also show for winter events a meridional wind abatement seen after the MTM peak. On one occasion, near the September equinox, a reversal was observed during the poleward transit of the MTM over Arequipa. Analysis inferring vertical winds from the observed convergence yielded inconsistent results, calling into question the validity of this calculation for the MTM structure at equatorial latitudes during solar minimum. Comparison of the observations with the predictions of the NCAR general circulation model indicates that the model fails to reproduce the observed amplitude by a factor of 5 or more. This is attributed in part to the lack of adequate spatial resolution in the model as the MTM phenomenon takes place within a scale of 300-500 km and similar to 45 min in local time.									34	0	0	0	0	34			0992-7689			WOS:000255364900007

Radar imaging permits precise collocation of the spectra with the background electric field. The Doppler shifts and spectral widths appear to be governed by the cosine and sine of the convection flow angle, respectively, and also proportional to the presumptive ion acoustic speed. The neutral wind also contributes to the Doppler shifts. These findings are consistent with those from the JOULE I experiment and also with recent numerical simulations of Farley Buneman waves and instabilities carried out by Oppenheim et al. (2008). Simple linear analysis of the waves offers some insights into the spectral moments. A formula relating the spectral width to the flow angle, ion acoustic speed, and other ionospheric parameters is derived.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0992-7689			WOS:000258074300016

Experimental results show that ill the subeutectic regime, the equilibrium film thickness decreases monotonically with decreasing temperature until it vanishes at a dewetting (prewetting) temperature. With increasing temperatures, nanometer-thick SAFs persist into a solid-liquid coexistence regime, in equilibrium with partial-wetting drops, with a gradual decrease in the macroscopic contact angle upon heating. The presence of an attractive dispersion force can significantly delay or inhibit the (otherwise expected) occurrence of complete wetting at higher temperatures. The equilibrium thickness of SAFs is explained from a balance between several Interfacial interactions, including dispersion forces, short-range forces of structural or chemical origins, volumetric free-energy terms, and electrostatic interactions. In a generalized Cahn critical-point wetting model, these SAFs are alternatively considered to be disordered multilayer adsorbates formed from coupled prewetting and premelting transitions.									87	1	0	2	0	87			1531-7331		978-0-8243-1738-6	WOS:000258337300010		
J	Luo, Chao-Xi; Schnabel, Guido								The cytochrome p450 lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase gene is a demethylation inhibitor fungicide resistance determinant in Monilinia fructicola field isolates from Georgia								APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY				74	2			359	366		10.1128/AEM.02159-07			JAN 2008	2008	Resistance in Monilinia fructicola to demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides is beginning to emerge in North America, but its molecular basis is unknown. Two potential genetic determinants of DMI fungicide resistance including the 14 alpha-demethylase gene (MfCYP51) and the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene MfABC1, were investigated in six resistant (DMI-R) and six sensitive (DMI-S) field isolates. No point mutations leading to an amino acid change were found in the MfCYP51 gene. The constitutive expression of the MfCYP51 gene in DMI-R isolates was significantly higher compared to DMI-S isolates. Gene expression was not induced in mycelium of DMI-R or DMI-S isolates treated with 0.3 mu g of propiconazole/ml. A slightly higher average MfCYP51 copy number value was detected in DMI-R isolates (1.35) compared to DMI-S isolates (1.13); however, this difference could not be verified in Southern hybridization experiments or explain the up to 11-fold-increased MfCYP51 mRNA levels in DMI-R isolates. Analysis of the upstream nucleotide sequence of the MfCYP51 gene revealed a unique 65-bp repetitive element at base pair position - 117 from the translational start site in DMI-R isolates but not in DMI-S isolates. This repetitive element contained a putative promoter and was named Mona. The link between Mona and the DMI resistance phenotype became even more apparent after studying the genetic diversity between the isolates. In contrast to DMI-S isolates, DMI-R isolates contained an MfCYP51 gene of identical nucleotide sequence associated with Mona. Still, DMI-R isolates were not genetically identical as revealed by Microsatellite-PCR analysis. Also, real-time PCR analysis of genomic DNA indicated that the relative copy number of Mona among DMI-S and DMI-R isolates varied, suggesting its potential for mobility. Interestingly, constitutive expression of the MfABC1 gene in DMI-R isolates was slightly lower than that of DMI-S isolates, but expression of the MfABC1 gene in DMI-R isolates was induced in mycelium after propiconazole treatment. Therefore, the MfABC1 gene may play a minor role in DMI fungicide resistance in M. fructicola. Our results strongly suggest that overexpression of the MfCYP51 gene is an important mechanism in conferring DMI fungicide resistance in M. fructicola field isolates from Georgia and that this overexpression is correlated with Mona located upstream of the MfCYP51 gene.									52	2	0	50	2	55			0099-2240			WOS:000252453100003	18024679	
B	Denny, Joel E.; Malloy, Brian A.			ACM					IELR(1): Practical LR(1) Parser Tables for Non-LR(1) Grammars with Conflict Resolution								APPLIED COMPUTING 2008, VOLS 1-3								240	245					2008	2008	There has been a recent effort in the literature to reconsider grammar-dependent software development from an engineering point of view. As part of that effort, we examine a deficiency in the state of the art of practical LR parser table generation. Specifically, LALR sometimes generates parser tables that do not accept the full language that the grammar developer expects, but canonical LR is too inefficient to be practical. In response, many researchers have attempted to develop minimal LR parser table generation algorithms. In this paper, we demonstrate that a well known algorithm described by David Pager and implemented in Menhir, the most robust minimal LR(1) implementation we have discovered, does not always achieve the full power of canonical LR(1) when the given grammar is non-LR(1) coupled with a specification for resolving conflicts. We also outline an original minimal LR(1) algorithm, IELR.(1), which we have implemented as an extension of GNU Bison and which does not exhibit this deficiency. Finally, using our implementation, we demonstrate the relevance of this deficiency for several real-world grammars, and we show that. our implementation is feasible for generating minimal LR(1) parsers for those grammars.					23rd Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing23rd Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing	MAR 16-20, 2008MAR 16-20, 2008	ACM SIGAC; Univ Fortaleza; Federal Univ CearaACM SIGAC; Univ Fortaleza; Federal Univ Ceara	Fortaleza, BRAZILFortaleza, BRAZIL	0	0	0	0	0	0					*****************	WOS:000268392200046

This study was designed to investigate the impacts of the conversion of forests to urbanized land, including construction and development impacts of land use conversion on water quality and biological integrity of streams. Land use and land cover changes, habitat conditions, water quality, and sediment loadings were studied in eleven subwatersheds of the Reedy River Watershed in the South Carolina Piedmont Ecoregion. Physical and chemical datasets and land use data were used as inputs to build a multivariate model using stepwise multiple regression to predict two instream biological dependant metrics, including Biotic Index, Final Bioclassification, and two biotic metrics that measure richness and species composition. Univariate statistical analysis among 25 environmental variables and biological indices indicated that watersheds of stable land use differed significantly from watersheds undergoing conversion of forest to urban land uses. Significant correlations were observed between land use and particle size distribution, land use and in-stream physical parameters, and land use and in-stream chemical variables. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that the principle environmental factors correlated with biological responses were conductivity, land use, and substrate distribution. Significant correlations between Biotic Index, Final Bioclassification, and compositional measures were found with conductivity, suggesting that conductivity may be a good indicator of land use changes and thus a good predictor of biotic indices in these subwatersheds.					8th Conference on the State of Lake Huron: Ecosystem Change, Habitat and Management8th Conference on the State of Lake Huron: Ecosystem Change, Habitat and Management	20072007	Aquat Ecosyst Hlth & Management Soc; Lake Huron Binatl PartnershipAquat Ecosyst Hlth & Management Soc; Lake Huron Binatl Partnership	Honey Harbour, CANADAHoney Harbour, CANADA	6	1	0	6	0	6			1463-4988			WOS:000257032200014

Characterization of Phytophthora cinnamomi populations from ornamental plants in South Carolina, USA								Archives of Phytopathology and Plant Protection				41	1			14	30		10.1080/03235400600628054			2008	2008	Fifty-one isolates of Phytophthora cinnamomi isolated from ornamental plants in South Carolina, USA, between 1995 and 2000 were characterized by sporangium morphology, mating type, sensitivity to the fungicide mefenoxam, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile analysis, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Sporangium shapes were predominantly ovoid to ellipsoid, and size averaged 65.5 x 40.3 mu m (length x breadth) with average length/breadth ratio of 1.6. Forty-nine isolates were the A2 mating type with only two A1 isolates found. This is the first report of the A1 mating type of P. cinnamomi in South Carolina. All isolates were sensitive to mefenoxam and EC50 values for all isolates were less than 0.2 mu g ml(-1). FAMEs of each isolate were analysed by gas chromatography and revealed five major fatty acids: myristic (14:0), palmitic (16:0), linoleic (18:2 omega 6c), oleic (18:1 omega 9c), and eicosapentaenoic (20:5 omega 3c) acids. These five fatty acids accounted for more than 80% of FAME profiles. Cluster analysis of FAME profiles showed that individual isolates had unique pattern that could be divided into four major clusters. AFLP analysis based on 200 informative loci also separated isolates into four major clusters. A1 isolates were different from all A2 isolates. The percentage of polymorphic loci (10.5%) and Nei's gene diversity (0.0435) were much higher for the two A1 isolates than for any cluster of A2 isolates even though A2 isolates had more isolates within a cluster. A2 isolates exhibited relatively little genetic variation overall, which suggests that these isolates may have come from a common source.									7	0	0	7	0	7						BCI:BCI200900058637

Broadcast chromatic numbers of graphs								ARS COMBINATORIA				86				33	49					JAN 2008	2008	A function pi : V -> {1,..., k} is a broadcast coloring of order k if pi(u) = pi(v) implies that the distance between a and v is more than pi(u). The minimum order of a broadcast coloring is called the broadcast chromatic number of G; and is denoted chi(b)(G). In this paper we introduce this coloring and study its properties. In particular, we explore the relationship with the vertex cover and chromatic numbers. While there is a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether chi(b)(G) <= 3, we show that it is NP-hard to determine if chi(b)(G) <= 4. We also determine the maximum broadcast chromatic number of a tree, and show that the broadcast chromatic number of the infinite grid is finite.									22	0	0	0	0	22			0381-7032			WOS:000253343000004

Simulation results show that the presence of a magnetic field changes the properties of the shock interface between the tenuous, overpressured jet (V-j(z)) flowing tangentially to a dense external medium. Magnetic fields can lead to more efficient acceleration of the jet, in comparison to the pure hydrodynamic case. A "poloidal'' magnetic field (B-z), tangent to the interface and parallel to the jet flow, produces both a stronger outward moving shock and a stronger inward moving rarefaction wave. This leads to a large velocity component normal to the interface in addition to acceleration tangent to the interface, and the jet is thus accelerated to larger Lorentz factors than those obtained in the pure hydrodynamic case. Likewise, a strong "toroidal'' magnetic field (B-y), tangent to the interface but perpendicular to the jet flow, also leads to stronger acceleration tangent to the shock interface relative to the pure hydrodynamic case. Overall, the acceleration efficiency in the poloidal case is less than that of the toroidal case, but both geometries still result in higher Lorentz factors than the pure hydrodynamic case. Thus, the presence and relative orientation of a magnetic field in relativistic jets can significantly modify the hydrodynamic boost mechanism studied by Aloy and Rezzolla.									24	0	0	0	0	24			0004-637X			WOS:000253454000008

Most CAIs in unmetamorphosed chondrites contain detectable excesses of Mg-26(Mg-26*), a decay product of the short-lived radionuclide Al-26(T-1/2 similar to 730, 000 yr), that correspond to an initial Al-26/Al-27 ratio of similar to(4-7) x 10(-5). It is suggested that Al-26 was injected into the protosolar molecular cloud or protoplanetary disk by a nearby core-collapse supernova (SN Type II) and uniformly distributed in the solar system; CAI formation started shortly after injection of Al-26 and lasted less than 20,000 yr. Here we show that CAIs from the metal-rich carbonaceous chondrites Acfer 214(CH) and Isheyevo (CH/CB-like) have a bimodal distribution of Mg-26*. Most CAIs composed of grossite (CaAl4O7), hibonite (CaAl12O19), Al-rich pyroxene, perovskite (CaTiO3), and gehlenitic melilite (Ca2Al2SiO7-Ca2MgSi2O7) show either unresolvable or small Mg-26* corresponding to an initial Al-26/Al-27 ratio of similar to 4 x 10(-7). Some of the grossite-rich CAIs and the less refractory inclusions composed of melilite, spinel (MgAl2O4), Al,Ti-pyroxene, and anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) have large Mg-26* corresponding to the initial Al-26/Al-27 ratio of similar to 5 x 10(-5). The Al-26-poor and Al-26-rich CAIs are characterized by O-16-rich (Delta O-17 < - 20 parts per thousand) compositions typical of CAIs. We suggest that the Al-26-poor and Al-26-rich CAIs represent samples of at least two generations of CAIs formed before and after injection of Al-26 into the solar system, respectively. Model yields of O-16, O-17, and O-18 for SN wind prior to explosion, during explosion, and in total, combined with the observations that both Al-26-poor and Al-26-rich CAIs plot on a three-isotope oxygen diagram (delta O-17 vs. delta O-18) along a single line with a slope of similar to 1 are consistent with injection of 26Al with the SN wind into the protosolar molecular cloud rather with the SN explosion into the disk.									41	0	0	1	0	41			0004-637X			WOS:000253454000063

Line selection and evaluation of radio frequency glow discharge atomic emission spectrometry in the determination of trace amounts of niobium in electron beam-melted tantalum sheet								ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY				29	1			16	20					JAN-FEB 2008	2008	Trace niobium (Nb) was determined in an electron beam-melted (EBM) tantalum (Ta) sheet by a radio frequency glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (RF-GD-OES) method using argon (Ar) as the discharge gas. The discharge operating parameters were optimized based on both the raw analyte signal intensity (S) and the signal-to-background ratio (S/B). A methodical approach was used to select a Ta interference-free line of Nb for the analysis of trace Nb in a Ta sheet based on signal-to-noise (S/N) measurements with a Model Jobin-Yvon high-resolution 1 in JY-10,000 RF monochromator having a 2400/2 grooves/mm holographic grating. The analytical lines selected were used to evaluate the degree of line interference and limits of detection. Nb determination in an EBM a sheet was perormed to estimate the precision and accuracy of the analytical result. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the intensity for the Nb line was around 3% for within runs and around 4% for between runs which represents the overall analytical performance of this technique on the precision; the accuracy was compared with ICP-OES analysis and was satisfactory. The detection limits for Nb in the EBM Ta sheet was estimated to be 2 mu g/g. The details of sensitive line selection and sputtering parameters are presented and discussed.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0195-5373			WOS:000254416900003

Effects of elasticity on the spraying of a non-Newtonian fluid								ATOMIZATION AND SPRAYS				18	3			243	271		10.1615/AtomizSpr.v18.i3.20			2008	2008	The effects of elasticity on spray performance are investigated. In particular, the breakup of liquid filaments exiting the nozzle and the drop size distribution are investigated for a series of low-viscosity polyethylene oxide (PEO) elastic liquids sprayed through a commercially available spray nozzle. Multiple vertical and horizontal positions within the spray are studied. We find that the increase in the elasticity of the moderate to high molecular weight polymer PEO solutions substantially impacts the breakup of liquids exiting the nozzle, reducing the spray angle and the overall coverage of the spray. The vertical distance from the nozzle for the fluid to break up increases with an increase in extensional viscosity. The fluid extensional properties lead to liquid filaments between drops in the non-Newtonian fluids, and these lead to an increase in the average drop size within the spray and also suppress the formation of undesirable fine spray drops.									6	0	0	1	0	6			1044-5110			WOS:000250307900002

Lime sulfur (LS) is the only fungicide registered for organic fruit production with demonstrated curative activity against apple scab, but such activity against Monilinia fructicola is unknown. In this study, the 6, 12, and 24 h post-infection activity of 1.5% lime sulfur (LS) against M. fructicola was investigated on two peach fruit cultivars (early- and mid-season cultivars, Coronet and Contender, respectively) at two maturity stages (commercially mature and immature fruit) in a wound-inoculation detached fruit study. Brown rot incidence, sporulating area, and production of conidia per fruit were higher on commercially mature fruit in all treatments as compared with immature fruit, and LS treatments showed consistent results for both cultivars tested. All three disease measurements were significantly lower (P = 0.05) for the 6 and 12 h post-inoculation applications of LS compared with either the untreated or 24 h post-inoculation applications of LS, irrespective of fruit maturity stages or cultivar. Disease incidence was reduced from 98.5-100% in the control treatment to 9-12% in the 6 h post-inoculation application. Both the 6 and 12 h post-inoculation applications reduced sporulating area from 64-72% in the control treatment to 0.0-1.3%. Disease incidence was not significantly (P = 0.05) different between the water-treated control and the 24 h post-inoculation treatment with LS, while percent sporulating area and number of conidia per fruit were significantly different (P = 0.05). Our results show up to 12 h post-inoculation activity of LS on M. fructicola in controlled environment studies and indicate that LS has potential for post-infection brown rot control in organic stone fruit production.									5	0	0	4	1	6			0815-3191	1448-6032		WOS:000257593600004

Electrochemical experiments reveal that no significant interaction occurs at the ground state between the two electroactive subunits. However, the occurrence of a photoinduced electron transfer in this donor-acceptor conjugate is observed in transient absorption experiments. Charge-separation (i.e., 4.0 x 10(11) s(-1)) and charge-recombination dynamics in benzonitrile (2.2 x 10(10) s(-1)) reveal a remarkable stabilization of the radical ion pair in this solvent.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0004-9425			WOS:000255227700002

There were few differences in UV protection when extracts were prepared at 27 or at 90 degrees C. Moreover, few differences in UV protection were demonstrated following infusion times of 5, 15, 30, and 60 min at 90 degrees C. At a 1% concentration, decaffeinated and caffeinated green teas were equally effective as UV protectants. At lower concentrations (0.1, 0.01, and 0.001%) caffeinated green tea provided greater UV protection (UVB/UVB 30, 60 min). Virus/tea extracts (caffeinated), under field conditions at 1 and 5%, were ineffective as UV screens. At a 10% concentration, some UV protection was provided and UV protection further increased in a concentration-dependent manner.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0958-3157	1360-0478		WOS:000257337400006

Many natural proteins found in a cell are enzymes that only function when soluble; in contrast, recombinant DNA proteins destined to be textiles will be required to function as insoluble or solid materials. The methods, which have to separate the target protein and purify it without severe losses of material, include filtration and centrifugation for insoluble removal, ultrasonic shock for mechanical cell disruption, chromatographic methods for soluble separations, and drying and crystallization for finishing.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978 1 84569 247 6	WOS:000277028400003

However, detrimental effects of highly active radical species generated during photoencapsulation must be carefully evaluated to maintain efficient hydrogel cross-linking while preserving the structure and bioactivity of encapsulated biomolecules. Here, we examine the free-radical-mediated inactivation and incomplete release of proteins from photocurable hydrogels utilizing lysozyme as a conservative model system. Various protein photoencapsulation conditions were tested to determine the factors affecting lysozyme structural integrity and bioactivity. It was found that a portion of the lysozyme becomes conjugated to polymer chains at high photoinitiator concentrations and long polymerization times. We also found that the more hydrophilic photoinitiator Irgacure-2959 (I-2959, 2-hydroxy-1-[4-(hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]-2-methyl-1-propanone) causes more damage to lysozyme compared to the hydrophobic photoinitiator Irgacure-651 (I-651, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone), even though I-2959 has been previously shown to be more cytocompatible. Furthermore, while nonacrylated PEG provides only limited protection from the denaturing free radicals that are present during hydrogel curing, acrylated PEG macromers effectively preserve lysozyme structural integrity and bioactivity in the presence of either photoinitiator. Overall, these findings indicate how photopolymerization conditions (e.g., photoinitiator type and concentration, UV exposure time, etc.) must be optimized to obtain a functional hydrogel device that can preserve protein bioactivity and provide maximal protein release.									26	0	0	15	0	26			1525-7797			WOS:000252415600012	18088094

Selectivity, low cost, and easy mass production make them an enabling technology for micro-detection and nanodetection techniques. These sensors operate through the adsorption of species on the functionalized surface of cantilevers. Through this functionalization, molecular recognition is directly transduced into a micromechanical response. This chapter presents a brief overview of microcantilever-based biosensors fabrication, the underlying principles of operation, modeling frameworks, techniques of microcantilever actuation, common materials used in fabrication of these sensors, and biological species detection techniques. More specifically, a detailed description of different operational modes of microcantilever biosensors is presented, followed by a set of comprehensive mathematical modeling frameworks. The chapter concludes with clinical applications of this type of biosensor, along with a review of recent developments and representative practical examples.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-0275-5	WOS:000324344500014

In many bacterial species, coordinate regulation of iron homeostasis depends on the protein product of a Fur gene. Fur also plays roles in virulence, acid tolerance, redox-stress responses, flagella chemotaxis and metabolic pathways.Results: We conducted physiological and transcriptomic studies to characterize Fur in Shewanella oneidensis, with regard to its roles in iron and acid tolerance response. A S. oneidensisfur deletion mutant was defective in growth under iron-abundant or acidic environment. However, it coped with iron depletion better than the wild-type strain MR-1. Further gene expression studies by microarray of the fur mutant confirmed previous findings that iron uptake genes were highly derepressed in the mutant. Intriguingly, a large number of genes involved in energy metabolism were iron-responsive but Fur-independent, suggesting an intimate relationship of energy metabolism to iron response, but not to Fur. Further characterization of these genes in energy metabolism suggested that they might be controlled by transcriptional factor Crp, as shown by an enriched motif searching algorithm in the corresponding cluster of a gene co-expression network.Conclusion: This work demonstrates that S. oneidensis Fur is involved in iron acquisition and acid tolerance response. In addition, analyzing genome-wide transcriptional profiles provides useful information for the characterization of Fur and iron response in S. oneidensis.									21	1	0	21	0	23			1471-2164			WOS:000206244100012	18366600

To explore this potential, it is necessary to develop compounds with high affinity for the CB2 receptor and little affinity for the CB1 receptor. This review will discuss structure-activity relations at both receptors for classical cannabinoids and cannabimimetic indoles. Examples of CB2 selective ligands from both classes of compounds are presented and the structural features leading to selectivity are described. Two approaches, receptor mutations and molecular modelling, have been employed to investigate the interaction of ligands with both cannabinoid receptors. These results obtained from these techniques are discussed.									37	1	0	30	0	38			0007-1188			WOS:000252883900018	17982473

Cannabinoids may modulate cell proliferation in various cell types through cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptors. Here, we investigated the effects of CB2 receptor agonists on TNF-alpha-induced proliferation, migration and signal transduction in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs).Experimental approach: HCASMCs were stimulated with TNF-alpha. Smooth muscle proliferation was determined by the extent of BrdU incorporation and the migration was assayed by modified Boyden chamber. CB2 and/or CB1 receptor expressions were determined by immunofluorescence staining, western blotting, RT-PCR, real-time PCR and flow cytometry.Key results: Low levels of CB2 and CB1 receptors were detectable in HCASMCs compared to the high levels of CB2 receptors expressed in THP-1 monocytes. TNF-alpha triggered up to similar to 80% increase (depending on the method used) in CB2 receptor mRNA and/or protein expression in HCASMCs, and induced Ras, p38 MAPK, ERK 1/2, SAPK/JNK and Akt activation, while increasing proliferation and migration. The CB2 agonists, JWH-133 and HU-308, dose-dependently attenuated these effects of TNF-alpha.Conclusions and implications: Since the above-mentioned TNF-alpha-induced phenotypic changes are critical in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and restenosis, our findings suggest that CB2 agonists may offer a novel approach in the treatment of these pathologies by decreasing vascular smooth muscle proliferation and migration.									85	5	0	81	0	90			0007-1188			WOS:000252883900019	17994109

Clear learning points are identified through each of the two different paths. One path focused more on theory and empirical work, whereas another was driven by practice and case studies. Despite these differences, the authors observe remarkable consistency in the themes across the two paths, particularly regarding the role of information technology and personnel. However, they also highlight significant gaps in the understanding of process representation, transformation, and alignment with other parts of the organization. The authors consolidate the knowledge from their experiences and describe the approach taken to compile this book. Gaps in knowledge are identified; the chapters in this volume are positioned as partially filling the gaps and providing a foundation for future work in business process transformation.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1554-6152		978-0-7656-1191-8	WOS:000283436500003

Pd-doped fibers were spun using a Pd salt mixed with an isotropic pitch precursor. Experimental techniques such as in situ X-ray analysis, thermogravimetric studies, scanning transmission electron microscopy and gas adsorption were employed to understand how processing conditions for the production of Pd-doped activated carbon fibers affect the microstructure, pore development, and dispersion of metal particles throughout the fibers. The results showed that PdO phase is present in the stabilized fibers and that this oxide phase is stable up to about 250 degrees C. The oxide phase transforms into Pd metal with increasing heat treatment temperature, going through the formation of an intermediate carbide phase. Sintering of Pd particles was observed with heat treatment at temperatures over 750 degrees C. It was also found that pore development during physical activation with CO2 was not significantly affected by the presence of Pd particles within the fibers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

One way for achieving this control is by carrying out doping processes through which atoms and molecules interact (covalently or noncovalently) with the nanotube surfaces. The aim of this chapter is to emphasize the importance of different types of doping in carbon nanotubes (single-, double- and multiwall). There are three main categories of doping: exohedral, endohedral and inplane doping. We will review the most efficient ways to dope carbon nanotubes and discuss the effects on the electronic, vibrational, chemical, magnetic and mechanical properties. In addition, we will discuss the different ways of characterizing these doped nanotubes using spectroscopic techniques, such as resonant Raman, X-ray photoelectron, electron energy loss spectroscopy and others. It will be demonstrated that doped carbon nanotubes could be used in the fabrication of nanodevices (e.g., sensors, protein immobilizers, field emission sources, efficient composite fillers, etc.). We will also present results related to the importance of inplane-doped nanotubes for attaching various metal clusters and polymers covalently using wet chemical routes.									68	2	0	1	0	68			0303-4216		978-3-540-72864-1	WOS:000253476700018

Modern parallel file systems spanning tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers will require fault tolerance to avoid job failure and catastrophic data loss due to a single disk failure or server loss. Effective fault tolerance in parallel file systems must provide a high degree of data resiliency, consistency, and scalable performance. In this paper, we describe a data replication technique that meets the resiliency and consistency requirements of parallel file systems and provides scalable performance. We measure the performance of our proposed mechanism by implementing it in a popular parallel file system, PVFS.					8th IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid8th IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid	MAY 19-22, 2008MAY 19-22, 2008	IEEEIEEE	Lyon, FRANCELyon, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-4237-9	WOS:000270502300113

Each of these families of metallofullerenes was identified and characterized by mass spectroscopy, HPLC, UV/Vis-NIR spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The mass spectra and HPLC chromatograms show that these larger metallic clusters are preferentially encapsulated by a C-88 cage. When the size of the cluster is increased, the C-96 cage is progressively favored over the predominant C-88 cage. It is also observed that the smaller cages (C-80-C-86) almost disappear on going from neodymium to cerium endohedral metallofullerenes. The UV/Vis-NIR spectra and cyclic voltammograms confirm the low HOMO-LUMO gap and reversible electrochemistry of these M3N@C-88 metallofullerenes.									48	1	0	4	0	49			0947-6539			WOS:000256241700017	18399530

In one of the series (1a) the SubPc units bear iodine atoms, while in the other series (1b) diphenylamino groups are linked to the SubPc macrocycles. The iodine atoms and diphenylamino groups both influence the resulting oxidation potentials of the electron-donating SubPc. They also modulate the outcome of excited state interactions, namely, energy and/or charge transfer. In addition, we have studied the impact that the substitution pattern in the phenoxy spacer exerts onto intramolecular processes in the ground and excited states. Although some of these processes are governed by the spatial separation between both components, the different electronic coupling through ortho-, meta-, or para- connections also plays decisive roles in some cases.									50	0	1	7	0	50			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000259079400031	18624288

This is the first time that La3N is successfully encapsulated inside fullerene cages. La3N@C-2n, metallofullerenes were synthesized by arcing packed graphite rods in a modified Kratschmer-Huffman arc reactor, extracted from the collected soot and identified by mass spectroscopy. They were isolated and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Different arcing conditions were studied to maximize fullerene production, and results showed that yields have a high La2O3/C dependence. Relatively high yields were obtained when a 1:5 ratio was used. Three main fractions, La3N@C-88, La3N@C-92, and La3N@C-96, were characterized by UV/Vis-NIR and cyclic voltammetry. Unlike other trimetallic nitride metallofullerenes of the same carbon cage size, La3N@C-88 exhibits a higher HOMO-LUMO gap and irreversible reduction and oxidation steps.									52	0	0	5	0	52			0947-6539			WOS:000259913900019	18663716	
J	Cooper, Melanie M.; Sandi-Urena, Santiago; Stevens, Ron								Reliable multi method assessment of metacognition use in chemistry problem solving								CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE				9	1			18	24		10.1039/b801287n			2008	2008	Metacognition is fundamental in achieving understanding of chemistry and developing of problem solving skills. This paper describes an across-method-and-time instrument designed to assess the use of metacognition in chemistry problem solving. This multi method instrument combines a self report, namely the Metacognitive Activities Inventory (MCA-I), with a concurrent automated online instrument, Interactive MultiMedia Exercises (IMMEX). IMMEX presents participants with ill defined problems and collects students' actions as they navigate the problem space. Artificial neural networks and hidden Markov modeling applied to the data collected with IMMEX produce two assessment parameters: the strategy state, which is related to the metacognitive qualities of the solution path employed, and the ability which is a measure of the problem difficulty students can properly handle. The ability values are significantly correlated with the MCA-I scores, and groups of students who performed using more metacognitive state strategies had significantly higher mean MCA-I values than those using fewer metacognitive strategies. This evidence is indicative of convergence between the methods. This instrument can be used diagnostically to guide the implementation of interventions to promote the use of metacognition; it takes little instructional time, is readily available and allows for the assessment of large cohorts.									34	0	0	0	0	34			1109-4028			WOS:000259185900003

Professional identity and the epistemic development of organic chemists								CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE				9	2			84	92		10.1039/b806222f			2008	2008	This paper presents a model of the epistemic development of organic chemists from student to practitioner. Key features of this model suggest that individuals first learn the language of organic chemistry, followed by the heuristics. Deep conceptual understanding of the concepts and models of organic chemistry does not occur until individuals become seasoned practitioners. Furthermore, it is proposed that professional identity formation occurs concurrently with practitioner development and that identity is the underlying motivation for learning. In addition to exploring this link, methods for helping students develop their identities as practicing organic chemists are suggested.									11	0	0	0	1	11			1109-4028			WOS:000259186000002

SOLID POLYMER ELECTROLYTES FROM CROSSLINKED PEG AND DILITHIUM N,N '-BIS(TRIFLUOROMETHANESULFONYL)PERFLUOROALKANE-1,omega-DISULFONAMIDE AND LITHIUM BIS(TRIFLUOROMETHANESULFONYL)IMIDE SALTS								COLLECTION OF CZECHOSLOVAK CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS				73	12			1777	1798		10.1135/cccc20081777			2008	2008	The present work consists of a series of studies with regard to the structure and charge transport in solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) prepared using various new bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI)-based dianionic dilithium salts in crosslinked low-molecular-weight poly(ethylene glycol). Some of the thermal properties (glass transition temperature, differential molar heat capacity) and ionic conductivities were determined for both diluted (EO/Li = 30:1) and concentrated (EO/Li = 10:1) SPEs. Trends in ionic conductivity of the new SPEs with respect to anion structure revealed that while for the dilute electrolytes ionic conductivity is generally rising with increased length of the perfluoroalkylene linking group in the dianions, for the concentrated electrolytes the trend is reversed with respect to dianion length. This behavior could be the result of a combination of two factors: on one hand a decrease in dianion basicity that results in diminished ion pairing and an enhancement in the number of charge carriers with increasing fluorine anion content, thereby increasing ionic conductivity while on the other hand the increasing anion size and concentration produce an increase in the friction/entanglements of the polymeric segments which lowers even more the reduced segmental motion of the crosslinked polymer and decrease the dianion contribution to the overall ionic conductivity. DFT modeling of the same TFSI-based dianionic dilithium salts reveals that the reason for the trend observed is due to the variation in ion dissociation enthalpy, derived from minimum-energy structures, with respect to perfluoroalkylene chain length.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0010-0765			WOS:000263121700016

Photosynthetic pathway of steppe vegetation and the stable carbon isotope composition of organic matter in the russian chernozem								COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS				39	5-6			641	651		10.1080/00103620701879034			2008	2008	This study was conducted to determine the stable carbon isotope composition of soil organic carbon (C) under different land uses in the Russian Chernozem, one of the typical soils in grasslands. Three sites were sampled: a native grassland field (not cultivated for at least 300 years), an adjacent 50-year continuous fallow field in the V. V. Alekhin Central Chernozem Biosphere State Reserve in the Kursk region of Russia, and a continuously cropped field in the Experimental Station of the Kursk Institute of Agronomy and Soil Erosion Control. All sampled soils were classified as Haplic Chernozem. The stable C isotope composition of organic C (13C values vary from -24.7 to -25.9) is determined by the C3-type plants dominating in the region. Agricultural crops grown in the region are predominantly C3-type with the exception of corn. Corn cropping slightly altered the stable C isotope signature of soil organic C. Presence of carbonates in the soil can interfere with the stable C isotope signature of soil organic C at depth. It can result in high variability of the stable C isotope signature of organic C where carbonates are present, and therefore caution should be applied when using these values for determination of the proportion of C3/C4-type plants contributing to soil organic-matter formation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-3624			WOS:000253508800002

Highly rigid polymers assemble to form supramolecular hierarchal structures that exhibit well defined electro-optical characteristics. The dynamic processes of the molecules within these agglomerates are a key in controlling the effective conjugation length and thus their optical properties. Among their association modes are micellar structures, liquid crystalline phases and gels. Using small angle neutron scattering together with neutron spin echo, and NMR, the different association modes of dialkyl poly (para phenyleneethynylene (PPE) in cyclohexane and their dynamics were investigated. In molecular solutions, the chains assume a worm-like conformation. With decreasing temperatures the chains associate to form aggregates that jam into each other and form fragile gels. The dynamics of the PPE molecules in the molecular solutions is characterized predominantly by center of mass diffusion, coupled to undulations of the backbone and a motion of side chains, whereas in the aggregated phase the center of mass is constrained while the undulations are maintained. As gel is formed, the motion of the aggregates is constrained, however the undulations of the chains within the aggregates is retained. The solvent molecules, though are sensitive to the presence of the polymer chains, retains a large degree of freedom.					5th International Workshop on Complex Systems5th International Workshop on Complex Systems	SEP 25-28, 2007SEP 25-28, 2007		Sendai, JAPANSendai, JAPAN	1	0	0	0	0	1			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0501-1	WOS:000253834300053		
B	Marion, Russ						UhlBien, M; Marion, R		COMPLEXITY THEORY FOR ORGANIZATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP								COMPLEXITY LEADERSHIP, PT 1: CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS		Leadership Horizons						1	15					2008	2008	Complexity theory offers unique perspectives of organizational behavior and of the generation of dynamic adaptability. Those perspectives challenge both reductionist and systems theory assumptions regarding change and importation of energy from the environment; it challenges reductionist-related notions of predictability, planning, and coordination. Complexity theory argues that complex organizational behavior is characterized by nonlinear, emergent change; interaction and interdependency; unpredictability; autocatalytic behavior; and dynamic movement. An important role of leadership (what we call, enabling leadership) in complex systems is to enable the conditions in which complex dynamics can emerge.									12	0	0	1	1	12					978-1-59311-795-5	WOS:000268285500002

These models are eminently effective for an economy premised on physical production but are not well-suited for a more knowledge-oriented economy. Complexity science suggests a different paradigm for leadership-one that frames leadership as a complex interactive dynamic from which adaptive outcomes (e.g., learning, innovation, and adaptability) emerge. This chapter draws from complexity science to develop an overarching framework for the study of complexity leadership theory, a leadership paradigm that focuses on enabling the learning, creative, and adaptive capacity of complex adaptive systems (CAS) within a context of knowledge producing organizations. This conceptual framework includes three entangled leadership roles (i.e., adaptive leadership, administrative leadership, and enabling leadership) that reflect a dynamic relationship between the bureaucratic, administrative functions of the organization and the emergent, informal dynamics of complex adaptive systems (CAS).									3	0	0	0	0	3					978-1-59311-795-5	WOS:000268285500009		
J	Foulk, Jonn A.; Akin, Danny E.; Dodd, Roy B.								Processability of flax plant stalks into functional bast fibers								COMPOSITE INTERFACES				15	2-3			147	168		10.1163/156855408783810902			2008	2008	Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is an agricultural crop that is being considered as cost effective alternative to glass in composites. Flax is nature's composite with strong bast fibers held together in bundles and located in the outer regions of the plant stem between the outermost cuticle-epidermis layer and the innermost, woody tissues. Agricultural production of this crop is environmentally beneficial because it is produced through photosynthesis and considered a naturally renewable and sustainable material. Its use in bio-based composites could help lessen our dependence on fossil fuels today and into the future. Despite the longevity of flax in world markets, particular problems exist to provide flax fiber economically for markets in the US and North America. Barriers to such provisions include consistent, high-quality retting methods, efficient processing of whole steins into cottonized fibers, and development of standards to judge fiber quality. Processability of plant stalks into usable fiber requires retting which selectively removes pectinaceous and matrix substances thus separating cellulose fibers from non-fibrous substances and easing mechanical cleaning. Enzymes have been tested for efficiency of retting, and recommendations are in place for particular fiber properties. Before this work began, no processing facilities existed in North America for producing high value fibers. To facilitate research on bast fiber retting and subsequent processing, the Flax Fiber Pilot Plant (Flax-PP), was designed and modified after the 'Unified Line'; it is the only research facility of this type in the US and effectively processes and extracts bast fibers from plant stalks. A separate cottonizing unit has been installed to complete processing of fibers for various applications. Each processing step creates a fiber product and byproduct both with potential uses in composites. The development of standards through ASTM International is a continuing project. Currently, emphasis is on new equipment to quantify properties of particular usefulness such as cleanliness, fineness, and color. The Flax-PP becomes a valuable tool for improving fiber processing and quality, and thus integrates all activities for a flax fiber industry in North America.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0927-6440			WOS:000255382100004

A number of existing and new constitutive relationships for modeling velocity are summarized or proposed. To effectively treat strong advection components within the modeling system, we apply discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for solving production flow in a supply chain network. In addition, a number of DG properties are analyzed for treating network flow. In particular, a nearly optimal error estimate is obtained using a new estimating technique that utilizes two physical meaningful assumptions on the connectivity matrix. Numerical examples are provided to simulate a single node, a serial supply chain and an entire network as well as to investigate the influence of influx variation and node shut-down to the profiles of work in progress (WIP) and outflux. It is shown that the proposed modeling approach is applicable to a large number of scenarios including re-entrant lines and the proposed DG algorithm is robust and accurate for predicting WIP and outflux behaviors.

The overall goal of the "Active by Choice Today" (ACT) trial is to expand the body of knowledge concerning the factors that influence long-term increases in PA in underserved adolescents (low socioeconmic status, minorities) during their middle school years.Design and setting: An overview of the ACT study design, theoretical framework, process evaluation, and primary hypotheses is presented. The trial involves twenty-four middle schools (1560 6th graders) in South Carolina that are randomly assigned to one of two after-school programs (motivational and life skills intervention, or general health education).Intervention: The intervention integrates constructs from Self-Determination and Social Cognitive Theories to enhance intrinsic motivation and behavioral skills for PA. The intervention targets skill development for PA outside of program days and the after-school program social environment (autonomy, choice, participation, belongingness, fun, enjoyment, support) is designed to positively impact cognitive mediators (self-efficacy, perceived competence), and motivational orientation (intrinsic motivation, commitment, positive self-concept).Main hypotheses/outcomes: It is hypothesized that the 17-week motivational and life skills intervention will lead to greater increases in moderate-to-vigorous PA (based on 7-day accelerometry estimates) at post-intervention as compared to the general health education program.Conclusions: Implications of this innovative school-based trial are discussed.

Nitrogen fertilization at the rice panicle differentiation stage to compensate for rice water weevil (Coleoptera : Curculionidae) injury								CROP PROTECTION				27	1			84	89		10.1016/j.cropro.2007.04.009			JAN 2008	2008	A three-year study was conducted to determine the effect of nitrogen fertilizer rates applied at the panicle initiation stage of rice, Oryza sativa L., and insecticide applications on yield loss caused by rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kushel, damage. Our estimates of yield loss caused by L. oryzophilus injury were, at the recommended nitrogen rate of 191 kg N per ha, 1.7% in 1997, 11.8% in 1998, and 9.9% in 1999. In 1998, doubling the particle differentiation nitrogen rate from 67 to 134 kg N per ha significantly increased yield by 591 kg per ha, averaged across insecticide treated and untreated plots. In both 1998 and 1999, reducing nitrogen rate below the recommended rate significantly (P < 0.05) reduced rice yield, indicating the value of providing the rice plant with sufficient levels of nitrogen. In 1998 and 1999, insecticide treatment increased yield by 570 and 830 kg per ha, respectively. The interaction between insecticide treatment and fertilizer rate was not significant (P > 0.05) for yield in any year of our study, suggesting that increasing nitrogen at the particle differentiation stage does not have a major impact on compensation of the rice plant for L. oryzophilus injury. Our results indicate that farmers should not increase nitrogen fertilizer at the panicle differentiation stage to compensate for L. oryzophilus damage. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ray, C. L.; Shipe, E. R.; Bridges, W. C.								Planting date influence on soybean agronomic traits and seed composition in modified fatty acid breeding lines								CROP SCIENCE				48	1			181	188		10.2135/cropsci2007.05.0290			JAN-FEB 2008	2008	A primary focus for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] breeders recently has been the development of cultivars with improved oil qualities such as reduced palmitic acid (16:0) and linolenic acid (18:3). A backcross breeding program was used to develop five low 16:0, two low 16:0 + 18:3, and one low 18:3 modified fatty acid breeding lines (MFALs). Research objectives were (i) to determine planting date effects on fatty acid content in the eight MFALs and (ii) to compare the MFALs to parental cultivars for seed composition and agronomic traits. The eight MFALs and four control cultivars were evaluated at two planting dates at Clemson, SC, in 2001, 2003, and 2004. Planting dates were chosen to simulate full season and double crop planting dates for South Carolina soybean production. Agronomic traits including seed yield, plant height, lodging, maturity date, seed size, and seed quality were measured, and seeds were analyzed for protein, oil, and fatty acid levels. Planting date had a significant effect on all agronomic variables, as well as on protein, oil, and palmitic and linolenic acid. There was a decrease in palmitic acid at the late planting date, while the early planting date resulted in a decrease in linolenic acid levels. The effect of genotype was significant for all agronomic and seed composition variables measured when averaged across planting dates. It appears that planting date may be manipulated to reduce palmitic or linolenic acid of MFALs, although the extent of the reduction varies with genotype.									14	0	0	10	1	14			0011-183X			WOS:000252971400021

Reaction of [M(C boolean AND N)(mu-Cl)](2) (M = Pt(II), Pd(II); C boolean AND N = 2-phenylpyridinate (ppy) or 7,8-benzoquinolinate (bzq)) with [9]aneS(3) followed by metathesis with NH4PF6 yields [M(C boolean AND N)([9]aneS(3))](PF6). The complexes [M(C boolean AND P)([9]aneS(3))](PF6) (M= Pt(II), Pd(II); C boolean AND P = {CH2C6H4P(o-tolyl)(2)-C boolean AND P}(-)) were synthesized from their respective [Pt(C boolean AND P)(mu-Cl)](2) or [Pd(C boolean AND P)(mu-O2CCH3)](2) (C boolean AND P) starting materials. All five new complexes have been fully characterized by multinuclear NMR, IR and UV-Vis spectroscopies in addition to elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and single-crystal structural determinations. As expected, the coordinated [9]aneS(3) ligand shows fluxional behavior in its NMR spectra, resulting in a single C-13 NMR resonance despite the asymmetric coordination environment of the cyclometallating ligand. Electrochemical studies reveal irreversible one-electron metal-centered oxidations for all Pt( II) complexes, but unusual two-electron reversible oxidations for the Pd( II) complexes of ppy and bzq. The X-ray crystal structures of each complex indicate an axial M - S interaction formed by the endodentate conformation of the [9]aneS(3) ligand. The structure of [ Pd( bzq)([9]aneS(3))](PF6) exhibits disorder in the [9]aneS(3) conformation indicating a rare exodentate conformation as the major contributor in the solid-state structure. DFT calculations on [Pt([9]aneS(3))(ppy)](PF6) and [Pd([9]aneS(3))(ppy)](PF6) indicate the HOMO for both complexes is primarily d(z2) in character with a significant contribution from the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand and p orbital of the axial sulfur donor. In contrast, the calculated LUMO is primarily ppy pi(*) in character for [Pt([9]aneS(3))(ppy)](PF6), but d(x2-y2) in character for [Pd([9]aneS(3))(ppy)](PF6).									26	0	0	0	0	26			1477-9226			WOS:000254424200011	18369494

Degradation terms are defined, to allow a complete understanding of the process by which absorbable materials are reduced and removed from the body. Multiple chemical and biological mechanisms that are at work in the body during material bioresorption are described. Additionally, the design criteria and characteristics for absorbable materials are outlined. The particularly appealing characteristic of an absorbable material is the elimination of a second surgery for implant removal. The lack of a follow-up surgery translates into reduced cost, pain, and recovery time for the patient; the chapter concludes by highlighting the exciting potential of absorbable and degradable materials in biomedicine.									2	0	0	2	0	2					978 1 84569 329 9	WOS:000276890500002

ASME					Dynamics of chain CVT drives: Effects of friction characteristic								DETC2007: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 7								1089	1097					2008	2008	A chain CVT is a type of friction-limited continuously variable transmission that provides a continuum of gear ratios with fewer moving parts. The dynamic performance and torque capacity of a chain CVT drive rely significantly on the friction characteristic of the contact patch between the chain and the pulley. Since the friction characteristic of the contact patch may vary in accordance with the loading and design configurations, it is crucial to study the influence of friction characteristic on the performance of a CVT. Two different mathematical models of friction, which characterize different operating/loading conditions, are embedded into a detailed planar multibody model of chain CVT in order to understand the various friction-induced effects in the system. The mathematical models, the computational scheme, and the results corresponding to different loading scenarios are discussed. The results discuss the influence of friction characteristics on the dynamic performance, the axial force requirements, and the torque transmitting capacity of a chain CVT drive.

In a similar vein, environmentally conscious design has been an increasingly important avenue of research which similarly seeks to reduce waste and thereby mitigate environmental impact. An analysis of the curbside municipal solid waste (MSW) and recycling collection process from a lean manufacturing standpoint reveals numerous non-value added activities which can be eliminated or reduced and value-added activities which can be made more efficient. Environmental America Inc. (EAI) has proposed a collection process which will improve the overall material flow through the use of a collection vehicle specializing in the combined collection of raw waste and recyclable waste. This collection vehicle, combined with localized, low-impact material off-loading facilities has the potential to revolutionize the curbside collection process. Our research supports this vision by configuring the truck layout and process operations, as discussed in this paper.

In our work, we focus on domain-specific digital libraries where the subject matter of the documents is restricted to the topics of concern in the government work; our goal is to assist government users who are knowledgeable in the domain(s) represented in the collection. We report here on two digital government projects: a project with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service with a focus on providing comprehensive access to documents produced by the agency for Forest Service managers, and a second project with the national health portal in Denmark, sundhed.dk, with a focus on meeting the information needs of family practice physicians as they treat patients. In this chapter, we describe how the use of a digital library application, Metadata++, can improve document and information retrieval, and we explore other aspects that contribute to project success, such as involvement of government partners, agency commitment, technology transfer, and evaluation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1571-0270		978-0-387-71611-4	WOS:000270285800028

A significant amount of research has been conducted on trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAS), the two regulated (in the United States [U.S.]) and largest classes of DBPs (on a weight basis). In addition to other measured DBPs, the sum of known DBPs has accounted for 30 to 60% of the total organic halogen (TOX) detected during chlorination, which is the oldest and the most commonly used disinfection technique in water treatment around the world. As a result, the formation and control of THMs and HAAS and other DBPs have been widely researched and discussed in the literature (1-4). However, recent research has shown that there are many emerging DBPs of health concern in drinking waters. The objective of this chapter is to summarize the recent advances in understanding DBP formation, occurrence, control, health effects, and regulations that have occurred mainly within the past five years. It was noteworthy that inorganic DBPs (e.g., bromate, chlorate, chlorite) have received less attention over the past few years as compared to emerging organic DBPs that exhibit high geno- and cytotoxicity.

Oxanine (O), derived from deamination of guanine, is a cytotoxic and potentially mutagenic lesion and studies of its enzymatic repair are limited. Previously, we reported that the murine alkyladenine glycosylase (Aag) acts as an oxanine DNA glycosylase (JBC (2004), 279: 38177). Here, we report our recent findings on additional oxanine DNA glycosylase (ODG) activities in Aag knockout mouse tissues and other mammalian tissues. Analysis of the partially purified proteins from the mammalian cell extracts indicated the existence of ODG enzymes in addition to Aag. Data obtained from oxanine DNA cleavage assays using purified human glycosylases demonstrated that two known glycosylases, hNEIL1 and hSMUG1, contained weak but detectable ODG activities. ODG activity was the highest in hAAG and lowest in hSMUG1. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									9	0	0	9	0	9			1568-7864			WOS:000252232600014	17954039

However, such experiments are often carried out under conditions in which a substantial amount of the energy transfer is through excitations of phonons at the surface. This paper reviews theoretical methods of treating energy transfer to the surface from the limit of purely quantum mechanical elastic diffraction and single phonon transfer to the classical limit of large numbers of phonon excitations. In the multiphonon limit, theories of molecule-surface scattering are discussed which are classical in the translational and rotational degrees of freedom but quantum mechanical in the treatment of internal molecular vibrational modes. Through direct comparison with experiments it is shown that qualitative and quantitative explanations, as well as important physical information, can be obtained for many phenomena involving multiple phonon excitation observed in molecule-surface collisions. Examples are discussed that include both situations in which multiphonon excitation is the primary object of study and cases in which it is a secondary effect that must be accounted for. These examples include scattered angular distributions, translational energy-resolved measurements, rotational energy resolved spectra and internal vibrational mode excitation probabilities.									13	0	0	0	0	13			1573-4331		978-0-08-093120-3	WOS:000310083200006		
J	Lindle, Jane Clark								School safety - Real or imagined fear?								EDUCATIONAL POLICY				22	1			28	44		10.1177/0895904807311295			JAN 2008	2008	The image of schooling tends to be benign, lulling parents and guardians into an assumption of safety for at least 6 hours each weekday. The complement to safety as an imagined state of schooling contains incidents of school violence and tragedy that feed communities' and parents' primeval fears about the well being of their children. The consequences of imagined safety, along with panic resulting from incidents of school violence or other lapses in school safety, yield school policies and rules that, perversely, may exacerbate community fears. Under the 2001 federal law known as No Child Left Behind (NCLB), the consequences of a public accounting for school safety may have generated more opportunities for public fear and panic as opposed to increasing conditions for school safety and security. The article concludes with strategies, rather than the blunt legislative approach to policies, for mediating public fears by ensuring genuine school safety.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0895-9048			WOS:000252289100003

However, there exists inevitable Joule heating in electrokinetic flow, which is known to cause temperature variations in liquids and draw disturbances to electric, flow and concentration fields via temperature-dependent material properties. Therefore, both the throughput and the resolution of analytic studies performed in microfluidic devices are affected. This article reviews the recent progress on the topic of Joule heating and its effect in electrokinetic flow, particularly the theoretical and experimental accomplishments from the aspects of fluid mechanics and heat/mass transfer. The primary focus is placed on the temperature-induced flow variations and the accompanying phenomena at the whole channel or chip level.									51	1	0	21	0	51			0173-0835			WOS:000252826500005	18058768

Development of a multidisciplinary-multiresponse robust design optimization model								ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION				40	9			805	819		10.1080/03052150802046304			2008	2008	Robust design is an efficient process improvement methodology that combines experimentation with optimization to create systems that are tolerant to uncontrollable variation. Most traditional robust design models, however, consider only a single quality characteristic, yet customers judge products simultaneously on a variety of scales. Additionally, it is often the case that these quality characteristics are not of the same type. To addresses these issues, a new robust design optimization model is proposed to solve design problems involving multiple responses of several different types. In this new approach, noise factors are incorporated into the robust design model using a combined array design, and the results of the experiment are optimized using a new approach that is formulated as a nonlinear goal programming problem. The results obtained from the proposed methodology are compared with those of other robust design methods in order to examine the trade-offs between meeting the objectives associated with different optimization approaches.									25	2	0	0	0	27			0305-215X			WOS:000258621200002

Robust design is an enhanced process/product design methodology for determining the best settings of control factors while minimizing process bias and variability. Tolerance design is aimed at determining the best tolerance limits for minimizing the total cost incurred by both the customer and manufacturer by balancing quality loss due to variations in product performance and the cost of controlling these variations. Although robust design and tolerance design have received much attention from researchers and practitioners, there is ample room for improvement. First, most researchers consider robust design and tolerance design as separate research fields. Second, most research work is based on a single quality characteristic. The primary goal of this paper is to integrate a sequential robust design-tolerance design optimization procedure within a bi-objective paradigm, which, the authors believe, is the first attempt in the robust design and tolerance design literature. Models are proposed and numerical examples along with sensitivity analysis are performed for verification purposes.									10	1	0	0	0	11			0305-215X			WOS:000260208100001

The results suggest that culture and transition context help explain scanning frequency, but entrepreneurs in the two countries are similar in their perceptions of strategic uncertainty in environmental sectors. Moreover, the perceptions of increased environmental change and sector importance, as conditioned by perceived information accessibility, are associated with increased scanning. Overall, our results provide important indications about perceptions and information seeking, and lend support to indications of a universal mindset of entrepreneurship.									26	0	0	0	1	27			1042-2587			WOS:000251629700005

Specifically, rhetorical forms of the jeremiad and myth are examined as adaptations to the medium of children's literature. In addition, the force of illustrated images is discussed, including the rhetorical force of color. The essay begins with a discussion of both Dr. Seuss and The Lorax within the contexts of the early environmental movement's rhetoric of alarm and political activism. It then outlines Seuss's attempt at "propaganda with a plot'' arguing that a collision of the American myth and ecological jeremiad parallel and divert from the environmentalist norm. A detailed analysis of illustrated imagery and the function of color demonstrate the rhetorical force toward narration and ideology possible in the visual form.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1752-4032			WOS:000207486500002

However, a recent study reported aerobic CH4 emission from plants by an unrecognized process, a result that has since been questioned. We investigated CH4 emissions under aerobic conditions from aboveground tissues of 44 species indigenous to the temperate Inner Mongolia steppe. Ten herbaceous hydrophytes (wetland-adapted plants) were examined, two of which-Glyceria spiculosa and Scirpus yagara-emitted CH4 from stems but not from detached leaves. Of 34 xerophytes (arid-adapted plants) examined, 7 out of 9 shrub species emitted CH4 from detached leaves but not stems, whereas none of 25 herbaceous xerophytes emitted CH4. The herbaceous hydrophyte, S. yagara, emitted highly C-13-depleted CH4, suggesting a microbial origin. Achillea frigida exhibited the highest CH4 emission rates among the shrubs and continuously emitted relatively C-13-enriched CH4 from detached leaves, indicating that CH4 was derived directly from plant tissues under aerobic conditions. Because woody species are relatively rare in the Inner Mongolia steppe, aerobic, plant-derived CH4 emission is probably negligible in this region, Our results may imply a larger role for aerobic CH4 production in upland ecosystems dominated by woody species or in ecosystems where woody encroachment is occurring as a result of global change.									55	11	0	48	0	68			0013-936X			WOS:000252037400013	18350876

This paper assesses the resources available to help medium-sized cities begin the task of creating such systems. This assessment presents infrastructure risk assessment tools, identifies infrastructure and funding resources, and creates a process for developing a security framework to connect agencies responsible for transportation security in these metropolitan areas. Descriptions of transportation security framework practices at the national level had led to the preparation of a transportation security framework for Greenville, South Carolina, USA, to serve as a prototype that other medium-sized cities can emulate. This security framework can serve as either a checklist to ensure security coverage in existing asset management systems and intelligent transportation systems architectures such as those frequently used in the U. S., Europe, and Japan, or it can provide baseline structure for developing a new transportation security framework for cities in developing countries.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1567-7133			WOS:000271910600001

We employed a multi-generation breeding experiment to test the hypotheses that karyotypic differences, body size differences, or geographic isolation among populations will increase pre or postzygotic reproductive barriers. Overall, prezygotic barriers were strong and postzygotic barriers weak in crosses of non-hybrid heterospecifics (F1 hybrid crosses) while prezygotic barriers were weaker and postzygotic barriers stronger in crosses involving hybrid individuals (F2 hybrid crosses and backcrosses). Prezygotic barriers among the two smaller species (Fundulus notatus and F. euryzonus) broke down rapidly; first generation hybrids spawned (F2 hybrid crosses and backcrosses) as frequently as parental forms in intraspecific crosses. There was no increase in postzygotic barriers among species with cytogenetic differences. There were increased prezygotic, but not postzygotic, barriers among geographically isolated populations of one species. While pure males and females were just as likely to spawn with hybrids, some types of hybrid females suffered from increased sterility, but not inviability, over hybrid males. Female sterility was only seen in hybrids with a Fundulus euryzonus parent, while other female hybrids produced viable eggs.									13	0	0	14	0	14			0269-7653			WOS:000251651100004

These factors provide cultural and environmental management challenges for landscape management. Urbanization and land use changes near coastal areas have been shown to degrade water quality. In an effort to reduce fertilizer-based nutrient pollution from urban areas, various programs are promoting alternative landscape materials, which require less input than traditional turfgrass vegetation. Although landscapes that utilize various plant materials that require traditional inputs may conceivably reduce nutrient pollution from urban landscapes, this idea remains unresolved. Here we use a replicated field experiment to show that P and K pollution via leaching was greater on a mixed-species ornamental landscape than a turfgrass monoculture during establishment and routine plant maintenance.

B	Wang, Liangjiang								Random Forests for Prediction of DNA-Binding Residues in Protein Sequences Using Evolutionary Information								FGCN: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2008 SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUTURE GENERATION COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING, VOLS 1 AND 2								976	981					2008	2008	A new machine learning approach has been developed in this study for sequence-based prediction of DNA-binding residues in proteins. The approach used both the labeled data instances collected from the available structures of protein-DNA complexes and the abundant unlabeled data found in protein sequence databases. The evolutionary information contained in the unlabeled sequence data was represented as position-specific scoring matrices and several new descriptors. The sequence-derived features were used to train random forests, which could handle a large number of input variables and avoid model overfitting. The use of evolutionary information was found to significantly improve classifier performance. The RF classifier was further evaluated using a separate test dataset. The results suggest that the RF-based approach gives rise to more accurate prediction of DNA-binding residues than previous studies.					2nd International Conference on Future Generation Communications and Networking2nd International Conference on Future Generation Communications and Networking	DEC 13-15, 2008DEC 13-15, 2008	IEEEIEEE	Hainan, PEOPLES R CHINAHainan, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-4008-5	WOS:000265567100210

The instructor and learning assistants serve as facilitators of guided inquiry by asking students leading questions as they work through class assignments. On-going, real time formative assessments ensure that the instructor is constantly aware of which students are mastering the material and which are struggling. The SCALE-UP format is currently used at our institution in the General Engineering program (all sections of the first year courses), Math Sciences (all sections of first year calculus, and one section of second year calculus), Civil Engineering (one section of engineering statics), Mechanical Engineering (all sections of engineering statics and dynamics), as well as in courses in Horticulture, Nursing, English, and Computer Science. This special session focuses on strategies for successful implementation of this pedagogical innovation. These include development of student activities, formative assessments, training for instructors and learning assistants, and the physical features of the learning environment.

IEEE					Work in Progress - Tablet PCs as Interactive Web-Based Instruction Tools in a First Year Engineering Course								FIE: 2008 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3		Frontiers in Education Conference						358	360					2008	2008	This paper presents pedagogical experiments conducted using MessageGrid, a web-based system that enables instructors to interact electronically with their students, and Tablet PCs. These combined technologies make active learning a reality in the classroom while maintaining the necessary pace of the course. All students, including those who are reluctant to participate in class, are able to share their work and receive feedback from the instructor. The goal of this research is to measurably improve the success of at-risk students in a first-year engineering course, which can ultimately improve retention. We examine the outcomes of using MessageGrid to allow students to "go public" with their work, demonstrating their mastery of course material. Because this is easily implemented using a Tablet PC, and can be done anonymously through the use of MessageGrid, students overcome their fears associated with making this "commitment." Grades on assignments related to topics taught with and without Tablet PCs are compared, as well as student responses to questions related to how they understand course materials.

This work employed a social cognitive theoretical framework to qualitatively investigate the educational experiences of FGC engineering students at an urban research university. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants in this pilot study. Interview data were coded and content analyzed using NVivo (TM) software. Nearly sixty emergent themes were identified, including six major barriers: 1) lack of understanding of the college admissions process, 2) financial constraints, 3) difficulty of coursework, 4) lack of engineering role models, 5) role conflicts and 6) lack of parental understanding about higher education and/or engineering. These barriers are discussed in terms of developing effective recruitment and retention interventions for first generation college students majoring in engineering, and recommendations for future work are offered.

IEEE					Influences for Selecting Engineering: Insights on Access to Social Capital from Two Case Studies								FIE: 2008 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3		Frontiers in Education Conference						947	+					2008	2008	This paper employs the theory of Social Capital to explore the educational experiences and academic career decisions of engineering undergraduates. Two case studies are presented from a larger mixed-methods project which investigated the experiences of ethnically and socio-economically diverse female engineering students at an urban research university. Participants completed an online survey, which included items about reasons for selecting engineering and information sources utilized in doing so. Additionally, semi-structured interviews explored participants' perceived supports and barriers for college and career plans. Triangulation of survey and interview data yielded insights regarding the relations between social capital and students' academic and career decision making processes. While both participants first became interested in engineering during middle school, their reasons for entering the field and access to information about engineering were very different. The social capital inequity apparent in these cases can be attributed in part to parental educational attainment and occupation.

Our program retains approximately 70% of new students in engineering disciplines. Students who choose to leave engineering by the end of their first year at our institution voluntarily complete a survey with questions regarding their certainty upon entry, motivating factors to enter and to leave engineering, and what appeals to them about their new majors. We have analyzed nearly 400 surveys over a five-year period to examine correlations between reasons for leaving and how students come to that decision, with changes in program resources, specifically refining career information, personality profile assessment, and mastery assessment. Open-ended survey responses were categorized based on concerns about the profession, the curriculum, self-awareness and institutional (or programmatic) issues. Using career theory as a framework, the survey responses were evaluated in light of programmatic changes that have been implemented.

The physical and mechanical properties of the films were compared with gelatin and HPMC films. The same starches were used to develop hard capsules for utilization in the pharmaceutical industry as a substitute for gelatin or animal based products. Starches with high amylose content had excellent film and hard capsule forming abilities and properties compared to the starches with low amylase content. The starch films also had excellent oxygen barrier properties (0.048 +/- 0.008 to 0.070 +/- 0.009 fl m/m(2) s Pa), but water barrier properties (1.1 +/- 0.5 to 1.8 0.4 ng m/m(2) s Pa) were higher than LDPE (0.00064 ng m/m(2) s Pa synthetic polymer films. The tensile strength values of starch films (12.1 +/- 10.7 to 19.0 +/- 2.2 MPa) were not significantly different from gelatin (19.5 +/- 1.6 MPa) and HPMC (19.9 +/- 1.2 MPa) films. In the case of elongation properties, starch films had lower values (42.2 +/- 7.7 to 79.4 +/- 9.2%,) than gelatin film (122.0 +/- 14.6%), but higher than HPMC film (13.8 +/- 4.2%). Molecular (SEC-MALLS) and physical (viscosity) characterization of vegetable starches, indicated that the starches with high amylose content produced better biopolymer films and capsules compared to the starches with low amylose and high amylopectin content. Biodegradable films and hard capsules for pharmaceutical applications could be developed from vegetable starches with similar physical and mechanical properties as synthetic and gelatin products.

Neutrinos emission is the means by which a newly-born neutron star formed in a core-collapse event cools. Neutrinos may play a significant role in causing the supernova explosion. Finally neutrinos may significantly affect the nucleosynthesis occurring in the layers of the exploding star that are eventually ejected into interstellar space. This paper reviews some interesting neutrino-nucleus processes that may occur in the cores of exploding massive stars and then discusses some effects neutrinos may have on explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae.

Simulation results show that the presence of a magnetic field changes the properties of the shock interface between a tenuous, overpressured jet flowing parallel to the shock interface and a dense external medium. Magnetic fields can lead to more efficient acceleration of the jet; in comparison to the pure -hydrodynamic case. A "poloidal" magnetic field (B-z), tangent to the interface and parallel to the jet flow, produces both a stronger outward moving shock and a stronger inward moving rarefaction wave. This leads to a large velocity component normal to the interface in addition to acceleration tangent to the interface, and the jet is thus accelerated to larger Lorentz factors than those obtained in the pure hydrodynamic case. Likewise, a strong "toroidal" magnetic field (B-y), tangent to the interface but perpendicular to the jet flow, also leads to stronger acceleration tangent to the shock interface relative to the pure hydrodynamic case. Thus, the presence and relative orientation of a magnetic field in relativistic jets can significant modify the hydrodynamic boost mechanism studied by Aloy and Rezzolla.

The 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope is a fully robotic system dedicated to the measurement of prompt and early time optical emission from GRBs. The system began routine operations from its Steward Observatory site atop Kitt Peak in April 2000 and currently operates every clear night. The telescope is instrumented with an optical CCD camera and a four position filter wheel. It is capable of observing Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) error boxes as early or earlier than the Swift UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT). Super-LOTIS complements the UVOT observations by providing early R- and I-band imaging. We also use the suite of Steward Observatory telescopes including the 1.6-m Kuiper, the 2.3-m Bok, the 6.5-m MMT, and the 8.4-m Large Binocular Telescope to perform follow-up optical and near infrared observations of GRB afterglows. These follow-up observations have traditionally required human intervention but we are currently working to automate the 1.6-m Kuiper telescope to minimize its response time.

The F-1 grains and leaves were non-aromatic while the F-2 non-aroma to aroma segregation pattern was 3:1. The F-3 segregation ratio was consistent with the expected 1: 2: 1 for a single recessive aroma gene in Ch-29B. Linkage analysis between simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and the aroma locus for the aromatic F-2 plants mapped the Ch-29B aroma gene to a chromosome 8 region flanked by SSR markers RM23120 at 0.52 cM and RM3459 at 1.23 cM, a replicate F-2 population confirming these results. Three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones cover chromosome 8 markers RM23120 and RM3459. Our molecular mapping data from the two populations indicated that the aroma locus occurs in a 142.85 kb interval on BAC clones AP005301 or AP005537, implying that it might be the same gene reported by Bradbury et al (2005a; Plant Biotec J. 3:363-370). The flanking markers Aro7, RM23120 and RM3459 identified by us could greatly accelerate the efficiency and precision of aromatic rice breeding programs.									14	2	0	13	0	16			1415-4757	1678-4685		WOS:000256957500021

With the development of X-ray crystallography and modern spectroscopic techniques, the directionality and strength of halogen bonds has been determined. Halogen bonds between dihalogens and Lewis bases fall into four main categories: simple adducts, bridging adducts, amphoteric adducts, and adducts that are both bridging and amphoteric. In the case of very strong interactions between the electron donor and the dihalogen, the halogen-halogen bond is broken, leading to ionic or oxidative addition products. The theoretical description of the halogen bond has also progressed, in parallel with the development of increasingly sophisticated theories of bonding. Relatively accurate predictions of structural parameters and interaction energies are now possible, but they present a challenge to available computational hardware and software.									52	0	0	4	0	52			0081-5993		978-3-540-74329-3	WOS:000252647100003

J	Montanucci, Richard R.								TAXONOMIC HISTORY AND STATUS OF THE COAHUILA BISHOP'S CAP								HASELTONIA					14			176	184					2008	2008	Astrophytum coahuilense (MOLLER) KAYSER has had an unsettled taxonomic history since it was originally named as a subspecies of A. myriostigma LEMAIRE by H Moller in 1927. A review of the systematic and horticultural literature reveals that A. coahuilense has been treated as a variety or synonym of A. myriostigma by botanists in the United States and Mexico but is generally, recognized as a distinct species in Germany, and other parts of Europe. Recent encyclopedic and regionally, significant works treat A. coahuilense as a synonym of A. myriostigma. Previous authors performed hybridization experiments involving the two taxa and reported reproductive isolation between them, but these authors provided little or no quantitative data in support of their observations. The results of my preliminary, hybridization experiments are in agreement with these published reports. A. coahuilense and A. myriostigma, when artificially hybridized, failed to set fruit or produced seed that, in most cases, failed to germinate. Furthermore, A. coahuilense and A. myriostigma differ in fruit morphology, mode of fruit dehiscence, and have allopatric geographical distributions of several hundred kilometers. The distinguishing genetic and morphological attributes provide compelling evidence for the recognition of the Coahuila Bishop's Cap as a distinct species.									3	0	0	3	1	3			1070-0048			WOS:000261680500013

Global diversity of black flies (Diptera : Simuliidae) in freshwater								HYDROBIOLOGIA				595				469	475		10.1007/s10750-007-9114-1			JAN 2008	2008	Black flies are a worldwide family of nematocerous Diptera whose immature stages are confined to running waters. They are key organisms in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but are perhaps best known for the bloodsucking habits of adult females. Attacks by black flies are responsible for reduced tourism, deaths in wild and domestic birds and mammals, and transmission of parasitic diseases to hosts, including humans. About 2,000 nominal species are currently recognized; however, certain geographical regions remain inadequately surveyed. Furthermore, studies of the giant polytene chromosomes of larvae reveal that many morphologically recognized species actually consist of two or more structurally indistinguishable (yet reproductively isolated) sibling species. Calculations derived from the best-known regional fauna-the Nearctic Region-reveal that the actual number of World black fly species exceeds 3,000.									22	0	0	20	3	23			0018-8158			WOS:000252253300048

Low-complexity adaptive transmission for cognitive radios in dynamic spectrum access networks								IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS				26	1			83	94		10.1109/JSAC.2008.080108			JAN 2008	2008	Cognitive radios that are employed in a network with dynamic frequency assignments must operate efficiently in the presence of uncertainties and variations in the propagation characteristics of the network's communication links. A low-complexity adaptive transmission protocol is described and evaluated for use in cognitive radio networks whose links have unknown and possibly time-varying propagation losses as a result of such phenomena as slow fading or variations in shadowing. The cognitive radios are required to derive only simple statistics in the receivers in order to provide the information that is needed by our protocol; no estimates or measurements of received power or channel gain are used. The protocol's primary mechanism for responding to changes in propagation loss is to adjust the modulation and coding. Because of disruptions that can be caused by higher levels of interference to other radios in the network, the transmitter power is increased only if the most powerful combination of coding and modulation is inadequate. We employ finite-state Markov models for slowly varying channels, and we demonstrate that for such channels our protocol performs nearly as well as an ideal protocol that is told the exact value of the propagation loss for each packet transmission. Thus, the additional complexity that is required to enable cognitive radios to obtain precise channel-gain estimates is not justified and would lead to only negligible improvement in throughput. The throughput of our adaptive transmission protocol is compared with an upper bound that is derived from information theory for a hypothetical ideal protocol that is given perfect channel-state information, and some preliminary results on learning the adaptation decision intervals are included.									37	1	0	0	0	38			0733-8716			WOS:000251848800008		
J	Collins, Edward R. (Randy); Jiang, Jian								Voltage sags and the response of a synchronous distributed generator: A case study								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY				23	1			442	448		10.1109/TPWRD.2007.905562			JAN 2008	2008	The dynamic behavior of a synchronous distributed generator connected to a distribution system during fault conditions is studied. A fault on an actual system was found to have a sag that was extended after the fault was cleared. It is shown that the combination of the generator and the load on the system contributes to the extended sag. The detailed simulation studies demonstrate that the primary factors are the reactive power drawn by the load during the fault and recovery along with the reaction of the generator. The prediction of such behavior requires proper modeling of the generator, the generator's controls, and the system and dynamic load. Operators of such generators need to be aware of this type of system and load response when synchronous DG is connected to a distribution network.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0885-8977			WOS:000252059100054

Trading with a stock chart heuristic								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS				38	1			93	104		10.1109/TSMCA.2007.909508			JAN 2008	2008	The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is a cornerstone of financial economics. The EMH asserts that security prices fully reflect all available information and that the stock market prices securities at their fair values. Therefore, investors cannot consistently "beat the market" because stocks reside in perpetual equilibrium, making research efforts futile. This flies in the face of the conventional nonacademic wisdom that astute analysts can beat the market using technical or fundamental stock analysis. The purpose of this research is to partially assess whether technical analysts, who predict future stock prices by analyzing past stock prices, can consistently achieve a trading return that outperforms the stock market average return. This is tested using knowlege engineering experimentation with one price history pattern-the "bull Hag stock chart"-which signals technical analysts of a future stock market price increase. A recognizer for the stock chart pattern is built using a template-matching technique from pattern recognition. The recognizer and associated trading rules are then tested by simulating trading on over 35 years of daily closing price data for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index. The experiment is then replicated using the horizontal rotation or mirror image pattern of the "bull flag" (or "bear flag" stock chart) that signals a future stock market decrease. Results are systematic, statistically significant, and fail to confirm the null hypothesis based on a corollary to the EMH: that profit realized from trading determined by this heuristic method is no better than what would be realized from trading decisions based on random choice.									13	0	0	0	0	13			1083-4427			WOS:000251974500010

Nonlinear-control strategy for advanced vehicle thermal-management systems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY				57	1			127	137		10.1109/TVT.2007.901892			JAN 2008	2008	Advanced thermal-management systems for internal combustion engines can improve coolant-temperature regulation and servomotor power consumption by better regulating the combustion process with multiple computer-controlled electromechanical components. The traditional thermostat valve, coolant pump, and clutch-driven radiator fan are upgraded with servomotor actuators. When the system components function harmoniously, desired thermal conditions can be accomplished in a power-efficient manner. In this paper, a comprehensive nonlinear-control architecture is proposed for transient-temperature tracking. An experimental system has been fabricated and assembled which features a variable-position smart valve, variable-speed electric water pump, variable-speed electric radiator fan, engine block, and various sensors. In the configured system, the steam-based heat exchanger emulates the heat generated by the engine's combustion process. Representative numerical and experimental results are discussed to demonstrate the functionality of the thermal-management system in accurately tracking the prescribed temperature profiles and minimizing electrical power consumption.									20	5	0	0	0	25			0018-9545			WOS:000252575300012		
B	Ruckle, William H.

At each moment of time each player can move to an adjacent point or remain at the point at which it stands. The goal is for both players to reach the same point in the least time. There are optimal strategy pairs for which both players tend toward the center. Using this result and a matrix representation for the situation we employ a symbolic program (Maxima) to determine all possible solutions to searches on lines having four or five points, the cases of 1, 2, or 3 points being trivial.

Current parallel file systems provide large amounts of aggregate I/O bandwidth; however, they do not achieve the high degrees of metadata scalability required to manage files distributed across hundreds or thousands of storage nodes. In this paper we examine the use of collective communication between the storage servers to improve the scalability of file metadata operations. In particular, we apply server-to-server communication to simplify consistency checking and improve the performance of file creation, file removal, and file stat. Our results indicate that collective communication is an effective scheme for simplifying consistency checks and significantly improving the performance for several real metadata intensive workloads.

Challenges of multiscale permeability variation in subsurface flow problems are addressed by using multiscale discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, where we construct local DG basis functions at a coarse scale while capturing local properties of Darcy flow at a fine scale, and then solve the DG formulation using the newly constructed local basis functions on the coarse-scale elements. Challenges of transport problems include the coupling of multiple processes, such advection, diffusion, dispersion, and reaction across different scales, which is treated here by using two splitting approaches based on operator decomposition. The methods decompose the coupled system into various individual operators with respect to their scales and physics, so that each subproblem can be solved with its own most efficient algorithm. These subproblems are coupled adaptively with iterative steps. Error estimates for the decomposition methods are derived. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the properties and effectiveness of both multiscale DG and operator-splitting methods.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1543-1649			WOS:000254868800009		
J	Brown, Carroll A.; Mcguire, Francis A.; Voelkl, Judith								The link between successful aging and serious leisure								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGING & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT				66	1			73	95		10.2190/AG.66.1.d			2008	2008	The purpose of this qualitative study is to examine whether engagement in a serious leisure activity provided older adults opportunities for successful aging. Data were collected through in-depth interviews at shag dance festivals in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. To provide structure for the interview, a general interview guide consisting of open-ended questions was used. A total of 31 interviews were conducted with 25 individuals and 6 couples, between 60 and 82 years of age. During the analysis stage, the constant comparative method was used to analyze the data. Themes that emerged support the idea that shag dancing is a form of serious leisure for older adults and support the role of serious leisure in successful aging. The narratives provided by the informants illustrate the powerful role serious leisure can play in an individual's life and point toward the value of serious leisure as an approach that holds promise for recreators working to help older individuals experience successful aging.									31	0	0	1	0	31			0091-4150			WOS:000254277600004	18429484

Evaluating the effects of virtual training in an aircraft maintenance task								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AVIATION PSYCHOLOGY				18	1			104	116		10.1080/10508410701749506			JAN-MAR 2008	2008	To provide the public with continuing, safe, and reliable air transportation it is important to have a sound aircraft inspection and maintenance system. To ensure that aircraft maintenance inspectors are adequately trained, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of the task of aircraft maintenance inspection. One proven technique for improving inspection performance is the use of training. Due to the nature of aircraft maintenance, inspection is vital in locating damage to the wing, fuselage, aircraft cargo bay, and other components of an aircraft. Because inspection plays such an important part of aircraft maintenance, it is imperative that inspectors are adequately trained and competent to ensure that damage to aircraft does not go unnoticed during routine maintenance. The purpose of this study was to develop a simulated aircraft cargo bay in a virtual reality (VR) environment to explore VR as a training tool and examine differences between general and detailed inspection under paced and unpaced conditions.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1050-8414			WOS:000253314600010

Prediction of lipid-interacting amino acid residues from sequence features								International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design				1	1			14	25		10.1504/IJCBDD.2008.018707			2008	2008	Proteins and lipids are integral components of cell membranes, and play important roles in cell signalling. Alterations of normal protein-lipid recognition may cause various diseases. However, molecular mechanisms underlying protein-lipid recognition are still poorly understood. In this study, we have developed a support vector machine-based approach for predicting lipid-interacting residues from amino acid sequence features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that applies machine learning to sequence-based prediction of lipid-interacting residues in proteins. Our study provides useful information for understanding protein-lipid interactions, and may lead to advances in drug discovery.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1756-0756	1756-0764		BCI:BCI201200062795	20054998

Vehicle configuration design with a packing genetic algorithm								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAVY VEHICLE SYSTEMS				15	2-4			433	448					2008	2008	3D packing problems occur in many applications. Exhaustive search methods cannot identify an optimum packing in reasonable time. To improve the search efficiency of such problems, a packing Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a new encoding method and packing GA operators is proposed. The method is applied to a vehicle configuration design problem, in which the goal is to maximise the vehicle survivability, maintainability and minimise vehicle rollover tendency by finding optimal positions of vehicle components. The packing GA is integrated with a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to search for a non-dominated front, which offers trade-off solutions to the designer.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1744-232X			WOS:000263309200015

Effectively scheduling jobs on critical or bottleneck equipment in the wafer fab can promote on-time deliveries. One type of critical fab equipment is a diffusion oven which processes multiple wafer lots (jobs) simultaneously in batches. We present a new polynomial time Batch Improvement Algorithm for scheduling a batch-processing machine to maximize on-time delivery performance (minimize total weighted tardiness) when job arrivals are dynamic. The proposed algorithm's performance is compared to previous research efforts under varying problem conditions. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the Batch Improvement Algorithm.									15	1	0	0	0	16			0020-7543			WOS:000251027900006

Significant work done in the CAFD field, the different methods used for each design phase, their working principles, and the information modeling requirements are presented. Information flows are developed through identification of CAFD phases (problem definition, fixture synthesis, and fixture analysis), of the effective methods for each, and of their input/output traffic. This survey is used to establish the representation and information requirements for integrated CAFD leading to a novel representation scheme. Specifically, the information types required include geometric information, locator information (number, type, orientation, and position), material properties, machining information (tool paths), applied forces, tolerance requirements, and displacement (errors).									22	0	0	0	0	22			0020-7543			WOS:000252337900004

Numbers of circulating white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes and monocytes were lower in the 2 Gy group compared to 0 Gy (p < 0.05); a trend for low granulocytes was also noted. Red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were decreased in irradiated animals (p < 0.05), whereas platelet counts and volume were unaffected. In the spleen, WBC counts and DNA synthesis by T cells were similar among groups and there were no differences in secreted interferon-gamma and interleukin-6. However, trends were noted for increased splenocyte capacity to secrete tumor necrosis factor-alpha and increased level of vascular endothelial cell growth factor in plasma. One or more of the irradiated groups had significant (p < 0.05) aberrations in several blood chemistry parameters associated with liver and kidney function.Conclusion: The data show that exposure to 56-Fe radiation induced pathological changes in important body systems long after exposure.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0955-3002			WOS:000258001700002	18661371

ADAPTIVE NON-LINEAR TRACKING CONTROL OF KINEMATICALLY REDUNDANT ROBOT MANIPULATORS								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS & AUTOMATION				23	2			98	105					2008	2008	Past research efforts have focused on the end-effector tracking control of redundant robots because of their increased dexterity over their non-redundant counterparts. This work utilizes an adaptive full-state feedback quaternion-based controller developed in [2] and focuses on the design of a general sub-task controller. This sub-task controller does not affect the position and orientation tracking control objectives, but instead projects a preference on the configuration of the manipulator based on sub-task objectives such as the following: singularity avoidance, joint limit avoidance, bounding the impact forces, and bounding the potential energy.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0826-8185			WOS:000266389700004

To achieve this objective, mapping is required to relate the joint/link control inputs to the desired Cartesian position and orientation. If there are uncertainties or singularities in the mapping, then degraded performance or unpredictable responses by the manipulator are possible. To address these issues, an adaptive tracking controller for robot manipulators with uncertainty in the kinematic and dynamic models is developed in this paper. The controller is developed based on the unit quaternion representation so that singularities associated with three parameter representations are avoided. Experimental results for a planar application of the Barrett whole arm manipulator (WAM) are provided to illustrate the performance of the developed controller.									29	2	0	0	0	30			0826-8185	1925-7090		WOS:000266389700006

The interpretation of cellular transport graphics by students with low and high prior knowledge								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION				30	2			239	261		10.1080/09500690601187168			2008	2008	The purpose of this study was to examine how prior knowledge of cellular transport influenced how high school students in the USA viewed and interpreted graphic representations of this topic. The participants were Advanced Placement Biology students (n = 65); each participant had previously taken a biology course in high school. After assessing prior knowledge using the Diffusion and Osmosis Diagnostic Test, two graphical representations of cellular transport processes were selected for analysis. Three different methods of data collection - eye tracking, interviews, and questionnaires - were used to investigate differences in perceived salient features of the graphics, interpretations of the graphics, and processing difficulty experienced while attending to and interpreting the graphics. The results from the eye tracking data, interviews, and instructional representation questionnaires were triangulated and revealed differences in how high and low prior knowledge students attended to and interpreted particle differences, concentration gradient, the role of adenosine triphosphate, endocytosis and exocytosis, and text labels and captions. Without adequate domain knowledge, low prior knowledge students focused on the surface features of the graphics ( ex. differences in particle colour) to build an understanding of the concepts represented. On the other hand, with more abundant and better-organised domain knowledge, high prior knowledge students were more likely to attend to the thematically relevant content in the graphics, which enhanced their understanding. The findings of this study offer a more complete understanding of how differentially prepared learners view and interpret graphics and have the potential to inform instructional design.									21	0	0	3	1	22			0950-0693			WOS:000251577400006

A novel path planning and control framework for passive resistance therapy with a robot manipulator								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE				39	6			639	653		10.1080/00207720701860037			2008	2008	In this article, we present a paradigm for safe path generation and control for a robotic manipulator such that it provides programmable passive resistance therapy to patients with deficits in the upper extremities. When the patient applies an interaction force at the robot's end-effector, a dynamic path generator time parameterises any therapist-specified contour in the robot's workspace-thus, the robot mimics the dynamics of a passive impedance whose anisotropy vector can be continuously reconfigured. The proposed algorithm is easily implementable because it is robust to uncertainty in the robot dynamics. Moreover, the proposed strategy also guarantees user safety by maintaining the net flow of energy during the human robot interaction from the user towards the manipulator.					43rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control43rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	DEC 14-17, 2004DEC 14-17, 2004	IEEE Control Syst Soc; Honeywell; MathWorks; Natl Instruments; United Technol Res Ctr; XEROXIEEE Control Syst Soc; Honeywell; MathWorks; Natl Instruments; United Technol Res Ctr; XEROX	BAHAMASBAHAMAS	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-7721	1464-5319		WOS:000254949400006

The analytical model includes the mass imbalance, stiffness non-uniformity, and radial run-out in addition to hysteretic energy dissipation and a longitudinal slip model. The system identification, based on a genetic algorithm, uses the experimental tangential and radial first harmonic wheel hub force variations as the target outputs. The results demonstrate that non-uniformities produce wheel hub forces at multiple combination frequencies of the first harmonic frequency.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0143-3369			WOS:000254027800001

B	Salehi-Khojin, Amin; Jalili, Nader			ASME					An analytical modeling framework for piezoelectric-based microcantilever actuator/sensor with thermal effects consideration								INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION 2007, VOL 11 PT A AND PT B: MICRO AND NANO SYSTEMS								169	175					2008	2008	In many surface science applications, piezoelctrically-actuated based micro-machines offer outstanding opportunity to detect topography of substrate in the scale of nano-meter. As the tip scan the surface of the sample, the laser beam deflected from the end of cantilever provide information related to nanoscale surface texture. However, application of laser beam to detect deflection of microcantilever beam will raise the local temperature of cantilever. This results in the resonance frequency shift due to the change in the effective stiffness of micro-beam. Therefore, studying the thermal effects on the microbeam is crucial when designing and employing microcantilever. In this study, a new modeling framework is presented for piezoelectrically driven atomic force microscopy (AFM). The piezoelectric layers are used as actuator and sensor attached on the top and bottom side of the cantilever. In our model, the local thermal effect due to laser beam has been also taken into account. The Hamilton's principle is used to derive the governing equations.

B	Hosseini, Mahmoud Reza; Jalili, Nader			ASME					Multiphysics, multiphase modeling of carbon nanotube synthesis process by chemical vapor deposition								INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION 2007, VOL 11 PT A AND PT B: MICRO AND NANO SYSTEMS								1197	1206					2008	2008	In the present paper, a comprehensive modeling framework is proposed to conduct multiphysics, multiphase modeling of carbon nanotube (CNT) fabrication process by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The modeling is based on fluid dynamics, heat transfer, chemical reaction, as well as mass transport phenomena which have been fully coupled with each other. The inserted gasses are considered as methane (CH4) as the main hydrocarbon gas and hydrogen (H-2) as the process enhancement gas. In the gas phase reaction section, a novel set of reactions for CH4 hydrocarbon gas is proposed which is based on 71 different chemical reactions that take place near CVD inlet. Also, surface reactions are modeled by considering 19 set of reactions acting near substrate surface which lead to CNTs formation. The investigation is performed for different combination of gas flow rate quantities ranging from 500 to 1000 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) for methane and 250 to 500 sccm for hydrogen gas. Also, the quartz tube temperature is considered to change from 700 to 1000 degrees C. Since the thermal specifications for each species are calculated individually, the gas flow inside the quartz tube is treated as nonisothermal flow. Numerous simulations are conducted and the results are compared with the fabricated CNT's images taken by the SEM (scanning electron microscopy). Utilizing the obtained diagrams from modeling, the effects caused by gas mixture flow rate and temperature changes on the production rate of gas phase species such as H, CH3, C2H2 and bulk carbon species (C and 2C) that produced by surface species TC and TC2 are investigated. It is found that increasing the fabricated temperature causes a rise in species production rate. However, it is observed that the produced species respond differently to any change in hydrogen and hydrocarbon flow rates. The velocity, temperature profile as well as concentration distribution along the silicon substrate length have been also investigated. This study can lead to a controlled CNTs manufacturing process when combined with in-situ measurement systems.

This study investigated the longitudinal associations between problem alcohol use and victimization, and whether these associations varied by gender.Methods: Data from the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health (Add Health) were used to investigate the prospective associations between alcohol use and victimization over three time points spanning 7 years. Because adolescence is a time of rapid growth, we used latent growth modeling (LGM) in addition to traditional cross-lagged structural equation modeling (SEM).Results: For boys, both SEM and LGM indicated that problem alcohol use was a risk factor for subsequent violent victimization. For girls, the SEM suggested a bi-directional association, although the LGM provided stronger support for problem alcohol use as a risk factor for, rather than a consequence of, violent victimization.Conclusions: Findings across the two statistical approaches suggest that interventions that reduce the likelihood of problem alcohol use among adolescents can minimize the short-term risk of victimization and the long-term risk of problem alcohol use in young adulthood. 0 2008 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

A small hive beetle (SHB) attractant using pollen substitute inoculated with the yeast Kodamaea ohmeri (NRRL Y-30722) was tested in newly established honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies for its effectiveness over a six month period from May to November 2006. Thirty two test colonies were established with 0.9 kg packages of bees with queens. Eight colonies were placed in each apiary, and colonies received one of three treatments: 1) yeast based attractant 2) apple cider vinegar, a known SHB attractant, and 3) control, consisting of an empty trap. The delivery system for the test was the "Hood small hive beetle trap." Both the yeast-based (56.2%), and the cider vinegar attractants (43.4%), increased SHB trapping compared to control traps (0.3%). The yeast based attractant showed an increase in SHB trapping efficiency during the warmer months, July and August. There were more capped brood and fewer beetles in colonies with attractant loaded traps as compared to control traps having no attractant or mineral oil. There was no significant difference in the effect of the two attractants on capped brood and colony beetle numbers.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0021-8839			WOS:000258938700012

One of the key issues is the interaction between cells and the microtopography of the implant surface. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of D1 cells, multipotent mouse bone marrow stromal precursors, in differentiating to fat and to characterize their metabolic activity (lactic acid released and glucose consumed) and lipid production when cultured on patterned poly-L-lactide (PLLA) films. It was determined that, with appropriate stimulation, the D1 cells displayed morphological characteristics of adipocytes and produced lipid. The results show that the patterned surfaces did affect the rate of lipid production. Polynomial models were proposed to predict the metabolic activity of the cells over a period of time.

The overall cost to repair or replace the bridges damaged during the hurricane is estimated at over $1 billion. This paper describes the observed damage patterns to bridges, including damage attributed to storm surge, wind, impact from debris, scour; and water inundation, as well as examples of repair measures used to quickly restore functionality to the bridges and transportation system. Using the data from the 44 bridges that were damaged, relationships between storm surge elevation, damage level, and repair costs are developed. The analysis reveals that, in general, regions with higher storm surge had more damage, although there were several instances where this was not the case, primarily due to damage resulting from debris impact. It is also shown that a highly nonlinear relationship exists between the normalized repair cost and the damage state. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on the efficacy of using typical seismic design details for mitigating the effects of hurricane loads, and potential design considerations for bridge structures in vulnerable coastal regions.									32	0	0	1	0	32			1084-0702			WOS:000253126300003		
J	Parente, Diane H.; Lee, Peggy D.; Ishman, Michael D.; Roth, Aleda V.								Marketing and supply chain management: a collaborative research agenda								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING				23	7-8			520	527		10.1108/08858620810913335			2008	2008	Purpose - This paper aims to establish a two-part research agenda for marketing in supply chain management (SCM) through the application of an interdisciplinary model, using marketing, operations, logistics/purchasing, and information technology as the nodes for a model.Design/methodology/approach - After generating a list of the highly ranked and relevant journals in each of the four disciplines, an exhaustive search was conducted of the literature published from January 1999 through December 2002, using the keywords supply chain and supply chain management. The keywords were searched for in any field (i.e. title or abstract). The authors also conducted a Delphi study of experts to identify relevant journals in each field. The resulting articles were sorted by topic and mapped to one of the other remaining three functional disciplines. This yielded six intersections between functions, three of which are examined in this manuscript as dyads with marketing. Thus, it was possible to identify current overlap in topics researched and potential areas of overlap, representing opportunities for collaboration between the disciplines.Findings - For simplicity and focus, this paper presents only marketing SCM research. The mapping process yielded: topics that are being researched from the marketing perspective but not in the IT, logistics, or operations perspectives; topics that are being researched from the IT, logistics, or operations perspectives but not from the marketing perspective; and similar (or identical) topics that are being researched from both the marketing and the IT perspective, the marketing and logistics perspective, and the marketing and operations perspective. Based on these mappings, an interdisciplinary research agenda for marketing SCM researchers was derived.Research limitations/implications - Using an automated extraction of articles from published databases by using keywords may present inconsistencies. The authors have attempted to minimize the inconsistencies by documenting the process and cross-validating the work in each function with at least two of the research team independently extracting, categorizing, and mapping the articles. Another limitation that arose was in terms of language. Since the research team consisted of researchers from different functional areas, it had to address semantics issues as the study was conducted. The authors also limited the initial endeavor to mapping only as a dyad and only using dichotomous variables. Future work on this model may include an ordinal ranking system or multi-function mapping.Practical implications - This work presents a useful model for determining an interdisciplinary research agenda in marketing. Since business and supply chain integration are increasingly important, concepts in business, academic research should take an interdisciplinary approach, providing the prospects for richer and more applicable results. Interdisciplinary research can also help to combat the silos that people tend to work in, creating new knowledge.Originality/value - This paper provides the example of a model for determining an interdisciplinary research agenda. Supply chain management has been co-opted by almost every business discipline. There is much to be learned by working together to bring new ideas and knowledge to bear on the issues related to managing the supply chain.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0885-8624			WOS:000261421800008

J	Klein, Richard; Wareham, Jonathan								HEALTHCARE INTERMEDIARIES IN ELECTRONIC MARKETS: PERFORMANCE AND CHOICE OF MARKET ENTRY MODE								JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH				9	4			243	259					2008	2008	Operational inefficiencies as well as disparate standards and administrative processes plague the U.S. healthcare industry despite its size and significance. In response, a novel breed of electronic healthcare intermediaries has evolved aiding providers, patients, and other market participants in negotiating more consistent and efficient operations. Intermediation theory posits that intermediaries engage in four distinct functional roles, specifically: (1) information management, (2) logistics management, (3) transaction securitization, and (4) insurance/market making and liquidity management. Employing data from 58 U.S. electronic healthcare intermediaries this research examines how the provision of these functions relates to firm performance and choice of electronic market entry mode. We find the provision of logistics management and, to a greater extent, insurance/market making and liquidity management to be associated with greater firm performance. In addition, we see firms engaged in insurance/market making and liquidity management activities demonstrate a propensity for direct entry and acquisitions in the pursuit of electronic market initiatives. By contrast, healthcare intermediaries offering transaction securitization services employ direct entry and joint ventures. We conclude by reflecting on the significance of these findings for the management of intermediaries within and outside of the healthcare industry.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1526-6133			WOS:000207921800001		
J	Ramaratnam, Karthik; Iyer, Swaminatha K.; Kinnan, Mark K.; Chumanov, George; Brown, Phillip J.; Luzinov, Igor								Ultrahydrophobic Textiles Using Nanoparticles: Lotus Approach								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS				3	4			1	14					2008	2008	It is well established that the water wettability of materials is governed by both the chemical composition and the geometrical microstructure of the surface.(1) Traditional textile wet processing treatments do indeed rely fundamentally upon complete wetting out of a textile structure to achieve satisfactory performance.(2) However, the complexities introduced through the heterogeneous nature of the fiber surfaces, the nature of the fiber composition and the actual construction of the textile material create difficulties in attempting to predict the exact wettability of a particular textile material. For many applications the ability of a finished fabric to exhibit water repellency (in other words low wettability) is essential(2) and potential applications of highly water repellent textile materials include rainwear, upholstery, protective clothing, sportswear, and automobile interior fabrics. Recent research indicates that such applications may benefit from a new generation of water repellent materials that make use of the "lotus effect" to provide ultrahydrophobic textile materials.(3,4) Ultrahydrophobic surfaces are typically termed as the surfaces that show a water contact angle greater than 150 degrees C with very low contact angle hysteresis.(4) In the case of textile materials, the level of hydrophobicity is often determined by measuring the static water contact angle only, since it is difficult to measure the contact angle hysteresis on a textile fabric because of the high levels of roughness inherent in textile structures.									24	2	0	7	0	25			1558-9250			WOS:000264531700001

In the case of fibers from semi-crystalline polymers this consists of the degree of crystallinity, the spacing and alignment of the crystalline regions, and molecular orientation of the polymer chains in the amorphous regions. Information on crystallinity and orientation can be obtained from X-ray analysis. In-situ X-ray characterization of a polymer during the melt spinning process is a major source of information about the effects of material characteristics and processing conditions upon structure evolution along the spinline, and the final structure and properties of the end product.We have recently designed and installed an X-ray system capable of in-situ analysis during polymer melt spinning. To the best of our knowledge this system is unique in its capabilities for the simultaneous detection of wide angle and small angle X-ray scattering (WAXS and SAXS, respectively), its use of a conventional laboratory radiation source, its vertical mobility along the spinline, and its ability to simulate a semi-industrial environment.Setup, operation and demonstration of the capabilities of this system is presented herein as applied to the characterization of the melt spinning of isotactic poly( propylene). Crystallinity and crystalline orientation calculated from WAXS patterns, and lamellar long period calculated from SAXS patterns, were obtained during melt spinning of the polymer along the spinline.									7	1	0	0	0	7			1558-9250			WOS:000266198200002		
J	Tascan, Mevlut; Vaughn, Edward A.								Effects of Fiber Denier, Fiber Cross-Sectional Shape and Fabric Density on Acoustical Behavior of Vertically Lapped Nonwoven Fabrics								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS				3	2									2008	2008	Acoustical insulation and absorption properties of nonwoven fabrics depend on fiber geometry and fiber arrangement within the fabric structure. The different structures of the fibers result in different total surface areas of nonwoven fabrics. Nonwoven fabrics such as vertically lapped fabrics are ideal materials for use as acoustical insulation products, because they have high total surface. Vertically lapped nonwoven technology consists of carding, perpendicular layering of the carded webs, and through-air bonding using synthetic binder fibers. The surface area of the fabric is directly related to the denier and cross-sectional shape of the fibers in the fabric. Smaller deniers yield more fibers per unit weight of the material, higher total fiber surface area, and greater possibilities for a sound wave to interact with the fibers in the fabric structure.The research in the literature uses two methods for measuring acoustical properties of fabric materials: the impedance tube and reverberation room method. Small test samples are in the impedance tube method and sound absorption coefficient is determined at each frequency. Large reverberation rooms and large test samples are used for the reverberation room method. A direct comparative acoustical properties measurement device that was designed and fabricated at Clemson University School of Materials Science & Engineering was used to measure acoustical insulation in this research. This paper provides a description of the measurement devices and acoustical measurement data for vertically lapped nonwoven fabrics made from three different polyester fiber shape and two denier levels.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1558-9250			WOS:000264531600004		
J	Cox, Christopher L.; Brown, Philip J.; Larzelere, John C.								Simulation of C-CP Fiber-Based Air Filtration								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS				3	2									2008	2008	The overall goal of this project is to develop High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter media, using conventional fiber spinning techniques, with lower pressure drop than current media through the use of shaped fibers. Capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are gaining interest for use in a range of separations applications. This paper focuses on modeling air filtration where the filter consists of C-CP fibers. A variety of numerical tools are being used in this effort, including a finite element flow solver and Brownian dynamics simulation. Aspects of these techniques in relation to the problem at hand will be described, and simulation results including comparisons to round-fiber filters will be presented. The primary result presented here is the significant difference in predicted pressure drop between a prototype C-CP filter and a round-fiber filter with equal total cross-sectional area.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1558-9250			WOS:000264531600006		
J	Smith, John F.; Luttrell, Randall G.; Greene, Jeremy K.								Seasonal abundance of stink bugs (Heteroptera : Pentatomidae) and other polyphagous species in a multi-crop environment in south Arkansas								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				43	1			1	12					JAN 2008	2008	A 3-yr study was conducted to determine seasonal abundance of major pentatomid, noctuid, and mirid pests in a multicrop environment in south Arkansas. Replicated field plots (similar to 0.1 ha) containing cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.), genetically engineered to express the Cry 1Ac toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), nonBt cotton, Bt corn, Zea mays (L.), genetically engineered to express the Cry 1Ab toxin of B. thuringiensis, nonBt corn, maturity group (MG) III, IV, V, and VI soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, and grain sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, were planted each year. Crop preferences of 3 stink bug species [southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.), green stink bug, Acrosternum hilare (Say), and brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say)] were recorded and observations also were made on the relative abundance of corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F), and tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beavois). Significantly higher densities of stink bugs were present in MG IV soybean than in all other crops in July and August during all 3 yrs of study. Densities of heliothines were significantly greater in grain sorghum and corn than in other crops during July. Tarnished plant bugs were most commonly observed in cotton. Preferences of these polyphagous pests for different crops at specific stages of phenological development appear to be predictable aspects of insect behavior that may be exploited in trap crops or other landscape management systems.									10	1	0	10	0	10			0749-8004			WOS:000253647100001		
J	Campbell, Joshua W.; Hanula, James L.; Waldrop, Thomas A.								Effects of prescribed fire and fire surrogates on saproxylic Coleoptera in the Southern Appalachians of North Carolina								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				43	1			57	75					JAN 2008	2008	We examined the effects of forest management practices (prescribed burning, mechanical, and prescribed burn plus mechanical) on saproxylic forest Coleoptera in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. During the 2-yr study, we captured 37,191 Coleoptera with baited multiple-funnel traps and pipe traps, comprising 20 families and 122 species that were used for our analysis. Saproxylic beetle numbers increased greatly from the first year to the second year on all treatments. Species richness and total abundance of Coleoptera were not significantly affected by the treatments, but several families (e.g., Elateridae, Cleridae, Trogositidae, Scolytidae) were significantly more abundant on treated plots. Abundances of many species, including various species of Scolytidae were significantly affected by the treatments. However, these scolytids (Hylastes salebrosus Eichoff, Ips grandicollis Eichoff, Xyloborinus saxeseni Ratzburg, Xyleborus sp., Xyleborus atratus Eichoff) did not respond in the same way to the treatments. Likewise, other Coleoptera such as Pityophagus sp. (Nitidulidae), Hylobius pales Herbst (Curculionidae), and Xylotrechus sagittatus Germar (Cerambycidae) also varied in their responses to the treatments. Species richness was not significantly different for the spring 2003 trapping seasons, but the fall 2003 sample had a higher number of species on mechanical shrub removal only and mechanical shrub removal plus prescribed burning plots compared with controls. Linear regression analysis suggests that increased dead wood caused by hot fires on mechanical plus burn and burn only treatments resulted in increases among various Coleoptera families and species. We saw no evidence that the treatments negatively impacted saproylic species and in most cases they benefited from the disturbances.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0749-8004			WOS:000253647100006

Assessing Outcomes From Participation in a Residential Environmental Education Program								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION				39	4			31	43		10.3200/JOEE.39.4.31-43			2008	2008	The authors explored the influences of 3- and 5-day residential environmental education programs at the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont (TN) on participants' connections with nature, environmental stewardship, interest in learning and discovery, and awareness of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and biodiversity. The authors found significant positive, short-term effects on all outcomes of interest. Also, 3-month delayed posttests indicated retention of significant gains in environmental stewardship and awareness, whereas other gains faded. Longer stays and active engagement of visiting teachers in on-site instruction enhanced most outcomes.

Children's Role in Meaning Making Through Their Participation in an Environmental Education Program								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION				39	4			44	59		10.3200/JOEE.39.4.44-59			2008	2008	The authors conducted an ethnography investigating children's lived experiences in a 3-day residential environmental education (EE) program with 20 gifted 4th- and 5th-grade students. The authors also conducted participant observation and a series of interviews before, during, and after the trip. After the authors conducted the interviews and collected other data, they conducted analyses that identified domains describing the children's lived experience with a residential EE program (J. P. Spradley, 1979). Through domain analysis, a theme emerged: Children's nonformal environmental-learning experience is negotiated through the feeling of having choices and enhanced through sensory perception and personal relationships. Explicit recognition of the importance of informal social interactions, unstructured time and play, and perception of choice has potential to enhance the meaningfulness of residential EE programs.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0095-8964			WOS:000207742100004

The relationships were originally developed by separating resonant column and torsional shear test results of 122 specimens into three general geologic groups (Quaternary-age soils, Tertiary-age and older soils, and residual/saprolite soils) and determining mean regressional model parameters (i.e., alpha, k, gamma(r1), and D-min1) for each group. Statistical variability of the regressional parameters is quantified and expressed by standard errors of prediction. The determined uncertainty of the regressional parameters is then propagated through the recommended relationships using the point-estimate method to estimate the model uncertainty of the relationships. The point-estimate method is a simple and effective method of uncertainty propagation. For uncertainty estimation, the regressional parameters are assumed to be uncorrelated for the sake of simplicity. The influence of this assumption on the model uncertainty of normalized shear modulus and material damping ratio values, as well as the sensitivity of the model uncertainty to the uncertainty of various regressional parameters, are also discussed.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1090-0241			WOS:000253127000003

Planning for pandemic influenza: Lessons from the experiences of thirteen Indiana counties								JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT				5	1					29				2008	2008	Significant concerns exist over the ability of the healthcare and public health systems to meet the surge demands that would result from an event such as an influenza pandemic. Current guidance for public health planners is largely based on expert opinion and may lack connection to the problems of street-level public health practice. To identify the problems of local planners and prepare a state-level planning template for increasing health care surge capacity that accounted for these issues, a study was conducted of local pandemic planning efforts in thirteen counties, finding that cognitive biases, coordination problems, institutional structures in the healthcare system, and resource shortfalls are significant barriers to preparing and implementing a surge capacity plan. In addition, local planners identify patient demand management through triage and education efforts as a viable means of ensuring adequate capacity, in contrast to guidance proposing an increased supply of care as a primary tool.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2194-6361	1547-7355		WOS:000258443700006

In particular, new experimental data for the upstream flow pattern resulting from multiple orifices, an orifice near a free surface, and a large orifice (where the pressure gradient across the orifice cannot be ignored) are collected and presented. A new potential flow solution for flow behind orifices is developed to include pressure gradient effects as well as to accurately superpose the solution due to multiple orifices and determine a solution close to orifices. The proposed solution compares well with the measured data for multiple orifices and for an orifice near a free surface. For a large orifice, the skew in the velocity profile in the vertical direction due to the pressure gradient is accurately predicted.									17	1	0	1	0	17			0733-9429			WOS:000252435500010

When the protein was treated only with the latter, a strong bitterness formed; but it decreased if the protein was treated with both the enzymes. The more the enzymes were used, weaker was the bitterness tasted. SDS-PAGE profile and ESI-MS spectrum of the hydrolysates evidenced that the Alcalase could convert the protein into peptides rapidly, while the enzymes in the A. elegans extract were able to further degrade some peptides which were difficult or unable to be hydrolyzed by the Alcalase. Further systematic analysis of the peptidases showed that the Alcalase exhibited a significant endopeptidase activity towards NBZ-Phe-pNA substrate (p < 0.01), whereas many exopeptidases in the A. elegans extract had the carboxypeptidase activity towards N-CBZ-Ile-Leu (p < 0.01). It is concluded that those exopeptidases presented in the A. elegans extract can benefit by decreasing the bitterness of the soybean protein hydroysate. They are also capable of being used with the Alcalase in a single-step enzymatic reaction to prepare the bitterless protein hydrolysate, which may be an efficient application for food industry.									13	7	0	9	1	20			1367-5435	1476-5535		WOS:000251487300006	17943333

The multidimensional framework of serious leisure contains six qualities from which 18 operations were employed. With the use of a q-sort, an expert panel, and confirmatory factor analysis, the 72 item SLIM demonstrated acceptable fit, reliability and equivalence across samples. Mean differences and correlation patterns found between samples demonstrated preliminary evidence for the predictive ability of the new measure. The SLIM short form (54 items) demonstrated good model fit and construct validity. Future replications are needed to adequately address the psychometric complexities of the SLIM within the network of interrelated leisure constructs.									29	0	0	2	0	29			0022-2216			WOS:000253827000003

Adolescent girls' involvement in disability sport: A comparison of social support mechanisms								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				40	2			183	207					2008	2008	Women and girls with disabilities are historically disenfranchised from physical recreation due to the "double whammy" of being female and having a disability. The literature suggests that challenges to participation likely include lack of social support for girls with disabilities to participate in sport. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine differences in social support received by girls with disabilities who did and did not participate in organized wheelchair sport programs. In addition, the relationship between social support and outcomes tied to wheelchair sport participation were investigated. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed using constant comparison techniques. Utilizing a model of social support as a framework, the findings illustrate multiple differences in social support mechanisms for girls who are and who are not involved in wheelchair sport programs.									9	0	0	1	0	9			0022-2216			WOS:000256203500001		
J	Kleiber, Douglas; McGuire, Francis A.; Aybar-Damali, Begum; Norman, William								Having more by doing less: The paradox of leisure constraints in later life								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				40	3			343	359					2008	2008	A considerable literature now documents the vast array of constraints that keep people from participating in or enjoying recreation and leisure activities. Consistently these factors have been regarded as negative and deserving of elimination, negotiation, or navigation. Recently, however, researchers have argued (in separate chapters in Jackson, 2005a) that constraints often exist in a beneficial relationship with leisure activity patterns and should, as a result, be studied for potential positive effects and managed accordingly. The case for the beneficial aspects of constraints to leisure has been made mostly with respect to aging, though arguably it applies to all ages. The model of successful aging that has received the most theoretical and empirical support in recent years is that of selective optimization with compensation (Baltes & Carstensen, 1996). We argue here for a proposition derived from this model that encountering and accepting constraint, while initially painful in many cases, is often life-enhancing. This paper explores this proposition and six implications for managing leisure experience in the course of adjusting to change and limitations throughout life.									17	1	0	0	0	18			0022-2216			WOS:000257720100001

Using Recreation Specialization to Understand Conservation Support								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				40	4			556	573					2008	2008	Previous empirical research has not provided definitive support for an association between participation in outdoor recreation activities and conservation attitudes and behaviors. This paper explored the relationships that construct recreationists' conservation behaviors in the context of recreational fishing. Study objectives were to investigate relationships of recreation specialization and personal motivations and attitudes that mediate conservation attitudes and behaviors; and explore causal connections between conservation attitudes and behaviors. Analyses generally supported the theoretical propositions in the model. Recreation specialization and the other concepts taken together appeared to provide insights to understanding patterns of conservation attitudes and behaviors. By knowing the causal relationships explaining conservation attitudes and behaviors, managers can better understand the extent of anglers' support for various conservation measures.									20	0	0	6	0	20			0022-2216			WOS:000261521200004		
J	Taylor, Mary Anne; Goldberg, Caren; Shore, Lynn M.; Lipka, Phillip								The effects of retirement expectations and social support on post-retirement adjustment - A longitudinal analysis								JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL PSYCHOLOGY				23	4			458	470		10.1108/02683940810869051			2008	2008	Purpose - The aim is to examine the shifting effects of retirement expectations and social support on adjustment three and half and ten months post-retirement.Design/methodology/approach - For the purpose of this study, the authors used a survey methodology. Expectations regarding retirement and social support were used to predict three facets of satisfaction post-retirement; life satisfaction, retirement satisfaction, and social satisfaction.Findings - Results suggested that expectations consistently and significantly predicted satisfaction early and later in retirement. Social support was only a significant antecedent of retirement satisfaction at time 2, and had a non-significant relationship to social and life satisfaction in retirement.Practical implications - Results support the view that retirement expectations have a strong influence on retirement, life, and social satisfaction in the first year of an individual's retirement.Originality/value - The paper's findings imply that interventions designed to create realistic expectations of the retirement experience may have a positive impact on adjustment.									10	0	0	0	1	11			0268-3946			WOS:000256277500006

These inks could be inkjet-printed on indium tin oxide-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) films (ITO-PET film) using a commercial desktop inkjet printer. These PANI-silica or PEDOT-silica/ITO-PET assemblies were utilized as the active layer in electrochromic devices (ECDs). A number of devices were fabricated that exhibited 500 mm size patterning and utilized spatially controlled printing of the particles to allow for a dual image display. In addition, the PANI and PEDOT-based particles were blended into a single ICP ink that allowed for a wider absorption tuning range of the final ECD.									50	0	0	0	0	50			0959-9428			WOS:000252564700012

Photoluminescence and ion sensing properties of a bipyridyl chromophore-modified semifluorinated polymer and its metallopolymer derivatives								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY				18	17			1970	1976		10.1039/b713458d			2008	2008	A difluorovinylene aromatic ether polymer (P1) incorporating periodic 5,5'-distyryl-2,2'-bipyridyl units as metal chelating chromophores was prepared by a transition metal-free step-growth polymerization. P1 displays strong ionochromic and ionoluminescent effects in response to transition metals. Although significant emission quenching is observed upon exposure to most transition metal ions, bathochromically shifted emission is observed upon addition of divalent d(10) ions (Zn2+, Cd2+ and Hg2+). A selective 10-fold increase in integrated emission intensity is observed upon addition of Zn2+ to P1. The Zn2+-P1 metallopolymer acts as a ratiometric fluorescent indicator selective for fluoride anions, and the Cu2+-P1 metallopolymer exhibits a striking turn-on fluorescence response (> 100-fold increase in integrated intensity) selective for cyanide and fluoride anions.									37	0	0	7	1	37			0959-9428			WOS:000255013200003

The resulting robust and homogeneous film exhibits a continuous smooth absorption with no shoulder, which agrees well with that of a chloroform solution containing BODA-co-C(60), suggesting that no aggregation occurs during the solvent evaporation process. White light was irradiated to a BODA-co-C(60) thin film employed as the working electrode to generate a relatively high anodic photocurrent in the presence of the I(-)/I(3)(-) redox couple. This is characteristic for the photogalvanic type of photocurrent generation and indicates the successful electron injection from the C(60) anions to the SnO(2) nanocrystallites, following the photoinduced charge separation. The result with regard to a photocurrent action spectrum allows us to conclude that polyarylene networks covering a C(60) core act as solubilizer and are not responsible for the photocurrent generation under white light illumination. Thus, this strategy for fullerene solubilization using polyarylene units is critical to a uniform organizing of C(60) onto nanocrystalline SnO(2) as a building block, leading to the construction of an efficient light-to-energy conversion system in combination with the light harvester.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0959-9428			WOS:000257426000009

Electroluminescent colloidal inks for flexographic roll-to-roll printing								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY				18	41			4942	4948		10.1039/b809450k			2008	2008	The academic and commercial interest in organic light-emitting devices is motivated in part by the potential of building devices utilizing simple and inexpensive fabrication routes, for example, commercial printing techniques. The focus on synthetically challenging small molecules and pi-conjugated polymers for these devices is countered by the alternative of developing emissive materials that utilize an electroluminescent dye embedded in a hole and electron transporting host. In this effort, we exploit readily obtainable materials and simple fabrication routes to produce lightemitting colloidal particles, which in turn allows us to invoke the concept of a "particle device". Specifically, we present colloidally based organic light emitting devices that can be designed to produce a range of colors by mixing together various ratios of red-, green-, and blue-emitting particles. These aqueous-based colloids are adaptable to form printing inks and may be utilized in fabricating devices through high-throughput commercial printing technologies.									19	0	0	1	0	19			0959-9428			WOS:000260024100006

Multi-disciplinary computations are carried out ranging from computational fluid mechanics of injection-mold filling and packing processes, flow-induced fiber orientation analysis, visco-elastic analysis of in-cavity residual stress developments and structural-mechanics computation of injection-molded part warping (under the effect of residual stresses) and deflection under simulated thermal loading encountered in the paint shop and under mechanical in-service loading. The results obtained helped identify the minimum level of polymer-to-metal adhesive strength and an optimal PMH-component architecture which are required in order for the direct-adhesion PMH technology to be considered a viable (weight-saving, parts-consolidation, manufacturing process-chain compatible) alternative to the currently used PMH technologies.

A novel solution-based layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition technique was developed to prepare multilayers of hydrated Zr cations and nanoclays. This LBL deposition technique is devised by integrating an electrostatic-mediated dip coating method for making nanoclay-polymer multilayers with a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method for making ultrathin oxide films. Nanostructured clay-zirconia multilayer composites formed through subsequent annealing. Characterization by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction confirmed that these films are uniform and crack-free, consist of no detectable impurities, and possess nanoscale-layered structure. The incorporation of nanoclays facilitates the electrostatic-mediated assembling of multilayers, enhances the structural integrity, and provides a generic framework to construct functionally graded materials. Potential applications are envisaged. Copyright (c) 2008 Hao Chen et al.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1687-4110			WOS:000255781500001

Advanced GIS Exercise: Estimating Beach and Dune Erosion in Coastal South Carolina								Journal of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Education				37				49	52					2008	2008	Many natural resources graduate students across the nation are being required to learn proper use of geographic information system, (GIS) to include not only in their graduate research, but to also prepare for a career as a professional in natural resources. This demand creates a need for graduate students to be properly instructed in GIS. Advanced GIS exercises can be useful in teaching common techniques and methodologies in GIS. We have developed an advanced GIS exercise that uses the spatial analyst extension in GIS and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data. The goal of this laboratory exercise was to determine the amount of erosion that has occurred over a 4-year period on the coast of South Carolina. All students, individually, had the opportunity to use the Cut/Fill tool and create their own digital elevation model (DEM). Students stated that this exercise helped them to understand how to work with LIDAR data and also how to estimate erosion. Independently, students estimated that there has been a loss of more than 50,000 m(3) of material from Folly Beach during the 4-year period included in this study.									0	0	0	1	0	1			1059-9053			BCI:BCI200900043154

We integrate some of those knowledge-based approaches seeking to understand how aspects related to cross-functional orientation, new technologies, and increasing access to information affect manufacturing strategy. In this paper, "know-what" (where to find the needed information) and "know-how" (how to run operations smoothly) are considered key components of organizational knowledge in the process of manufacturing strategy formulation. Assuming that knowledge accumulation may lead to competitive advantage, we propose a model of manufacturing strategy process from a resource-based view perspective. We used a survey to collect field data from 104 companies. The results indicate that cross-functional activities integrate manufacturing knowledge and contribute to the creation of valuable and rare product characteristics. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

L1 supports a bite angle (P-M-P angle, beta) of 171.4 degrees in the trans-square planar complex. L1 was tested in Rh-catalyzed 1,4-addition reactions of arylboronic acids (six examples) to alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones (five examples). In mixed aqueous/cyclohexane solution at 60 degrees C, addition reactions proceed in up to quantitative yield with a 1: 1 arylboronic acid/enone ratio. Yields as high as 77% can be acquired even when one of the coupling partners is sterically encumbered 2,4,6-trimethylphenylboronic acid. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The main production of (44)Ti takes place in the alpha-rich freeze-out phase deep inside the supernova. The key reactions governing the (44)Ti abundance have been identified in an earlier sensitivity study. Using the recoil mass spectrometer DRAGON at the TRIUMF-ISAC facility in Vancouver, Canada, we measured the main production reaction (40)Ca(alpha,gamma)(44)Ti, resulting in an increased reaction rate compared to the rate derived from previous prompt gamma-ray studies, which is commonly used in supernova models. The uncertainty of the (44)Ti production is now dominated by the rate of reactions with short-lived nuclides around (44)Ti, namely (45)V(p,gamma)(46)Cr, (44)Ti(alpha, p)(47)V and (44)Ti(alpha,gamma)(48)Cr. The sensitivity of these reactions on the (44)Ti production has been revisited.					3rd Europhysics Conference on Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics (NPA3)3rd Europhysics Conference on Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics (NPA3)	MAR 26-31, 2007MAR 26-31, 2007	European Phys Soc, Nucl Phys BoardEuropean Phys Soc, Nucl Phys Board	Dresden, GERMANYDresden, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-3899			WOS:000252019800035

The objective of this research was to evaluate liquid and/or granular N fertilization on turfgrass quality, clipping yield, and root biomass of 'L-93' creeping bentgrass. Treatments consisted of two annual nitrogen (N) inputs, 127 and 190 kg ha(-1), using 100% granular urea fertilizer, 50% granular urea + 50% liquid urea fertilizer, or 100% liquid urea fertilizer. These results suggest a rate of at least 190 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) is needed to maintain acceptable bentgrass quality in the transition zone of the U.S. Combining both liquid and granular methods appear superior compared to relying on one method exclusively.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0190-4167			WOS:000255687800012

By its nature, such a comparative inquiry pulls for relativist reasoning, but such an approach undermines the universalism that is at the root of the concept of human rights. Like the international human rights instruments that preceded it, the Convention on the Rights of the Child is based on "recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family." Whether grounded in religious or secular ethical reasoning, human rights are directed toward a world in which the Golden Rule-a regime of mutual respect-serves as the guidepost for the social order. Building from that premise, recommendations are offered for social scientists' contributions to creation and preservation of such societies.									7	0	0	1	0	7			0022-4537			WOS:000261222200011

An equivalent sample size method is proposed that retains the simple interval structure inherent with white noise model errors, but modifies the sample size to account for the serial autocorrelations present in the errors. This makes the interval perform akin to weighted least squares intervals. The accuracy of the approach is demonstrated in three common regression problems. A noteworthy by-product of the work identifies explicit variances of several classical regression statistics in time series settings.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0094-9655			WOS:000254508200001

When organizations source via multilayered supply chains with poor visibility they are particularly vulnerable. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework called the "Six Ts" of supply chain quality management - traceability, transparency, testability, time, trust and training - which are relevant for any product but are especially critical to the preservation of public welfare through a safe food supply. We describe the globalization of food supply chains and present data on the trends of U. S. food import volumes, both in aggregate and specifically from China. We also highlight the inherent difficulties and risks posed by global food supply chains, using those originating in China as an example. Finally, we provide a research agenda and questions to be addressed regarding the application of the six Ts in global food supply chain management.									125	1	0	12	0	125			1523-2409			WOS:000207979800003

Evidence from the Galapagos islands								JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM				16	4			467	489		10.2167/jost797.0			2008	2008	Proponents of ecotourism within protected areas believe that tour design and interpretation can help mitigate the negative impacts of tourism, human and environmental, and build an educated and motivated constituency that supports environmental conservation and social improvements. However, ecotourism's claims to achieve those objectives are largely untested, and linkages between tourism's operational characteristics and positive changes in tourists' environmental knowledge, attitudes and behaviours are largely unexplored. This exploratory research investigated the efforts of one Galapagos National Park tour operator to explore whether a well-conceived interpretation/ecotourism product could influence tourists' educational outcomes and support of environmental conservation. Results suggest that well-designed and delivered interpretation during the ecotourism, experience can increase knowledge of the host-protected area, supportive attitudes towards resource management issues facing the host-protected area, general environmental behavioural intentions and philanthropic support of conservation.									83	0	0	17	0	84			0966-9582			WOS:000258352300006

Yet, business executives and researchers continue to question the value of IT investments. We argue that while the current trajectory of research in this important area is useful, it is limited. In order to address the evolving nature of IT and the novel contexts in which it is being exploited, we must create a discontinuity in our thinking of how IT value should be studied. After summarizing what we have learned thus far, we discuss key new research themes that must be addressed if IT is to be demonstrably relevant. Further, we identify specific research thrusts, areas for theoretical development, and research questions on IT-based value that must be included in our research agenda for the future. We conclude by challenging IT researchers to consider the consequences of status quo research themes versus an expanded set of research questions.									209	3	0	1	1	213			1536-9323			WOS:000255118300002

The composite particles were achieved by either creating chemical bonds by silane coupling agents (composite A) or tuning the pH in order to form electrostatic attractive interactions between the core and shell composite (composite B). Based on the average values of the pull-off force vs pH, a qualitative agreement between the measured adhesion forces and the material removal rate (MRR) was found. For pH 3, both the MRR and adhesion forces are larger for composite B with respect to composite A. Interestingly, for pH 10, composite B and ceria give almost the same MRR and similar adhesion force values. Nevertheless, in general, the adhesion forces measured at pH 10 are significantly smaller than those monitored at pH 3, whereas the MRR is significantly larger for pH 10. This suggests that factors other than adhesion, such as an enhanced silica dissolution rate, dominate and define the MRR at pH 10. The increase in repulsive force with increasing pH corresponds to a decrease in composite-glass adhesion. For pH between 2 and 7, the electrostatic attractive forces between polymer particles and the silica surface are responsible for high particle counts. To improve the particle removal efficiency after CMP with the ceria-based slurry, pH values higher than 7 are recommended.

J	Ibrahim, Samir; Ramamurthi, Anand								Hyaluronic acid cues for functional endothelialization of vascular constructs								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				2	1			22	32		10.1002/term.61			JAN 2008	2008	Current vascular implant materials insufficiently recruit endothelial cells (ECs) to form a normally functional and confluent endothelium, a key challenge to reinstating vascular homeostasis at the surgical site. Recent studies indicate that hyaluronan (HA), a connective tissue GAG whose biological effects are often dictated by its fragment size, may inherently stimulate endothelialization. We previously showed that ECs respond poorly to large HA fragments (10 kDa < MW < 1 MDa), therefore, we currently sought to comprehensively study the effects of exogenous high molecular weight (> 1000 kDa) and oligomeric (0.75-10 kDa) ranges on various phenotypic and functional aspects of cultured ECs. HA-1500 (1500 kDa) was enzymatically digested into oligomers under iteratively defined conditions, until a mixture (HA-o) containing a maximal yield of HA-6-mer and 12-mers (33.3 +/- 2.44% and 39.2 +/- 2.68% w/w, respectively) was obtained. The effects of HA-1500, HA-o and pure HA-6-mers on rat aortic ECs were compared. DNA and tube formation assays revealed HA-o and HA-6-mers to stimulate EC proliferation and EC tube formation (angiogenesis) much more than non-HA controls, while HA-1500 had a significant but more modest effect. Both HA-o and HA-6-mers attenuated platelet adhesion and activation on EC layers, while HA-1500 drastically inhibited the same relative to controls. However, flow cytometry and cytokine array studies found that HA-o incited increased expression levels of EC activation markers (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and promoted the release of select inflammatory cytokines to a greater degree than HA-1500. These results suggest that HA-o and HA-1500 both provide benefits, although frequently of different kinds, to endothelial cell sustenance, proliferation and normal functionality. Thus, tissue engineering scaffolds containing both these cues in optimized ratios could potentially serve as excellent materials for vascular EC regeneration. This forms the basis of our ongoing studies. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.									31	2	0	22	0	33			1932-6254			WOS:000256520400003	18265428

J	Denham, Bryan E.								FOLK DEVILS, NEWS ICONS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF MORAL PANICS Heroin chic and the amplification of drug threats in contemporary society								JOURNALISM STUDIES				9	6			945	961		10.1080/14616700802227811			2008	2008	In studying media content and effects, scholars sometimes refer to amplifications of deviance and constructions of moral panics. The present article examines how "heroin chic,'' a 1990s trend characterized by emaciated, disheveled fashion models and film actors, as well as the symbolic death of music icon Kurt Cobain, interacted with news representations of heroin-namely how the narcotic had reappeared to threaten a new generation of users-thus creating a moral panic. The article posits a role for exemplification theory and news icons in conversations of how moral panics arise and are sustained through mass media. Content analyses of heroin reports in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times and the Washington Post (N = 1770) revealed increases in references to popular culture during the middle 1990s, with officials citing dramatic exemplars as evidence of a "new scourge'' and of "an old enemy making a dangerous comeback.'' Actual heroin use did not appear to increase during 16 years of analysis.									15	0	0	0	0	15			1461-670X			WOS:000207486400007		
S	Dean, Brian C.; Griffis, Adam; Whitley, Adam						Laber, ES; Bornstein, C; Nogueira, LT; Faria, L		Approximation algorithms for k-hurdle problems								LATIN 2008: THEORETICAL INFORMATICS		LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		4957				449	460		10.1007/978-3-540-78773-0_39			2008	2008	The polynomial-time solvable k-hurdle problem is a natural generalization of the classical s-t minimum cut problem where we must select a minimum-cost subset S of the edges of a graph such that vertical bar p boolean AND s vertical bar >= k for every s-t path p. In this paper, we describe a set of approximation algorithms for "k-hurdle" variants of the NP-hard multiway cut and multicut problems. For the k-hurdle multiway cut problem with r terminals, we give two results, the first being a pseudo-approximation algorithm that outputs a (k - 1)-hurdle solution whose cost is at most that of an optimal solution for k hurdles. Secondly, we provide two different 2(1 - 1/r)-approximation algorithms. The first is based on rounding the solution of a linear program that embeds our graph into a simplex, and although this same linear program yields stronger approximation guarantees for the traditional multiway cut problem, we show that its integrality gap increases to 2(1 - 1/r) in the k-hurdle case. Our second approximation result is based on half-integrality, for which we provide a simple randomized half-integrality proof that works for both edge and vertex k-hurdle multiway cuts that generalizes the half-integrality results of Garg et al. for the vertex multiway cut problem. For the k-hurdle multicut problem in an n-vertex graph, we provide an algorithm that, for any constant epsilon > 0, outputs a [(1 - epsilon)k]-hurdle solution of cost at most O(log n) times that of an optimal k-hurdle solution, and we obtain a 2-approximation algorithm for trees.					8th Latin American Symposium on Theoretical Informatics (LATIN 2008)8th Latin American Symposium on Theoretical Informatics (LATIN 2008)	APR 07-JUL 11, 2008APR 07-JUL 11, 2008	Microsoft; UOL; IFIP; HP; Yahoo; FAPERJ; CNPq; CAPES; SpringerMicrosoft; UOL; IFIP; HP; Yahoo; FAPERJ; CNPq; CAPES; Springer	Buzios, BRAZILBuzios, BRAZIL	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-540-78772-3	WOS:000254390900039

The effects of microencapsulation on the changes in survival rate of the L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 during exposure to artificial gastrointestinal and on the change in heat susceptibility of L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 during the heat treatment were studied. In addition, cholesterol assimilation and intestinal adhesion of non-encapsulated and encapsulated L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 were also investigated to explore the effect of microencapsulation on health beneficial effect of lactic acid bacteria. Non-encapsulated cells were completely destroyed when exposed to artificial gastric juice (AGJ) of pH 1.2 and 1.5, while the treatment declined the viable count of encapsulated samples only by 3 log. Encapsulated cells exhibited a significantly higher resistance to artificial intestinal juice (AIJ) and heat treatment than non-encapsulated samples. The assimilative reductions of cholesterol by non-encapsulated and encapsulated L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 were 35.98% and 32.84%, respectively. However, encapsulation did not significantly (P > 0.05) affect the adherence of L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 onto the human intestinal epithelial cell lines HT-29. The microencapsulation effectively protected the microorganisms from heat and acid treatment in delivering the viable cells to intestine without any significant adverse effect on their functionalities.

The resins were plasticized with glycerol, sorbitol and the mixture of glycerol and sorbitol (MGS). The effect of type of plasticizer on extruded and heat-pressed (EHP) film-forming capacity was studied, and the mechanical and water barrier properties of resulting EHP gelatin films were compared with those of gelatin films prepared by solution casting method. Stretchable films were formed when glycerol or MGS were used as plasticizer, whereas resins plasticized with sorbitol were extruded in non-stretchable sheets. Glycerol plasticized gelatin film showed the highest flexibility and transparency among the EHP films tested. Tensile strength (TS), elongation (E) and water vapor permeability (WVP) of glycerol plasticized EHP gelatin films were 17.3 MPa, 215.9% and 2.46 ng m/m(2) s Pa, respectively, and EHP gelatin films had higher E values, lower TS values and higher WVP values compared to the glycerol plasticized cast gelatin films.

GROWTH OF BLACK-LEGGED KITTIWAKE RISSA TRIDACTYLA CHICKS IN RELATION TO DELIVERY RATE, SIZE, AND ENERGY DENSITY OF MEALS								Marine Ornithology				36	2			107	114					2008	2008	The growth rate of chicks is a parameter often used to examine the effects of changes in food availability on reproductive performance of seabirds. We analyzed the relationship of growth rates in Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla chicks at three colonies in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and three colonies in Lower Cook Inlet, Alaska, to two components of nestling meals that represent diet quantity (meal delivery rate and meal size) and one that represents diet quality (energy density). During this study, kittiwakes appeared to rely on an array of relatively high-lipid prey. Growth rates of alpha and singleton chicks were positively correlated with annual productivity and were best explained by meal delivery rate and meal size; growth rates of beta chicks were not correlated with productivity and were best explained by meal delivery rate alone. The lack of a positive effect of energy density on growth rates was in contrast to results from a companion study that found a moderately positive effect of energy density on kittiwake productivity. Taken together, results from these two studies demonstrate the need to measure both diet quantity and quality to reliably assess the relationships between diet composition, provisioning rates, growth rates, and productivity in seabirds.									6	0	0	6	0	7			1018-3337			BCI:BCI200900295459		
S	Sanders, John P.; Brosnan, Denis A.						Trimble, BE; Brisch, JH		The effect of void area on brick masonry performance								MASONRY		AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR TESTING AND MATERIALS SPECIAL TECHNICAL PUBLICATION		1496				84	97		10.1520/STP45708S			2008	2008	Higher void (hollow) brick offer the potential for energy savings, decreased raw material usage and reduced environmental impact. These advantages are related to the movement toward "green" building materials. The National Brick Research Center has performed an extensive study comparing the wall system performance of hollow and solid brick. Hollow masonry units are defined by ASTM C 652 while solid masonry units are specified in ASTM C 216. The key differences between these two specifications are related to the permissible void area and face shell thickness. The objective of this work was to determine what effect, if any, increasing void area might have on important aspects of the performance of brick masonry. The effect of decreasing face shell thickness was also evaluated. For this study, the performance of several sets of comparison extruded brick was measured. These sets of comparison brick represent a range of manufacturers and, thus, a range of physical properties. Water penetration, flexural bond strength, and compressive strength were measured on each type of brick and used as indicators of potential performance in a wall. Additionally, mortar usage as a function of void area was studied. Based on the results of testing from these sets of comparison brick, increasing void area or decreasing face shell thickness did not result in increased water penetration or decreased flexural bond strength.					11th Symposium on Masonry11th Symposium on Masonry	JUN   12, 2006JUN   12, 2006	Amer Soc Testing & Mat, Comm C12, C15, C7Amer Soc Testing & Mat, Comm C12, C15, C7	Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1040-1695		978-0-8031-3492-8	WOS:000256219300009

This solution was named as Tris-SBF-27 mM. Firstly, collagen sponges were soaked in Tris-SBF-27 mM solution at 37 degrees C and were found to be fully covered with nanoporous apatitic calcium phosphate (Ap-CaP). The composites of collagen-Ap-CaP biomaterials are expected to be used in orthopedic and dental surgery. Secondly, Ap-CaP short whiskers or microrods with a novel nanotexture and surface areas higher than 45 m(2)/g were synthesized in Tris-SBF-27 mM solution. Thirdly, calcium sulfate cements doped with CaHPO4 (monetite), were shown to have apatite-inducing ability upon ageing in Tris-SBF-27 mM. CaHPO4 addition in calcium sulfate was found to improve its mechanical strength, measured after cement setting reaction. Pure calcium sulfate cement pellets were not stable in Tris-SBF-27 mM solutions and crumbled into a powder. All the samples were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, surface area and mechanical strength measurements. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The adverse drug interactions are common in the field of medical oncology. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) continues to have a considerable effect on the physical and psychological well-being of patients with cancer, despite significant advances in antiemetic drugs since the 1990s. Fortunately, evidence-based interventions suggested that to a certain extent antiemetic effects can be achieved by use of placebo appropriately. Placebo effect can be reinforced by conferring much meaning. Thus physician can replace antiemetic drugs with reinforced meaningful antiemetic placebo to get better prevention and treatment efficacy for CINV white reduce the unnecessary adverse drug interactions induced by antiemetic drugs and chemotherapeutic agents.

In this work, a comparative study is performed using two training paradigms for kinesthetic tasks. Subjects are trained to team a complex 3D path through either the haptic method or the visual method. After the training period, subjects trace the learned 3D path without any feedback. Performance is evaluated primarily based on path deviation and time. Results indicate that haptically trained users have significantly higher performance than visually trained users. Other relevant results are also presented that can have a significant effect in the design of haptics-based interaction systems.					16th Conference on Medicine Meets Virtual Reality16th Conference on Medicine Meets Virtual Reality	JAN 30-FEB 01, 2008JAN 30-FEB 01, 2008		Long Beach, CALong Beach, CA	1	0	0	0	0	1			0926-9630			WOS:000272668400102	18391346

Kintner, PM; Coster, AJ; FullerRowell, T; Mannucci, AJ; Mendillo, M; Heelis, R		Thermospheric Dynamics at Low and Mid-Latitudes During Magnetic Storm Activity								MIDLATITUDE IONOSPHERIC DYNAMICS AND DISTURBANCES		Geophysical Monograph Series		181				201	219		10.1029/181GM19	10.1029/GM181		2008	2008	The coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-plasmasphere system is very complex. The study of the interrelationships of these components during geomagnetically disturbed conditions for low- and mid-latitude regions is especially challenging. This is partly because observations of the neutral atmosphere response are sparse and partly because the lack of coordination of satellite observations with ground-based measurements makes the proper identification of temporal and spatial variations in measurements difficult to achieve. In disturbed geomagnetic conditions, thermospheric neutral winds exhibit large deviations from the climatological behavior resulting in large corresponding changes in the ionospheric plasma density, composition, temperature, and electrodynamics. The general outline of the neutral thermosphere response to magnetic storm activity Is clear. The mid-latitude thermospheric wind response is characterized by enhanced and expanded wind circulation cells in the polar regions (caused by enhanced ion convection) and divergent flows originating at high latitudes (caused by Joule heating/particle heating sources). Increased thermospheric temperatures and significant deviations of zonal and meridional winds from quiet-time climatology behavior are observed for the mid-latitude themosphere. The low-latitude response of the thermosphere may be significantly less than at mid-latitudes. What remains unclear is the step-by-step sequence of the thermosphere response once the magnetic activity disturbance has been initiated. Also unclear is how this sequence might be modified as the season and the phase of the solar cycle change.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0065-8448		978-0-87590-446-7	WOS:000267401600018		
J	Young, Shawn P.; Isely, J. Jeffery								Evaluation of methods for attaching PIT tags and biotelemetry devices to freshwater mussels								MOLLUSCAN RESEARCH				28	3			175	178					2008	2008	We evaluated methods to attach PIT tags and transmitters to freshwater mussels. Mussels received externally-mounted PIT tags using cyanoacrylate or underwater epoxy, and a sub-group of those with PIT tags attached using cyanoacrylate also received dummy transmitters. Tag retention and survival were 100% after a 30 day laboratory observation period for each method. During the subsequent 18 months of field observation, underwater epoxy and cyanoacrylate proved to be adequate adhesives for attaching PIT tags and transmitters. Epoxy performed best with 100% PIT tag retention. Cyanoacrylate also provided high retention rates of PIT tags and transmitters, >90%. Mortality was minimal at 4.7% for all relocated mussels over 18 months. All mortalities were those tagged with cyanoacrylate. Three of the mortalities occurred among mussels fitted with dummy transmitters, and seven among PIT tags only. Percent recapture of the different tag/adhesive combinations ranged from 48 - 77.5% during 6- and 18-month surveys. Results suggest both adhesives provide a reliable method for external attachment of tags during freshwater mussel research; however, epoxy may be better suited because of slightly higher tag retention and reduced emersion times during attachment.									7	0	1	7	0	7			1323-5818			WOS:000262852100005

In the two-level algorithm, the solution to the fully nonlinear coarse mesh problem is utilized in a single-step linear fine mesh problem. When modeling parameters are chosen appropriately, the error in the two-level algorithm is comparable to the error in solving the fully nonlinear problem on the. ne mesh. We demonstrate numerically that, for an appropriate choice of grids, the two-level algorithm is significantly more efficient than the standard one-level algorithm. We also provide a rigorous numerical analysis of the two-level method, which yields appropriate scalings between the coarse and. ne mesh-sizes (H and h, respectively), and the radius of the spatial filter used in the Smagorinsky model (delta). Our analysis provides a mathematical answer to the large eddy simulation mystery of finding the scaling between the filter radius and numerical mesh-size.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1540-3459	1540-3467		WOS:000260847400006

Nano Ti is commercially pure titanium, that was nanostructured by a special technique of severe plastic deformation. It is bio inert, does not contain even potentially toxic or allergenetic additives and has significantly higher specific strength properties than any other titanium applied in dental implants. Cylindrical threaded screw implants Nanoimplant (R) sized 2.4 mm in diameter and 12 mm in length were made from nTi. It is the first application of nTi dental implant in the world reported. Recently more than 250 successful clinical applications dealing with surgery on the font teeth were carried out. No complications were noticed during the early postoperative period and early loading. Laboratory cytocompatibility tests undertaken so far on mice fibroblast cells have indicated that nanocrystalline Ti surface has a significantly better property for cell colonisation and healing of tissue consequently.					4th International Conference on Nanomaterials by Severe Plastic Deformation4th International Conference on Nanomaterials by Severe Plastic Deformation	AUG 18-22, 2008AUG 18-22, 2008		Goslar, GERMANYGoslar, GERMANY	35	0	1	1	2	36			0255-5476		*****************	WOS:000259440800008

After straining to an equivalent total equivalent of 6.5 samples were annealed for I h at temperatures between 175 and 800 degrees C followed by water quenching. Micro and nano-hardness measurements showed an initial hardness increase, the former rising to a maximum at 175 degrees C. while the latter exhibited a maximum at 500 degrees C. BSEI and TEM analysis showed that these observations can be understood by considering the microstructure chances occurring at different length scales. Annealing in the temperature range of 175 to 500 degrees C did not significantly alter the alpha and beta particle size, while TEM showed that recovery and continuous recrystallization occurred in the alpha phase, higher temperatures being required to activate the recovery and recrystallization processes within the beta phase. Finally at temperatures above 600 degrees C spheroidization and growth of the beta phase occurred with the volume fraction of this phase increasing from 15 pct at lower temperature to 25 pct at 800 degrees C, an equi-axed alpha+ beta microstructure being observed at this temperature.					4th International Conference on Nanomaterials by Severe Plastic Deformation4th International Conference on Nanomaterials by Severe Plastic Deformation	AUG 18-22, 2008AUG 18-22, 2008		Goslar, GERMANYGoslar, GERMANY	3	0	0	0	0	3			0255-5476		*****************	WOS:000259440800145

Here, species-specific root classifiers were developed to discriminate detected roots from bright background artifacts.Classifiers were developed from training images of peach (Prunus persica), freeman maple (Acer x freemanii) and sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) using the Adaboost algorithm. True- and false-positive rates for classifiers were estimated using receiver operating characteristic curves.Classifiers gave true positive rates of 89-94% and false positive rates of 3-7% when applied to nontraining images of the species for which they were developed. The application of a classifier trained on one species to images from another species resulted in little or no reduction in accuracy.These results suggest that a single root classifier can be used to distinguish roots from background objects across multiple minirhizotron experiments. By incorporating root detection and discrimination algorithms into an open-source minirhizotron image analysis application, many analysis tasks that are currently performed by hand can be automated.									18	2	0	17	0	20			0028-646X			WOS:000251766300026	18042202

As biological approaches alone such as VGEF have fallen short of their promises, one may look for an engineering approach to build microvasculature. Layer-by-layer approach for customized fabrication of cell/scaffold constructs have shown some potential in building complex 3D structures. With the advent of cell printing, one may be able to build precise human microvasculature with suitable bioink. Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HMEC) and fibrin were studied as bioink for microvasculature construction. Endothelial cells are the only cells to compose the human capillaries and also the major cells of blood vessel intima layer. Fibrin has been already widely recognized as tissue engineering scaffold for vasculature and other cells, including skeleton/smooth muscle cells and chondrocytes. In our study, we precisely fabricated micron-sized fibrin channels using a drop-on-demand polymerization. This printing technique uses aqueous processes that have been shown to induce little, if any, damage to cells. When printing HMEC cells in conjunction with the fibrin, we found the cells aligned themselves inside the channels and proliferated to form confluent linings. Current studies to characterize the biology and functionality of these engineered microvascular structures will be presented. The preliminary data suggests that a combined simultaneous cell and scaffold printing can promote HMEC proliferation and microvasculature formation.					24th Internationational Conference on Digital Printing Technologies/Digital Fabrication 200824th Internationational Conference on Digital Printing Technologies/Digital Fabrication 2008	SEP 06-11, 2008SEP 06-11, 2008	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol; Imaging Soc JapanSoc Imaging Sci & Technol; Imaging Soc Japan	Pittsburgh, PAPittsburgh, PA	6	0	0	6	0	6					978-0-89208-279-7	WOS:000260411500125

Laudon, M; Romanowicz, B		Flow of Viscous Surface Layer during Electropolishing of Tungsten Wire								NSTI NANOTECH 2008, VOL 1, TECHNICAL PROCEEDINGS								892	895					2008	2008	We investigated the mechanism of mass transfer during DC electropolishing of a tungsten wire in 2M KOH electrolyte solution. It appears that a viscous layer formed by the products of electrochemical reaction on anode surface has distinguishable optical and physicochemical properties. The viscous fluid flow is initiated by formation and detaching of a small droplet at the wire tip. Therefore, according to Tate's law, effects of surface tension and gravitational forces exerted on the film are comparable. Using high speed flow imaging, we estimated the density of this layer as rho approximate to 1075kg/m(3) and its interfacial tension as gamma approximate to 5.82.10(-6) N/m.

Laudon, M; Romanowicz, B		Preparation and characterization of highly porous PVDF nanofibers and yarns								NSTI NANOTECH 2008, VOL 2, TECHNICAL PROCEEDINGS								763	766					2008	2008	Unique highly porous polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) nanofibers of about 50-500 nm in diameter were prepared by electrospinning. Electrospinning setup used allows controlling the nanofiber's placement on the gap-type electrodes. Nanofiber arrays and yarns can be freely suspended in the gap between the electrodes. The resulting nanofiber samples are uniform and do not require expensive purification. Electrospun nanofiber yams are waterproof. Water drop deposited on the yarn's surface does not penetrate into the bulk. The PVDF yarns have high tenacity, can be bent, knotted, or twisted without any breakage. Results of DSC, TGA, and FTIR characterization of the yarns show the presents of crystalline PVDF P-phase responsible for ferroelectric properties of the PVDF material. Porosity of electrospun nanofibers was determined using SEM and AFM.

GDR contains annotated databases of all publicly available Rosaceae ESTs, the genetically anchored peach physical map, Rosaceae genetic maps and comprehensively annotated markers and traits. The ESTs are assembled to produce unigene sets of each genus and the entire Rosaceae. Other annotations include putative function, microsatellites, open reading frames, single nucleotide polymorphisms, gene ontology terms and anchored map position where applicable. Most of the published Rosaceae genetic maps can be viewed and compared through CMap, the comparative map viewer. The peach physical map can be viewed using WebFPC/WebChrom, and also through our integrated GDR map viewer, which serves as a portal to the combined genetic, transcriptome and physical mapping information. ESTs, BACs, markers and traits can be queried by various categories and the search result sites are linked to the mapping visualization tools. GDR also provides online analysis tools such as a batch BLAST/FASTA server for the GDR datasets, a sequence assembly server and microsatellite and primer detection tools. GDR is available at http://www.rosaceae.org.									116	4	0	116	1	124			0305-1048			WOS:000252545400180	17932055	
J	Johnson, Arlene E								A nursing faculty's transition to teaching online.								Nursing education perspectives				29	1			17	22					2008 Jan-Feb	2008	The introduction of web-based instruction into nursing education has resulted in a significant change in the responsibilities of nurse educators. This phenomenological research study explored the experiences of a graduate nursing faculty who had recently made the transition from traditional face-to-face instruction to web-based teaching. Through guided interviews, the faculty participants provided a rich description of their transition to web-based teaching and their perceptions of what faculty members need in order to make such a change successfully. Faculty members described how their role as nurse educators was reconceptualized as they learned to teach in a different environment. The participants' accounts of their experiences revealed a true paradigm shift in their perception of the nurse educator role and, for many, a comparable shift in their philosophy of teaching.									13	0	0	0	1	13			1536-5026			MEDLINE:18330417	18330417

To do this the researcher must draw meaningful conclusions from the data, situate them within the context of previous work, and discuss their implications. It is particularly important that the researcher be aware of the kinds of errors that can creep into educational research, and this chapter describes a number of common problems often found in research reports in chemistry education. These include mistaking cause and effect, overgeneralization, using anecdotal evidence, not controlling for differences in student population, mistaking self-reported learning for actual improvements in student learning, and disturbing the test population by the act of investigation. Examples of exemplary reports using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method research designs are provided to show how these problems can be avoided.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0097-6156		978-0-8412-6958-3	WOS:000277624800011

J	Bobko, Philip; Roth, Philip L.								Psychometric accuracy and (the continuing need for) quality thinking in meta-analysis								ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH METHODS				11	1			114	126		10.1177/1094428107303155			JAN 2008	2008	The four feature-topic articles advance the accuracy of meta-analytic techniques. As might be expected, most articles focus on more precise ways to aggregate all available relationships in a given topic domain. Such aggregation results in overall estimates of relationships and estimates conditional on particular moderators. However, scholars and practitioners can expect more than empirical aggregation from meta-analysis. Careful attention to underlying theory, application, and important methodological issues will result in clearer understanding and explanation. Using the situational judgment testing literature as an example, the current analysis suggests the need for much more upfront, reflective thinking about each meta-analytic study's purpose and how this thinking relates to the inclusion or choice of primary studies, analytic method, coding, and so on. For example, when the focus is on prediction, frequent use of concurrent designs may bias aggregated parameter estimates. Also, it is noted that methods and constructs continue to be confounded in the research literatures.									15	0	0	0	0	15			1094-4281			WOS:000251815900008

Highlighting human form and motion information enhances the conspicuity of pedestrians at night								PERCEPTION				37	8			1276	1284		10.1068/p6017			2008	2008	Exploring how biological motion can make pedestrians more conspicuous to drivers at night, one-hundred-and-twenty participants were driven along an open-road route at night and pressed a button whenever they recognized that a pedestrian was present. A test pedestrian wearing black clothing alone or with 302 cm(2) of retroreflective markings in one of four configurations either stood still or walked in place on an unilluminated sidewalk. Participants' response distances were maximal for the full biological-motion configuration and remained surprisingly long when convenient subsets of reflective markers were positioned on the pedestrian's ankles and wrists. When the pedestrian wore a reflective vest, the responses were no better than when he wore no reflective markings. The biological-motion advantage actually results from interacting form-perception and motion-perception mechanisms.

The theory is a simple, quantitatively accurate and transferable continuum approach to predicting defect formation energies that obviates the need for computationally expensive quantum mechanical methods. Thus the theory has the potential to serve as the basis for thermodynamic and multi-scale modelling of the structural properties of carbon nanostructures.									8	0	0	1	0	8			0950-0839			WOS:000252989100008		
J	Starkey, Charles								Classifying Emotions: Prospects for a Psychoevolutionary Approach								PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY				21	6			759	777	PII 906067955	10.1080/09515080802513300			2008	2008	One of the most significant developments in the area of emotion theory in recent years is the revival of the psychoevolutionary approach to classification. This essay appraises the prospects for such an approach. The first contention is that the supposed advantages of psychoevolutionary classification over functional classification in scientific psychological research is less than presumed, particularly with respect to the utility of the classification, which is the basis of the argument for the superiority of psychoevolutionary classification. The second and central contention is that classification in terms of mechanisms proposed by empirical psychology and neuroscience has better prospects than psychoevolutionary classification with respect to both the utility for psychological research and the ability to carve psychological systems at their joints, that is, to produce natural kind divisions that distinguish emotions from other psychological traits.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0951-5089			WOS:000261195400003

Investigation of band inversion in (Pb,Sn)Te alloys using ab initio calculations								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				77	3					033103	10.1103/PhysRevB.77.033103			JAN 2008	2008	The electronic structure of the (Pb,Sn)Te alloy displays the so-called "band inversion" between its two end members, PbTe and SnTe. Although the electronic structures of these two end members have been extensively studied by first-principles calculations, there have been no reports of first-principles calculations of the evolution of the band gap with composition. We have studied systematically the band structure using first-principles calculations within the generalized gradient approximation and have investigated the effects of compositional disorder. By taking into account local disorder, we show that the calculated dependence of band gap on composition is in good agreement with experimental results.									23	0	1	4	0	24			1098-0121			WOS:000252862900003

These selectable markers are based oil the use of mutant tubulin genes from natural biotypes or in vitro selected mutant plants. The results of numerous studies on plants resistant to herbicides with antimicrotubular modes of action are summarized. In addition, the transfer and expression of Mutant tubulin genes, conferring resistance to amiprophosmethyl (phosphorothioamidate herbicide) and trifluralin (dinitroaniline herbicide), by somatic hybridization to related and remote species are discussed. The results of experiments oil transformation of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants with a mutant (alpha-tubulin gene conferring resistance to dinitroanilines are described to test the possibility of its use as a selectable marker gene and, simultaneously, as all agronomic trait to obtain dinitroaniline-resistant plants.

J	Talley, Kemper; Ng, Carmen; Shoppell, Michael; Kundrotas, Petras; Alexov, Emil								On the electrostatic component of protein-protein binding free energy.								PMC biophysics				1	1			2	2		10.1186/1757-5036-1-2			2008 Nov 05	2008	Calculations of electrostatic properties of protein-protein complexes are usually done within framework of a model with a certain set of parameters. In this paper we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of the sensitivity of the electrostatic component of binding free energy (DeltaDeltaGel) with respect with different force fields (Charmm, Amber, and OPLS), different values of the internal dielectric constant, and different presentations of molecular surface (different values of the probe radius). The study was done using the largest so far set of entries comprising 260 hetero and 2148 homo protein-protein complexes extracted from a previously developed database of protein complexes (ProtCom). To test the sensitivity of the energy calculations with respect to the structural details, all structures were energy minimized with corresponding force field, and the energies were recalculated. The results indicate that the absolute value of the electrostatic component of the binding free energy (DeltaDeltaGel) is very sensitive to the force field parameters, the minimization procedure, the values of the internal dielectric constant, and the probe radius. Nevertheless our results indicate that certain trends in DeltaDeltaGel behavior are much less sensitive to the calculation parameters. For instance, the fraction of the homo-complexes, for which the electrostatics was found to oppose binding, is 80% regardless of the force fields and parameters used. For the hetero-complexes, however, the percentage of the cases for which electrostatics opposed binding varied from 43% to 85%, depending on the protocol and parameters employed. A significant correlation was found between the effects caused by raising the internal dielectric constant and decreasing the probe radius. Correlations were also found among the results obtained with different force fields. However, despite of the correlations found, the absolute DeltaDeltaGel calculated with different force field parameters could differ more than tens of kcal/mol in some cases. Set of rules of obtaining confident predictions of absolute DeltaDeltaGel and DeltaDeltaGel sign are provided in the conclusion section.PACS codes: 87.15.A-, 87.15. km.									24	0	0	13	0	25				1757-5036		MEDLINE:19351424	19351424

Broiler chick thrombocyte response to lipopolysaccharide								POULTRY SCIENCE				87	1			61	63		10.3382/ps.2007-0036			JAN 2008	2008	The effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin ( IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-12 in broiler chick thrombocytes was investigated. At 4 wk of age, blood samples were collected, and isolated thrombocytes were incubated with LPS for 1 h. Ribonucleic acid was extracted from the cells to examine the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines using real-time reverse transcription PCR. It was found that expressions of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-12 in thrombocytes were unaffected by diets containing corticosterone and vitamin C fed to chicks. However, LPS exposure did increase the expressions of these cytokines. The fact that thrombocytes are so abundant and can be stimulated by LPS makes them primary effector cells in innate host defenses against bacterial infections in chickens.									15	0	0	14	1	15			0032-5791			WOS:000253855000010	18079451

The rosemary preparations differed in oil and water solubility, dispersion properties, or both. Addition of rosemary to ground chicken had an overall positive effect on raw meat appearance during storage and cooked meat flavor. No effect on bacterial growth was observed due to rosemary addition. However, oxidation was slowed in meat with added rosemary as indicated by lower TBA values, lower hexanal concentrations, and sensory scores. Color ( redness) was more stable in meat with added rosemary compared with meat without rosemary, as reflected in redness (a*) values, hue angles, and visual scores. Of the 4 rosemary preparations tested, the oil-soluble, most concentrated preparation (HT-O) was most effective in maintaining meat quality compared with the other 3 types tested.									34	2	0	25	1	37			0032-5791			WOS:000253855000026	18079467

Full characterization of a thermoelectric material requires measurement of the electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient. While standard reference materials exist or have existed for the first two properties, Seebeck coefficient standard reference materials are not available. In an effort to expedite research efforts in this field, we have initiated a project to develop a Seebeck coefficient SRM (TM) material.. Currently, we have completed a round-robin measurement survey of two candidate materials, Bi2Te3 and constantan (55% Cu and 45% Ni). In this paper, we summarize our plan and development effort, including the results and the methodology used for the round-robin measurement survey.					26th International Conference on Thermoelectrics (ICT'07)26th International Conference on Thermoelectrics (ICT'07)	JUN 03-05, 2007JUN 03-05, 2007	Korean Thermoelect Soc; Int Thermoelect Soc; Inst Elect & Electron Engn; IEEE Components, Packaging & Mfg Technol SocKorean Thermoelect Soc; Int Thermoelect Soc; Inst Elect & Electron Engn; IEEE Components, Packaging & Mfg Technol Soc	Jeju Isl, SOUTH KOREAJeju Isl, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1094-2734		978-1-4244-2262-3	WOS:000258325700088		
B	Singapogu, Ravikiran B.; Sander, Sam T.; Burg, Timothy C.; Lee, DongBin			IEEE					A five DOF haptic rendering algorithm using multiple contact points								PROCEEDINGS IEEE SOUTHEASTCON 2008, VOLS 1 AND 2								262	267		10.1109/SECON.2008.4494300			2008	2008	With the proliferation of haptic devices, there has been significant research toward realistic haptic rendering of virtual environments. Currently, the majority of haptic devices provide only three degrees-of-freedom (3 DOF), but 5 and 6 DOF devices are becoming more common. This paper presents a method of using existing 3 DOF rendering techniques to produce forces for a 5 or 6 DOF device when true 6 DOF rendering is unavailable. Point-force 3 DOF rendering that is most commonly used in commercial haptic applications is simple and fast for basic haptic rendering; however, this creates unrealistic haptic effects when an avatar other than a point is considered. As a solution, a 6 DOF force and torque algorithm is presented based on multiple contact points. Using the multi-point torque rendering approach, forces are rendered in three linear dimensions using existing 3 DOF algorithms, and up to three additional torque degrees-of-freedom are calculated based on the forces on multiple points. This capability enhances haptic realism without modifying the legacy rendering. Finally, this algorithm is demonstrated using a 5 DOF haptic interface. The results from test observations suggest that the 5 DOF rendering algorithm functions as expected.

The first technique is to use newly developed monolithically stacked 3D-IC technology for the implementation, because vertical stacking can drastically reduce interconnect length in both matchlines and searchlines, hence reducing signal path delay and power consumption. The second technique is to replace the conventional SRAM memory in a TCAM with an array of programmable vias (or electrolyte non-volatile memory). Special programming circuitry is designed to read/write memory bits from/to the programmable via array because they do not simply store data in the form of low and high voltage levels. We also devised a new TCAM cell design to further reduce power consumption in TCAMs by taking full advantage of 3D-IC technology. A 1024x144-bit TCAM using the proposed schemes is implemented with 1.0-V 65mn CMOS technology. Our analysis and simulations have shown that the proposed monolithically stacked 3D-TCAM can reduce the total dynamic power consumption by almost 3.5 times and increase TCAM cell density by about 4 times in comparison with a conventional 2D-TCAM chip of the same capacity.

Krikhaar, R; Lammel, R; Verhoef, C		A toolkit for visualizing the runtime behavior of TinyOS applications								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGRAM COMPREHENSION		International Conference on Program Comprehension						43	52		10.1109/ICPC.2008.22			2008	2008	TinyOS has proven to be an effective platform for developing reactive embedded network applications. However the platform's lean programming model and power-efficient operation come at a price: TinyOS applications are notoriously difficult to construct and debug. The development difficulties stem, in large part, from a programming model founded on events and deferred execution. In short, the model introduces non-determinism in the execution ordering of primitive actions (i.e., commands, events, and tasks). The resulting set of possible execution sequences is typically large, and can swamp developers' unaided intellectual ability to reason about program behavior.In this paper, we present a platform-neutral visualization toolkit for TinyOS 2.0 to aid in program comprehension. The goal is to assist developers in reasoning about the computation forest underlying a system under test, and the particular branches chosen during each run. The toolkit design includes (i) a full-featured static analysis and instrumentation library, (ii) a selection-based probe insertion system, (iii) a lightweight event recording service, (iv) a trace extraction and reconstruction tool, and (v) two visualization front-ends.

B	Andrae, John						Smith, RA		Rotational Grazing Benefits and Specific Methods								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 41ST ANNUAL CONFERENCE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF BOVINE PRACTITIONERS								104	108					2008	2008	Rotational grazing is a topic frequently discussed among forage producers. Many testimonials have been made regarding the benefits of rotational grazing. Some claim that simply implementing a rotational grazing system will allow doubling or even tripling stocking rates and total elimination of fertilizer inputs. These claims are far from true; however, rotational grazing does offer substantial benefits to cattle producers located in the humid eastern US, including improved animal productivity, increased plant persistence, conservation of environmental resources, and improved animal temperament. This article gives a general overview of rotational grazing, with examples taken in part from Southern Forages (3(rd) ed) and a large, three-year grazing study conducted by Drs. Hoveland, McCann, and Hill at the University of Georgia.					41st Annual Conference of the American-Association-of-Bovine-Practitioners41st Annual Conference of the American-Association-of-Bovine-Practitioners	SEP 25-27, 2008SEP 25-27, 2008	Amer Assoc Bovine PractitAmer Assoc Bovine Practit	Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	0	0	0	0	0	0					*****************	WOS:000267056800018

We give a direct proof of a recursion for the number of equivalence classes of this relation for an arbitrary graph Y using edge deletion and edge contraction of non-bridge edges. We conclude by showing how this result may also be obtained through an evaluation of the Tutte polynomial as T-Y (1, 0), and we provide bijections to two other classes of acyclic orientations that are known to be counted in the same way.

B	Daqaq, Mohammed F.; Bradley, Calvin; Jalili, Nader; Alhazza, Khaled			ASME					Feedback delays for ultrasensitive sensing								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 1, PTS A-C								743	750					2008	2008	Nanomechanical Cantilever Sensors (NMCS) have recently emerged as an effective means for label-free chemical and biological species detection. Their high selectivity, low cost, and easy mass production make them an enabling technology for micro- and nanodetection techniques. Sensitivity constitutes one of the most desirable characteristics of NMCS. However, sensitivity of current NMCS is predominately limited by their size. In other words, smaller sensors are more sensitive than larger ones. The detection of ultra-small masses or frequency variations is therefore obstructed by the availability of more advanced fabrication techniques that are capable of manufacturing smaller and smaller sensors. Even in that case, other issues such as noise, damping, and measurement difficulties become more evident. Therefore, techniques for sensitivity enhancement should be studied and implemented to allow for accurate and precise detection of even smaller parameter variations. Along that line of reasoning, we propose a simple, but effective concept to enhance sensitivity of NMCS. The proposed methodology is based on utilizing feedback delays to create a limit-cycle response whose amplitude is ultra-sensitive to frequency variations. In this paper, we explain, analyze, and derive the equations that verify the proposed concept. We then experimentally implement the sensitivity enhancement technique on a macrocantilever beam and demonstrate more than two-orders-of-magnitude sensitivity enhancement over the frequency-shift method.

This can be done by measuring either the static deflection of the microcantilever after the adsorption or the adsorption induced shift in its resonance frequency. This paper presents a new method of formulating the adsorption induced surface stress as a function of the static deflection of the microcantilever. Most of the previous works in this area are based on the Stoney's simple equation. In the proposed method, the molecular interactions of the adsorbed biological species are modeled based on the Lennard-Jones attraction/repulsion potential. As a result, the sensitivity of the static detection mode (based on the proposed method) is compared to that of the dynamic mode. It is shown that the dynamic mode of biosensing is much more sensitive to the change in the properties of the adsorbed biological species, when compared to conventional static mode detection mechanism.

B	Hossein, Mahmoud Reza; Jalili, Nader			ASME					A new nanomechanical cantilever sensing paradigm using piezoelectric boron nitride nanotube-based actuation								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 1, PTS A-C								759	768					2008	2008	Nanomechanical Cantilever Sensors (NMCS) have recently attracted a widespread attention for use in different nano- and micro-size applications such as studying the nanoscale surface topography by scanning probe microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In newer AFM systems, a sharp probe is placed at the tip of the microcantilever and a piezoelectric patch actuator deposited on the cantilever surface produces the movements of the probe above the examined surface. Similar system can be also utilized for mass sensing purposes by adding an unknown mass to the tip and measuring the beam deflection and the amount of shift in the resonance frequency that is caused by the addition of the tip mass. This sensing paradigm finds many applications in medical and biological fields such as DNA strand and bacteria weight measurement. However, one of the major issues in all piezoelectrically-actuated microcantilevers is the low actuation energy of the piezoelectric patch. Most of the current and widely used piezoelectric materials possess low mechanical characteristics such as low Young's modulus of elasticity, low yield strength and most importantly incompatibility with most biological species and environment. It has been shown that both carbon and boron nitride nanotubes (CNT and BNNT) possess outstanding mechanical, chemical and electrical properties with acceptable piezoelectricity which make them suitable for microcantilever actuation applications. In this paper, a multi-physics multi-scale model is proposed in which the actuation of microcantilevers is produced by two sets of nanotube layers. Through extensive simulations, BNNTs were chosen to be used as the actuators because of their enhanced piezoelectric characteristics compared to CNTs. The modeling framework proposed here is used to investigate the effects of deposited tip mass with different weights on frequency response and resonance frequency of the microcantilever beam. These microbeams are made of aluminum or titanium materials and the results are compared with each other.

By decoupling the hysteresis from the system dynamics, an uncertain linear dynamic system subjected to a static hysteretic input is achieved. A bound of uncertainty for the parameters of the dynamic system is considered and the hysteresis is reduced to a line with a known slope plus a varying function representing the difference of the approximate line and the hysteresis response. For the described uncertain system, g-synthesis method is used to achieve both stabilization and tracking performance within a desired precision and bandwidth. Simulation performed on a perturbed nonlinear plant demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach when compared to other methods.

The RRP (Revolute Revolute Prismatic) manipulator considered here utilizes two rotational motors with 0.1 grad resolution and one linear Nanomotor (R) with 0.25 nm resolution. Weighing just about 30g and having short lever arms (< 5cm), the manipulator is capable of achieving well-behaved kinematic characteristics without the backlash in addition to atomic scale precision to guarantee accurate manipulation at the nanoscale. A mathematical model of the nanomanipulator is formulated and both direct and inverse kinematics of the system as well as dynamic equations are presented. A fused force vision feedback based modified optimal robust controller with perturbation estimation for nanomanipulator positioning is then derived and analyzed extensively. Unlike typical macroscale manipulator models and controllers, the controller development is not trivial here due to nanoscale movement and forces, coupled with unmodeled dynamics, nonlinear structural dynamics and mainly lack of position and velocity feedback in this nanomanipulator. Following the development of the fused force vision robust controller, numerical simulations of the proposed controller are preformed to demonstrate the positioning performance capability in nanofiber grasping applications.

B	Mahmoodi, S. Nima; Afshari, Mana; Jalili, Nader			ASME					Nonlinear vibrations of a piezoelectrically-driven microcantilever for biologically-induced surface stress sensing								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 1, PTS A-C								1005	1014					2008	2008	In this paper, nonlinear vibrations of a piezoelectrically-driven microcantilever beam in presence of a biological monolayer are investigated and the corresponding equations of motion are derived and simulated. A part of the microcantilever beam surface is covered by a piezoelectric layer, which acts as an actuator. Inextensibility condition and the coupling between electrical and mechanical properties in piezoelectric materials are considered in the bending vibrations of the beam. The adsorbed biological layer is considered to be a monolayer and its adsorption induced surface stress is formulated from the molecular viewpoint. The nonlinear terms in the governing equations of motion of the beam appear in the form of quadratic due to presence of piezoelectric layer, and cubic due to geometry of the beam and the adsorbed biological layer. Through extensive numerical simulations, it is demonstrated that the nonlinear effect of piezoelectric layer is significant in the microcantilever resonance sensing range. It is also shown that the effect of intermolecular attraction/repulsion on the surface stress is less dominant than other sources of surface stress (e.g., the electrostatic forces). Finally, it is observed that piezoelectrically-actuated microcantilever provides the ability of indirect measurement of vibrations and frequency response characteristics, instead of using bulky laser sensor.

B	Salehi-Khojin, Amin; Jalili, Nader			ASME					A shear-lag model for nanotube reinforced piezoelectric polymeric composites subjected to electro-thermo-mechanical loadings								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 1, PTS A-C								1889	1897					2008	2008	Understanding the stress transfer between nanotube reinforcements and surrounding matrix is an important factor in determining the overall mechanical properties of nanotube-reinforced composites. An efficient load transfer from the polymer matrix to the nanotube through interface is required to take the advantage of very high Young's modulus and strength of carbon nanotubes in the composites. On the other hand, considerable energy dissipation can be obtained by interfacial slippage in the interface of nanotube and matrix which is beneficial in term of structural damping. In order to obtain a composite structure with tunable properties ranges from stiffer structure to better damper, we propose a semi-active control approach. In this method, applied electrical loading to piezoelectric polymeric matrix such as Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) reinforced with nanomaterials results in radial displacement of piezoelectric polymer corresponding to the direction and magnitude of electrical load. This leads to control of restriction effect of nanotube on the polymer segments, and consequently results in tunable interfacial adhesion between piezoelectric polymer and nanomaterials with faster response time. According to the concept of semi-active control, a shear lag model is obtained for a nanotube reinforced piezoelectric polymer under electro-thermo-mechanical loadings. As the adhesion in carbon nanotube (CNT) composite is universally present in the form of van der Waals interaction, and is the focus of this study, the shear stress and the axial displacement of nanotube and matrix in the interface zone can not be equal. This makes mathematical modeling of interface region more difficult. To solve this complexity, we propose to obtain the relative axial displacement between nanotube and polymer in the interface according to the Lennard-Jones potential function. Results indicate that as the electrical load increases, the relative displacement between nanotube and polymer increases which mean the possibility for slippage increases. Furthermore, results indicate that stiffer structures have more potential to show more switch stiffness capability.

More specifically, in the first part of this work, we examine the free response of a cantilever beam subjected to delayed-acceleration feedback. We characterize the stability of the trivial solutions and determine the normal form of the bifurcation at the stability boundary. We show that the trivial solutions lose stability via a Hopf bifurcation leading to limit-cycle oscillations (LCO). We assess the stability of the resulting LCO close to the stability boundary by determining the nature of the Hopf bifurcation (sub-or supercritical). We show that the bifurcation type depends only on the frequency of the delayed-response at the bifurcation point and the coefficients of the beam geometric and inertia nonlinearities. To analyze the stability of the LCO in the postbifurcation region, we utilize the Method of Harmonic Balance and the Floquet Theory. We observe that, increasing the gain magnitude for certain feedback delays may culminate in a chaotic response.In the second part of this study, we analyze the effect of feedback delays on a cantilever beam subjected to primary base excitations. We find that the nature of the forced response is largely determined by the stability of the trivial solutions of the unforced response. For stable trivial solutions (i.e., inside the stability boundaries of the linear system), the free response emanating from delayed feedback diminishes leaving only the particular solution resulting from the external excitation. In that case, delayed feedback acts as a vibration absorber. On the other hand, for unstable trivial solutions, the response contains two coexisting frequencies. Therefore, depending on the excitation amplitude and the closeness of the frequency of the delayed response to the excitation frequency, the response is either periodic or quasiperiodic. Finally, we study the effect of higher vibration modes on the beam response. We show that the validity of a single-mode analysis is dependent on the gain-delay combination utilized for feedback as well as the position and size of the piezoelectric patch.

A fast and robust genetic algorithm is developed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Customized crossover and mutation operators specifically tailored to solve the combinatorial optimization problem are discussed. A proof-of-concept simulation on a practical design problem is presented. The described genetic algorithm incorporates features to prevent redundant evaluation of identical solutions and a method for handling of the compatibility matrix (feasible/infeasible combinations) and addressing desirable/undesirable combinations. The proposed approach is limited by its reliance on the quantifiable metrics for evaluating the objectives and the existence of a mathematical representation of the combined solutions. The optimization framework is designed to be a scalable and flexible procedure which can be easily modified to accommodate a wide variety of design methods that are based on the morphological chart.

Better understanding of current techniques which are applied in the scale of single grain requires a straightforward analytical theory to map the PFM response for a wide range of typical experimental parameters. To this end, a new modeling framework is presented for a PFM which is modeled as a suspended cantilever beam with a tip mass. More specifically, the beam is considered to vibrate in all three directions, while subjected to a bias input voltage. The Hamilton's principle is used to derive the governing equations. The local electrostatic forces on the tip and distributed forces acting on the cantilever are also taken into account in the current modeling framework. Since the sample and tip are in the contact mode and any changes in the topography of surface will affect the indentation depth of indenter, the boundary control input force is used at the base unit. Moreover, the free end of beam with the equivalent mass of tip is connected to springs in the vertical, longitudinal and lateral directions to represent the resistance of piezoelectric material to tip movement. It is shown that the vertical bending is coupled to longitudinal displacement and lateral bending is coupled to torsion through the friction between tip and sample.

The principles of phase space geometry suit the dynamic behavior exhibited during transient and non-stationary operating modes. In this paper, two strategies are presented to evaluate the dynamic behavior of power generating natural gas turbines based on the phase space properties. Recurrence analysis allows methods to be developed that are suitable for many dynamic systems. The evaluation of extensive operating data for a simple cycle power generating gas turbine was performed to assess the health condition, and to evaluate the performance of equipment clusters in a power generation plant. The analytical results obtained from this implementation, along with the main conclusions drawn regarding the health condition of the machines, demonstrates the opportunity for system diagnostics.

ASME					Exact solution of time history response for dynamic systems with arbitrary viscous damping using complex modal analysis								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION 2007, VOL 12: NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN SIMULATION METHODS AND SOFTWARE FOR ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS								153	163					2008	2008	A solution method for general, non-proportional damping time history response for piecewise linear loading is generalized to exact solutions which include piecewise quadratic loading. Comparisons are made to Trapezoidal and Simpson's quadrature rules for approximating the time integral of the weighted generalized forcing function in the exact solution to the decoupled modal equations arising from state-space modal analysis of linear dynamic systems. Closed-form expressions for the weighting parameters in the quadrature formulas in terms of time-step size and complex eigenvalues are derived. The solution is obtained step-by-step from update formulas derived from the piecewise linear and quadratic interpolatory quadrature rules starting from the initial condition. An examination of error estimates for the different force interpolation methods shows convergence rates depend explicitly on the amount of damping in the system as measured by the real-part of the complex eigenvalues of the state-space modal equations and time-step size. Numerical results for a system with general, non-proportional damping, and driven by a continuous loading shows that for systems with light damping, update formulas for standard Trapezoidal and Simpson's rule integration have comparable accuracy to the weighted piecewise linear and quadratic force interpolation update formulas, while for heavy damping, the update formulas from the weighted force interpolation quadrature rules are more accurate. Using a simple model representing a stiff system with general damping, we show that a two-step modal analysis using real-valued modal reduction followed by state-space modal analysis is shown to be an effective approach for rejecting spurious modes in the spatial discretization of a continuous system.

B	Jensen, Matthew; Wagner, John; Alexander, Kim; Pidgeon, Philip			ASME		Jensen, Matthew/0000-0002-5229-7382			A customizable human/vehicle interface for enhanced operator performance								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION 2007, VOL 16: TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS								33	41					2008	2008	The emergence of cost effective electronics and actuators within the transportation industry allows the presentation of increased driver feedback for greater situational awareness. The operator feedback channels can be broadly divided into visual, audio, and haptic. To date, the automotive community has primarily relied on instrument panel lamps and buzzer/chime sounds to notify the driver of important information while the vehicle's interaction with the road is mechanically communicated through the steering wheel "feel" and the driver seat motion. However, an opportunity exists to integrate the visual, audio, and haptic feedback channels in a more effective manner to increase driver safety. For instance, the driver may receive haptic driving information through high frequency and low amplitude steering wheel vibrations. Visual feedback may be presented in the form of LED lights on the dashboard and instrument cluster. Similarly, audio messages that are recognized through a different cognitive process than visual and haptic signals may be integrated into the cockpit. In this paper, a comprehensive approach is proposed for driver communication through visual, audio, and haptic feedback. Laboratory tests have been conducted with human subjects using a custom driving simulator to evaluate driver notification strategies. The effectiveness of each feedback channel is evaluated and the results demonstrate that the coordinated presentation of vehicle operational data through targeted feedback channels increase the operator's overall safety.

Furthermore, there are additional considerations, such as safety and reliability that need to be taken into account when developing a coil head reduction plan. Three possible solutions were prototyped and tested: a highly emissive paint, a thermally conductive polymer, and the utilization of heat pipes. Each idea was tested to determine the reduction in coil head temperature. Of these designs, the use of a highly emissive paint on the internal surface of the motor's end cap, allowed the most heat to be dissipated. For $4, this solution yielded a 1.8 degrees C decrease in coil head temperature.

B	Bashash, Saeid; Jalili, Nader			ASME					Adaptive robust control strategy for coupled parallel-kinematics piezo-flexural micro and nano-positioning stages								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION 2007, VOL 9, PTS A-C: MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND CONTROL								997	1006					2008	2008	Multiple-axis parallel kinematics piezo-flexural stages, used in variety of scanning probe microscopy and manipulation applications, suffer not only from the hysteresis nonlinearity and the effects of system dynamics, but also from the nonlinear coupling of one axis action on the motion of the other axes. Motivated by these shortfalls, a Lyapunov-based adaptive robust control methodology is proposed for the simultaneous tracking control of multiple-axis parallel kinematics piezo-flexural micro/nano- positioning systems in the presence of parametric uncertainties and unknown or partially known hysteresis and coupling nonlinearities. For this, a double-axis parallel-kinematics piezo-flexural stage with sub-nanometer resolution capacitive position sensors is considered for the system analysis and controller verification. The hysteresis response and the coupling effect of the stage are studied through a number of experiments, followed by a mathematical formulation for the system nonlinear equation of motion. Adopting the variable structure (sliding mode) control method with a parameter adaptation strategy, an adaptive robust controller is then derived with its asymptotic stability guaranteed through the Lyapunov stability criterion. To avoid the chatter phenomenon, which is a common problem in the sliding mode control, the hard switching function of the controller is replaced by a soft switching function. Through theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that a parallelogram-type zone of attraction can be explicitly formed for the proposed soft variable structure controller, to which the error phase trajectory converges. Therefore, a uniformly ultimately bounded closed-loop system response is achieved. The proposed controller is eventually implemented on the piezo-flexural stage, demonstrating the effective double-axis tracking control of the stage, even in the absence of a representative hysteresis model and despite parametric uncertainties. Results indicate good agreement between experiments and theoretical developments.

Due to the variety of applications in biological and material science technologies, microcantilevers have recently received widespread attention. Due to their extreme sensitivity and simplicity, piezoresistive microcantilevers are widely used in variety of sensing applications; however, most of the current studies focus on a simple lumped-parameters modeling rather than modeling of the piezoresistive microcantilevers itself. Due to the applications of the piezoresistive microcantilevers in nanoscale force sensing or non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which are involved with the forces in the range of nano-Newton to pico-Newton, precise modeling of the piezoresistive microcantilevers is essential. Instead of the previously used lumped-parameters modeling, a distributed-parameters modeling is proposed and developed here to achieve the most precise model of the piezoresistive microcantilever with tip-mass, tip-force and base movement. In order to utilize online control and real-time sensor feedback, there is a need to have a closed-form relationship between microcantilever's piezoresistive output voltage as a function of tip force and the base motion. To achieve this, utilizing a novel approach a closed-form modeling framework for the piezoresistive microcantilever is presented. Following the mathematical modeling, simulation results are presented to show the accuracy of the proposed distributed-parameters modeling when compared with the previously reported lumped-parameters modeling approach.

Here a 3 DOF (Degrees Of Freedom) nanomanipulator with RRP (Revolute Revolute Prismatic) actuator arrangement is considered for nanomanipulation purposes. Due to the sophisticated complexity, and expected high level of accuracy and precision (of the order of 10(-7) rad in revolute actuators and 0.25 nm in the prismatic actuator) of the nanomanipulator, there is a need to design a suitable controller to guarantee an accurate manipulation process. However, structure of the nanomanipulator employed here, namely MM3A, is such that the dynamic equations of motion of the nanomanipulator are highly nonlinear and complicated. Linearizing these dynamic equations of the nanomanipulator simplifies the controller design process significantly. However, linearization could suppress some critical information about the system dynamics. In order to achieve the precise motion of the nanomanipulator utilizing the simple linearized model, H-infinity and mu-synthesis robust controller design approaches are proposed. Following the development of the controllers, numerical simulations of the proposed controllers on the nanomanipulator are used to verify the positioning performance.

To improve their sensitivity, a new concept based on delayed-position feedback is proposed and implemented. The proposed approach utilizes feedback delays and inherent system nonlinearities to produce stable limit-cycle oscillations. These limit cycles are generated as a result of the trivial solutions loosing stability via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The amplitude of the limit cycles is shown to be ultra sensitive to variations in the sensor natural frequency. This creates an ultra-sensitive cantilever-based mass sensing platform which does not require any changes or additions to the current sensor geometry and can be implemented in real time.

Results front the first pilot study suggest the presence of a learning curve that novice users must overcome in order to gain proficiency in EyeWrite's use (requiring practice with its letter-like gestural alphabet). Results from the second longitudinal study indicate that EyeWrite's inherent multi-saccade handicap (4.52 saccades per character, frequency-weighted average) is sufficient for the on-screen keyboard to edge out EyeWrite in speed performance. Eye-typing speeds with EyeWrite approach S wpm tail average (8 wpm attainable by proficient users), whereas keyboard users achieve about 7 wpm oil average (in line with previous results). However, EyeWrite users leave significantly fewer uncorrected errors in the final text, with no significant difference in the number of errors corrected during entry, indicating a speed-accuracy trade-off. Subjective results indicate that participants consider EyeWrite significantly faster, easier to use, and prone to cause less ocular fatigue than the on-screen keyboard. In addition, EyeWrite consumes much less screen real-estate than an on-screen keyboard, giving it practical advantages for eye-based text entry.

Limited research exists on sports turf foliar nutrient absorption and comparisons with granular fertilizer. However, to date, findings on foliar fertilization include: 1) younger leaves demonstrate great foliar nutrient absorption rate than old leaves; 2) lower (abaxial) leaf surfaces (with more stomata) absorb more nutrients than the upper (adaxial) side of the leaf; 3) neutral molecule absorption is more efficient than cation (positively charged ions) and anion (negatively charged ions) absorption; 4) most of 17 plant nutrients including some beneficial elements have been reported to be absorbed by leaves; 5) cuticle penetration is possible and is genetically regulated; 6) the total fertilizer input may be reduced by using foliar fertilization; 7) there may be synergetic effects by using foliar fertilizers and plant growth regulators; and 8) it is environmentally safer to use more foliar fertilizers. Thus, this review is trying to provide the most updated research results on turfgrass foliar fertilization including sports turfgrasses.					2nd International Conference on Turfgrass Management and Science for Sports Fields2nd International Conference on Turfgrass Management and Science for Sports Fields	JUN 24-29, 2007JUN 24-29, 2007		Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	2	0	0	1	0	2			0567-7572		978-90-6605-108-9	WOS:000256224300034

The effect of a carbon-nanotube forest-mat strike face on the ballistic-protection performance of E-glass reinforced poly-vinyl-ester-epoxy composite armour								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS				222	L1			15	27		10.1243/14644207JMDA136			JAN 2008	2008	In the present work, a ballistic material-model development approach is combined with transient non-linear dynamics simulations of the projectile/ armour interactions to explore the armour-hard-facing potential of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) reinforced, polyvinyl-ester-epoxy (PVEE)-matrix composite mats. This approach is applied to improving the ballistic-protection performance of E-glass fibre-mat reinforced PVEE-matrix laminate armour. Two different architectures of the MWCNT-reinforced/PVEE-matrix composite mats were considered: (a) a MWCNT-ply mat structure in which the MWCNT reinforcements are aligned parallel to the armour faces and (b) a MWCNT-forest mat structure in which the MWCNT reinforcements are aligned orthogonally to the armour faces. The projectile/ armour interaction simulation results showed that, at low volume fractions of MWCNTs, both armour architectures yield no discernable increase in the armour ballistic-protection performance as measured by the armour. On the other hand, at high MWCNT volume fractions of MWCNTs, the first armour architecture remained ineffective whereas the second showed a minor improvement in the ballistic-protection performance relative to the corresponding monolithic armour. These results were rationalized using published experimental observations pertaining to the effect of MWCNTs on the in-plane and the through-the-thickness properties of fibre-mat/polymer-matrix composite materials.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1464-4207			WOS:000252804000002

In the 2001 and 2002 plantings, 'Cadamans (R)' 'SLAP', 'Lovell', 'Pumiselect (R)' and 'Guardiane (R) SC-17' were the most vigorous; and 'Adesoto 101', 'Julior', 'Jaspi', 'Mr.S. 2/5', 'K146-43', 'VVA-1' and 'VSV-1' were the most dwarfing rootstocks. Plum rootstocks 'Julior', 'Jaspi', 'Adesoto 101', 'Mr.S. 2/5', 'VSV-1' and 'VVA-1' had significant root suckering. Mortality was high for 'Adesoto 101' and 'Jaspi'. Many 'Cadamano (R)' trees died of unknown causes by 2005. Within cultivars, there was a 1-2 days range in bloom date and a 4-5 days range in maturity date among rootstocks. Trees on 'Penta', 'Julior' and 'Adesoto 101' bloomed earliest, and trees on 'Cadamano' bloomed last. 'Redhaven' fruit from trees on 'Mr.S.' 2/5, 'Adesoto 101', 'VSV-1' and 'VVA-1' rootstocks matured earliest, 4-5 days before 'Lovell'. No rootstock produced fruit significantly larger than those on 'Lovell'. Trees on 'Mr.S. 2/5' and 'Jaspi' produced the smallest fruit. Trees on 'Cadamano (R)', 'SLAP', 'SC-17', 'Bailey' and 'Lovell' had the highest fruit yields, while those on 'Julior', 'Jaspi', 'Mr.S. 2/5', 'VSV-1' and 'VVA-1' had the lowest. Trees on 'Bailey' had the highest cumulative yield efficiency. Most dwarfing rootstocks except 'VSV-1' had low yield efficiencies. At the Sandhills trial, which was on a severe bacterial canker replant site, all trees on 'Adesoto 101', 'Monegro', and 'VVA-1', and most trees on 'K146-43' died as a result of bacterial canker. 'Lovell', 'Mr.S. 2/5' and 'Pumiselect (R)' were the only rootstocks with 100% survival in 2005.

Increasing environmental concerns and legislation in the Unites States and other countries require that we take a more comprehensive approach to improving and integrating cultural best management practices, since these operations are typically intensive users of resources which are applied to relatively small land areas. The website (http://www.waternut.org) provides the general public with an overview of the project and a link to the knowledge center (http://www.waternut.org/moodle/), which provides access to more than twenty intensive learning modules over the internet, within a Moodle learning management framework. These learning modules have been designed to actively engage learners in topics on substrate, irrigation, surface water, nutrient and pathogen management, which are integral to formulating farm-specific strategies for effective water and nutrient management. Additionally, tools such as irrigation audits and water and nutrient management planning are covered in specific modules. Over fifty regulatory agency, industry and education professionals have been active in the developmental review of these resources, through face-to-face workshops and on-line reviews of content. By providing on-line access to in-depth learning modules though this knowledge center, we intend to reach out to many different audiences, to a comprehensive informational resource of best management practices, to increase the efficiency of resources used by commercial ornamental operations.

Studies of this interaction at the molecular level require the production and purification of quantities of the 3 genomic and 1 subgenomic RNAs of each virus. Standard viral purification procedures and procedures used to extract RNA frequently yield less than the needed amount of material thus making some areas of experimentation difficult to complete. As a preliminary to examining the roles of these 4 RNAs in the disease at the molecular level, we have inserted full-length cDNA copies of each RNA molecule of PNRSV, together with an upstream T7 promoter, into the plasmid pUC 19. Transcription of plasmids linearized with Small yields full length RNA copies of the 3 genomic and I subgenomic RNAs. Results of initial studies on the infectivity of these copies plus additional information concerning attempts to create infectious cDNA clones of the virus are presented.					20th International Symposium on Virus and Virus-Like Diseases of Temperate Fruit Crops20th International Symposium on Virus and Virus-Like Diseases of Temperate Fruit Crops	MAY 22-26, 2006MAY 22-26, 2006	TUBITAK; Ankara Univ, Biotechnol Inst; Turkish Phytopathol Soc; Bioreba; Loewe; Durviz; Apricot Agr Sale Cooperat Union; Parlakyildiz Daphne Soap Co; TeknopolTUBITAK; Ankara Univ, Biotechnol Inst; Turkish Phytopathol Soc; Bioreba; Loewe; Durviz; Apricot Agr Sale Cooperat Union; Parlakyildiz Daphne Soap Co; Teknopol	Antalya, TURKEYAntalya, TURKEY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-6605-080-8	WOS:000256218900004

To investigate the role of 3 viruses and Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd) in a graft-transmissible bloom delay observed in peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch), trees of 'Springprince' were planted in a high-density, Y-trained orchard system and inoculated using chipbuds containing Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV), PLMVd, Cherry green ring mottle virus (CGRMV) and an uncharacterized Foveavirus referred to as Asian prunus virus (APV) alone or in various combinations. DASI-ELISA, dot-blot hybridization and RT-PCR systems were used to verify transmission of these infectious agents from the chipbuds to the 'Springprince' trees. Three replicates of 4-tree plots for each of 11 defined mixtures of viruses and viroid treatments were established. Phenological developments including leaf abscission, fruit set and flowering time were monitored to compare the effects of defined multiple and single inoculations. In addition, horticultural characters such as trunk cross-sectional area, fruit weight and tree yields were recorded. Mixed virus and/or viroid combinations resulted in accelerated bloom progression, increased fruit set and greater fruiting efficiency.					20th International Symposium on Virus and Virus-Like Diseases of Temperate Fruit Crops20th International Symposium on Virus and Virus-Like Diseases of Temperate Fruit Crops	MAY 22-26, 2006MAY 22-26, 2006	TUBITAK; Ankara Univ, Biotechnol Inst; Turkish Phytopathol Soc; Bioreba; Loewe; Durviz; Apricot Agr Sale Cooperat Union; Parlakyildiz Daphne Soap Co; TeknopolTUBITAK; Ankara Univ, Biotechnol Inst; Turkish Phytopathol Soc; Bioreba; Loewe; Durviz; Apricot Agr Sale Cooperat Union; Parlakyildiz Daphne Soap Co; Teknopol	Antalya, TURKEYAntalya, TURKEY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-6605-080-8	WOS:000256218900079

Trees were trained to a central leader system. Data recorded through 2006 included trunk. circumference, tree survival, fire blight incidence, full bloom date, fruit maturity date, fruit size, and fruit yield. 'Hosui', 'Ya LF and 'Shin Li' were the most vigorous cultivars. 'Shinko' was the least vigorous. Mean full bloom dates among cultivars varied by 11 days. 'Ya Li' consistently bloomed earliest, whereas 'Olympic' and 'Shinko' bloomed latest. Fruit maturity dates were distinct among cultivars. Ripening times progressed from first 'Hosui' followed by 'Niitaka', 'Atago', 'Shinko', 'Olympic' and then last with 'Shin Li' and 'Ya Li', which both ripened similar to 39 days after 'Hosui'. Cumulative fruit yields per tree among cultivars were significantly different only between 'Shin Li' (673 kg) and both 'Hosui' (460 kg) and 'Ya Li' (449 kg). However, these same cultivars also differed significantly in fruit size. 'Shin LF had the largest mean fruit weight (408 g); whereas 'Hosui' (250 g), 'Shinko' (224 g) and 'Ya Li' (206 g) the smallest. The other cultivars were statistically similar with mean fruit weights from 352 to 389 g. Cumulative yield efficiency (kg/cm(2)) was significantly different among cultivars with 'Atago' (4.16) being more than twice as yield efficient as 'Hosui' (1.87). 'Shinko' (3.48) was also yield efficient, whereas 'Ya Li' (2.29) was not. Some alternate bearing occurred and was most pronounced in 'Ya Li'. In addition, 'Ya Li' was less precocious in fruiting than the other cultivars and was more prone to yield losses due to frosts. Fire blight strikes occurred in most trees during the trial, but 'Shinko' had few fire blight strikes, while the majority of 'Ya Li' trees were infected and eventually killed despite a spray program.					10th International Pear Symposium10th International Pear Symposium	MAY 22-26, 2007MAY 22-26, 2007	ISHS Sect Pome & Stone Fruits; ISHS WG European & Asian Pears; Camara Municipal Obidos; Camara Municipal Terres Vedras; Camara Municipal Bombarral; Camara Municipal Caldas Rainha; Camara Municipal Alcobaca; Camara Municipal Peniche; Camara Municipal Cadaval; Reg Turismo Oeste; MCTES, Fund Cien Tecnol; Programa AGRO; Bayer CropSci - Emeritus Sponsor; MAFRoda; Credito Agricola; Adubos Deiba; Pessl Instrument Metos; Coopval; Unirocha; Revista Fruits Legumes e FloresISHS Sect Pome & Stone Fruits; ISHS WG European & Asian Pears; Camara Municipal Obidos; Camara Municipal Terres Vedras; Camara Municipal Bombarral; Camara Municipal Caldas Rainha; Camara Municipal Alcobaca; Camara Municipal Peniche; Camara Municipal Cadaval; Reg Turismo Oeste; MCTES, Fund Cien Tecnol; Programa AGRO; Bayer CropSci - Emeritus Sponsor; MAFRoda; Credito Agricola; Adubos Deiba; Pessl Instrument Metos; Coopval; Unirocha; Revista Fruits Legumes e Flores	Peniche, PORTUGALPeniche, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-6605-611-4	WOS:000262964600038

Given evolution toward ecosystem management, rights-based management, and international ocean governance, is the current supply of fishery managers capable of meeting the demand for effective and sustainable 21st century fishery management? The international initiative Training Managers for 21st Century Fisheries addresses these challenges. The initiative was first conceived in Queenstown, New Zealand, in December 2001, when 63 government, industry, academic, and nongovernmental organization leaders from Oceania, North America and Europe discussed the challenges for fishery management. Workshop participants defined the training, education, and professional working environments necessary to produce fishery managers who are problem solvers, leaders, and innovators. They also produced a collective vision and a comprehensive list of skill and knowledge requirements. Participant consensus produced the following eight priority strategies for developing training capacity at international, national, and regional levels 1) develop creative partnerships within and among institutions, sectors, and nations; 2) include the management process as a learning experience; 3) broaden and lengthen career paths; 4) identify the gaps between training supply and demand; 5) create a Web site that shares information about training opportunities and resources; 1) encourage industry scholarships; 7) develop a case study library; and 8) establish a network of training providers. The workshop concluded with establishing an international steering committee charged with facilitating implementation of these strategies and guiding the initiative. To progress the global initiative, steering committee members have begun fostering partnerships and communications with other training efforts and are initiating training in case study teaching methods. The intended outcome of this global initiative is a coordinated international fisheries management training framework that supports integration, partnership, cooperation, and exchange.

This is troubling given considerable evidence of TS program benefits associated with regular weekly attendance and ubiquitous reliance by treatment professionals on these programs to provide important support services. This chapter reviews and advances theory of TS utilization and dose that is supported by prior research, multi-variate models, and scales that predict risk of TS meeting underutilization. Advancing theory should organize and clarify the process of initial utilization, guide intervention development, and improve adherence of TS program referrals, all of which should lead to improved treatment planning and better outcomes. Three theories are integrated to explain processes that may influence TS program dose: the health belief model, self-determination theory (motivational theory), and a person-in-organization cultural fit theory. Four multidimensional scales developed specifically to predict participation are described. Implications for practice and future research are considered in a final discussion. Information contained in this chapter raises awareness of the need for TS-focused treatments to focus on achieving weekly attendance during and after treatment.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0738-422X		978-0-387-77724-5	WOS:000268129200016	19115775

Analyst behavior following IPOs: The "Bubble Period" evidence								REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES				21	1			101	133		10.1093/rfs/hhl028			JAN 2008	2008	We examine over 7400 analyst recommendations made in the year after going public for IPOs from 1999 to 2000. Initiations of coverage at the end of the quiet period come almost exclusively from affiliated analysts, whereas initiations afterward are predominantly from unaffiliated analysts. Contrary to previous findings, we find no evidence that the market discounts recommendations from affiliated analysts once we control for recommendation characteristics and timing. Moreover, analyst coverage in the first year is not affected by underpricing, and after the flurry of initiations at the end of the quiet period, the number of analysts covering a firm during the following 11 months is unrelated to the number of managing underwriters.

Using this method, islands of varying size can be created and placed in close proximity, increasing the probability of initiating and observing coalescence events. Data obtained from crash initiated events on a Ag(111) surface are presented. Relaxation time exponents extracted from these data confirm that our method gives results consistent with previous, sputter-obtained island coalescence studies. We also describe an instrument-control routine developed for these measurements that utilizes commercial imaging and off-the-shelf automation software to automate the tracking of islands or other features by the microscope.

In experiments on ripple formation and dynamics under variable flow intensity bimodal sediment mixture was used. To explain the results of observations, the model for homogeneous sands (Testik et al. 2005a) was extended to the case of bimodal sediment and verified experimentally. In experiments on ripple degradation, as a first step, homogenous sediment was used. In these experiments established sand ripples were subjected either to weak oscillatory flow, which was below the threshold for ripple formation, or to background turbulence, which was generated by an oscillating grid. In both cases the ripple degradation (decrease of ripple height) was observed and documented. To explain the results on ripple degradation, a diffusion model (Hay 2006a, b) was applied and experimental data were quantified in terms of the ripple effective diffusion coefficient. Some comparisons with available field measurements are given.					5th IAHR Symposium on River, Coastal and Estuarine Morphodynamics5th IAHR Symposium on River, Coastal and Estuarine Morphodynamics	SEP 17-21, 2007SEP 17-21, 2007	IAHRIAHR	Univ Twente, Enschede, NETHERLANDSUniv Twente, Enschede, NETHERLANDS	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-415-45363-9	WOS:000252235800048

This paper proposes a new Lighting model, adapted from a model previously used to light convective clouds and other participating media, together with a distribution of ray processing across multiple GPUs, in order to achieve these global illumination effects while maintaining near real-time performance. The lighting model is based on a lattice-Boltzmarm method in which reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance parameters are taken from measurements of real plants. The Lighting model is solved as a pre-processing step and requires only seconds on a single GPU. The ray tracing engine uses the well-known short-stack algorithm, due to Horn, Sugerman, Houston, and Hanrahan. Both the pre-processing step and the ray tracing engine make extensive use of NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA).

Fast rotating structures are commonly found in mechanical, transportation and energy systems, and the challenges of using wireless sensors on such structures have not been adequately addressed. For wireless sensors on rotating structures, it has been found there is an eminent dependency of packet error rates on rotation speeds, bursty bit errors, periodic variation in received signal strengths, and dominance of multipath effects. Previously, a reliable data transmission approach was developed to recover transmission errors, and it was found that transmission errors have mostly occurred in certain higherror regions. The objective of this study is to utilize the transmission approach to infer the transmission error pattern of such regions. The paper presents a sliding window algorithm for estimating the error region width, and a transmission simulator for studying dependencies among error burst statistics, error region distribution and widths, and accuracy of the rotation speeds. It is concluded that i) the number, width, and distribution of error regions can be inferred from normalized error burst distance distributions, ii) the error burst distance distributions depend sensitively on accuracy of the rotation speed, and iii) the error in speed can be inferred from the error burst distance distributions. The conclusions directly guide future work on transmission error modeling, on-line error pattern inference, and error-avoidant transmission methods for radios on rotating structures.

Additionally, the leaching behavior of (233)U(VI) from boehmite was examined as a function of pH and HEDPA concentration. The results are discussed in terms of sludge washing procedures that may be utilized during underground tank waste remediation. In the pH range 4 to 10, complexation of Al(III) by HEDPA significantly enhanced dissolution of boehmite. This phenomenon was especially pronounced in the neutral pH region where the solubility of aluminum, in the absence of complexants, is limited by the formation of sparsely soluble aluminum hydroxides. At pH higher than 10, the dissolution of synthetic boehmite was inhibited by HEDPA, likely due to sorption of Al(III):HEDPA complexes. The addition of HEDPA to equilibrated U(VI)-synthetic boehmite suspensions yielded an increase in the aqueous phase uranium concentration. Partitioning of uranium between the solid and aqueous phase is described in terms of U(VI):HEDPA speciation and dissolution of the boehmite solid phase.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0149-6395			WOS:000260210100002

The mechanical response of sand under high deformation-rate conditions has been represented using the modified compaction material model developed in our recent work [1]. While the mechanical response of the other attendant materials (air, gaseous-detonation products and AISI 1006 mild steel) is accounted for using the material models available in literature. The results obtained (specifically, the temporal evolution of the sand overburden shape and pressure at various locations in air above the detonation site) were compared with their experimental counterparts for a (50wt%-sand/50wt.%-clay) soil obtained recently by Foedinger [2]. The comparison revealed that the modified compaction material model for sand can account reasonably well for the magnitude, spatial distribution and the temporal evolution of the dynamic loads accompanying detonation of shallow-buried mines in soils with various clay and water contents.									14	0	0	0	0	14			1070-9622			WOS:000252949900007

In this paper we investigate DG-DG and DG-MFE domain decomposition couplings using mortar finite elements to impose weak continuity of fluxes and pressures on the interface. The subdomain grids need not match, and the mortar grid may be much coarser, giving a two-scale method. Convergence results in terms of the. ne subdomain scale h and the coarse mortar scale H are established for both types of couplings. In addition, a nonoverlapping parallel domain decomposition algorithm is developed, which reduces the coupled system to an interface mortar problem. The properties of the interface operator are analyzed.									29	1	0	0	0	29			0036-1429	1095-7170		WOS:000253815100016

Planning for workforce succession among National Park Service advanced-level natural resource program managers: A gap analysis								SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES				21	1			50	62		10.1080/08941920701329694			2008	2008	Most natural resource management agencies will suffer a loss of the skills, knowledge, and institutional memory embodied in their most experienced employees as advanced-level managers retire. Knowledge of job deficiencies of employees scheduled to move into positions of pending retirees is essential for training and workforce succession management. This article provides guidance about workforce succession by analyzing perceived training competency/needs of National Park Service resource management professionals. A gap analysis was used to analyze perceived differences in preparation for and importance of specific competencies for advanced-level job classifications (GS-12 grades and above). Results indicated that Program Managers (n = 117) reported "large gaps'' or deficiencies in training for 18 out of 34 competencies measured. There were also significant differences (p <= .05) between the perceived gaps of three age cohorts, with the cohort group most likely to succeed retirees the most deficient. Five training modules are suggested to address these job competency needs.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0894-1920			WOS:000251676300004		
J	Oh, Chi-Ok; Ditton, Robert B.; Stoll, John R.								The economic value of scuba-diving use of natural and artificial reef habitats								SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES				21	6			455	468		10.1080/08941920701681953			2008	2008	Artificial reefs may attract and sustain fish populations, but whether they resemble natural reefs is open to conjecture. This article addresses the question of whether artificial reefs are functionally acceptable to scuba divers. Research objectives were (1) to identify the nonmarket value of recreational scuba diving in offshore marine waters and (2) to ascertain whether the willingness to pay for scuba diving varied between users of natural and artificial reef habitats. A random sample of 1,059 scuba divers was used to estimate consumer's surplus associated with the diving experience. While natural and artificial habitats provide substantial economic value associated with diving, results indicate divers using natural reef habitats value their diving experience significantly more highly than those using artificial reef habitats. Also, substantial value from recreational diving use of artificial reefs suggests they serve as potential substitutes and thus may alleviate pressures on natural reef areas for conservation purposes.									10	0	0	7	1	11			0894-1920			WOS:000257069800001

For this discussion, we selected two types of recently introduced surface layers: binary brush layers with variable chemical composition forming a controllable gradient of composition and properties in a selected direction and brush layers either grafted directly to inorganic nanoparticles to form hybrid core-shell structures or combined with inorganic nanoparticles embedded into this layer. Unlike traditional brush layers, such a design brings a novel set of responsive surface properties allowing for capillary-driven microfluidic motion, combinatorial-like multiplexing response, reversible aggregation and dis-assembly of nanoparticles, fabrication of ultrahydrophobic coatings, and switchable mass transport across interfaces.									170	2	0	12	0	171			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000254386800008

Low grafting temperatures were achieved via solvent-assisted grafting and allowed the use of the developed approach for surface templating in a variety of ways. Specifically, two examples of the patterning are discussed. A poly-2-vinylpyridine, P2VP surface pattern was created by a combination of capillary force lithography and the solvent-assisted grafting. Silver nanoparticle arrays were created and transferred into a silicon matrix employing the P2VP pattern. Solvent-assisted grafting was also a suitable technique for manipulating thermolabile objects, e. g. proteins. Protein molecules were imprinted via the grafting. Rebinding experiments showed preferential protein adsorption onto the imprinted surface relative to a non-imprinted control sample.									25	0	0	3	0	25			1744-683X			WOS:000261733100014

The Journal of health administration education				25	3			191	211					2008	2008	Global warming, the depletion of the world'snatural resources, and excessive consumer consumption in developed countries are determinants reshaping the way we live our everyday lives. These factors are rapidly giving rise to new ecological paradigms of environmental stewardship and in healthcare environments that express sustainable theories and practices. This has given rise to a systematic system for promoting and assessing the energy performance and efficiency of healthcare facilities known as Leadership in Energy Efficient Environmental Design (LEED), and a parallel certification program, the Green Guide for Heath Care. These developments are examined in direct relation to the functions of managerial ethics. A series of ten sustainability-based ethical dilemmas are presented. Each is examined in relation to the need to inculcate in future healthcare administrators a critical understanding and appreciation of the need to reposition contemporary healthcare organizations at the center--as leading civic participants and role models in relation to the emerging movement towards carbon neutrality in the healthcare industry.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0735-6722			MEDLINE:19655628	19655628

Solvothermal syntheses of nano-engineered CoSb3 skutterudite have been studied in the present work in which CoCl2 and SbCl3 were used as precursors and NaBH4 as a reductant. Elemental, structural and morphology characterization techniques including: XRD, SEM, TEM and EDAX were used to identify and characterize the products. NaBH4 was found to be a necessary factor in forming cobalt antimonide. It was detected the products' phase transited from Sb2Co to CoSb3 in conjunction with the amount increase of NaBH4. The change of synthesis time and temperature contributed little on the products' phases under the present experimental routes. Single-phased CoSb3 skutterudites was obtained from the solvothermal syntheses combined with an acid wash. The as-prepared CoSb3 powders consist of irregular nanoparticles with 15 similar to 20 nm in size. A possible chemical mechanism was also discussed.					8th Symposium on Themoelectric Power Generation held 2007 MRS Fall Meeting8th Symposium on Themoelectric Power Generation held 2007 MRS Fall Meeting	NOV 26-29, 2007NOV 26-29, 2007	Mat Res SocMat Res Soc	Boston, MABoston, MA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-9172		978-1-55899-987-9	WOS:000258399500001

An immediate question arises as to whether one can fabricate a thermoelectrically favorable grain boundary?In this paper we present a proof-of-principle grain boundary engineering study in the pulverized p-Bi2Te3 system. Utilizing the lately developed hydrothermal nano-coating technique, we fabricated an Alkali-metal(s)-containing surface layer with few tens of nm thick on the p-Bi2Te3 bulk reference grain, where it becomes part of the grain boundary upon hotpressing densification. The electrical resistivity, thermopower, thermal conductivity and Hall coefficient measurements constitute solid evidence that this heterogeneous layer helps decouple the otherwise inter-related resistivity, thermopower and thermal conductivity. To optimize the figure of merit ZT, we carefully varied the ratio between Na, K and Rb concentrations. It was found that the sample treated in the solution with Na/Rb =1:2 achieved a ZT comparable with that of the commercial ingot; in the mean time, the compatibility factor and robustness of device were considerably improved. In principle this technique can be applied to other existing polycrystalline thermoelectric materials as a new "tuning knob".					8th Symposium on Themoelectric Power Generation held 2007 MRS Fall Meeting8th Symposium on Themoelectric Power Generation held 2007 MRS Fall Meeting	NOV 26-29, 2007NOV 26-29, 2007	Mat Res SocMat Res Soc	Boston, MABoston, MA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-9172		978-1-55899-987-9	WOS:000258399500003

Theoretical calculations predict that: (i) Semimetallic Bi nanowires exhibit semiconducting nature when their nanowire diameter is below 50 nm, and (ii) Semiconducting Bi nanowires with diameter < 10 nm are expected to have an enhanced figure of merit (ZT > 2), when Z = S-2 sigma/kappa (S: Seebeck coefficient, sigma: electrical conductivity, and kappa is the thermal conductivity). We report the synthesis of similar to 10 nm diameter Bi nanorods using a pulsed laser vaporization method. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy images of our Bi nanorods show (i) crystalline < 012 > planes in the core of the nanorods, and (ii) coated with a thin amorphous Bi2O3 layer. The infrared absorption and the surface plasmon peaks in our Bi nanorods are blue-shifted in energy when compared to the corresponding spectra in bulk Bi.					8th Symposium on Themoelectric Power Generation held 2007 MRS Fall Meeting8th Symposium on Themoelectric Power Generation held 2007 MRS Fall Meeting	NOV 26-29, 2007NOV 26-29, 2007	Mat Res SocMat Res Soc	Boston, MABoston, MA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-9172		978-1-55899-987-9	WOS:000258399500010

The host community can display itself in a chosen manner to visitors, who have the chance to engage in a novel recreational experience while viewing the message put forth by their hosts. An event's message likely is conveyed through its theme and the physical entities and activities undertaken to highlight the theme. While the theme does provide information about an event's message, more information can be gleaned from an investigation of objects and settings (Forster-Hahn, 1995). This distinction posits that the physical environment includes objects (whether animate or inanimate) and settings (or physical spaces) which mutually influence the reception of the other. This chapter describes the utility of the object and setting dichotomy to the understanding of symbolic meanings of an event. Personal construct theory (Kelly, 1955) informs the use of object and setting - the theory proposes that an individual constructs his/her own mental space for use in predicting future events. Two tests applicable with personal construct theory - the repertory grid and the ratings grid - enable the researcher to understand a person's psychological space. This chapter describes both tests and illustrates the use of the ratings grid through a case study. In the case study, respondents rate setting and object components (called elements in personal construct theory) based on a series of adjectives (called constructs) to ascertain symbolic meanings of festival attendance. The chapter concludes by discussing implications of this example and future uses for personal construct theory, the repertory grid and the ratings grid in measuring meanings of specific events or tourist attractions.									1	0	0	0	1	2					978-1-84593-323-4	WOS:000293557400012		
J	Racha, Sujith; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Sarasua, Wayne; Ma, Yongchang								Analysis of work zone traffic behavior for planning applications								TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY				31	2			183	199		10.1080/03081060801948175			2008	2008	Understanding work zone traffic behavior is important for the planning and operation of work zones. The objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical model of work zone traffic flow elements by analyzing the relationships between speed, flow, and density that can be used to estimate the capacity of work zones. Traffic flow data were collected from 22 work zone sites on South Carolina interstate highways. The scatter plots of the collected data demonstrate that the relationship between speed and density does not follow Greenshields' linear model. A non-linear hyperbolic model was developed to describe the relationship between speed and density. Using this model the capacity of a work zone was estimated to be 1550 passenger cars per hour for 2-lane to 1-lane closures. Adjustments to this capacity value to consider other types of vehicle as well as the work zone intensity are provided. Highway agencies can use this estimated capacity along with anticipated traffic demand to schedule work zone operations to avoid long periods of over-saturation.The tapered approach to work zone lane closures used by South Carolina is similar to methods used in work zones throughout the world. The authors believe that the methodology described in this paper for modeling work zone traffic as well as estimating work zone capacity is transferable to other countries. The conversion of actual volumes to passenger car equivalents may have to be modified due to the significant differences in traffic makeup between the United States and other countries.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0308-1060			WOS:000253990900003

Automatic Camera Calibration Using Pattern Detection for Vision-Based Speed Sensing								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2086			30	39		10.3141/2086-04			2008	2008	Vision-based automatic traffic monitoring systems require a calibrated camera to measure the speeds of tracked vehicles. Typically this calibration is done by hand. An automatic technique was developed to calibrate the camera for typical viewpoints on highways using a real-time boosted cascade vehicle detector (BCVD). Image processing is used to estimate the two vanishing points, from which the camera height, focal length, and pan and tilt angles are calculated. The key contribution of the proposed approach is its applicability to a wide variety of environmental conditions. The technique does not rely on background subtraction, nor does it require scene-specific features such as pavement markings. As a result, it is unaffected by the presence of shadows, adverse weather conditions, headlight reflections, lack of ambient light, or spillover caused by low-mounted cameras. Speed estimation within 10% of ground truth is shown for sequences obtained during daylight, nighttime, and rain, and including shadows and severe occlusion.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0361-1981			WOS:000262797600004

Reporting officers were instructed to use the GPS units to determine coordinate location data for recording on the crash report. Some of the problems experienced when trying to geocode 3 years (2004 to 2006) of crash data for use in safety analysis are discussed. Overall, approximately 80% of the crash records were located within reasonable levels of accuracy. Trends in the errors over the 3 years indicate a potential for targeted training to significantly reduce error. Recommendations are provided to help improve the success rate of the geocoding process. These recommendations focus on training officers and data entry personnel, designing data entry filters, and possibly changing the crash report form.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981			WOS:000261532500008

Effect of Wireless Communication and Entertainment Devices on Simulated Driving Performance								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2069			48	54		10.3141/2069-07			2008	2008	An analysis of the effect of wireless telephone communication using text and voice modalities as well as an Apple iPod on lane keeping, speed, speed variability, lateral speed, and lane position variability was conducted with a driving simulator. Participants (young adult licensed drivers) drove in an unusually curvy simulated driving environment while using wireless devices, controlling an iPod, and participating in conversations and word games. As expected on the basis of previous research, lane-keeping performance was robust for voice communication tasks; however, the text messaging and iPod tasks that required significant manual manipulation of the device resulted in significant decrements in lane-keeping performance. In addition, all wireless communication tasks and the iPod task resulted in significant increases in speed variability throughout the driving scenario. Lateral speed increases occurred for all wireless communication tasks other than the cellular phone conversation as well as the iPod task. Increases in lane position variability were observed for the text messaging conditions. In addition to establishing the dramatic performance decrement caused by text messaging tasks, this experiment suggests that driving performance may be affected by distraction in ways not captured by lane-keeping measures alone and explores potential alternative measures of driving performance that may be useful for identifying and quantifying the effects of distracted driving.									15	0	0	6	0	15			0361-1981			WOS:000261993000007

This new map was used to identify quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling date of flowering and number of petals. From a rose bud expressed sequence tag (EST) database of 2,556 unigenes and a rose genomic library, 44 EST-SSRs and 20 genomic-SSR markers were developed, respectively. These new rose SSRs were used to expand genetic maps of the rose interspecific F-1 progeny. In addition, SSRs from other Rosaceae genera were also tested in the mapping progeny. Genetic maps for the two parents of the progeny were constructed using pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. The maps consist of seven linkage groups of 105 markers covering 432 cM for the maternal map and 136 markers covering 438 cM for the paternal map. Homologous relationships among linkage groups between the maternal and paternal maps were established using SSR markers. Loci controlling flowering traits were localised on genetic maps as a major gene and QTL for the number of petals and a QTL for the blooming date.

J	Yandle, Bruce; Rotondi, Joseph A.; Morriss, Andrew P.; Dorchak, Andrew								Bootleggers, Baptists & televangelists: Regulating tobacco by litigation								UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW					4			1225	1284					2008	2008	The "bootleggers and Baptists" public choice theory of regulation explains how durable regulatory bat-gains can arise from the tacit collaboration of a public-interest-minded interest group (the "Baptists") with an economic interest group (the "bootleggers"). Using the history of tobacco regulation, this article extends the bootleggers and Baptists theory of regulation to incorporate the role of policy entrepreneurs like the state attorneys general and private trial lawyers who joined forces to regulate tobacco by litigation. We denominate these actors "televangelists" and demonstrate that they play a pernicious role in regulation.The article begins by showing how tobacco regulation through the 1980s fit the traditional bootleggers and Baptists public choice model. It then explores the circumstances that made it possible for the emergence of the televangelists as a regulatory partner that the bootleggers would prefer. The article then criticizes televangelistbootlegger bargains as likely to result in substantial wealth transfers from large, unorganized groups to the coalition partners. It also shows how televangelist-bootlegger coalitions are more pernicious than bootlegger-Baptist coalitions. Finally, it concludes with suggestions for how to make televangelist-bootlegger coalitions less durable.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0276-9948			WOS:000259267000003

These benchmarks support assessment of verification tools and techniques to prove total correctness of functionality of sequential object-based and object-oriented software. The problems are designed to help evaluate the state-of-the-art and the pace of progress toward verified software in the near term, and in this sense, they are just the beginning. They will allow researchers to illustrate and explain how proposed tools and techniques deal with known pitfalls and well-understood issues, as well as how they can be used to discover and attack new ones. Unlike currently available benchmarks based on "real-world" software systems, the proposed challenge problems are expected to be amenable to "push-button" verification that leverages current technology.					2nd Working Conference on Verified Software - Theories, Tools and Experiments (VSTTE 2008)2nd Working Conference on Verified Software - Theories, Tools and Experiments (VSTTE 2008)	OCT 06-09, 2008OCT 06-09, 2008	Microsoft ResMicrosoft Res	Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	9	0	0	0	0	9			0302-9743		978-3-540-87872-8	WOS:000260433600006		
S	Kuehn, Thomas						Kelly, HA		FIDEICOMMISSUM AND FAMILY: THE ORSINI DI BRACCIANO								VIATOR: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES, VOL 39, NO 2		Viator-Medieval and Renaissance Studies		39	2			323	341					2008	2008	The legal key to the survival and fortunes of the line of the Orsini di Bracciano was the fideicommissum (substitution of heirs and stipulation to keep property in the Orsini lineage) worked out by the brothers Napoleone and Roberto in 1477. Such fideicommissa were popular inheritance devices for nobles and patricians throughout much of Italy. For the Orsini, across the next century the fideicommissum would function at moments of inheritance but also on judicial occasions to funnel property through and to Orsini hands, despite the challenges that arose from both within and outside the lineage. It served them well and essentially preserved the family. In an important sense the fideicommissum was the Orsini di Bracciano.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0083-5897		978-2-503-52783-3	WOS:000260692700014

The bounds are illustrated by considering a system using convolutional encoding. The bounds are closed-form expressions in terms of the code's transfer function. They are shown to be tighter than previously developed closed-form bounds for communications in correlated Rayleigh fading.

Many solutions appropriate for one environment could and/or should be similarly applicable to the other Common technologies do sometimes appear in the two application areas, but the two technical communities may not regularly collaborate in synergy. Appreciation of situational similarities can increase support for technology development and accelerate application acceptance. This talk will first compare and contrast factory and automotive environments and requirements. A technology life cycle comparison and example will then illustrate how coordinated development can be very synergistic.

J	Ding, Huiling								The use of cognitive and social apprenticeship to teach a disciplinary genre - Initiation of graduate students into NIH grant writing								WRITTEN COMMUNICATION				25	1			3	52		10.1177/0741088307308660			JAN 2008	2008	This study reports about a yearlong study of the initiation of novice grant writers to the activity system of National Institutes of Health grant applications. It investigates the use of cognitive apprenticeship within writing classrooms and that of social apprenticeship in laboratories, programs, departments, and universities, which introduced students to the genre system of National Institutes of Health grant proposals and helped them in moving from peripheral participation to more central participation. While cognitive apprenticeship employs devices such as modeling, scaffolding, coaching, and collaboration to enhance learning in formal settings, social apprenticeship requires socialization, interaction, and collaboration with experts, colleagues, and-peers in informal settings to acquire disciplinary knowledge and experiences. The study suggests that writing instructors should acknowledge and incorporate resources in other activity systems in which students participate, i.e., their laboratories and home departments, and teach genre systems rather than specific genres to better facilitate students' enculturation to activity systems of disciplinary discourse communities.									21	0	0	1	0	21			0741-0883			WOS:000251888500001

In this work, we report on the rheology and processing of two bio-based polymers, namely poly-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA) copolymers and poly-lactic acid (PLA), and their blends. These materials are derived from renewable resources, and can degrade under the appropriate conditions. The rheology is investigated in shear, elongation, and transient modes. Of particular importance is the degradation of these materials at typical processing conditions, and the impact of polymer architecture on the extensional properties. Using results from these rheological investigations, appropriate thermal and flow conditions are employed in a DSM Xplore microcompounder, with the cast film attachment, to produce films of PHA copolymers blended with PLA. The resultant films are characterized, as a function of both material composition and processing history, using DSC, WAXD, tensile testing, and SEM, to investigate the effect of varying PHA content on the final properties.					15th International Congress on Rheology/80th Annual Meeting of the Society-of-Rheology15th International Congress on Rheology/80th Annual Meeting of the Society-of-Rheology	AUG 03-08, 2008AUG 03-08, 2008	Soc RheolSoc Rheol	Monterey, CAMonterey, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0549-3	WOS:000257623000038		
J	Cediel, Roberto A.; Blob, Richard W.; Schrank, Gordon D.; Plourde, Robert C.; Schoenfuss, Heiko L.								Muscle fiber type distribution in climbing Hawaiian gobioid fishes: Ontogeny and correlations with locomotor performance								ZOOLOGY				111	2			114	122		10.1016/j.zool.2007.06.004			2008	2008	Three species of Hawaiian amphidromous gobioid fishes are remarkable in their ability to climb waterfalls up to several hundred meters tall. Juvenile Lentipes concolor and Awaous guamensis climb using rapid bursts of axial undulation, whereas juvenile Sicyopterus stimpsoni climb using much slower movements, alternately attaching oral and pelvic sucking disks to the substrate during prolonged bouts of several cycles. Based on these differing climbing styles, we hypothesized that propulsive musculature in juvenile L. concolor and A. guamensis would be dominated by white muscle fibers, whereas S. stimpsoni would exhibit a greater proportion of red muscle fibers than other climbing species. We further predicted that, because adults of these species shift from climbing to burst swimming as their main locomotor behavior, muscle from adult fish of all three species would be dominated by white fibers. To test these hypotheses, we used ATPase assays to evaluate muscle fiber type distribution in Hawaiian climbing gobies for three anatomical regions (midbody, anal, and tail). Axial musculature was dominated by white muscle fibers in juveniles of all three species.. but juvenile S. stimpsoni had a significantly greater proportion of red fibers than the other two species. Fiber type proportions of adult fishes did not differ significantly from those of juveniles. Thus, muscle fiber type proportions in juveniles appear to help accommodate differences in locomotor demands among these species, indicating that they overcome the common challenge of waterfall climbing through both diverse behaviors and physiological specializations.

J	Shah, Sagar R.; DesJardins, John D.; Blob, Richard W.								Antler stiffness in caribou (Rangifer tarandus): Testing variation in bone material properties between males and females								ZOOLOGY				111	6			476	482		10.1016/j.zool.2007.12.001			2008	2008	Vertebrate bones, including deer antler, often exhibit variation in their mechanical properties that corresponds to differences in the functional demands they encounter. Among deer antlers are found in both males and females only in caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Several differences between male and female R. tarandus in behavior and physiology might subject their antlers to differing demands, potentially making divergence of antler material properties between the sexes advantageous. Alternatively, antler material properties might not differ between male and female R. tarandus because both sexes are members of the same species, and the properties of their antlers could, therefore, have emerged under similar pressure and constraints through evolution. To test for sexual dimorphism in antler material properties, we compared the stiffness (Young's modulus of elasticity) of antler specimens from male and female caribou using three-point bending tests. Despite behavioral and physiological differences between males and females, stiffness values did not differ significantly between the sexes in caribou with a mean (+/- S.E.) stiffness of 5.8 +/- 0.4 GPa across all specimens. This value differed by less than 10% from the values published for R. tarandus specimens of unknown sex verifying the comparability of bone material property data collected across multiple studies, and lending confidence to recent analyses of the evolution of antler stiffness in deer that have drawn on literature data.
