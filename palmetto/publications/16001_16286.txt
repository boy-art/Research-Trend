J	Chong, Juang-Horng; Oetting, Ronald D.								Intraguild predation and interference by the mealybug predator Cryptolalemus montrouzieri on the parasitoid Leptomastix dactylopii								BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				17	9-10			933	944		10.1080/09583150701596305			2007	2007	The compatibility of the encyrtid parasitoid Leptomastix dactylopii with the coccinellid beetle Cryptolaemus montrouzieri against the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri, is determined by the extent of intraguild predation and interference by the predator. We tested the preference of the adults and fourth-instar larvae of C. montrouzieri for healthy mealybugs and parasitized mealybugs harboring 1-, 4-, 7- and 14-day-old parasitoid larvae. The experiments were conducted in no-choice (only unparasitized mealybugs or parasitized mealybugs of one parasitoid age were offered at one time) and choice (unparasitized and parasitized mealybugs of a specific age were offered simultaneously) tests. Both the adults and larvae of C. montrouzieri fed on unparasitized and parasitized mealybugs but strongly discriminated against the hardened mummies (14 days old). We also investigated the influence of the presence of C. montrouzieri to the foraging effectiveness of L. dactylopii. The level of parasitism by L. dactylopii was reduced from about 13 to 6% when the number of the C. montrouzieri was increased from zero to four. We recommended that the releases of C. montrouzieri should be conducted 14 days after the releases of L. dactylopii to reduce intraguild predation on the parasitized mealybugs and to avoid interference with the foraging parasitoids.									12	0	0	12	1	13			0958-3157			WOS:000252250700003

Effects of prescribed fire and fire surrogates on floral visiting insects of the blue ridge province in North Carolina								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				134	3			393	404		10.1016/j.biocon.2006.08.029			JAN 2007	2007	Pollination by insects in forests is an extremely important process that should be conserved. Not only do pollinating insects help to maintain a diversity of plants within forests, but they also aid in pollinating crops found near forested land. Currently, the effects of various forest management practices on floral visiting insect abundance or diversity is unknown, so we investigated how prescribed burning, mechanical shrub control, and combination of the two affected abundance of floral visiting insects. We caught 7921 floral visitors from four orders and 21 families. Hymenoptera was the most abundant and diverse order, with Halictidae being the most abundant family A total of 45 species of Hymenoptera representing six families were captured. We caught seven families and 35 species of Lepidoptera, six families and 33 species of Coleoptera, and two families and 13 species of Diptera. Most floral visitors were captured in the mechanical shrub control plus prescribed burn treatments, while lower numbers were caught on the mechanical shrub control only, prescribed burn only and control treatments. Overall species richness was also higher on mechanical plus burn treatments. Total pollinator abundance and the abundance of most orders and families was correlated with decreased tree basal area and increased percent herbaceous plant cover. Our study shows that floral visitors increased in abundance and species richness most from forest disturbance that reduced the density of overstory trees and increased the amount of herbaceous plant growth.

Glycosaminoglycan-targeted fixation for improved bioprosthetic heart valve stabilization								BIOMATERIALS				28	3			496	503		10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.09.005			JAN 2007	2007	Numerous crosslinking chemistries and methodologies have been investigated as alternative fixatives to glutaraldehyde (GLUT) for the stabilization of bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs). Particular attention has been paid to valve leaflet collagen and elastin stability following fixation. However, the stability of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), the primary component of the spongiosa layer of the BHV, has been largely overlooked despite recent evidence provided by our group illustrating their structural and functional importance. In the present study we investigate the ability of two different crosslinking chemistries: sodium metaperiodate (NaIO4) followed by GLUT (PG) and 1-Ethyl-3-(3 dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) followed by GLUT (ENG) to stabilize GAGs within BHV leaflets and compare resulting leaflet characteristics with that of GLUT-treated tissue. Incubation of fixed leaflets in GAG-degrading enzymes illustrated in vitro resistance of GAGs towards degradation in PG and ENG treated tissue while GLUT fixation alone was not effective in preventing GAG loss from BHV leaflets. Following subdermal implantation, significant amounts of GAGs were retained in leaflets in the ENG group in comparison to GLUT-treated tissue, although GAG loss was evident in all groups. Utilizing GAG-targeted fixation did not alter calcification potential of the leaflets while collagen stability was maintained at levels similar to that observed in conventional GLUT-treated tissue.

Convection and diffusion in charged hydrated soft tissues: a mixture theory approach								BIOMECHANICS AND MODELING IN MECHANOBIOLOGY				6	1-2			63	72		10.1007/s10237-006-0040-3			JAN 2007	2007	The extracellular matrix of cartilage is a charged porous fibrous material. Transport phenomena in such a medium are very complex. In this study, solute diffusive flux and convective flux in porous fibrous media were investigated using a continuum mixture theory approach. The intrinsic diffusion coefficient of solute in the mixture was defined and its relation to drag coefficients was presented. The effect of mechanical loading on solute diffusion in cartilage under unconfined compression with a frictionless boundary condition was analyzed numerically using the model developed. Both strain-dependent hydraulic permeability and diffusivity were considered. Analyses and results show that (1) In porous media, the convective velocity for each solute phase is different. (2) The solute convection in tissue is governed by the relative convective velocity (i.e., relative to solid velocity). (3) Under the assumption that all the frictional interactions among solutes are negligible, the relative convective velocity for alpha-solute phase is equal to the relative solvent velocity multiplied by its convective coefficient (H-alpha) which is also known as the hindrance factor in the literature. The relationship between the convective coefficient and the relative diffusivity of solute is presented. (4) Solute concentration profile within the cartilage sample depends on the phase of dynamic compression.									17	1	0	11	0	17			1617-7959			WOS:000243873500008	16767452

Adding high carbon content of waste paper in algal sludge feedstock to have a balanced C/N ratio was undertaken in this study. The results showed adding 50% (based on volatile solid) of waste paper in algal sludge feedstock increased the methane production rate to 1170 +/- 75 ml/l day, as compared to 573 +/- 28 ml/l day of algal sludge digestion alone, both operated at 4 g VS/l day, 35 degrees C and 10 days HRT. The maximum methane production rate of 1607 +/- 17 ml/l day was observed at a combined 5 g VS/l day loading rate with 60% (VS based) of paper adding in algal sludge feedstock. Results suggested an optimum C/N ratio for co-digestion of algal sludge and waste paper was in the range of 20-25/l. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lawson, Brian R; Belkowski, Stanley M; Whitesides, John F; Davis, Paul; Lawson, John W								Immunomodulation of murine collagen-induced arthritis by N, N-dimethylglycine and a preparation of Perna canaliculus.								BMC complementary and alternative medicine				7				20	20		10.1186/1472-6882-7-20			2007 Jun 11	2007	BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its accepted animal model, murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), are classic autoimmune inflammatory diseases which require proinflammatory cytokine production for pathogenesis. We and others have previously used N, N-dimethylglycine (DMG) and extracts from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel Perna canaliculus (Perna) as potent immunomodulators to modify ongoing immune and/or inflammatory responses.METHODS: In our initial studies, we treated lipopolysaccahride (LPS) stimulated THP-1 monocytes in vitro with increasing concentrations of Perna extract or DMG. Additionally, we treated rat peripheral blood neutrophils with increasing concentrations of Perna extract and measured superoxide burst. In subsequent in vivo experiments, CIA was induced by administration of type II collagen; rats were prophylactically treated with either Perna or DMG, and then followed for disease severity. Finally, to test whether Perna and/or DMG could block or inhibit an ongoing pathologic disease process, we induced CIA in mice and treated them therapeutically with either of the two immunomodulators.RESULTS: Following LPS stimulation of THP-1 monocytes, we observed dose-dependent reductions in TNF-alpha and IL-12p40 production in Perna treated cultures. DMG treatment, however, showed significant increases in both of these cytokines in the range of 0.001-1 microM. We also demonstrate that in vitro neutrophil superoxide burst activity is dose-dependently reduced in the presence of Perna. Significant reductions in disease incidence, onset, and severity of CIA in rats were noted following prophylactic treatment with either of the two immunomodulators. More importantly, amelioration of mouse CIA was observed following therapeutic administration of Perna. In contrast, DMG appeared to have little effect in mice and may act in a species-specific manner.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that Perna, and perhaps DMG, may be useful supplements to the treatment of RA in humans.									6	0	0	4	0	7				1472-6882		MEDLINE:17562016	17562016

Two distinct deposits are formed when an electric arc is struck between a Co/Ni impregnated carbon electrode (anode) and a graphite electrode (cathode). The cobweb-like deposit harvested from the walls of the growth chamber (chamber deposit) contained SWNT bundles while the MWNTs were present in the deposit formed at the tip of the cathode (cathode deposit). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy of each deposit confirmed the presence of respective carbon nanotubes along with carbonaceous impurities. A systematic purification procedure for separating SWNT bundles from the rest of the impurities is discussed. The optimal yield of purified SWNT bundles is similar to 25 wt.% of the as-prepared chamber deposit. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Toward cell therapy for vascular calcification: osteoclast-mediated demineralization of calcified elastin								CARDIOVASCULAR PATHOLOGY				16	1			29	37		10.1016/j.carpath.2006.07.001			JAN-FEB 2007	2007	Background: Elastin-oriented vascular calcification is a clinically significant feature, which involves formation of ectopic bone-like structures. Taking advantage of the similarities between arterial calcification and bone regulation, our hypothesis was that therapeutic approaches for limitation of vascular calcification could be developed using site-specific delivery of autologous osteoclasts. In the present paper, we tested the hypothesis that bone-marrow-derived osteoclasts have the ability to demineralize calcified elastin, without significant alterations in elastin integrity. Methods: Active, multinucleated osteoclasts were obtained by in vitro maturation of rat bone-marrow-derived progenitor cells in the presence of vitamin D-3 and retinoic acid. Cell phenotype was validated by staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, formation of resorption pits on hydroxyapatite-coated disks, and RT-PCR for identification of cathepsin K gene expression. Calcified aortic elastin was seeded with osteoclasts and calcium, and phosphorous levels were monitored in gels and culture media to detect demineralization of elastin. Soluble elastin peptides were also monitored in culture media for elastin degradation. For in vivo experiments, pure aortic elastin was coimplanted with allogenic osteoclasts subdermally into rats, and the degree of elastin calcification and degradation was evaluated using mineral analysis and desmosine quantitation. Results: Bone-marrow-derived osteoclasts reduced mineral content of calcified elastin in vitro by 80%. Moreover, in vivo implantation of allogenic osteoclasts in the vicinity of calcifying elastin limited elastin mineralization by almost 50%, in the absence of detectable elastin degradation. Conclusions: Osteoclasts have the ability to demineralize calcified elastin, without significant alterations in elastin integrity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the removal of tars, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and other byproducts from the raw gas is required. The gas clean-up technology that offers more advantages is hot catalytic gas conditioning downstream of the gasifier reactor. Here, we review the applications of basic, acidic, metallic, and redox catalysts for the removal of such byproducts and research strategies to prevent coke accumulation on the catalytic surface, to increase the resistance to sulfur poisoning, and to bring the by-product removal reactions to temperatures below 600 degrees C.									164	4	0	12	0	167			0161-4940			WOS:000250348200001

The starting high-purity nano HA crystals was synthesized using a wet chemical precipitation technique. The HA compacts were microwave-sintered over the temperature range 1000-1300 degrees C, using a rapid sintering schedule of 30 min for each temperature. Shrinkage of all compacts was uniform and the sintered material did not exhibit any cracks. XRD phase analysis indicated that the HA phase stability was not disrupted throughout the sintering regime employed. A relative density of 90-91 % was attained for samples sintered at 1000 degrees C, whereas a higher relative density of above 96% and similar to 98% was measured for HA sintered at 1100 degrees C and 1300 degrees C, respectively. The present work revealed that microwave heating was beneficial in preventing grain growth, particularly when sintered at temperatures < 1200 degrees C, and coupled with improved mechanical properties, i.e., high fracture toughness of 1.45 MPa m(1/2) and hardness of 6.38 GPa were measured for HA compacts sintered at 1050 degrees C and 1150 degrees C, respectively.

A more careful analysis reveals some dramatic differences between the particles obtained by these two synthetic methods. Physicochemical methods indicate that the CNOs obtained from nanodiamonds (N-CNOs) are smaller and contain more defects than the CNOs obtained from arcing (A-CNOs). These properties explain the enhanced reactivity of the N-CNOs in cycloaddition and oxidation reactions, as well as in reactions involving radicals. Given the easier functionalization of the N-CNOs, they are the most obvious choice for studying the potential applications of these multi-shelled fullerenes.									44	0	0	4	0	44			1861-4728			WOS:000246543300007	17465408	
J	Oh, Young Ju; Song, Hocheol; Shin, Won Sik; Choi, Sang June; Kim, Young-Hun					SHIN, WON SIK/0000-0001-6829-8825			Effect of amorphous silica and silica sand on removal of chromium(VI) by zero-valent iron								CHEMOSPHERE				66	5			858	865		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.06.034			JAN 2007	2007	The effect of two surfaces (amorphous silica and silica sand) on the reduction of chromium(VI) by zero-valent iron (Fe(0)) was investigated using batch reactors. The amendment of both surfaces significantly increased the rate and extent of Cr(VI) removal. The rate enhancement by amended surfaces is presumed to result from scavenging of Fe(0)-Cr(VI) reaction products by the provided surfaces, which minimized surface deactivation of Fe(0). The rate enhancing effect was greater for silica compared to sand, and the difference is attributed to silica's higher surface area, greater affinity for reaction products and pH buffering effect. For a given mass of Fe(0), the reactivity and longevity of Fe(0) to treat Cr(VI) increased with increasing dose of silica. Elemental analyses of the reacted iron and silica revealed that chromium removed from the solution was associated with both surfaces, with its mass distribution being approximately 1:1 per mass of iron and silica. The overall result suggests reductive precipitation was a predominant Cr(VI) removal pathway, which involves initial reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), followed by formation of Cr(Ill)/Fe(III) hydroxides precipitates.

Congener-specific PCB data as a function of depth from the sediment-water interface for the 2004 sediment samples were compared to data obtained from 1987 and 1998 samples taken from the same locations. Despite modest decreases in total PCB levels near the G30 sediment-water interface, historical increases in average degrees of chlorination may elevate the overall toxic risk at this site. Unlike G30, the more rapid recovery in the near-surface sediment of G33 suggests that the effectiveness of the U.S. EPA natural attenuation record of decision is site-specific and is unlikely to result in uniform surface sediment recovery throughout the most contaminated regions of Lake Hartwell.

This hybrid process enables the creation of structures that have geometries that would be difficult or impossible to create using any other processes. A feasibility study has been conducted exploring the toolpath planning and deformation force data was collected. Because the forming operations occur on sheet-like material made by machining rather than rolling, we have conducted experiments testing the formability of machined sheet. Preliminary results are encouraging, and point to a broad range of industrial applications for this process.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0007-8506			WOS:000248383100069

We first reformulate the problem by making a favorable choice of variables and parameterizations. We then perform energy estimates for the evolution equations. It is important to note that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is present for the vortex sheet in the absence of surface tension. Accordingly, we must construct the energy functional carefully with an eye toward the regularization of this instability. Well-posedness follows from the estimates.									33	0	0	1	0	33			1539-6746			WOS:000247781200009

Five input variables, including excavation depth, system stiffness, excavation width, shear strength normalized with vertical effective stress, and Young's modulus normalized with vertical effective stress, are adopted as inputs to the ANN. The database for training and testing the ANN is generated from hypothetical cases using finite element method. The performance of the developed ANN reveals that the influence of each input variable on the wall deflection is consistent with the excavation behaviors generally observed in the field. The validation using 12 excavation case histories collected in this study shows that the wall deflection caused by braced excavation can be accurately predicted by the developed ANN.

J	Luo, Jian				Luo, Jian/A-4777-2008				Stabilization of nanoscale quasi-liquid interfacial films in inorganic materials: A review and critical assessment								CRITICAL REVIEWS IN SOLID STATE AND MATERIALS SCIENCES				32	1-2			67	109		10.1080/10408430701364388			2007	2007	Recent observations of three classes of nanometer-thick, disordered, interfacial films in multicomponent inorganic materials are reviewed and critically assessed. The three classes of films are equilibrium-thickness intergranular films (IGFs) in ceramics, their free-surface counterparts, that is, surficial amorphous films (SAFs), and their metallic counterparts. Also briefly reviewed are several related wetting and adsorption phenomena in simpler systems, including premelting in unary systems, prewetting in binary liquids or vapor adsorption on inert walls, and frustrated-complete wetting. Analogous diffuse-interface and force-balance models are discussed with the goal of exploring a unifying thermodynamic framework. In general, the stability of these nanometer-thick interfacial films does not follow bulk phase diagrams. Stabilization of quasi-liquid interfacial films at subeutectic or undersaturation conditions in multicomponent materials can be understood from coupled interfacial premelting and prewetting transitions. More realistic models should include additional interfacial interactions, for example, dispersion and electrostatic forces, and consider the possibility for metastable equilibration. It is suggested that quasi-liquid grain boundary films in binary metallic systems can be used to validate a basic thermodynamic model. These nanoscale interfacial films are technologically important. For example, the short-circuit diffusion that occurs in interface-stabilized, subeutectic, quasi-liquid films explains the long-standing mystery of the solid-state activated sintering mechanism in ceramics, refractory metals, and ice.									94	1	0	1	0	94			1040-8436			WOS:000247237500003

When inspection is visual in nature, humans play a critical role in ensuring inspection quality with training identified as the primary intervention strategy for improving inspection performance. However, for this Strategy to be successful, inspectors must be provided with the needed tools to enhance their inspection skills.

However, EDTA must then be removed from the groundwater, by advanced oxidation or specialized biological treatment. In this work, aqueous individual metal-EDTA solutions were aerated with steel wool for 25 h, at ambient pH, temperature, and pressure. Removal of approximately 99% of EDTA (0.09-1.78 mM); glyoxylic acid (0.153 mM); chelated Cd2+ (0.94 and 0.0952 mM), Pb2+ (0.0502 mM), and Hg2+ (0.0419 mM); and free chromate and vanadate was shown. EDTA was oxidized to glyoxylic acid and formaldehyde, and metals/metalloids were coprecipitated together with iron oxyhydroxide floc. Free arsenite and arsenate were each removed at 99.97%. Free Sr2+, and chelated Ni2+ were removed at 92% and 63%, respectively. Similar removals were obtained from mixtures, including 99.996 +/- 0.004% removal of total arsenic (95% confidence). Traces of iminodiacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, and ethylenediaminetriacetic acid were detected after 25 h. Results are consistent with first-order, solution-phase oxidation of EDTA and glyoxylic acid by ferryl ion and H2O2, respectively, with inhibition due to sludge accumulation, and equilibrium metal coprecipitation. This ambient process, to our knowledge previously unknown, agrees with recently reported findings and shows promise for remediation of metals, metalloids, and radionuclides in wastewater, soil, and sediment.									55	1	0	37	0	56			0013-936X			WOS:000243124600045	17265958	
J	Hoang, Tham C.; Tomasso, Joseph R.; Klaine, Stephen J.				Klaine, Stephen/C-5352-2011				An integrated model describing the toxic responses of Daphnia magna to pulsed exposures of three metals								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				26	1			132	138		10.1897/06-081R.1			JAN 2007	2007	Some toxicology research in which toxicant exposures are continual (pulsed) rather than continuous have been reported. A number of toxicity models have been developed for pulsed and continuous exposures. Most of these models were developed based on one- or two-compartment, first-order toxicokinetics and were calibrated with organic compounds. In the present study, the relationship between mortality (after 21 d) of Daphnia magna in response to pulsed and continuous exposures to Cu, Zn, and Se was used to develop a model that integrated the effects of single and multiple pulsed metal exposures based on first-order uptake and depuration kinetics. Mortality was a function of exposure concentration, duration, and recovery time between exposures. The model was successfully validated using an independent data set. It is applicable to risk assessment and, potentially, may be incorporated with other models (e.g., the biotic ligand model) to predict the toxicity of pulsed metal exposures under a range of environmental conditions.									12	0	0	10	0	13			0730-7268			WOS:000243293800017	17269470

We analyze the role of the internal state, i.e. the vibrationally excited and dissociating states of the neutral molecules resulting from above-surface neutralization of impacting molecular ions in typical sputtering experiments. The sputtering yields are shown to considerably increase with the internal vibrational energy at the lowest impact energies. By comparison of calculated and measured yields we draw conclusions regarding the possible mechanisms for neutralization.									22	0	0	0	0	22			0295-5075			WOS:000245743000010

Measurements are then made on the two groups to ascertain if there is in fact a statistically significant treatment effect. Exact calculation of the associated randomization distribution theoretically involves looking at all possible partitions of the original measurements into two appropriately-sized groups. Computing every possible partition is computationally wasteful, so our objective is to systematically enumerate partitions starting from the tail of the randomization distribution. A new enumeration scheme that only examines potentially worthwhile partitions is described, based on an underlying partial order. Numerical results show that the proposed method runs quickly compared to complete enumeration, and its effectiveness can be enhanced by use of certain pruning rules.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-666X		978-0-387-48793-9	WOS:000270348200006

GAD was purified 186-fold from rice germ. Ultraviolet-visible spectra showed that the rice germ holoGAD presented a weak peak at 420 nm, but the inactivated apoGAD did not. The holoGAD also exhibited a strong peak at 308 nm and a weak peak at 336 nm in its fluorescence emission spectrum. The apoGAD led to a 20% increase in the fluorescence emission at 308 mu. The contents of the secondary structure elements of the holoGAD and apoGAD were estimated from the values of the mean residue ellipticity based on the CD spectra. The holoGAD had a greater P-sheet content than the apoGAD (39% versus 27%), whereas both had a similar alpha-helix content (13% versus 14%). These findings confirmed that a slight conformational change had occurred when PLP bound to the apoGAD to form the holoGAD. Chemical modifications of the GAD by some selected reagents indicated that histidine residue(s) might be involved in the enzymatic functions, but were not essential for the enzyme activity. The study also suggested there was one arginine residue in the GAD active site, and most likely at the substrate-binding site. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Fish samples were purchased from two locations, manufactured by two methods, purchased for two consecutive years, and investigated at two conditions (raw and steamed). Twenty-seven odorous compounds were found among the fish products including alcohols (3), aldehydes (7), miscellaneous compounds (2), ketones (3), other N-containing compounds (4), other Ocontaining compounds (1), and S-containing compounds (7). Seven potent components including 3-methylutanal (almond-like), methanethiol (decay vegetable-like), dimethyl trisulfide (fried garlic, onion-like), hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg-like), trimethylamne (fishy, fish oil-like) bis(methylthio)methane (fried garlic/onion-like), and (Z)-4-heptenal (fatty, grease-like) were identified. The majority of them did not have significant difference among the different treatments (p > 0.05). Other less potent components may contribute to the odor of a fish due to their differences in distribution and potency. Statistically, only location and method x period interaction have major impacts on the magnitude of the odorants found in salted-dried white herrings (p< 0.05). (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The hydrolysate of collagen by cocktail mixture of protease bovine pancreas, protease Streptomyces and protease Bacillus spp. exhibited the highest antioxidant activities on 1,1-diphenyl-2-pierylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, metal chelating and in a linoleic acid peroxidation system induced by Fe2+. And degree of hydrolysis highly affected the antioxidant properties of the hydrolysates. Four different peptides showing strong antioxidant activity were isolated from the hydrolysate using consecutive chromatographic methods including gel filtration chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The molecular masses and amino acid sequences of the purified antioxidant peptides were determined using electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. One of the antioxidative peptides, Gln-Gly-Ala-Arg, was then synthesized and the antioxidant activities measured using the aforementioned methods. The results confirmed the antioxidant activity of this peptide, and adds further support to its feasibility as a provider of natural antioxidants from porcine skin collagen protein.

Antioxidative activity of chitosans with varying molecular weights								FOOD CHEMISTRY				101	1			308	313		10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.01.038			2007	2007	Antioxidant activity of chitosans of different molecular weights (30, 90 and 120kDa chitosan) in salmon (Salmo salar) was investigated. The progress of oxidation was monitored by employing the 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assays. In general, all chitosans exhibited antioxidative activities in salmon. The addition of chitosans to salmon reduced lipid oxidation for seven days of storage. The TBARS values of salmon containing chitosan were significantly lower than those of the control (p < 0.01). At 0.2% (w/v) and 0.5% (w/v) concentrations, the TBARS with chitosan addition was decreased by 75% and 45%, respectively, over 15 days. At 1% concentration, the TBARS value with native chitosan addition was decreased by 32% after 15 days of storage. 90 kDa chitosan showed an increased DPPH free radical-scavenging activity with increasing concentration in the range of 0.2-1% (w/v). The free radical-scavenging activity of the 0.2 mM DPPH solution was saturated by 30 kDa chitosan at a concentration of >= 0.7% (w/v), resulting in a strong antioxidant activity of approximately 85%. This was comparable to the DPPH free radical-scavenging activity of BHT. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									103	11	0	66	2	118			0308-8146	1873-7072		WOS:000242139900043

GAD was purified 186-fold from rice germ using a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sepharose FF ion exchange chromatography, Superdex-200 gel filtration chromatography, and Glu-Sepharose CL 4B affinity chromatography. The purified preparation showed a single peak on SE-HPLC with an approximate molecular mass of 78 kDa and a single band on SDS-PAGE with a subunit Mr of 40 kDa. This indicated that the GAD from rice germ existed as a dimer of homological subunits. Rice germ GAD has an optimum pH range between 5.5 and 5.8, and an optimum temperature at 40 degrees C. K-m values for glutamic acid and PLP were determined at 32.3 mM and 1.7 mu m, respectively. Chemicals reagents such as HgCl2, KI and AgNo3 decreased the enzyme activity by 68.5%, 44.9% and 32.4%, respectively, but 500 mu M of CaCl2 at the optimum pH could increase the activity by 145%.

One occurs during adaptation to and survival in soil, and the other occurs in concert with host plant speciation and adaptation. Actinobacteria from the genus Frankia are facultative symbionts that form N-2-fixing root nodules on diverse and globally distributed angiosperms in the "actinorhizal" symbioses. Three closely related clades of Frankia sp. strains are recognized; members of each clade infect a subset of plants from among eight angiosperm families. We sequenced the genomes from three strains; their sizes varied from 5.43 Mbp for a narrow host range strain (Frankia sp. strain HFPCcl3) to 7.50 Mbp for a medium host range strain (Frankia alni strain ACNl4a) to 9.04 Mbp for a broad host range strain (Frankia sp. strain EANlpec.) This size divergence is the largest yet reported for such closely related soil bacteria (97.8% - 98.9% identity of 16S rRNA genes). The extent of gene deletion, duplication, and acquisition is in concert with the biogeographic history of the symbioses and host plant speciation. Host plant isolation favored genome contraction, whereas host plant diversification favored genome expansion. The results support the idea that major genome expansions as well as reductions can occur in facultative symbiotic soil bacteria as they respond to new environments in the context of their symbioses.									182	3	0	172	0	835			1088-9051			WOS:000243191400002	17151343

Differing effects of mass and interpersonal communication on breast cancer risk estimates: An exploratory study of college students and their mothers								HEALTH COMMUNICATION				21	2			165	175					2007	2007	Research has demonstrated that women tend to overestimate the percentage of all breast cancers that result from genetic predispositions, and this article examines the knowledge of college students, as well as their mothers, on this subject, applying uncertainty management (Brashers, 2001) as the theoretical framework. The authors build on the literature by studying (a) the types of media outlets college students and their mothers use for securing information, and (b) the types of articles and programs within those outlets that may affect risk perceptions. The authors also address associations between these mass communication measures and interpersonal sources of information in the context of risk estimation. Respondents exposed to media reports about the role of genetics in breast cancer, in addition to study participants who had discussed this role within the family, tended to overestimate measures of genetic risk. Conversely, those who had attended to media reports about screening practices tended to offer lower risk estimates, indicating that such reports may have positioned genetics as just one factor in the overall equation of breast cancer risk. The authors discuss the implications of these and other findings for communication scholars and health practitioners.									13	0	0	2	0	13			1041-0236			WOS:000247536100007	17523862

This paper presents a brief description of this program as well as salient observations and quantitative parameterizations for scour, ripples, and burial that resulted from it (which constitute the ASU mine burial model). Improvements to mine burial predictive capabilities offered by the ASU model are demonstrated by evaluating it vis-A-vis the (legacy) mine burial models that are in common use [Defense Research Agency mine burial environment (DRAM-BUIE), Industrie Anlagen Bau Gesellschaft (NBURY, Munchen, Germany), and wave-induced spreadsheet prediction (WISSP)]. To this end, both the legacy and ASU models are discussed briefly and compared with field experimental data obtained during the 2003 Indian Rocks Beach (IRB, FL) experiment. The scour/burial data collected during the IRB campaign, using instrumented mines and diver observations, show that the predictions of the mostly laboratory-based ASU model agree satisfactorily with field observations, both qualitatively and quantitatively.									15	1	0	0	0	16			0364-9059			WOS:000248315200018		
J	Vahidi, Ardalan; Kolmanovsky, Ilya; Stefanopoulou, Anna								Constraint handling in a fuel cell system: A fast reference governor approach								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY				15	1			86	98		10.1109/TCST.2006.883242			JAN 2007	2007	A compressor-based air supply system in a fuel cell is susceptible to saturation during fast transients in load. Aggressive control of the air compressor may result in compressor surge or choke, disrupt the flow of air into the cathode of a fuel cell stack, and negatively impact the fuel cell power generation. Low partial oxygen pressure in the cathode caused by rapid increase in load may also damage the stack and reduce its life. A load governor can be added to the air supply control system to monitor the load and prevent violation of constraints (compressor surge, choke, and partial oxygen pressure) by modifying the load command to the fuel cell system. In this paper, we present the steps involved in the design of such a load governor for the fuel cell application. To reduce the online computations, we utilize the "fast" reference governor (FRG) approach which has been developed for linear systems. FRG utilize a "maximal constraint admissible set" calculated offline and, thus, require fewer online calculations. We propose a modification to the FRG design to make it applicable to the nonlinear fuel cell plant. The scheme is then implemented on a real-time simulation platform and it is shown that the computations of the load governor can be performed in real-time.									36	1	0	0	0	37			1063-6536			WOS:000243342200009

The novel data-fragmentation method in this scheme not only provides finer granularity caching units to allow more effective cache replacement, but also offers a unique and natural way of handling the interactive VCR functions in the proxy-caching environment. Furthermore, a cache-replacement scheme, based on user request arrival rates for different multimedia objects and the playback rates of these objects, is proposed to address the drawbacks in existing cache-replacement schemes, most of which consider only the user access frequencies in their cache-replacement decisions. In this cache-replacement scheme, a sliding history window is employed to monitor the dynamic user request arrivals, and a tunable-victimization procedure is used to provide an excellent method of managing the cached multimedia data in accordance with different quality-of-service requirements of the streaming multimedia applications. Performance studies demonstrate that the fragmental proxy-caching scheme significantly outperforms other caching schemes, in terms of byte-hit ratio and the number of delayed starts, and can be tuned to either maximize the byte-hit ratio or minimize the number of delayed starts.									10	2	0	0	0	12			1520-9210	1941-0077		WOS:000243041500014		
J	Wolf, Brian J.; Hammond, Joseph L.; Noneaker, Daniel L.; Russell, Harlan B.								A protocol for construction of broadcast transmission schedules in mobile ad hoc networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS				6	1			74	78		10.1109/TWC.2007.05210			JAN 2007	2007	In a mobile ad hoc network using broadcast transmission scheduling, a terminal that is ready to join the network must first determine the current state of the transmission-scheduling protocol. In order to transmit and receive packets without interference, the new terminal needs to notify other terminals of its presence and exchange information with them so that it can form a collision-free broadcast transmission schedule. A new distributed protocol is described that allows a new terminal to acquire sufficient information about the terminals in its local neighborhood so that it can efficiently integrate itself into the existing transmission schedule. The protocol is also designed to enable a group of terminals to form a new transmission schedule if one does not already exist. We show that a large group of terminals can quickly form a new and efficient collision-free transmission schedule.									3	1	0	1	0	4			1536-1276			WOS:000245119500015

J	Foulk, Jonn A.; Dodd, Roy B.; McAlister, David; Chun, David; Akin, Danny E.; Morrison, Herb								Flax-cotton fiber blends: Miniature spinning, gin processing, and dust potential								INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS				25	1			8	16		10.1016/j.indcrop.2006.05.001			JAN 2007	2007	Development of a flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) industry in North America is desired to supply a domestic source of clean, consistent quality textile fiber for blending with cotton. The objective of this work was to evaluate portions of traditional cotton gin equipment (extractor feeder and lint cleaner) and the "50-g cotton-spinning test (CST)" for flax. Dust was collected on an area sampler in an isolated card room to evaluate dust potential during textile pilot plant processing. Fibers retted by diverse means were cleaned on two separate portions of Continental Eagle's pilot plant cotton gin stand, the Super 96 Feeder and the 24D lint cleaner. Fibers separated and removed from flax stalks by these gin sections were compared against the standard 'unified line' processing technique of the USDA Flax Pilot Plant. Test yams were then made in a CST with cotton and flax blends to provide an indirect measurement of fiber properties that can be related to the retting and gin cleaning processes. The yarns were tested for strength and evenness. Flax fibers that displayed the most favorable properties in the CST were then spun in 23 kg lots in the pilot plant at the following cotton/flax blend ratios: 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75, and 20/80. With modifications, it appears that portions of a cotton gin stand are able to process adequately small samples of properly retted flax stalks. The CST with minor adjustments provides useful data for ranking and further large-scale flax processing. As expected, it appears that flax fiber can be successfully cleaned on a cotton processing line and that increasing the amount of flax generates additional dust.

In the recent years IS researchers have applied various methodologies; one such method that is gaining prominence is action research. As qualitative method that emphasis collaboration between researchers and practitioners' action research has been applied to study IS in various organizational settings. In this chapter we address the issues associated with action research. In doing this we develop a set of criteria to assess the quality of information systems action research. We then provide recommendations to improve both the incidence and the quality of action research in the field.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1571-0270		978-0-387-36060-7	WOS:000270496900016

The paper highlights the differences in funding of inter-library lending.Findings - Much could be said about how electronic resources are altering the landscape and future of interlibrary loan, but no media forms have evolved to entirely satisfy readers' need to handle the physical book in front of them.Originality/value - One of the remarkable things about the physical book is what a superb technological form it is. Books are both portable and strong. There is still no better way to read lengthy texts. Although more people are requesting articles electronically, the demand for books seems to keep growing apace with the development of shared library catalogs.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0264-1615			WOS:000251952300010

Our approach creates multicast regions that use symmetric key cryptography for communications. Each multicast region contains a single keyserver that is used to perform key management and maintain the integrity of a multicast region. Communications between two multicast regions is performed by nodes that belong to both regions. To ease the network management burden, it is desirable for the networks to self-organize into regions and dynamically select their keyservers. This paper shows how to determine the number of keyservers (k) to use and the size in the number of hops (h) of their multicast regions. We find that power consumption issues provide a natural trade-off that determines optimal values for these parameters. Analysis of one application shows an increase in system security with 70-80% less power overhead than existing security approaches.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1550-1329			WOS:000248768000002

Durability studies on concrete columns confined with advanced fibre composites								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS & PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY				28	1-2			8	28		10.1504/IJMPT.2007.011507			2007	2007	This paper presents the results of two different durability studies of concrete columns confined with Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite and with PVC-FRP hybrid composite. The confined concrete specimens were divided into three groups: control (left at room temperature), exposed to wet/dry environment and exposed to freeze/thaw environment. The confined and unconfined concrete specimens were loaded in uniaxial compression. Test results showed that both types of confinements effectively increase the strength and improve the energy absorption capacity of the concrete specimens. The FRP and PVC-FRP hybrid confinements showed to significantly protect the concrete when subjected to harsh environmental conditions. The 200 freeze/thaw cycles appeared to have insignificant effect on the strength and ductility; whereas, the 400 cycles of freeze/thaw showed a reduction in both strength and ductility of the specimens.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0268-1900			WOS:000243929900002		
J	Cox, Christopher; Lee, Hyesuk; Szurley, David								Finite element approximation of the non-isothermal Stokes-Oldroyd equations								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND MODELING				4	3-4			425	440					2007	2007	We consider the Stokes-Oldroyd equations, defined here as the Stokes equations with the Newtonian constitutive equation explicitly included. Thus a polymer-like stress tensor is included so that the dependent variable structure of a viscoelastic model is in place. The energy equation is coupled with the mass, momentum, and constitutive equations through the use of temperature-dependent viscosity terms in both the constitutive model and the momentum equation. Earlier works assumed temperature-dependent constitutive (polymer) and Newtonian (solvent) viscosities when describing the model equations, but made the simplifying assumption of a constant solvent viscosity when carrying out analysis and computations; we assume no such simplification. Our analysis coupled with numerical solution of the problem with both temperature-dependent viscosities distinguishes this work from earlier efforts.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1705-5105			WOS:000245811200008

The goal of inclusion of the chi u* is to drive unresolved fluctuations to sero exponentially. We study convergence of discretization of model to the model's solution as h, Delta t -> 0. Next we complement this with an experimental study of the effect the time relaxation term (and a nonlinear extension of it) has on the large scales of a flow near a transitional point. We close by showing that the time relaxation term does not alter shock speeds in the inviscid, compressible case, giving analytical confirmation of a result of Stolz, Adams, and Kleiser.									22	0	0	0	0	22			1705-5105			WOS:000245811200020

The test, based upon larval darkwinged fungus gnat attraction to potato starch as a food source, yielded results in 24 h and was inexpensive to conduct. Using written standard operating procedures, validation data were collected using a Bti formulation from a single lot to validate the method through QA/QC methods and develop a database for employing the toxicity test as a bioassay. The bioassay might be suitable for use with other biological and chemical pesticides, to assist insecticide product development efforts, for quality control testing, for formulation evaluation, and for efficacy comparison between pesticides.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0967-0874			WOS:000243876300010

Under these assumptions, the sample mean and variance are often used to estimate the process mean and variance. In practice, the above assumptions are not always satisfied. When these assumptions are violated, one can alternatively use the sample median and median absolute deviation to estimate the process mean and variance. However, the median and median absolute deviation both suffer from a lack of efficiency under the normal distribution, although they are fairly outlier-resistant. To remedy this problem, we propose new robust design methods based on a highly efficient and outlier-resistant estimator. Numerical studies substantiate the new methods developed and compare the performance of the proposed methods with the ordinary dual-response robust design.									18	0	0	1	0	18			0020-7543			WOS:000242019100008		
J	Shin, S.; Cho, B. R.								Integrating a bi-objective paradigm to tolerance optimization								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH				45	23			5509	5525		10.1080/00207540701325181			2007	2007	The primary goal of tolerance design is to determine the optimal tolerance by minimizing quality loss and process costs (i.e. manufacturing and rejection costs). Most tolerance design models find the optimal tolerance by considering a sum of process quality and costs. In real-world industrial settings, however, quality practitioners often need a balance associated with the quality and costs. For this reason, a bi-objective tolerance optimization problem for obtaining the Pareto solutions of the quality and costs need to be considered. In practical situations, objective functions in many tolerance optimization models reported in the research community often become a high-order, and the associated Pareto frontiers can be non-convex. Thus, it is known that obtaining efficient solutions using the conventional weighted-sum method widely used in tolerance optimization is unlikely. To address this concern, we develop a weighted-Tchebycheff based bi-objective tolerance design model to obtain all efficient solutions and a non-convex Pareto frontier. The weighted-Tchebycheff method is far more effective than any other when a function has higher-order terms or is neither convex nor concave. A numerical example is provided, and a comparison between the two methods is made.									6	1	0	0	0	7			0020-7543			WOS:000250704400005

Within this modeling space, a particular PDS is chosen by way of a Grobner basis, and using different monomial orders may result in different polynomial models. In this paper, we present a systematic method for selecting most likely polynomial models for a given data set, using the Grobner fan of the ideal of the input data. We apply the method to reverse engineer two biochemical networks, a Boolean model of lactose metabolism in E. coli and a protein signal transduction network in S. cerevisiae, and compare our results to those from two published network-reconstruct ion methods.					20th International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation20th International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation	JUL 29-AUG 01, 2007JUL 29-AUG 01, 2007	SIGSAM; Symbol Computat Grp; FIELDS; Maplesoft; MITACS; Univ WaterlooSIGSAM; Symbol Computat Grp; FIELDS; Maplesoft; MITACS; Univ Waterloo	Waterloo, CANADAWaterloo, CANADA	9	0	0	4	0	9					978-1-59593-743-8	WOS:000265926900017

Kenneth								Online mercury speciation through liquid chromatography with particle beam/electron ionization mass spectrometry detection								JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY				22	3			283	291		10.1039/b609362k			2007	2007	The ability of particle beam/electron ionization-mass spectrometry (PB/EI-MS) to provide elemental and molecular information for a sample solution has been evaluated for the speciation of inorganic and organic mercury compounds. Specifically, the EI process yields mass spectra which reflect the chemical species eluting from the chromatographic column, either atomic or molecular. A detailed evaluation of source temperature and electron energy parameters has been performed for the PB/EI-MS method. Preliminary studies demonstrated that the approach can be utilized for the determination of mercury at mu g mL(-1) levels. A non-linear response at low concentrations (0.1 - 1 mu g mL(-1)) of mercury was observed due to poor transport of small particles through the PB interface. The use of KCl as a carrier agent to enhance particle transport was investigated. The analyte responses for mercury species showed higher sensitivity with good linearity upon KCl addition, providing limits of detection on the ng mL(-1) level (sub-ng absolute). The three mercury species (inorganic, phenyl- and methylmercury) were separated using a reversed phase (C-18) column with a total elution time of less than 11 min and the species were detected using PB/EI-MS. Post-column addition of the KCl carrier to the mobile phase was accomplished with a HPLC pump and a tee connection. It is believed that the PB/EI-MS technique is well suited not only for speciation of mercury, but also for obtaining comprehensive speciation information via atomic and molecular mass spectral information of diverse species, and thus can be used to solve a number of speciation challenges.					14th Winter Conference on Plasma Spectrochemistry14th Winter Conference on Plasma Spectrochemistry	JAN 09-14, 2006JAN 09-14, 2006		Tucson, AZTucson, AZ	29	2	0	15	0	30			0267-9477			WOS:000244530100006

Separations were performed in the size exclusion and reversed-phase chromatographic modes. Myoglobin, holo-transferrin and iron(II) chloride were separated by size exclusion chromatography and the eluent species were detected by both PB/HC-OES and ICP-OES through the Fe I 259.9 nm and S I 180.7 nm optical emission. Sulfur optical emission was monitored as means of protein identification through the Fe/S empirical formula differences, with the absence of S emission used to identify the "free'' Fe. Both techniques demonstrated detection limits for triplicate injections on the nanogram level for iron (0.9 ng mL(-1) ICP-OES and 41.9 ng mL(-1) PB/HC-OES) over the concentration range of 0.1 ng mL(-1)-100 mg mL(-1) for iron and iron metalloproteins. The corresponding values for sulfur in the proteins were more similar for the two techniques, being of the order of 20 ng mL(-1). The SEC retention times and peak shapes of the three analyte peaks for both techniques are similar to those determined by UV absorbance at 220 nm (Fe-containing metalloproteins) and conductivity (inorganic iron), demonstrating the ability of both techniques to preserve the integrity of the separation. While the LODs in "bulk'' sampling were lower with ICP-OES, the signal-to-noise values were comparable for both techniques when sampling chromatographic eluents in real-time. In addition, a reversed-phase separation of the same analyte mixture was carried out with Fe I 259.9 nm and S I 180.7 nm optical emission detection by the PB/HC-OES, demonstrating the compatibility of the PB/HC-OES with a wide range of solvent polarities, its ability to detect non-metals and act as a protein specific detector for liquid chromatography of proteins.

Relative levels of semen platelet activating factor-receptor (PAFr) and ubiquitin in yearling bulls with high content of semen white blood cells: Implications for breeding soundness evaluation								JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY				28	1			92	108		10.2164/jandrol.106.000216			JAN-FEB 2007	2007	High content of the platelet activating factor (PAF) and its plasma membrane receptor (PAFr) in semen is thought to benefit fertility in farm animals and humans. We used flow cytometric, biochemical, and immunocytochemical analysis to examine PAFr levels alone (Trial 1, n = 156 bulls) or in a dual assay with sperm defect marker ubiquitin (UBI; Trial 2, n = 88 bulls), in semen samples from 160 yearling bulls undergoing Breeding Soundness Evaluations (BSE). In both trials, we observed increased PAFr levels in semen samples with high content of white blood cells (WBC). Consequently, PAFr levels within such semen samples correlated negatively with several subjective parameters of BSE, including palpation, satisfaction of evaluation, and scrotal circumference. Due to a high WBC content, increased semen sample dilution had to be applied for microscopic evaluation. There was a negative correlation between semen PAFr and conventional sperm morphology, while the increased levels of PAFr correlated positively with sperm UBI content. Immunofluorescence microcopy revealed high expression of PAFr on the surface of leukocytes and morphologically normal spermatozoa, while reduced immunoreactivity was observed in defective spermatozoa immunoreactive to anti-UBI antibodies. A single PAFr band of appropriate mass was observed in Western blots of ejaculated spermatozoa, while testicular and epididymal spermatozoa also displayed several larger bands indicative of posttranslational processing or modification. Collectively, these data suggest that high levels of semen PAFr in young bulls are indicative of semen contamination with WBC. In the future, objective protein marker-based semen analyses in young bulls will likely require additional parameters distinguishing between marker expression in the spermatozoa and in the contaminating WBC. While identification of high sperm PAFr levels may support fertility, this assay alone is not reliable, due to the expression of PAFr in WBC that contaminate semen samples.									9	1	0	8	1	9			0196-3635			WOS:000243141400015	16928895

Anabolic-androgenic steroid use as a complicating factor in the female athlete triad: Behavioral implications for sport psychology								JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPORT PSYCHOLOGY				19	4			457	470		10.1080/10413200701599181			2007	2007	In 1992, recognizing a ubiquitous pattern of disordered eating, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis among young women participating in competitive sports, the American College of Sports Medicine ( ACSM) initiated a dialogue about the Female Athlete Triad. Since then, members of ACSM and other professional societies have offered theoretical models for reducing problem behaviors, but few have conceptualized how the use of anabolic- androgenic steroids ( AAS) might exacerbate symptoms of the Triad, and by extension, complicate the work of sport psychology consultants in applied settings. The current article offers such a conceptualization, proposing strategies for behavior change grounded in appeals to self- efficacy and task performance, as opposed to emotion- based testimonials and threats of imminent maladies.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1041-3200			WOS:000250101400005		
J	Yao, Hai; Gu, Wei Yong								Three-dimensional inhomogeneous triphasic finite-element analysis of physical signals and solute transport in human intervertebral disc under axial compression								JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS				40	9			2071	2077		10.1016/j.jbiomech.2006.10.001			2007	2007	A 3D inhomogeneous finite-element model for charged hydrated soft tissues containing charged/ uncharged solutes was developed and applied to analyze the mechanical, chemical, and electrical signals within the human intervertebral disc during an axial unconfined compression. The effects of tissue properties and boundary conditions on the physical signals and the transport of fluid and solute were investigated. The numerical simulation showed that, during disc compression, the fluid pressurization and the effective (von Misses) solid stress were more pronounced in the annulus fibrosus (AF) region near the interface between AF and nucleus pulposus (NP). In NP, the distributions of the fluid pressure, effective stress, and electrical potential were more uniform than those in AF. The electrical signals were very sensitive to fixed charge density. Changes in material properties of NP (water content, fixed charge density, and modulus) affected fluid pressure, electrical potential, effective stress, and solute transport in the disc. This study is important for understanding disc biomechanics, disc nutrition, and disc mechanobiology. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Proposed international standards for TKR wear simulation have been drafted, yet their methods continue to be debated. The "gold standard" to which all TKR wear testing methodologies should be compared is measured in vivo TKR performance in patients. The current study compared patient TKR kinematics from fluoroscopic analysis and simulator TKR kinematics from force-controlled wear testing to quantify similarities in clinical ranges of motion and contact bearing kinematics and to evaluate the proposed ISO force-controlled wear testing methodology. The treadmill walking kinematics from eight well-functioning, 13 month average post-op patients were compared to the 2 million cycle interval walking cycle kinematics from a force-controlled (Instron/Stanmore Knee Joint Simulator, Instron, Canton, MA) knee simulator using identical implant designs (Natural Knee II, Standard Congruent, Zimmer, Warsaw, IN). The in vivo and simulator data showed good agreement in kinematic patterns and ranges of clinical motion. Tribologically the data sets showed similar contact pathway ranges of motion and wear travel distances per cycle. Surgical and simulator alignments of the implant systems were determined to be a contributing factor in observed kinematic differences. This study's statistical findings offer supporting evidence that the simulation of in vivo walking cycle wear kinematics can be accurately reproduced with a force controlled testing methodology.

Effects of collagen fiber orientation on the response of biologically derived soft tissue biomaterials to cyclic loading								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				80A	1			194	205		10.1002/jbm.a.30871			JAN 2007	2007	In the present study, the effects of initial collagen fiber orientation on the medium-term (up to 50 x 10(6) cycles) fatigue response of heart valve soft tissue biomaterials was investigated. Glutaraldehyde treated bovine pericardium (GLBP), preselected for uniform structure and collagen fiber orientation, was used as the representative heart valve biomaterial. Using specialized instrumentation, GLBP specimens were subjected to cyclic tensile loading to maximum stress levels of 500 +/- 50 kPa at a frequency of 22 Hz. Two sample groups were examined, one with the preferred collagen fiber direction parallel (PD) and perpendicular (XD) to the direction of applied strain. The primary findings indicated that GLBP fatigue response was highly sensitive to the direction of loading with respect to fiber orientation. Specifically, when loading perpendicular to the preferred collagen fiber orientation, fiber reorientation is the dominant mechanism. In contrast, when loaded parallel to the preferred fiber direction a reduction in both collagen fiber crimp and fiber reorientation occurred. Moreover, alterations in the degree and direction of mechanical anisotropy can be inducted by cyclic loading when specimens are loaded perpendicular to the preferred fiber direction. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) results indicate that molecular-level damage to collagen occurs in both groups after only 20 x 10(6) cycles. Taken as a whole, the results of this study suggest that initial collagen orientation plays a critical role in bioprosthetic heart valve biomaterial fatigue response.

J	Lohitharn, Nattapom; Goodwin, James G., Jr.								n-Butane isomerization on sulfated zirconia: How olefins affect surface intermediate concentration								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				245	1			198	204		10.1016/j.jcat.2006.10.007			JAN 1 2007	2007	Isotopic transient kinetic analysis (ITKA) was used to study the effect of various olefin additions (ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, and 1-pentene) on n-butane isomerization on sulfated zirconia (SZ) at 100 degrees C. Earlier work showed that the activity of this catalyst is enhanced not only by the addition of butene, but also by the addition of ethylene, propylene, and 1-pentene. This reaction activity enhancement observed for olefins other than butene was suggested to be due to the isomerization of n-butane via different oligomeric species. In this work, we show that at the maximum reaction rate after the initial induction period, the activity of the reaction sites appeared to be similar, regardless of whether they were activated by the various added olefins or by butene produced during reaction. The addition of butene was able to lower the average surface residence time of the active intermediates leading to isobutane (tau(*)(isoC4)) at the very beginning of the reaction induction period, reinforcing an early suggestion that butene formation and accumulation of olefinic intermediates are required for the reaction. The improved isobutane formation rate caused by the addition of olefins was due to an increased concentration of surface intermediates leading to isobutane (N-isoC4(*)). Any type of added olefin led to the formation/utilization of additional active olefin-modified sites (i.e., adsorbed carbenium ions on acid sites). A larger N-isoC4(*) was obtained compared with the reaction without olefin addition when the olefins were added only during the initial 2 min of reaction and then terminated. This suggests that most of the olefin-modified sites were probably formed by the addition of olefin at the early stages of the reaction. Those sites were able to integrate themselves into the reaction cycles and to persist for multiple turnovers. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

J	Srivastava, Nilabh; Haque, Imtiaz								Transient Dynamics of the Metal V-Belt CVT: Effects of Pulley Flexibility and Friction Characteristic								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS				2	1			86	97		10.1115/1.2389233			JAN 2007	2007	A continuously, variable transmission (CVT) offers a continuum of gear ratios between desired limits. The present research focuses on developing a continuous one-dimensional model of the metal V-belt CVT in order to understand the influence of pulley flexibility and friction characteristics on its dynamic performance. A metal V-belt CVT falls under the category of friction-limited drives as its performance and torque capacity rely significantly on the friction characteristic of the contact patch between the belt element and the pulley. Since the friction characteristic of the contact patch may vary in accordance with the loading and design configurations, it is important to study the influence of the friction characteristic on the performance of a CVT. Friction between the belt and the pulley sheaves is modeled using different mathematical models which account,for varying loading scenarios. Simple trigonometric functions are introduced to capture the effects of pulley deformation oil the thrust ratio and slip behavior of the CVT Moreover, since a number of models mentioned in the literature neglect the inertial coupling between the belt and the pulley, a considerable amount of effort in this paper is dedicated towards modeling the inertial coupling between the belt and the pulley and studying its influence on the dynamic performance of a CVT. The results discuss the influence of friction characteristics and pulley flexibility on the dynamic performance, the axial force requirements, and the torque transmitting capacity of a metal V-belt CVT drive.									6	1	0	0	0	7			1555-1423			WOS:000259931900010

None of these have described a coherent data-generating process (DGP). Moreover, conventional approaches to inference employed in these papers are invalid due to complicated, unknown serial correlation among the estimated efficiencies. We first describe a sensible DGP for such models. We propose single and double bootstrap procedures; both permit valid inference, and the double bootstrap procedure improves statistical efficiency in the second-stage regression. We examine the statistical performance of our estimators using Monte Carlo experiments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									669	5	0	47	18	690			0304-4076			WOS:000242252100002

In this study, we investigated the effects of 35 spices from 15 plant families, on the activity of the gypsy moth nucleo-polyhedrovirus (LdMNPV) infecting the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.). The activity of LdMNPV was not affected in 29 different virus/spice combinations, whereas six virus/spice combinations (NPV/cayenne, NPV/curry, NPV/dill, NPV/nutmeg, NPV/paprika and NPV/tarragon) enhanced activity of the virus against gypsy moth larvae. These findings indicate that several of these spices may be useful as viral enhancers and should be further investigated to obtain more efficacious formulations for the control of agriculturally important insect pests.									7	0	0	7	0	8			0749-8004			WOS:000244310000011

The study reported here follows on a recent discovery of anomalously high uranium concentrations in several private well waters in the area. An HPGe spectrometer was used for quantification of gamma emitting radionuclides in the sediments. All sediments contained radionuclides from the uranium and thorium series as well as K-40. Uranium-238 concentrations in sediment samples ranged from 11.1 to 74.2 Bq kg(-1). The measured radionuclide concentrations were compared with data from UNSCEAR and NURE reports. The river and stream sediment data were augmented by in situ NaI(Tl) gamma-ray spectrometer measurements. Comparisons between the ex situ and in situ measurements indicate equivalently distributed uranium in the surface soils and stream sediments, the source of which is likely attributed to the monazite belts that are known to exist in the area.

Both first and second generation GMOs are better accepted by American respondents than by French re-spondents, but respondents in both countries perceive a direct benefit from second generation GM foods with at least a less negative attitude toward them. In addition, respondents indicated factors which would make it more likely that they would purchase such enhanced GM foods.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1045-4446			CCC:000246235500006

Data from field cone penetration tests and laboratory tests of samples taken from the Cooper marl are used to investigate the adequacy of index properties-based criteria for assessing liquefaction susceptibility of clayey soils. In particular, the criterion based on soil behavior type index (I-c) and that based on Atterberg limits are examined. The results show that the Atterberg limits-based criterion adequately reflected the characteristics of the marl, whereas the I-c-based criterion erroneously identified the marl as being liquefiable.

Dimensionless rainfall patterns for South Carolina								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING				12	1			130	133		10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2007)12:1(130)			JAN-FEB 2007	2007	This note presents methodologies for developing dimensionless design rainfall patterns for the state of South Carolina based on the real rainfall events as an alternative to the presently used Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curves that are based on rainfall bursts. The rainfall data were analyzed, and previously used methods of separating a rainfall event out of the continuous data set were evaluated and modified for the present application. Two distinct nondimensional rainfall patterns, one for short durations of rainfall and the other for long durations, were identified. Though the general patterns for South Carolina were similar to rainfall patterns generated for other states in recent studies, they were markedly different when compared to the SCS Type II curve currently used in the state.									12	0	0	5	0	12			1084-0699			WOS:000242982300014		
J	Fries, Ryan; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Ma, Yongchang								Accelerated incident detection and verification: A benefit to cost analysis of traffic cameras								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				11	4			191	203		10.1080/15472450701653499			2007	2007	Traffic incidents are a major contributor to congestion on US freeways, resulting in millions of dollars in property damage and significant deaths and injuries each year. Because a single incident can cause traffic delays, equally devastating secondary incidents can result. Thus, the faster an incident is detected, verified, and cleared, the less significant the impact. Traffic cameras and other technologies are widely used for this purpose. This work examined the effectiveness of traffic cameras at five metropolitan freeway sites in South Carolina using the traffic simulation software PARAMICS to simulate various incident scenarios and traffic camera operations through application programming interfaces. The authors used these interfaces to produce random spatial and temporal occurrence of incidents, including the incident start times, durations and locations. A benefit-cost analysis based on the simulation results suggested traffic cameras returned $12 for every dollar spent under the prevailing conditions at the study sites. A sensitivity study, varying different benefit- and cost-related parameters, such as deployment costs, number of incidents, and discount rate, revealed benefit-cost values that were always above one.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1547-2450	1547-2442		WOS:000251191100004

Polypentafluorostyrene (PPFS) of different molecular weights with an end carboxyl group was used for the grafting. Atomic force microscopy imaging revealed that, in general, the grafted chains evenly covered all substrates. Thickness of the grafted layer increased with temperature and time of grafting. To reach a significant level of grafting and consequently high hydrophobicity temperature above 140 degrees C, 5 min of grafting had to be used. For longer grafting time (I h) the hydrophobicity could be reached at 120 degrees C. The thickness of the grafted layer should be at least 2-3 nm to attain the high water-contact angle. The polymer grafting technique developed could be readily applied to surface modification of fibers and textiles leading to generation of hydrophobic fibrous materials.									22	0	0	2	0	22			0022-2348			WOS:000243498000012

The stability of the arrays of colloidal particles was studied in pH 4 and pH 10 buffer solutions, deionized (DI) water, and nonionic surfactant solution. The array was determined to be stable. Attachment of the nanoparticles to one-component homogeneous PGMA and PVP films was also studied in order to determine the role of each polymer in the anchoring layer. Virtually no particles were adsorbed on the surface modified with PGMA. The nanoparticles could be adsorbed on PVP, but the integrity of the polymer layer was destroyed in the environment used for adsorption, i.e., a dispersion of nanoparticles at pH 10. Measurement of adhesion between the nanoparticles attached to the anchoring layer and the glass substrate were performed in aqueous media having different pH values using a colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2348			WOS:000243498000017

The magnetization rises smoothly with negative curvature due to uncompensated Fe3+ spins and with a large high field slope due to the underlying antiferromagnetic ferritin core. Even at highest fields the magnetic moment is only similar to 4% of the saturation moment of the full complement of Fe3+ in the ferritin molecule. The AC magnetic susceptibility, chi(AC)(T,f), responding to the uncompensated spins, reaches a maximum near the superparamagnetic blocking temperature with the temperature of the maximum, T-M, varying with excitation frequency, T-M(-1) alpha logf for 10 <= f <= 10(4) Hz.

We argue that family firms are unique in that, although they work as a single entity, at least two forms of social capital coexist: the family's and the firm's. We investigate mechanisms that link a family's social capital to the creation of the family firm's social capital and examine how factors underlying the family's social capital affect this creation. Moreover, we identify contingency dimensions that affect these relationships and the potential risks associated with family social capital. Finally, we suggest these insights are generalizable to several other types of organizations with similar characteristics.									313	0	0	0	4	316			0022-2380			WOS:000243295800004

However, the compatibility of the large amount of functional groups necessary for the nanotube functionalization with the polymeric matrices is critical to the properties and performance of the resulting nanocomposites. We have developed an approach of only using functional polymers that are structurally identical or maximally similar to the matrix polymers in the functionalization and solubilization of carbon nanotubes. Several representative examples are highlighted, and issues concerning the characterization and evaluation of the polymeric nanocomposites thus obtained are discussed.									111	4	0	4	0	113			0959-9428			WOS:000244869100001

This optical tuning was achieved by altering the complex refractive index of the PEDOT shell through a manipulation of its redox state, specifically the absorption characteristics. A mediated electron transfer system was employed to ferry charge from the electrodes of the cell to the isolated particles for both the oxidation and reduction processes. The mediators diffused between the electrode surfaces and the PEDOT-coated particles to accomplish (de) doping of the entire colloidal array. The reflected peak from an ordered array exhibited a significant drop in height during a typical reduction process, dropping to 40% of its original height, though the peak height could be reinstated by re-oxidizing the particles with an imposed bias shift to the cell.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0959-9428			WOS:000244869100002

Since the first demonstration of an organic field-effect transistor, a specific interest in fabricating low-cost, large area organic electronics through the exploitation of conventional ink-jet, screen, or roll-to-roll printing technologies has developed. Using a commercial roll-to-roll printing press, interdigitated test figures were printed with the core-shell colloidal ink down to a line thickness of ca. 40 mu m. The printed zones exhibited a conductivity of ca. 0.5 Omega(-1) cm(-1), though this conductivity could be modified by altering the composition of the ink to include more uncoated poly( butyl methacrylate) particles. Heating the printed zone above 35 degrees C allowed the core to flow, resulting in enhanced mechanical properties of the printed zone.									22	1	0	2	0	23			0959-9428			WOS:000245241400002

Introductory soil science exercises using USDA web soil survey								Journal of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Education				36				19	23					2007	2007	The USDA, Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey is a valuable teaching tool for soil science education. By incorporating the Web Soil Survey into an undergraduate-level course, students are able to use the most detailed digital soil survey information without the steep learning curve associated with geographic information systems (GIS). We have developed two laboratory exercises utilizing the Web Soil Survey: (1) "Using NRCS Web Soil Survey to evaluate soil physical properties, septic suitability and basement suitability"; and (2) "Using NRCS Web Soil Survey to evaluate soil chemical properties." The primary objective of these laboratory exercises was to teach students how the Web Soil Survey can be used as a tool to make environmentally based land use decisions. Sixty-seven Clemson University students from various fields (horticulture, forestry, agricultural mechanization, and agricultural education) had hands-on training in using the Web Soil Survey during CSENV 202: Introductory Soil Science course taught in spring 2006. Student responses to the laboratory exercises were strongly positive, both in terms of how the Web Soil Survey helped them understand a range of soil science topics as well as the potential for using, the system in their future careers. Incorporation of the Web Soil Survey into introductory soil science courses should have a significant impact on the quality of soil science education and training.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1059-9053			BCI:BCI201000431190

Structural equation modeling analyses revealed morale was best predicted by indices of engagement in meaningful work and confidence in unit functioning and leadership, whereas depression was best predicted by deployment stressors and negative events. Morale assessed during the deployment was related to perceiving benefits from deploying six months later, whereas depression was related to posttraumatic stress disorder and negative perceptions of deploying. The relationship between morale and benefits was a function of engagement in meaningful work. Discussion focuses on the importance of longitudinal research in specifying the antecedents of positive and negative outcomes of a stressful work environment.									36	1	0	4	0	37			1076-8998			WOS:000243498700003	17257065

Application of the new method was demonstrated using pyrene in the presence of nonquenching (K+) and dynamically quenching (Cs+) akali metal chloride salt solutions at room temperature. For these two model systems, Setschenow constants for pyrene salting-out by KCl and CsCl were determined to be 0.211 and 0.355 M-1, respectively. We expect that the methodology reported in this paper can be applied equally well to interactions between a variety of salting-out agents and fluorescent biological and/or environmental molecules in aqueous solutions.

The functionalized nanotube samples were characterized by using established instrumental techniques. The absorption and emission results of the samples suggest that there are significant "intramolecular" excited-state energy transfers from both pyrene monomer and excimer to the linked nanotube, though the energy transfer efficiencies may be different between the monomer and excimer. The excimer formation can be limited by reducing the pyrenemethanol fraction to simplify the excited state processes, but contributions from the luminescence of the well-functionalized carbon nanotubes in the same wavelength region becomes an additional complication. Mechanistic implications of the photophysical results are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									13	0	0	1	0	13			1010-6030			WOS:000242913200014

Bacillus thuringiensis as a pest management tool for control of the squash vine borer, Melittia cucurbitae (Lepidoptera : Sesiidae) in South Carolina								JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION				114	1			26	29					JAN 2007	2007	A commercial formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis (Mattch) was evaluated under field conditions at Clemson, South Carolina, USA for control of the squash vine borer, Melittia cucurbitae (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), on yellow crookneck squash, Cucurbita pepo in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Two application methods were used: injection of the B. thuringiensis formulation directly into the main stem and spray foliage application. These were compared to an insecticide standard, endosulfan (Phaser), and an untreated check. In most cases, B. thuringiensis treated plots had significantly less damage than untreated plots and generally gave control equal to that of the insecticide standard, enclosulfan. In a trial 1998, the two methods were directly compared, the foliage sprays gave control equal to or better than the injection treatments. Even during the heaviest pest pressure (second trial, 1998), the B. thuringiensis treatments were as effective as enclosulfan in reducing the squash vine borer damage.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1861-3829			WOS:000244497400006

The goal of this study was to relate spectral canopy reflectance to plant nutritive value and species composition. Multiple grass/alfalfa fields were analyzed using a field spectrometer, and then species composition, forage nutritive quality, and plant biomass were determined. Derivative analyses of spectra as well as narrow-band vegetation indices were used to examine the relationship between canopy reflectance and plant biophysical properties. Derivative analysis found a high correlation between high-order derivatives at multiple wavelengths and some plant properties, which include species composition and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). Wavelengths in the red region and between the red and near-infrared region of the spectrum showed the highest correlation in the derivative analysis. Analysis of whole canopy reflectance using spectroscopy may provide a quick, nondestructive method to determine plant characteristics.									3	1	0	3	0	4			0190-4167	1532-4087		WOS:000252091100017

The onset crystallization-time difference for PP versus LDPE components is an important parameter that controls the orientation and morphology of the coextruded films. Although the overall molecular orientation of PP and LDPE was not significantly different in multi-layer films, single-layer LDPE films displayed some row-nucleation of crystals that was not observed in the LDPE layer in coextruded films. Also, there was a slight decrease of crystalline a-axis orientation for coextruded LDPE layer relative to that obtained for single-layer LDPE films.					64th Annual Technical Conference of the Society-of-Plastic-Engineers64th Annual Technical Conference of the Society-of-Plastic-Engineers	MAY 07-11, 2006MAY 07-11, 2006	Soc Plast EngineersSoc Plast Engineers	Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	6	0	0	0	0	6			8756-0879			WOS:000247871000002

To conduct adhesion measurements, the particles present in a CMP system were first attached to the surface of a silicon wafer covered with thin polymer film having high affinity for both particles and the silicon wafer. A silica glass sphere was attached to the AFM cantilever with an appropriate spring constant. The sphere represented the surface of the material being polished and was used as received or covered with a layer of copper. The sphere can be modified with various materials in future research. The AFM force volume mode, which uses the collection of the force-distance curves over selected surface areas, was used for the adhesion measurements. The adhesion in the systems studied was strongly dependent on the pH value of the aqueous environment, and the concentration and type of surfactants added.

CNT distribution was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, while CNT dispersion and alignment were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The specific gravity of the composite material was measured using a density gradient column, which indicates how well the nanotubes are integrated into the polymer matrix.

Bioindicators of immune function in creosote-adapted estuarine killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus								JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES				70	17			1433	1442		10.1080/15287390701382910			2007	2007	Several populations of the estuarine killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, also known as the mummichog, exhibit characteristics of adaptation to priority pollutants. One such population of mummichog inhabits the Elizabeth River in Virginia at the Atlantic Wood site (AW), a U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund site heavily contaminated with creosote containing a mixture of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Although PAHs are known to be immunotoxic in experimental animals, resident AW mummichogs seem to thrive. Mummichogs from the AW site and a reference site were subsequently examined over a 2-yr period for total immunoglobin (IgM), as well as circulating antibody levels against 5 ubiquitous marine bacteria. Expression profiles of circulating and lymphoid lysozyme and lymphoid cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were also examined. Compared to relatively high total IgM and specific antibody responses in reference fish, AW mummichogs had lower circulating IgM and lower specific antibody levels against all bacteria examined, however they had higher levels of circulating lysozyme. Lymphoid cells in the AW mummichogs also expressed higher levels of lysozyme, as well as COX-2, which may indicate a state of macrophage activation. Elevated COX-2 levels may be associated with enhanced metabolism of PAHs through cooxidation-peroxidase pathways. Additional studies attempted to immunize AW mummichogs reared in uncontaminated water to compare their antibody responses to that of reference fish. AW mummichogs did not survive 40 d post culture, while reference fish thrived. Our findings suggest that the chemical environment at the AW site may be vicariously enhancing components of innate immunity, probably through oxidative stress pathways, in resident mummichogs, while actively suppressing humoral immune responses.									12	0	0	11	0	12			1528-7394			WOS:000249192400004	17687729

Alterations in immune function and CYP450 activity in adult male deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) following exposure to benzo[a] pyrene, pyrene, or chrysene								JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES				70	21			1783	1791		10.1080/15287390701384643			2007	2007	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) are among the most common classes of chemical contaminants found at hazardous waste sites. Deer mice ( Peromyscus maniculatus) exhibit a wide geographic distribution throughout North America and have been suggested as a terrestrial biomonitoring species to facilitate comparisons between superfund sites. Chemicals tested were benzo[ a] pyrene ( BaP; CAS number 50- 32- 8), pyrene ( Pyr; CAS number 129- 00- 0), and chrysene ( Chr; CAS number 218- 01- 9). Adult male deer mice were exposed via intraperitoneal ( ip) injection every other day for 11 d to the PAHs ( 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/ kg) or a corn oil carrier control. Both BaP and Chr suppressed the plaque- forming cell ( PFC) response at all treatment levels. Pyr exposure ( 1 - 30 mg/ kg) also resulted in suppression of this response. Macrophage pinocytosis was suppressed only by Chr ( 3, 10, and 30 mg/ kg). Concanavalin A- induced proliferation was stimulated by BaP at all dose levels, by Pyr at 1 - 30 mg/ kg, and by Chr at 30 mg/ kg. Chr did not affect pokeweed mitogen ( PWM)induced proliferation; however, BaP ( 1 - 30 mg/ kg) and Pyr ( 0.3 - 30 mg/ kg) produced stimulation of this response as compared to respective controls. BaP and Chr stimulated cytochrome P- 450 1A1 ( CYP1A1) activity ( 3, 10, or 30 mg/ kg) as measured by ethoxyresorufin O- deethylase ( EROD) activity, but Pyr did not. These results indicate that immune function endpoints appear to be more sensitive to these PAHs than measured hepatic CYP450 activity.									8	0	0	7	0	8			1528-7394			WOS:000250517100001	17934950

J	Hollandsworth, Bobby L.; Foy, Jennifer								Griffin search: how Westminster college implemented WebFeat								LIBRARY HI TECH				25	2			211	219		10.1108/07378830710754974			2007	2007	Purpose - This paper aims to shed light on federated search engine solutions by documenting how Westminster College implemented a new system after a failed attempt.Design/methodology/approach - The librarians became interested in a new federated search solution after a previous vendor was unable to provide a satisfactory product. After seeing demonstration from several vendors, the librarians decided on WebFeat. This paper chronicles that decision and its implementation, which surprisingly took less than three months.Findings - The librarians found WebFeat to be a superior product in comparison with the first federated search engine. WebFeat made an immediate impact on how the students and faculty searched for information. The seamless integration into the library web page made it easier for users to search databases and the library catalog without confusion and frustration.Originality/value - The value of this paper comes from the fact that the library became a "federated search casualty" after adopting a system in 2003 that did not live up to expectation and eventually had to be terminated. WebFeat was the next choice, and it has performed above expectations. The librarians witnessed the failure of one federated search engine solution and the success of another over the past three years.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0737-8831			WOS:000248061200005

The content of Irgafos 168 was not detected in 5 kGy treated samples and the content of Irganox 1076 decreased by 34.9% from the initial level in 10 kGy treated samples. The radiolysis products, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP), 1,3-di-tert-butylbenzene (1,3-DTBB), and toluene were identified and their concentrations gradually increased as the irradiation dose increased. Migration of Irgafos 168 from the LLDPE pouch into food simulants, distilled water, acetic acid (4 ml/100 ml distilled water) or ethanol (20 ml/100 ml distilled water), was not detected at dose levels up to 200 kGy while that of the Irganox 1076 was detected in a decreasing mode with increasing dose.

Edible films made from membrane processed soy protein concentrates								LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				40	3			418	423		10.1016/j.lwt.2006.02.003			2007	2007	Edible films were prepared from membrane processed soy protein concentrate (MSC) at various film forming solution pHs, and their mechanical, barrier, and physical properties were compared with soy protein isolate (SPI) films. As the film solution pH increased from 7 to 10, the resulted MSC films were more transparent, yellowish, and had lower oxygen permeabilities. However, tensile strength (TS), modulus of elasticity (ME) and water vapor permeabilities of MSC films were not affected by film solution pHs. The values of MSC films prepared at pH 7 were not significantly (P > 0.05) different from those of SPI films prepared at alkaline solutions (pH 8-10). The uniform TS and ME values of MSC film over the wide film solution pH ranges were attributed to the higher solubility of MSC at pH 7. For the films formed at neutral film solutions (pH 7.0), MSC films showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher elongation value, film solubility, and transparency compared to SPT films.

The turbidity of the immersion solution increased with extensive storage time while total sugar of yams exhibited the tendency to lessen. The composition of free sugars ranged in the order of fructose > glucose > sucrose except for the samples processed by hand-peeling electrolyzed water and anhydrous storage. The machine peeling showed the suppression of microorganisms that was 1 log cycle lower than hand peeling except EW-2-S. In both hand- and machine-peeled treatments of immersion storage, the effectiveness of the suppression of microorganisms was in the order of 0.6% acetic acid (AA) > EW-1-S > EW-2-S. The results of sensory characteristics of hand-peeled yam were slightly higher than the machine-peeled yam. Overall acceptance of sensory characteristics were: the sample processed by electrolyzed water and hydrous treatment (EW-1-S, EW-2-S) > the sample processed by electrolyzed water and anhydrous storage (EW-1-NS, EW-2-NS) > the sample processed by 0.6%AA and hydrous storage (0.6%AA). The results show that electrolyzed water and hydrous storage is effective on the storage of yams.

Gellan and kappa-carrageenan were added to improve properties of the fish gelatin films. Initially, polysaccharides were added to make fish gelatin gels, and tested for the melting point. Mechanical, barrier, color and microstructure properties, as well as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and thermal analysis (DSC) of the modified fish gelatin films were evaluated. The addition of gellan and K-carrageenan increased the melting point of fish gelatin gels, gellan being more effective. Polysaccharides modified fish gelatin films by increasing tensile strength and barrier against water vapor, but made films slightly darker. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) microstructure analysis revealed that gellan eliminated cracks present in the film matrix resulting in a more uniform structure. FTIR and DSC analyses showed that both polysaccharides effectively interacted with fish gelatin, and moreover, gellan being more effective. Overall, addition of gellan up to 2g/100g of gelatin performed better in enhancing fish gelatin films properties. (c) 2006 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Investigating the antioxidant properties of oxo-sulfur compounds on metal-mediated DNA damage								MAIN GROUP CHEMISTRY				6	3-4			143	153		10.1080/10241220802012387			2007	2007	The organosulfur compounds allicin, methionine and methylcysteine protect against metal-mediated oxidative DNA damage, but few studies have determined the antioxidant behaviour of the oxo-sulfur derivatives of these compounds. Gel electrophoresis experiments were performed to determine the ability of MetSO, MeCysSO, MMTS, MePhSO and Me(2)SO(2) to inhibit copper- and iron-mediated DNA damage. Under these conditions, MetSO and MeCysSO significantly inhibit DNA damage, MePhSO and Me(2)SO(2) have no effect and MMTS promotes DNA damage. For iron-mediated DNA damage, significantly less antioxidant or pro-oxidant behaviour is observed for these compounds. To determine whether metal coordination is a mechanism for the antioxidant activity of these oxo-sulfur compounds, UV-vis spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis experiments using [Cu(bipy)(2)](+) or [Fe(EDTA)](2-) as the metal source were also performed. Results of these experiments indicate that metal coordination is a significant factor for their antioxidant activity, but another mechanism also contributes to their antioxidant behaviour.

Contrasting arsine and phosphine coordination behaviour: heteroleptic palladium(II) complexes with triphenylarsine and a crown thioether								MAIN GROUP CHEMISTRY				6	3-4			249	261		10.1080/10241220801927767			2007	2007	The synthesis, spectroscopic data and crystal structures of two new mononuclear Pd(II) heteroleptic complexes with the crown trithioether 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane (9S3) and the arsine ligand, triphenylarsine (AsPh(3)) are presented. Reaction between [Pd(9S3)Cl(2)] and AsPh(3) (1: 2 stoichiometry) in nitromethane followed by metathesis to the hexafluorophosphate salt results in the formation of two different palladium(II) complexes, the expected bis arsine complex [Pd(9S(3))(AsPh(3))(2)](PF(6))(2) as well as, surprisingly, the intermediate mono arsine-chloro complex [Pd(9S3)(AsPh(3))(Cl)](PF(6)). Both complexes exhibit the anticipated structure consisting of a cis square planar array of two sulfur atoms from the 9S3 and either two As donors (bis AsPh(3) complex) or one As and one Cl donor (mono AsPh(3) complex). The third 9S3 sulfur atom exhibits a long distance interaction with the palladium forming an elongated square pyramidal geometry with a coordination environment around the Pd best described as [S(2)Lambda s(2) vertical bar S(1)] or [S(2)Lambda sCl vertical bar S(1)]. Structural, spectroscopic, and reactivity differences are observed between the arsine and related phosphine complexes due to the poorer donor qualities of AsPh(3).

Basin-scale patterns of mtDNA differentiation and gene flow in the bay scallop Argopecten irradians concentricus								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				349				139	150		10.3354/meps07045			2007	2007	The bay scallop Argopecten irradians concentricus Say is a commercially and recreationally important species along the East Coast of the US that consistently shows evidence of recruitment limitation. To determine if limited planktonic larval exchange between populations inhabiting lagoonal basins or sounds contributes to recruitment limitation in central North Carolina, a hypervariable portion of mtDNA (885 bp) was sequenced from 219 adults from 4 sounds (Topsail, Bogue, Back, and Pamlico), 3 of which (Bogue, Back, and Pamlico) are connected by inshore waterways. Although the largest sound (Pamlico) harbored the greatest genetic diversity, diversity was high in all 4 sounds, with no evidence of recent bottlenecks. An analysis of molecular variance indicates significant genetic structure among sounds (phi(CT) = 0. 0069, p = 0.023); all pairwise comparisons among sounds were significant, with the exception of those involving Pamlico Sound. Despite being connected by a short (3 km) inshore waterway, adjacent Bogue and Back Sounds were highly significantly differentiated (phi(CT)=0.0145, p = 0.000). Coalescent-based estimates of gene flow indicated that most sounds exchange <= 4 migrants each generation. Bogue and Back Sound populations, which were heavily impacted by a localized red tide outbreak in 1983 and which subsequently experienced a recruitment failure, each receive <4 migrants each generation from all other sounds combined. Dynamic physical processes in the vicinity of Beaufort Inlet can explain such limited larval exchange between Bogue and Back Sounds, but if dispersal is primarily controlled by tidally dominated surface flow, net dispersal distances may be limited throughout the region. Therefore, patterns of gene flow and genetic differentiation are consistent with the hypothesis that individual sounds are demographically independent and are closed with respect to fishery management issues.									12	0	0	12	0	12			0171-8630			WOS:000251565400013		
J	Wang, James Z.; Du, Zhidian; Srimani, Pradip K.								Cooperative proxy caching for wireless base stations								MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS				3	1			1	18					2007	2007	This paper proposes a mobile cache model to facilitate the cooperative proxy caching in wireless base stations. This mobile cache model uses a network cache line to record the caching state information about a web document for effective data search and cache space management. Based on the proposed mobile cache model, a P2P cooperative proxy caching scheme is proposed to use a self-configured and self-managed virtual proxy graph (VPG), independent of the underlying wireless network structure and adaptive to the network and geographic environment changes, to achieve efficient data search, data cache and date replication. Based on demand, the aggregate effect of data caching, searching and replicating actions by individual proxy servers automatically migrates the cached web documents closer to the interested clients. In addition, a cache line migration (CLM) strategy is proposed to flow and replicate the heads of network cache lines of web documents associated with a moving mobile host to the new base station during the mobile host handoff. These replicated cache line heads provide direct links to the cached web documents accessed by the moving mobile hosts in the previous base station, thus improving the mobile web caching performance. Performance studies have shown that the proposed P2P cooperative proxy caching schemes significantly outperform existing caching schemes.									7	1	0	0	0	7			1574-017X			WOS:000262909600001

The original eDPD method is extended to account for the interfacial thermal resistance occurs at the angstrom-wide interface between materials, and we also investigated the choice of time step in eDPD simulations. For nanocomposite with randomly dispersed nanoparticles, the eDPD simulations predict that the thermal conductivity of matrix material can be enhanced by embedding high thermal conductivity nanoparticles, but the effectiveness of such a strategy diminishes as the interfacial thermal resistance between the nanoparticle and matrix material increases. These results are in quantitative agreement with the classical Maxwell-Garnett model. Further simulations indicate that the enhancement of thermal conductivity can be affected by the alignment of nanoparticles with respect to the temperature gradient, which cannot be predicted by the classical models. These simulation results indicate that eDPD method can be a versatile method for studying thermal transport in heterogeneous materials and complex systems.									37	0	0	0	0	37			0892-7022	1029-0435		WOS:000248941300008		
S	Saeldpourazar, Reza; Jalili, Nader						Varadan, VK		Memory-based robust adaptive control of a variable length stepping nanomanipulator								Nanosensors, Microsensors, and Biosensors and Systems 2007		PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		6528				52816	52816	UNSP 652816	10.1117/12.715824			2007	2007	This paper presents the modeling and memory-based robust adaptive control of a variable length stepping nanomanipulator. A three degree of freedom (3DOF) nanomanipulator with revolute revolute prismatic (RRP) actuator structure, namely here MM3A, is utilized for a variety of nanomanipulation tasks. Unlike widely used Cartesian-structure nanomanipulators, the MM3A is equipped with revolute-piezoelectric actuators which result in outstanding performance for controlling the nanomanipulator's tip alignment during the nanomanipulation process. However, the RRP structure of the nanomanipulator introduces complicity in kinematic and dynamic equations of the system which needs to be addressed in order to control the nanornampulation process. Dissimilar to the ordinary piezoelectric actuators which provide only a couple of micrometers working range, the piezoelectric actuators utilized in MM3A, namely Nanomotors (R), provide wide range of action (120 degrees in revolute actuators and 12mm in prismatic actuator) with sub-nano scale precision (0.1 mu rad in revolute actuators and 0.25 nm in prismatic actuator). This wide range of action combined with sub-nano scale precision is achieved using a special stick/slip moving principle of the Nanomotors (R). However, such stick/slip motion re.,sults in stepping movement of the MM3A. Hence, due to the RRP structure and stepping movement principle of the MM3A nanomanipulator, controller design for the nanomanipulation process is not a trivial task. In this paper, a novel memory-based robust adaptive controller is proposed to overcome these shortfalls. Following the development of the memory-based robust adaptive controller, numerical simulations of the proposed controller are preformed to demonstrate the positioning performance capability of the controller in nanomanipulation tasks.

Application of such problem is utilized in several nanotechnological instruments such as atomic force microscopy, nanomechanical cantilever sensors and friction force microscopy. The actuation and sensing are both facilitated through bonding a piezoelectric layer (here, ZnO) on the microcantilever surface. The piezoelectric properties combined with nonlinear geometry of the beam introduce both linear and nonlinear coupling between flexural vibration as well as longitudinal and torsional vibrations. The governing equations of motion are obtained with piezoelectric nonlinearity appearing in quadratic form while inertia and stiffness nonlinearities as cubic. An experimental setup consisting of a commercial piezoelectric microcantilever installed on the stand of an ultramodern laser-based microsystem analyzer is designed and utilized to verify the theoretical developments. First and second flexural natural frequencies are both experimentally and numerically obtained and are shown to be in good agreement. Both linear and nonlinear simulation results are compared with experimental results and it is observed that nonlinear modeling response matches the experimental findings very closely.

Specific United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) research objectives are to: (1) evaluate traditional farm equipment for flax production, (2) improve retting, especially through use of enzymes, (3) develop objective standards for fiber quality testing, and (4) test fibers for manufacturing performance and/or aesthetic properties. Fiber flax for short staple uses can be rapidly harvested by equipment readily available on US farms. Warm southern climates allow this crop to be grown in the winter to produce flax on traditionally dormant fields. Enzymes to extract fibers provide an environmentally friendly method for reliable and sustainable agriculture. Commercial enzymes and calcium chelating agents provide a key step in the economic development of a controlled and scientific approach to efficiently produce fibers of high and consistent quality. A USDA Flax Pilot Plant based on commercially available equipment provides better understandings of fiber quality parameters, fiber standards, processing costs, and eliminates uncertainties of raw material supply. ASTM International standards are being developed to judge flax fiber for quality related to processing and marketing decisions. Flax fiber blended with cotton and spun by vortex, rotor, and ring-spinning equipment at the Cotton Quality Research Station (CQRS), ARS-USDA, provide a final stage of evaluation.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-9761849-7-3	WOS:000268468400027

The change in signal per unit thickness (25 mu m) is used to describe each technique resolution, when using a pulsed-thermographic procedure and a UVF spectroscopic analysis. Furthermore, Tanimoto criterion in addition to a local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computation measure the revealability of pinholes, the IRT technique provides an 83% revealability while the UVF imaging has a 66% value. The goal of this work is to benchmark the novel UVF approach against that of the IRT procedures. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0963-8695			WOS:000242411700009

Many of the challenges in tissue engineering generally and biofabrication specifically are biological in nature; however, many appear to fall within the realm of imaging and science and technology. One challenge is to arrange the donor cells into the exact patterns that will promote growth towards the desired tissue form and function. Of the many approaches that have been suggested to accurately place cells the inkjet printing approach is one of the more interesting. In these devices researchers have tailored their bioinks by two approaches, namely using new biomaterials that fit the processing window of commercial printers or developing new systems that use the biomaterials as bioink directly. Tailoring the physical properties of these inks, and developing printheads optimized for these properties will improve cell density, and the tissue fabrication speed. Biofabricated tissues can be used to build models of the effects of local environment on different cell types. The models can be incorporated into computer design and simulation environment in order to predict tissue function.					23rd International Conference on Digital Printing Technologies/Digital Fabrication 2007 Conference23rd International Conference on Digital Printing Technologies/Digital Fabrication 2007 Conference	SEP 16-21, 2007SEP 16-21, 2007	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol; Imaging Soc JapanSoc Imaging Sci & Technol; Imaging Soc Japan	Anchorage, AKAnchorage, AK	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-0-89208-273-5	WOS:000251941400004		
J	Gao, Honghai; Huang, Jianmin; Barany, Francis; Cao, Weiguo								Switching base preferences of mismatch cleavage in endonuclease V: an improved method for scanning point mutations								NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH				35	1					E2	10.1093/nar/gkl916			JAN 2007	2007	Endonuclease V (endo V) recognizes a broad range of aberrations in DNA such as deaminated bases or mismatches. It nicks DNA at the second phosphodiester bond 3' to a deaminated base or a mismatch. Endonuclease V obtained from Thermotoga maritima preferentially cleaves purine mismatches in certain sequence context. Endonuclease V has been combined with a high-fidelity DNA ligase to develop an enzymatic method for mutation scanning. A biochemical screening of site-directed mutants identified mutants in motifs III and IV that altered the base preferences in mismatch cleavage. Most profoundly, a single alanine substitution at Y80 position switched the enzyme to essentially a C-specific mismatch endonuclease, which recognized and cleaved A/C, C/A, T/C, C/T and even the previously refractory C/C mismatches. Y80A can also detect the G13D mutation in K-ras oncogene, an A/C mismatch embedded in a G/C rich sequence context that was previously inaccessible using the wild-type endo V. This investigation offers insights on base recognition and active site organization. Protein engineering in endo V may translate into better tools in mutation recognition and cancer mutation scanning.									9	0	0	8	0	9			0305-1048			WOS:000243805800002	17130153

The domain-domain structures are generated by parsing single chain structures into loosely connected domains and are important features of the database. The database (http://www.ces.clemson.edu/compbio/protcom) could be used for benchmarking purposes of the docking and other algorithms for predicting 3D structures of protein-protein complexes. The database can be utilized as a template database in the homology or threading methods for modeling the 3D structures of unknown protein-protein complexes. PROTCOM provides the scientific community with an integrated set of tools for browsing, searching, visualizing and downloading a pool of protein complexes. The user is given the option to select a subset of entries using a combination of up to 10 different criteria. As on July 2006 the database contains 1770 entries, each of which consists of the known 3D structures and additional relevant information that can be displayed either in text-only or in visual mode.									32	0	0	29	0	33			0305-1048			WOS:000243494600116	17071962

The participating nodes can no longer keep track of even a small fraction of the knowledge about the global network due to limited storage. We need a new paradigm of localized distributed algorithms, where a node takes simple actions based on local knowledge of only its immediate neighbors and yet the system achieves a global objective. Self-stabilization is a relatively new paradigm for designing such localized distributed algorithms for networks; it is an optimistic way of looking at system fault tolerance and scalable coordination; it provides a cost effective built-in safeguard against transient failures that might corrupt data in a distributed system. We introduce self-stabilizing protocol design with the example of a total dominating set in a network graph and discuss some open problems.					5th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing and Applications/ISPA 2007 International Workshops5th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing and Applications/ISPA 2007 International Workshops	AUG 29-31, 2007AUG 29-31, 2007		Niagara Falls, CANADANiagara Falls, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-540-74741-3	WOS:000249626600001

Based on our spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy studies, this report shows the binding of lysophospholipids onto carbon nanotubes is dependent on the charge and geometry of the lipids and the pH of the solvent, and independent of solvent temperature. From molecular dynamics simulations, the binding of lysophospholipids onto carbon nanotubes does not fully obey any of the models proposed in the literature. We also studied carbon nanotube diffusion using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, and carbon nanotube - lipid binding and dissociation using the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The use of carbon nanotube - lipid assembly for enabling nanotoxicological studies is demonstrated by the uptake of the assembly in the living organism Daphnia magna.									31	1	0	4	0	31			1463-9076			WOS:000243564400001	17216058

We present x-ray absorption spectra that show unequivocally that Yb is nearly divalent in YbGaGe and the valence does not change with temperature or with nominally 1% B or 5% C impurities, ruling out a valence-fluctuation mechanism. Moreover, substantial changes occur in the local structure around Yb with B and C inclusion. Together with inelastic neutron scattering measurements, these data indicate a strong tendency for the lattice to disorder, providing a possible explanation for NZTE in YbGaGe.									6	0	0	1	0	6			1098-0121			WOS:000243894600009

The numerical algorithm employed in the calculation is based on the direct numerical integration of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation in a spin-dependent variant of the particle-source method. We find that the spin-precession length L(s), controlled by the strength of the Rashba coupling, establishes the critical length scale that marks the significant reduction of the spin-Hall conductivity in bulk systems. In contrast, the electron mean free path, inversely proportional to the strength of disorder, appears to have only a minor effect.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1098-0121			WOS:000243895400107

Each processor simulates a replica at a driving rate that is M times faster than the desired rate, where M is the number of processors. As in regular parallel replica dynamics, when a transition to a new state is detected on any processor, the times are summed and every processor is restarted in the new state. The state-to-state dynamics are shown to be correct if the processors run at the same speed and the system is driven slowly enough (on each processor) so that the escape rates do not depend on the time history of the drive. We demonstrate the algorithm by stretching a carbon nanotube with a preexisting vacancy, noting a significant dependence of the nature of nanotube yield on the strain rate. In particular, we are able to achieve strain rates slow enough such that the time scale for vacancy diffusion is faster than that for mechanical yield at a temperature of 2000 K. We thus observe vacancy-induced morphological changes in the nanotube structure, providing some insight into previously unexplained experimental features.									26	1	0	0	0	26			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000243894600058

Several approaches to kinematic analysis of continuum trunks complement a wide variety of available continuum robots. However, these kinematics exhibit singularity-like conditions when the trunk assumes a straight posture, which is essential to complete many tasks. The novel limiting-case analysis presented in this paper eliminates these problems, demonstrating that the unique causes of the problem are rooted in the continuum formulation and cannot be solved by traditional rigid-link singularity analysis. Three practical examples demonstrate the necessity of this analysis presented, enabling the trunk to successfully perform each task.

Also, these hospitals carry out tests to become familiar with the sequence of events that need to occur for an effective evacuation. However, risk managers only have a limited number of scenarios that they can actually consider for testing, due to time constraints or complexity in performing the tests. They can not make sure of the efficiency and effectiveness of their plans. Inefficient and ineffective evacuation plan may result in tragic loss of life as occurred in evacuation of hospitals as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This research proposes a simulation model that can be used by the hospitals to evaluate their performances in case of an evacuation due to a hurricane.					2007 Winter Simulation Conference2007 Winter Simulation Conference	DEC 09-12, 2007DEC 09-12, 2007		Washington, DCWashington, DC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-1305-8	WOS:000256071800131

In an effort to significantly increase their throughput capability, the company created a new production scheme based on takt time calculations. To achieve a smooth flow of production, they desired low Work In Process (WIP) inventory in order to make all components move simultaneously. However, the order of operations in key shared resources implies that a simple takt time calculation cannot provide enough information in determining achievable throughput. The process includes several parallel assembly lines that "converge" to common resources. In certain cases, these components are joined into one unit; in other cases the components split again for further customization. We attempt to improve throughput using a combination of takt time and simulation by understanding how each stage of the system interacts with other stages.					2007 Winter Simulation Conference2007 Winter Simulation Conference	DEC 09-12, 2007DEC 09-12, 2007		Washington, DCWashington, DC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-1305-8	WOS:000256071801029

Cellular levels of lipids are tightly regulated, and alterations in lipid metabolism can cause various human diseases such as inflammation, cancer and neurological disorders. Here, we present a method that takes an amino acid sequence as the only input and predicts lipid-interacting residues using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Protein sequence datasets with known lipid-interacting residues were chosen from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). SVM classifiers were then constructed using data instances encoded with three sequence features. The results suggest that lipid-interacting residues can be predicted at 52.78% sensitivity and 70.84% specificity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that utilizes a machine learning approach to predict lipid-interacting residues based on amino acid sequence data. Our study provides useful information for understanding protein-lipid interactions, and may lead to advances in drug discovery.					7th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering7th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering	OCT 14-17, 2007OCT 14-17, 2007	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Engn Med Biol; NSF; Int Soc Intelligent Biol Med; Syst, Man, Cybermet SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Engn Med Biol; NSF; Int Soc Intelligent Biol Med; Syst, Man, Cybermet Soc	Boston, MABoston, MA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-1509-0	WOS:000252958200054

Such spatial and temporal control of the chemistry and pattern geometry can provide new insights into fundamental aspects of cell-surface interactions. For example, cellular development can be dramatically effected by constraining cells to spread over a specific cell-surface contact area. The cell and biomaterial printing techniques developed here may prove particularly useful for exploring the interactions of anchorage-dependent cells with their environment in vitro. Our recent studies addressed the simultaneous printing of endothelial cells and biomaterials. The studies further demonstrated that cells can be printed onto polymer scaffolds or fibers without significant loss of cell activity. A combination of these methods may result in the construction of vascularized tissue with mechanical properties approaching those of native tissue.

ASME					Micro-feature replication via polymer molding at ambient pressure								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING - 2007								171	177					2007	2007	The study focuses on the ability of a polymer to replicate micro-features when processed at an elevated mold temperature without externally applied pressure. Replication is performed using four different polymers-High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polypropylene (PP), Polystyrene (PS), and Poly (Methyl Methacrylate) (PMMA) on a silicon mold containing surface features as small as 500nm. Feature replication is assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to compare feature dimensions of the mold to those of the replicated parts. Shrinkage in dimensions is observed to be anisotropic in the molded parts and its extent of varies among the different polymers. Crystalline HDPE shows a higher degree of shrinkage relative to amorphous polymers such as PS and PMMA. These results verify the theoretical value of shrinkage calculated from the coefficient of volumetric shrinkage values and density. By increasing the mold temperature well above the melting point of the polymer, a depth ratio of 70-80% can be achieved in parts having aspect ratios of around 0.5. The result is comparable to the values achieved by similar studies. Varying aspect ratios are fully replicated by all four polymers at elevated mold temperature. This clearly shows that increasing mold temperature results in significant improvement in depth ratios for micro-featured parts. The amorphous materials provide better feature replication and lower surface roughness than the semi-crystalline polymer.

The end goal is production of flexure-based artifacts that exhibit low fabrication expense, stiffness adjustability by design, insensitivity to load application point, mechanical robustness, and good reproducibility. Experimental determination of AFM cantilever spring constants is important because the measured forces are inferred from the cantilever displacement and a linear relationship between force and displacement.As a first step in this study, we have constructed a test setup that enables us to: 1) monitor AFM cantilever behavior during loading; and 2) record the shape of the cantilever under test during contact to better understand boundary conditions. The fundamental metrology tool employed by the test setup is a three-dimensional optical profiler, or scanning white light interferometer. By locating the cantilever (and test surface) within the measurement area of the profiler, we are able to record "snapshots" of the cantilever shape under various loading conditions. Given the deflected shape, we can make comparisons between the actual shape and the profile that would be obtained by ideal (fixed-free) boundary conditions. Results for cantilevers with various stiffness values (spanning four orders of magnitude) are presented and comparisons with ideal deflected shapes are provided.

ASME					Implementing point assignment using octrees and GPU								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING - 2007								573	580					2007	2007	Data point set registration is an important operation in coordinate metrology. Registration is the operation by which sampled point clouds are aligned with a CAD model by a 4X4 homogeneous transformation (e.g., rotation and translation). This alignment permits validation of the produced artifact's geometry. Registration is an iterative nonlinear optimization operation assigning points on the CAD model for the sampled points. The objective is to minimize the sum of the squares of the normal distances between each point in the point cloud and the closest point in the CAD model. State-of-the-art metrology systems are now capable of generating thousands, if not millions, of data points during an inspection operation, resulting in increased computational power to fully utilize these larger data sets. The execution time for assigning the point set in registration process is directly related to the number of points processed and CAD model complexity. A brute force approach to registration, which is often used, is to compute the minimum distance between each sampled point and its normal projection on the CAD model. As the point cloud size and CAD model complexity increase, this approach becomes intractable and inefficient. This paper proposes a new approach to efficiently identify the closest point in the CAD model for a given point. This approach employs a combination of readily available computer hardware, graphical processor unit (GPU) and a formulation of the point assignment problem, using an octree data structure that is suited for execution on the GPU.

The methods and techniques by which to accomplish these tasks has been the focus of numerous studies in recent years. With the rapid advances in computing technology, the complexity and overhead that can be feasibly incorporated in any developed technique has dramatically improved. Thus, techniques that would have been impractical for implementation just a few years ago can now be realistically applied.This rapid growth has resulted in a wealth of new capabilities for improving part and process quality and reliability. In this paper, overviews of recent advances that apply to machining are presented. Moreover, due to the relative significance of two particular machining aspects, this review focuses specifically on research publications pertaining to using tool condition monitoring and coordinate measurement machines to improve the machining process.Tool condition has a direct effect on part quality and is discussed first. The application of tool condition monitoring as it applies to turning, drilling, milling, and grinding is presented. The subsequent section provides recommendations for future research opportunities. The ensuing section focuses on the use of coordinate measuring machines in conjunction with machining and is subdivided with respect to integration with machining tools, inspection planning and efficiency, advanced controller feedback, machine error compensation, and on-line tool calibration, in that specific order and concludes with recommendations regarding where future needs remain.

Experimental study of scalar filtered mass density function in turbulent partially premixed flames								PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE				31				1533	1541		10.1016/j.proci.2006.07.099			2007	2007	The mixture fraction filtered mass density function (FMDF) used in large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent combustion is studied experimentally using line images obtained in turbulent partially premixed methane flames (Sandia flames D and E). Cross-stream filtering is employed to obtain the FMDF and other filtered variables. The means of the FMDF conditional on the subgrid-scale (SGS) scalar variance at a given location are found to vary from close to Gaussian to bimodal, indicating well-mixed and non-premixed SGS mixing regimes, respectively. The bimodal SGS scalar has a structure (ramp-cliff) similar to the counter-flow model for laminar flamelets. Therefore, while the burden on mixing models to predict the well-mixed SGS scalar is expected to lessen with decreasing filter scale, the burden to predict the bimodal one is not. These SGS scalar structures can result in fluctuations of the SGS flame structure between distributed reaction zones and laminar flamelets, but for reasons different from the scalar dissipation rate fluctuations associated with the turbulence cascade. Furthermore, the bimodal SGS scalar contributes a significant amount of the scalar dissipation in the reaction zones, highlighting its importance and the need for mixing models to predict the bimodal FMDFs.

Hrotko, K		Growth and yield of 'Redhaven' peach on nineteen rootstocks at twenty north American locations								Proceedings of the Eighth International Symposium on Canopy, Rootstocks and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems		ACTA HORTICULTURAE			732			271	278					2007	2007	Nineteen Prunus rootstock cultivars and selections budded with 'Redhaven' peach were planted at 20 locations in North America in 1994 as a uniform planting of the NC-140 Cooperative Regional Rootstock Project. The rootstocks included peach seedlings from 'Lovell', 'Nemaguard', 'Bailey', 'Tennessee Natural 281-1', 'Stark's Redleaf, 'GF 305', 'Higama', 'Montelar', 'Rubira', 'Chui Lum Tao', 'Tzim Pee Tao', 'H7338013', 'H7338019', 'BY520-8' and 'Guardian (R) BY520-9'. Clonal rootstocks included 'Ishtara', 'Myran', 'S.2729' and 'Ta Tao 5' interstem on 'Lovell'. Data were summarized across the 20 sites in 18 states and provinces over eight years. 'Myran' was the most vigorous rootstock followed by 'S.2729' and 'Guardiang BY520-9'. 'Ishtara', 'Tzim Pee Tao' and 'Chui Lum Tao' produced the smallest trees. Fruit weight was significantly influenced by rootstock as 'Redhaven' fruit from 'BY520-8' and 'Ta Tao 5' interstem trees were smaller (similar to 10 g) and fruit from 'Ishtaral and 'H7338013' were larger (6-7 g) than fruit from trees on 'Lovell'. Cumulative fruit yield (1996-2001) significantly varied among rootstocks, and yield differences were evident among locations as the highest cumulative fruit yields were from Ohio, north central New Jersey, Maryland and South Carolina. No rootstock yielded significantly more than 'Lovell'. However, 'GF 305', 'Montclar', 'Guardiang BY520-9' and 'H7338019' yielded equivalent to 'Lovell'. In contrast, 'Ishtara', 'Chui Lum Tao', 'Tzim Pee Tao', 'Bailey', 'Higama' and 'Rubira' and the 'Ta Tao 5' interstem trees often had significantly lower yields than 'Lovell'.					8th International Symposium on Canopy, Rootstocks and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems8th International Symposium on Canopy, Rootstocks and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	JUN 13-18, 2004JUN 13-18, 2004	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Budapest, HUNGARYBudapest, HUNGARY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-6605-128-7	WOS:000246176200040

Hrotko, K		Survival, growth and yield of 'Carogem' peach on an interstem and two dwarfing rootstocks								Proceedings of the Eighth International Symposium on Canopy, Rootstocks and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems		ACTA HORTICULTURAE			732			303	306					2007	2007	Size controlling rootstocks for intensive orchard systems, and interstems to delay phenology to reduce frost risk, were evaluated for peach in South Carolina. A high-density 'Carogem' peach orchard was established on heavy clay soil in February 1998 at the Musser Fruit Research Center, near Clemson, South Carolina. The orchard had 4-tree plots of four treatments consisting of 'Carogem' budded to a 30-40 cm Prunus sp. interstem (=PKI) on 'Lovell' rootstock, and to three other non-peach rootstocks, 'Jaspi', 'Pumiselect (R)' and 'Micronette'. Trees were spaced at 2.2 x 6.1 in and trained to a Kearney perpendicular-V system. Full bloom date, fruit maturity date, fruit yield, fruit size, trunk cross-sectional area, bacterial canker (Pseudomonas syringae) resistance and survival were recorded annually through 2003. All 'Carogem' on 'Jaspi' trees died in the springs of 1999 and 2000 from bacterial canker. After 6 years, PKI interstem trees had a lower survival percentage (68%) than trees on P. pumila rootstocks (81-88%). The majority of these dead trees died from waterlogging and Phytophthora spp. Some trees on P. pumila rootstocks were leaning. PKI interstem trees delayed full bloom by an average of 8 days for 4 years when compared to the two P. pumila rootstocks. Scion trunk cross-sectional area was significantly reduced by 18% on 'Pumiselect (R)' rootstock. Pruning times and pruning weights for P. pumila rootstocks in January 2004 were reduced by an average of 20% and 45%, respectively, compared to PK1 trees. The PK1 interstem delayed fruit maturity an average of similar to 2 days and had the highest cumulative fruit yields, followed by 'Micronette' and then 'Pumiselect (R)'. PKI trees also had the highest cumulative yield efficiency and fruit size was similar to 25% larger than with P. pumila trees. 'Jaspi' was highly susceptible to bacterial canker, but the P. pumila rootstocks survived as well as or better than 'Lovell' rootstock.					8th International Symposium on Canopy, Rootstocks and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems8th International Symposium on Canopy, Rootstocks and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	JUN 13-18, 2004JUN 13-18, 2004	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Budapest, HUNGARYBudapest, HUNGARY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-6605-128-7	WOS:000246176200045

Hrotko, K		The peach latent mosaic viroid in the Kearney-V training system for peach								Proceedings of the Eighth International Symposium on Canopy, Rootstocks and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems		ACTA HORTICULTURAE			732			443	445					2007	2007	'Coronet' peach trees on 'Lovell' rootstock were planted near Clemson, South Carolina in December 1995 in 4 rows (=reps) 6.1 meters apart with trees 2.2 meters apart within each row. Trees were trained to a Kearney perpendicular-V system. In the 2(nd) leaf (August 1997), 'Ta Tao 5' vegetative bud grafts were applied to half (=6 trees or 6-tree plot) the trees in each row. These trees received two 'Ta Tao 5' chip buds infected with Peach Latent Mosaic Viroid (PLMVd) per scaffold at similar to 0.75 to 1.15 in above the ground. Dot blot hybridization confirmed that the chip bud grafts successfully (100%) inoculated the treated trees, whereas the controls tested negative for PLMVd. Data collected in 2003 included bloom date, tree size, dormant and summer pruning times, fruit maturity date, fruit yield and mean fruit weight. Flowering and fruit maturity were delayed by similar to 4 days in PLMVd-inoculated (PI) trees. PI trees produced larger fruit, but yield was 23% less than that of noninoculated trees. Both fruit size and yield were larger in PI trees in previous years. Cumulative yields per tree after 8 years were statistically higher in PI trees than the controls (101 vs. 90 kg). There were no differences in yield efficiency in 2003, but PI trees were 26% smaller in trunk cross-sectional area and 7% shorter. PI trees took 34% and 23% less time to dormant and summer prune, respectively and had 34% and 28% less wood removed by dormant and summer pruning, respectively, than control trees. PI trees in the Kearney-V system had lower pruning costs and yielded equal to or better than non-PI Kearney-V trees in 5 of the 6 crop years.					8th International Symposium on Canopy, Rootstocks and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems8th International Symposium on Canopy, Rootstocks and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	JUN 13-18, 2004JUN 13-18, 2004	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Budapest, HUNGARYBudapest, HUNGARY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-6605-128-7	WOS:000246176200067

Using concept forests to represent the semantics of text documents, the semantic similarities of these documents are then measured as the commonalities of their concept forests. Performance studies of text document clustering based on different document similarity measurement methods show that the CF-based similarity measurement is an effective alternative to the existing key-words-based methods. In particular, this CF-based approach has obvious advantages over the existing keywords-based methods, including LSI, in processing short text documents or in P2P or live news environments where it is impractical to collect the entire document corpus for analysis.

Impulse loading resulting from shallow buried explosives in water-saturated sand								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS				221	L1			21	35		10.1243/14644207JMDA96			JAN 2007	2007	A transient non-linear dynamics analysis of the detonation of a landmine buried to different depths in water-saturated sand is carried out in order to determine the resulting impulse loading. The results obtained are compared with their experimental counterparts obtained using the vertical impulse measurement fixture (VIMF), a structural mechanical device that enables direct experimental determination of the blast-loading impulse. The mechanical response of the structural steel used in the construction of the VIMF and the hydrodynamic response of the TNT high-energy high-pressure detonation products generated during detonation of a mine and of the air surrounding the VIMF are represented using the standard materials models available in the literature. The mechanical response of the sand surrounding the mine, on the other hand, is represented using the present authors' recent modified compaction model [1], which incorporates the effects of degree of saturation and the rate of deformation, two important effects, that are generally neglected in standard constitutive models for sand. The results obtained indicate that the use of the modified compaction model yields a substantially better agreement with the experimentally determined impulse loads over the use the original compaction model. Furthermore, the results suggest that, in the case of fully saturated sand, the blast loading is of a bubble type rather than of a shock type, i.e. it resembles under-water explosion.									17	0	0	0	0	17			1464-4207			WOS:000244837400003		
S	Rapaka, V. K.; Faust, J. E.						Kanlayanarat, S; Nell, TA; Eason, J		The interaction of ethylene and carbohydrate status on the postharvest quality of non-rooted vegetative cuttings								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN SUPPLY CHAINS OF ORNAMENTALS		ACTA HORTICULTURAE		755				75	80					2007	2007	Successful post-harvest shipment and propagation of non-rooted vegetative cuttings is dependent on the interaction of carbohydrate status and ethylene sensitivity. Carbohydrate status of the cutting is affected by the ambient irradiance delivered to the stock plants, the time of cutting harvest from the stock plant and the amount of respiration that occurs in the post-harvest environment. The combination of stock plants grown under relatively high irradiance (10-20 mol m(-2) d(-1)), afternoon harvest, and proper post-harvest temperature management result in cuttings with a relative high carbohydrate status. Ethylene production results from the wounding process that occurs during cutting harvest. For most species, ethylene production in the post-harvest environment increases as temperature increases, e.g., poinsettia cuttings stored in sealed packages at 20 degrees C for two days accumulated 0.25 ppm of ethylene while cuttings stored at 10 degrees C accumulated only 0.06 ppm. Plant sensitivity to this ethylene is dependent on the carbohydrate status of the cutting. Cuttings that possess a relatively high carbohydrate status are less sensitive to leaf senescence when exposed to ethylene. In contrast, cuttings with a low carbohydrate status are more sensitive to ethylene in the post-harvest environment. The most common symptoms include chlorosis and/or abscission of the most mature leaves. If the mature leaves exhibit only marginal chlorosis without rapid abscission, then the ethylene signal may result in improved rooting during propagation. Adventitious root formation was inhibited by application of the ethylene action inhibitor 1-MCP during the post-harvest environment, whereas it was promoted by exogenous ethylene when applied to cuttings with a higher carbohydrate status. These results suggest that a post-harvest ethylene signal promotes root regeneration when carbohydrate status is higher in the source leaves. Alternatively, when the carbohydrate status is low, rapid leaf abscission occurs and root formation is not promoted.

The evg mutant is one of only two described natural mutants affecting winter dormancy in woody perennials. The evg mutation segregates as a recessive nuclear gene, and previous work fine mapped the trait to a 3.3 cM region between simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. This region was physically mapped using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library, and a contig of three overlapping fragments was assembled. We completed the sequencing of a 132 kilobase region of the peach genome assembled from three overlapping BACs that encompass the complete EVG trait containing region. We present here 1) an analysis and annotation of this genomic region including putative and experimentally verified gene sequences; 2) a lambda phage library of an evg mutant genome, and screening of this library for inserts that span the mutant locus; 3) results of sequencing and analysis of the mutant locus and comparative expression studies of the genes directly affected by the mutation in wild-type and mutant trees.

We have constructed an initial physical map for peach. The map is anchored onto the general Prunus genetic map and has been integrated with a peach transcript map (http://www.rosaceae.org). Our efforts to exploit the peach genomic databases are focused on two genomic regions of interest: the distal part of linkage group 2 associated with the genes for root-knot nematode resistance and the distal part of linkage group 4 which is important for fruit characters such as freestone and melting flesh. Our approach combines linkage genetic mapping using EST based genetic markers, localization of the markers on the physical framework, and sequencing the genomic region of interest. Preliminary results illustrate the efficiency of this strategy to facilitate gene discovery in peach.

Moench, and Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) were planted as single crops or in combinations of feverfew, tansy and E. purpurea during 2005 and 2006. The species and abundance of arthropod pests monitored on these plants included two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae Koch), whiteflies {Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)) biotype B and thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis). Among the predators, Orius insidiosus (Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), Geocoris punctipes (Say) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) and spiders were most abundant in plots where Feverfew and Echinacea were planted together. Orius insidiosus and G. punctipes were 3-4 times more abundant in plots of feverfew than from any of the other medicinal plant species. Our research demonstrated that feverfew could be used as a companion crop or "banker" plant to attract and maintain predators, especially O. insidiosus and G. punctipes. The community of predators that build up in feverfew were shown to reduce populations of whiteflies, thrips and spider mites on E. purpurea when these crops were planted together.

Yadav, AK		In vitro plant and organ culture of medicinal and neutriceutical species in laboratory and industrial scales								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MEDICINAL AND NUTRACEUTICAL PLANTS		Acta Horticulturae			756			95	+					2007	2007	Medicinal, nutraceutical and culinary herbs are receiving scientific attention for their health promoting properties. Many are ferile or wild species that often exist as long-lived perennials that are heterozygous out-crossers in heterogeneous populations. Sustainable delivery of plant materials without degrading native populations requires modern propagation technologies that may include in vitro conservation banks, cryopreservation, or slow growth tissue cultures. Tissue culture techniques have been developed for such a diverse group of plants that these methods are assumed to be universally applicable. Commercial laboratories can supply starter-plants for field culture. Such laboratories can also generate uniform plant organs for direct production of active compounds. Micropropagation allows for the creation and dissemination of large numbers of nursery plants without spreading pathogens across continents. Also, micropropagation of seedling-derived clones accelerates the screening and selection process. Environmental control systems (greenhouse, growth chambers or in vitro laboratory) can advance cultivation of slow growing perennial species. Misidentified plant material, biotic and abiotic contaminants, and loss of living specimens from prior studies confound accurate scientific investigations. A properly managed in vitro plant laboratory would eliminate much uncertainty in development of standardized medicinal and nutraceutical plant products. Costs are the major impediment to laboratory-based systems. Liquid bioreactor systems originally designed as microbial fermentors have been modified for industrial scale plant organ culture. Simpler and less expensive liquid systems developed largely for ornamental plants have been adapted to in vitro production of medicinal plants at a more moderate degree of scale-up. Greater economy, higher plant quality, and process control are achieved with liquid systems. Specific examples of in vitro cultivation applied to phtyochemical plant development will illustrate these technologies.

Yadav, AK		Development of micro- and minirhizomes of turmeric, Curcuma longa L., in vitro								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MEDICINAL AND NUTRACEUTICAL PLANTS		ACTA HORTICULTURAE			756			103	108					2007	2007	Microrhizomes are in vitro storage organs employed in micropropagation of turmeric and a variety of other geophytes. Microrhizomes develop as engorged stem tissues in response to high concentrations of sucrose in liquid medium. Active storage organ function is indicated since microrhizome tissues have higher dry/fresh weight ratios than leaves or roots. In a system optimized for turmeric in 180 ml vessels, 115 and 180 mg microrhizome dry weight per explant was accumulated during 4 and 6 weeks of culture, respectively. These microrhizomes were ovoid like primary rhizomes of young field-grown turmeric plants. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "minirhizomes." In contrast with microrhizomes, minirhizomes produce cylindrical, lateral, secondary rhizomes comprising a large fraction the plant at harvest. Minirhizomes occurred during 15 to 24 weeks of in vitro culture in larger vessels (appx. 2.5 L) with periodic media supplementation to maintain high sucrose concentrations. Approximately 65% of explants possessed secondary rhizomes after 24 weeks. The average mass of a rhizome was 675 mg and the majority of plant dry weight was found in the rhizome. When sucrose levels were maintained at nearly constant levels over a 5-week time course, the dry/fresh weight ratio of the rhizome was directly related to the sucrose concentration in the medium. The greatest total plant mass was observed among plants grown with 6% initial sucrose concentration within the 2% to 8% initial sucrose range that was evaluated.

MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) (4.33 g L-1) supplemented with BA (5 mu M), NAA (0.025 mu M), sucrose (30 g L-1) was used for two experiments with addition of agar (5 g L-1) for agar treatments. Agar, liquid stationary (LS), liquid agitated (LA) and liquid culture with floating paper (FP) were compared for fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), % dry weight (%DW), multiplication ratio (MR) along with sucrose, media and water use. S. lateriflora, S. costaricana, S. baicalensis were cultured for 4, 6, 8 weeks respectively. LA and LS plantlets were more hyperhydric and had less MR compared to agar and FP plantlets. Biomass was higher in liquid culture except S. baicalensis plantlets in LS. Since LA and LS gave higher biomass, our further research is focused on a polyester fiber matrix in liquid that may prevent hyperhydricity and provide greater biomass. Agar, LS and liquid culture systems with matrix where plantlets kept in the gaseous phase were compared for similar responses with addition of hyperhydricity (visual assessment). The polyester fiber covered with seed germination paper was the matrix. Agar, LS and fiber 30 had 30 ml initial media and, fiber 20 began with 20 ml and had additional 5 ml at week 4 and 6. Plantlets were harvested after 8 weeks. Fiber 20 plantlets had significantly higher % DW for all species.

B	Pargas, Roy P.						Uskov, V		Engaging every student in large laptop-enhanced courses								Proceedings of the Sixth IASTED International Conference on Web-Based Education								86	91					2007	2007	This paper proposes that with the right hardware and software tools, it is possible to: (1) engage students during lecture with short in-class exercises to help them to team course material immediately, (2) provide students with feedback on how they are doing on a particular topic, (3) conduct frequent (even daily) assessment of each student in order to identify students who are not catching on, and (4) to conduct short programming exercises in lecture or tab, exercises that are easy to evaluate and can give valuable clues as to who can program and who cannot. We show how we use a web-based tool called MessageGrid in a laptop-enhanced computer science class to implement student activities that both engage the students and reap the benefits of peer-instruction and peer-collaboration. The exercises we describe and the pedagogical techniques we employ can be used in CS 1, CS2, CS4, and other computer science classes.					6th IASTED International Conference on Web-Based Education6th IASTED International Conference on Web-Based Education	MAR 14-16, 2007MAR 14-16, 2007	Int Assoc Sci & Technol Dev; World Modelling & Simulat ForumInt Assoc Sci & Technol Dev; World Modelling & Simulat Forum	Chamonix, FRANCEChamonix, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-88986-650-8	WOS:000246211500016		
J	Gupta, Sushil; Roth, Aleda V.								Martin K. Starr: A visionary proponent for system integration, modular production, and catastrophe avoidance								PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				16	1			1	12					JAN-FEB 2007	2007	Martin K. Starr facilitated the creation of an identity for production and operations management (POM) as an academic discipline. This paper aims to summarize Starr's substantial contributions to scholarly inquiry on system integration and interfunctional coordination, modular production, and catastrophe avoidance. Even after four decades, we describe how his legacy in these areas continues to define several major drivers of operations and supply chain management research and practice. Starr has influenced several generations of students, professors, and executives with his writings, teaching, and leadership roles in the POM community that include 32 years on the faculty of the Columbia School of Business, 15 years as Editor-in-Chief of Management Science, and presidency of the Production and Operations Management Society.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1059-1478			WOS:000246451500001		
J	Xu, X.-B.; Huang, Y. F.								An efficient analysis of vertical dipole antennas above a lossy half-space								PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER				74				353	377		10.2528/PIER07052202			2007	2007	The electromagnetic modeling of radiation by vertical dipole antennas above a lossy half-space is an important subject. The modeling often encounters Sommerfeld-type integrals that are normally highly oscillatory with poor convergence. Recently, an efficient computation of the electric field radiated by an infinitesimal electric dipole above a lossy half-space has been reported, in which the Sommerfeld-type integrals are reduced to rapidly-converging integrals. Using such efficiently-calculated electric field as the Green's function, in this paper, an electric field integral equation ( EFIE) is formulated for the analysis of a vertical dipole antenna above a lossy half-space. Then, the EFIE is solved numerically employing the Method of Moments ( MoM). Sample numerical results are presented and discussed for the current distribution as well as the input impedance and radiation pattern of the antenna. In particular, the EFIE solutions of the current distribution on an antenna in free space are checked with that obtained using a traditional approach of solving the Pocklington's equation. Also, the current distributions on an antenna above a very lossy halfspace are checked by comparing them with that for the antenna above a PEC plane. Data of the current distribution and the input impedance show that for an antenna close to the media interface separating the two half-spaces, the electromagnetic parameters of the lower half-space can significantly affect the antenna characteristics. The radiation patterns of the antenna presented all exhibit properties as expected and similar to that documented in literature for infinitesimal vertical dipoles above a lossy half-space.									12	1	0	2	0	14			1559-8985			WOS:000248081000022

S	Guss, Nathan						Day, J		Outing Proust								Queer Sexualities in French and Francophone Literature and Film		FRENCH LITERATURE SERIES		34				101	111					2007	2007	This paper examines a remarkable chapter of the little-known, posthumously published Jean Santeuil where the eponyinous protagonist cross-dresses. Unlike the narrator of La recherche, Jean, a character who transparently resembles Proust, engages in non-normative behavior rather than simply being a voyeur to others' transgressions. The narrator frames these near avowals in an allegory of a reading that does not regain lost time. The hidden, unspeakable nature of homosexuality in Jean and Proust's social milieu is a paragon of writing because it is not simply homosexuality that resists expression, but all lived experience.

This study was initiated to investigate the applicability of color flexible concrete pavement (CFCP) for elementary school zones in South Korea. Color flexible pavement has been applied to non-motorway pavements, such as pedestrian and bicycle roads. This paper presents the engineering properties of color flexible concrete pavement used for motorway pavement of elementary school zones. A commercial polymer of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was used to modify the transparent binder and to increase the performance characteristics of color flexible concrete pavement. Waste paper was used to prevent the binder draindown of gap-graded mixture. Evaluation of the mixtures included the following testing procedures: Marshall stability, indirect tensile strength (ITS), and permanent deformation. The results from this study showed that 1) the color asphalt concrete mixtures used in this study had nearly the same quality in engineering properties when compared with conventional asphalt concrete mixtures, and 2) there have been no apparent problems in application of color flexible pavement in the field, especially in the elementary school zones.					2nd International Conference Safety and Security Engineering2nd International Conference Safety and Security Engineering	JUN 25-27, 2007JUN 25-27, 2007	Wessex Inst Technol; Univ Rome, Fac Engn; ASCE UK Int Grp; WIT Transact Built EnvironmWessex Inst Technol; Univ Rome, Fac Engn; ASCE UK Int Grp; WIT Transact Built Environm	MALTAMALTA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1746-4498		978-1-84564-068-2	WOS:000248254200042

To assure transportation efficiency, safety, and security in the presence of such growth, it is critical to identify an infrastructure development methodology that can adapt to expansions while assuring reliable operation for both centralized monitoring and distributed management. In this paper, a wireless sensor network design methodology is presented, aimed at providing effective distributed surveillance, anomaly detection, and coordinated response. The proposed methodology integrates state-of-the-art traffic sensors, with flexibly programmable controller devices that can integrate with the available traffic control equipments. The system methodology provides a paradigm in which sensors and controllers can be progressively incorporated and programmed to autonomously coordinate with peer sensors and a hierarchy of controllers to detect, notify, and react to anomalous events. Since the system can tolerate failure of parts of the system, as the network connectivity continues to increase, the proposed sensor network will have positive implications on evacuation plans during natural disasters or terrorist attacks. To illustrate the design methodology and usage, a simulated system along a freeway corridor in South Carolina was constructed in an integrated microscopic traffic and wireless sensor network simulation platform, in which distributed incident detection and response functions were implemented. The test results, including detection and false alarm rates and wireless communication latencies, are analyzed to identify insights of the system's operation and potential enhancement strategies.

In this medium the parameters to be recovered are (1) the wave speed for a wave propagating in the direction along the fiber; (2) the wave speed for a wave propagating in any direction which is orthogonal to the fiber direction; and (3) the unit fiber direction itself. So four scalar functions are to be recovered. The data are the positions of four distinct wave fronts as the corresponding waves propagate through the medium. The mathematical relation, which is the Eikonal equation, between the wave front locations and the four unknown functions, is nonlinear. Here it is established, perhaps surprisingly, that corresponding to the given data set, there can be up to four possible solution quadruples. We present and implement an algorithm to compute each of the possible solutions and show our selection criteria to obtain the correct solution. The Eikonal equation, which relates the wave front positions to the unknown functions, is the same equation obtained for the horizontally polarized shear wave (SH wave) which propagates in a linear elastic system.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0036-1399			WOS:000251173900002

Most populations exhibit infrequent diurnal activity, mainly during the breeding season or during overcast or rainy days. This paper reports on a population of Hellbenders from Transylvania County, NC, where 148 observations of diurnal activity were made during 51 person hours over a 3-yr period. Hellbenders were most diurnally active during the September breeding season (mean = 16.3 individuals/person hr), but also exhibited high levels of diurnal activity during summer months, especially in May (mean = 11.4 individuals/person hr). Diurnal activity was not correlated with cloud cover, water depth, or time of day when searches were conducted, but was positively correlated with water temperature. Previous literature and numerous surveys conducted by the author in other parts of the Hellbender's range suggest that this North Carolina population is unique in its diurnal activity, which is possibly related to factors such as prey availability, intraspecific competition, or predator threats.									2	0	0	3	0	3			1528-7092			WOS:000245702900011

We monitored water levels and environmental conditions at the nest sites of Moxostoma robustum (Robust Red-horse) on a main-channel gravel bar in the Savannah River, GA-SC. During the course of the 2005 spawning season, over 50% of the observed nest sites were either completely dewatered or left in near zero-flow conditions for several days. This occurred on two separate occasions, once early during the spawning season and then again near its conclusion. We hypothesize the habitat preferences of spawning Robust Redhorse leave them vulnerable to water-level fluctuations, and this phenomenon may be widespread in regulated river systems.									19	1	0	18	0	20			1528-7092			WOS:000249790000008

In particular, tomographic imaging methods can produce maps of physical property distributions that have significant potential to improve subsurface characterization and enhance monitoring of hydrologic processes. In the tomographic imaging approach, geophysical images of the subsurface are converted to hydrologic property maps using petrophysical relations. In field studies, this transformation is complicated because measurement sensitivity and averaging during data inversion result in tomographic images that have spatially variable resolution (i.e., the estimated property values in the geophysical image represent averages of the true subsurface properties). Standard approaches to petrophysics do not account for variable geophysical resolution, and thus it is difficult to obtain quantitative estimates of hydrologic properties. We compare two new approaches that account for variable geophysical resolution: a Random Field Averaging (RFA) method and Full Inverse Statistical Calibration (FISt). The RFA approach uses a semi-analytical method whereas FISt calibration is based on a numerical solution to the problem.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0065-8448		978-0-87590-437-5	WOS:000276666800015

The short-hard class of GRBs is also believed to be associated with a black hole - accretion disk -jet system, but with merging binary systems of compact stars (e.g., a neutron star binary) as progenitors. Both of these source classes trace, more or less directly, the cosmic star formation history, and thus offer a unique probe of the high redshift Universe. Regardless of the nature of their central engines, and their progenitors, their high luminosities allow easy detection even at very large distances, and their optical afterglows provide a (rapidly decaying) light source that offers unique opportunities for spectroscopic studies of interstellar gas in the evolving Universe.

All of the resulting piglets were housed and raised identically under standard commercial settings and slaughtered upon reaching market weight. Loin samples were taken from each slaughtered animal and shipped offsite for meat composition analysis. In total, loin samples from 404 animals (242 from offspring of clones and 162 from controls) were analyzed for 58 different parameters generating 14,036 and 9396 data points from offspring of clones and the controls, respectively. Values for controls were used to establish a range for each parameter. Ten percent was then added to the maximum and subtracted from the minimum of the control range, and all results within this range were considered clinically irrelevant. Of the 14,036 data points from the offspring of clones, only three points were found outside the clinically irrelevant range, two of which were within the range established by the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 18, 2005; website: http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/. The only outlier was the presence of Eicosadienoic acid (C20:2) in one sample which is typically present in minute quantities in pork; no reference data were found regarding this fatty acid in the USDA National Nutrient Database. In conclusion, these data indicated that meat from the offspring of clones was not chemically different than meat from controls and therefore supported the case for the safety of meat from the offspring of clones.

J	Mattox, James H., III; Sarasua, Wayne A.; Ogle, Jennifer H.; Eckenrode, Ryan T.; Dunning, Anne								Development and evaluation of speed-activated sign to reduce speeds in work zones								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2015			3	11		10.3141/2015-01			2007	2007	Excessive speed is one of the most significant factors contributing to work zone crashes, which, along with work zone fatalities, have increased substantially in the past decade. From the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2003, the number of work zone crashes in South Carolina nearly tripled. In 2005, the South Carolina Department of Transportation initiated a research project to evaluate speed reduction measures in work zones. Through an in-depth literature review of speed control techniques for work zones, it was found that innovative technologies are often too expensive and thus impractical for large-scale implementation. There is a need for less-expensive technologies that are effective in reducing speeds in work zones. Development and evaluation of a speed-activated sign are discussed. Data were collected in work zones on two-lane primary and secondary highways in South Carolina, and the effectiveness of the speed-activated sign was evaluated on the basis of changes in mean speeds, 85th-percentile speeds, and percentages of vehicles exceeding the speed limit. Mean speed reductions ranged from 2 to 6 mph (3.2 to 9.7 km/h) with an average reduction of 3.3 mph (5.3 km/h). This average reduction improved to 4.1 mph (6.6 km/h) at sites where more than 50% of the vehicles were speeding before a sign was introduced. Further research was conducted with two speed-activated signs on a multilane divided highway and an Interstate freeway where similar speed reductions were experienced. From this study, researchers recommend that the speed-activated sign be used in short-term work zones.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0361-1981			WOS:000253234800001		
J	Tyrrell, Richard A.; Balk, Stacy A.; Switzer, Fred S., III; Brooks, Johnell O.				谢, 飞/C-7706-2009				Effects of tire pressure monitoring systems an tire pressures in consumer vehicles								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2018			15	21		10.3141/2018-03			2007	2007	In response to a federal mandate, all new light passenger vehicles in the United States will soon be required to include tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMSs) that alert drivers when one or more tires become 25% or more underinflated relative to the pressure level recommended by the vehicle manufacturer. Although the goal of TPMSs is to reduce the population of underinflated tires, their ultimate effect on tire pressure in consumer vehicles is unknown. Tire pressure and survey data were collected from approximately 1,200 vehicles that. had just entered a rest area from an Interstate highway. Comparisons between vehicles with and without a TPMS were made from 864 vehicles in the full sample and from a subset of 123 target vehicles. The presence of TPMSs was generally associated with a small (0.7 to 1.5 psi) but significant decrease in the severity of tire underinflation. In addition, vehicles equipped with TPMSs were significantly less likely to have at least one tire that was 25 % or more underinflated. The effect of TPMSs on tire pressure might have been larger had the systems been designed to activate at a less severe underinflation level. Less than 2 % of survey respondents believed that TPMSs should have a trigger threshold as extreme as the currently mandated 25% threshold. Surveys also revealed that drivers without a TPMS do not report large differences in their tire maintenance behaviors relative to drivers with a TPMS and that more than 25 % of drivers of vehicles with a TPMS are unaware that their vehicle is so equipped.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981			WOS:000253232200003		
J	Eckenrode, Ryan T.; Sarasua, Wayne A.; Mattox, James H., III; Ogle, Jennifer H.; Chowdhury, Mashrur								Revisiting the use of drone radar to reduce speed in work zones - South Carolina's experience								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2015			19	27		10.3141/2015-03			2007	2007	Speeding through work zones is a major safety concern in South Carolina. Multiple traffic control devices aimed at reducing speeds in South Carolina work zones were evaluated. The majority of these speed control measures, with the exception of drone radar, were often found not to be practical for widespread, cost-effective implementation. The drone radar device has been tested for more than 20 years, though never before in South Carolina. The focus of this research was to determine the effect of drone radar as a speed reduction measure in work zones on Interstates and secondary highways during day and evening conditions, both for passenger cars and for tractor-trailers. One unique aspect of this study involves the use of a specialized detector to identify vehicles using radar detectors. Most documented research used visual inspection, which is not ideal for this determination, because many vehicles do not have their radar detectors in a visible location. The effectiveness of drone radar was evaluated on the basis of changes in mean speeds, 85th-percentile speeds, and percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit. Overall, drone radar caused mean speed reductions of 2 mph for the entire traffic stream. However, individual vehicles equipped with radar detectors reduced speeds ranging from 5 to 8 mph. Drone radar also caused 85th-percentile speeds to decrease between 1 and 5 mph, and a 20% speed reduction was shown in vehicles exceeding the speed limit.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0361-1981			WOS:000253234800003		
J	Elango, Vetri Venthan; Guensler, Randall; Ogle, Jennifer								Day-to-day travel variability in the Commute Atlanta, Georgia, study								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2014			39	49		10.3141/2014-06			2007	2007	Traditional travel diary surveys collect 1 or 2 days of travel data from participant households. Although useful in determining the overall average travel behavior of a regional population, cross-sectional travel diary surveys provide little insight into intrahousehold and intraperson trip variability. Longitudinal surveys are generally preferred for examining travel variability. The objective of the research is to examine the intrahousehold travel variability in the Commute Atlanta, Georgia, study, a Global Positioning System-based instrumented-vehicle monitoring study that collected vehicle trips from approximately 500 vehicles in 260 representative households. The research effort uses 2004 travel data collected for the Commute Atlanta study, in which the average variability or deviation in the number of trips by a household was 3 trips/day. Demographic variables (e.g., household size, household income, vehicle ownership, number of children, number of workers, and number of students) significantly affect the day-to-day variability in the total number of household trips per day. The variability due to seasonal effects is controlled by separately analyzing travel data during specific months in spring, summer, and fall. Results indicate that demographic variables have a significant effect on the day-to-day variability of the household number of trips when the variability associated with seasonal effects is excluded. Vehicles identified by participants as being used always or occasionally for business or commercial purposes have travel patterns different from those of other vehicles, and their presence in the sample will significantly bias analytical results in the analysis of longitudinal data. Commercial use vehicles are excluded from travel variability analysis, and the argument is made that households with such vehicles must be treated as an independent sample in future travel diary data collection and longitudinal studies.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0361-1981			WOS:000253279900006

It was conducted to evaluate the influence of a potassium acetate deicer and anti-icer in causing ASR distress in concrete specimens. A modified ASTM C 1293 test method was employed in this investigation, in which concrete prisms prepared with aggregates of known reactivity were exposed to 50% solution of potassium acetate (KAc) or 1 normal solution of sodium hydroxide (1N NaOH) during the course of testing. Expansion of the concrete test prisms was monitored periodic-ally, along with changes in their dynamic modulus of elasticity. In addition, visual and scanning electron microscopic examinations were conducted on polished specimens at the conclusion of tests. The pH of the deicer soak solution was monitored to detect any changes caused by its interaction with the specimens. Findings from the study indicate that potassium acetate deicer solution is capable of causing significant ASR distress in concrete specimens containing reactive aggregates. A secondary reaction product, composed primarily of a potassium sulfate phase, was observed in prisms containing both reactive and non-reactive aggregates. This product was predominantly found as an infilling in cracks and voids. Additional research needs are identified to help to decipher the precise mechanisms involved in this attack.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981			WOS:000253235100007		
J	Bhavsar, Parth; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Sadek, Adel; Sarasua, Wayne; Ogle, Jennifer								Decision support system for predicting traffic diversion impact across transportation networks using support vector regression								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2024			100	106		10.3141/2024-12			2007	2007	This paper describes follow-up research to a previous study by the authors that used case-based reasoning (CBR) and support vector regression (SVR) to evaluate the likely impacts of implementing diversion strategies in response to incidents on highway networks. In the previous study, the training and testing of the CBR and SVR tools were performed on a single transportation network from South Carolina, which limited the applicability of the developed tool to the specific network for which it was developed. To address this limitation, the current study investigates the feasibility of developing a generic decision support system (DSS) capable of predicting traffic diversion impacts for new transportation networks that the tool has not previously seen. In such cases, users need only to input the geometric and traffic variables, via a graphical user interface, and the tool, which uses a SVR model, will predict the benefits of diverting traffic for a specific incident on the new site. To illustrate the feasibility of developing such a tool, two different highway networks covering portions of I-85 and I-385 in South Carolina were used to train the SVR model, which was then tested on a third network covering portions of I-89 in Vermont. The study found only a 15% difference between the predictions of the SVR model and those of a detailed simulation counterpart, demonstrating the feasibility of developing a generic DSS. Adding more sites and parameters to train the software is also expected to improve the prediction accuracy of the DSS.									0	1	0	0	0	1			0361-1981			WOS:000253233400012

Evaluation of abutment scour prediction equations with field data								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2025			118	126		10.3141/2025-12			2007	2007	The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with FHWA, compared predicted abutment scour depths, computed with selected predictive equations, with field observations collected at 144 bridges in South Carolina and at eight bridges from the National Bridge Scour Database. Predictive equations published in the 4th edition of Evaluating Scour at Bridges (Hydraulic Engineering Circular 18) were used in this comparison, including the original Froehlich, the modified Froehlich, the Sturm, the Maryland, and the HIRE equations. The comparisons showed that most equations tended to provide conservative estimates of scour that at times were excessive (as large as 158 11). Equations also produced under-predictions of scour, but with less frequency. Although the equations provide an important resource for evaluating abutment scour at bridges, the results of this investigation show the importance of using engineering judgment in conjunction with these equations.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0361-1981			WOS:000253233600012		
J	Dunning, A. E.; Oswalt, Jennifer L.								Train wreck and chlorine spill in Graniteville, South Carolina								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2009			130	135		10.3141/2009-17			2007	2007	The 2005 railroad chlorine spill in Graniteville, South Carolina, killed "only" nine people, but it illustrated the difficulties of achieving adequate capacity to handle no-notice evacuation for hazardous materials incidents. This research uses Graniteville as a case study to highlight needs for building capacity in evacuation capabilities and transportation recovery. Rail operational concepts emerged, such as the need for positive train control and automatic warning technology. The local community faced several challenges, including a lack of public understanding of how to react to a chlorine spill (even though chlorine traversed the town daily), public necessity for basic transportation to work after the evacuation, and a need for documentation of transportation infrastructure to facilitate recovery. Finally, evacuation issues arose, such as how to determine whether to shelter in place or evacuate, what routes would protect or harm people given different hazardous materials and how they behave in a spill, and the role of transportation professionals in working with emergency responders to manage evacuation. Experience and lessons learned from Graniteville can help define a national research agenda for the transportation requirements of no-notice and hazardous-materials evacuation.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0361-1981			WOS:000252907600017		
J	Kanhere, Neeraj K.; Birchfield, Stanley T.; Sarasua, Wayne A.; Whitney, Tom C.								Real-time detection and tracking of vehicle base fronts for measuring traffic counts and speeds on highways								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					1993			155	164		10.3141/1993-21			2007	2007	A real-time system is presented for automatically monitoring a highway when the camera is relatively low to the ground and on the side of the road. In such a case, occlusion and the perspective effects due to the heights of the vehicles cannot be ignored. The system presented in this paper is based on a novel technique of detecting and tracking the base fronts of vehicles. Compared with the authors' previous approach, the proposed technique involves a simplified problem formulation, operates in real time, and requires only a small number of parameters to calibrate. Experimental results of a camera mounted at a height of 26 ft and a lateral distance of 12 ft from the edge of the pavement reveal accuracy as high as 98% with few false detections. The system can collect a variety of traffic data, including volume, time-mean speed and space-mean speed, density, vehicle classification, and lane change activities. By handling perspective effects and vehicle occlusions, the system overcomes some of the limitations of commercially available machine vision-based traffic monitoring systems that are used in many intelligent transportation systems applications.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0361-1981			WOS:000252682800021		
J	Fries, Ryan; Inamdar, Imran; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Taaffe, Kevin; Ozbay, Kaan				ozbay, kaan/C-7141-2013				Feasibility of traffic simulation for decision support in real-time regional traffic management								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2035			169	176		10.3141/2035-19			2007	2007	State-of-the-art microscopic traffic simulation programs offer detailed modeling capabilities of vehicle interactions based on drivers, pedestrians, and highway elements. Consequently, these tools can help regional traffic management personnel make operational decisions by predicting future traffic conditions that result from incidents. This research sought to determine the effectiveness and timeliness of using a detailed microsimulation suite called Paramics to support personnel in a regional traffic management center in real-time decision making. Two sites in rural, high-crash areas of South Carolina were examined to see whether Paramics could provide decision information as quickly as desired by regional traffic management centers. Only certain combinations of incident durations and simulation accuracy satisfied the decision-time constraints for real-time decision support. Increasing the computational resources or reducing the size of the traffic network can provide decision support for longer incidents at higher accuracies and further allow microscopic traffic simulation to aid regional traffic management personnel in real-time decision making.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0361-1981			WOS:000253787400019		
J	Jun, Jungwook; Ogle, Jennifer; Guensler, Randall								Relationships between crash involvement and temporal-spatial driving behavior activity patterns - Use of data for vehicles with global positioning systems								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2019			246	255		10.3141/2019-29			2007	2007	Knowledge about characteristics of crash-involved drivers and their driving performance can enhance countermeasure programs designed to improve safety on roadways. However, few studies have been able to analyze detailed exposure data of individual drivers (travel by time of day and by roadway type) alongside driving performance data (speed, throttle, braking, and acceleration). Thus, researchers have been forced to base safety analyses on aggregate crash experience rather than on more frequent individual driving activities and driving performance parameters. This research evaluated driving exposure and performance differences between drivers who were involved in crashes versus drivers who were not involved in crashes during a 14-month study period, on the basis of data for vehicles with Global Positioning Systems. The objective was to verify whether the exposure of crash-involved drivers and driving performance were significantly different on the basis of disaggregated analyses by facility types and trip start times. Researchers found that the mileage exposure, speed, and acceleration patterns of drivers who were involved in crashes during the study period were significantly different from those of drivers who were not involved in crashes. Further, crash-involved drivers accumulated more mileage, consistently traveled at higher speeds, and engaged more frequently in hard deceleration events than their no-crash counterparts did. Although this study does not definitively correlate driver exposure and performance measures with crash causation, it does suggest that there is real potential to identify at-risk drivers on the basis of data obtained from vehicle-monitoring technologies. The identification and immediate correction of at-risk behaviors could obviate crash experience. If this research is successful, the surrogate measures also would reduce safety analysts' dependency on crash data.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0361-1981			WOS:000253002300029

This article analyses city size distributions, by decade, from the south-eastern region of the US for the years 1860-1990. It determines if the distributions are clustered into size classes and documents changes in the pattern of size classes over time. A statistical hypothesis test was also performed to detect dependence between city size and growth using discrete probability calculations under the assumption of Gibrat's law. The city size distributions for the south-eastern region of the US were discontinuous, with cities clustering into distinct size classes. The analysis also identified departures from Gibrat's law, indicating variable growth rates at different scales.									17	0	0	5	0	17			0042-0980			WOS:000249417100008

Shumaker, R		Evaluation of interaction devices for projector based virtual reality aircraft inspection training environments								VIRTUAL REALITY, PROCEEDINGS		Lecture Notes in Computer Science		4563				533	+					2007	2007	The Aircraft maintenance and inspection is a complex system wherein humans play a key role in ensuring the worthiness of the aircraft. Traditional visual inspection training consisted mainly of on-the-job training (OJT). While OJT provides novice inspectors with the hands-on experience critical to effective transfer, it lacks the ability to provide real-time feedback and exposure to various scenarios in which to inspect.With advances in technology, computer simulators have been developed to train the novice inspector and reduce the learning curve inherent with transitioning from the classroom to the workforce. Advances in graphics and virtual reality (VR) technology have allowed for an increase the sense of involvement in using these simulators. Though these simulators are effective, their deployment in aircraft maintenance training schools is limited by the high cost of VR equipment. This research investigates the effectiveness of different interaction devices for providing projector based simulated aircraft maintenance inspection training.					2nd International Conference on Virtual Reality held at the HCI International 20072nd International Conference on Virtual Reality held at the HCI International 2007	JUL 22-27, 2007JUL 22-27, 2007		Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	3	0	0	0	0	3			0302-9743		978-3-540-73334-8	WOS:000248249200058

Tolerance of cantaloupe to postemergence applications of rimsulfuron and halosulfuron								WEED TECHNOLOGY				21	1			30	36		10.1614/WT-05-175.1			JAN-MAR 2007	2007	Field trials were conducted in the spring of 2004 and the spring and summer of 2005 to evaluate cantaloupe tolerance to rimsulfuron and halosulfuron applied to cantaloupe at the two-leaf stage, five- to six-leaf stage, plants having 30- to 40-cm vines, and plants having up to 5-cm-diam melons. Additionally, control of eight weed species was evaluated in these trials in 2005. Cantaloupe plant injury from rimsulfuron differed among application timings and trials, but applications were generally more injurious when applied at the two early crop stages. Halosulfuron was less injurious to cantaloupe, but 31 and 14% injury occurred following the two-leaf and five- to six-leaf applications, respectively, in the second trial in 2005. In the first trial of 2005, number of marketable melons the first week of harvest was lower for all halosulfurcin applications compared with the nontreated control (30 to 37% reduction). In the second trial of 2005, total number of marketable melons was comparable to the nontreated control for each of the halosulfuron treatments, except the five- to six-leaf and up to 5-cm-diam melon applications. Injury estimates were poor indicators of occurrence or absence of delays in crop earliness or number of marketable melons. Rimsulfuron was generally effective (>= 80% control) in controlling seedling Texas panicum, large crabgrass, tall morningglory, pitted morningglory, and Palmer amaranth, but was ineffective against yellow and purple nutsedge and goosegrass. Halosulfuron was effective in controlling yellow and purple nutsedge, but was ineffective against Texas panicum, large crabgrass, goosegrass, pitted morningglory, tall morningglory, and Palmer amaranth.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0890-037X			WOS:000245166300006

Preemergence herbicides included S-metolachlor, pendimethalin, dimethenamid, quinclorac, pronamide, ethofumesate, and DCPA, a registered standard. Herbicide applied to two- to three-leaf green onion included glyphosate, trifloxysulfuron, flumioxazin, phenmedipham, ethalfluralin, pendimethalin, S-metolachlor, and oxyfluorfen. Plots were cultivated and hand weeded to minimize negative effects of weed interference on the crop. All herbicides applied at seeding, excluding DCPA, caused excessive injury (> 25%) to green onion in at least 1 of 2 years. Oxyfluorfen, ethalfluralin, or S-metolachlor applied after crop emergence caused less than 10% injury in both years to green onion. Green onion yields following treatment with oxyfluorfen, ethalfluralin, or S-metolachlor were equivalent to the nontreated control. All other herbicides applied after crop emergence resulted in height, density, or yield reductions relative to a nontreated control in at least 1 of 2 years.									5	0	0	6	0	6			0890-037X			WOS:000245166300021

Survival of planted oak seedlings is improved by herbaceous weed control								WEED TECHNOLOGY				21	1			175	178		10.1614/WT-06-114.1			JAN-MAR 2007	2007	Sulfometuron was applied at 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 kg ai/ha over the top of oak seedlings. Three separate field studies were completed. In 1997, 0.1 and 0.2 kg ai/ha was applied PRE over six oak species. In 1998 and 1999, 0.1 and 0.15 kg ai/ha were applied PRE and 0.1 kg ai/ha was applied POST over two species of oaks. Results demonstrate that first-year survival of oak seedlings is greater in areas which receive competition control. Survival was 21 to 44% greater in treated areas as compared to nontreated areas. Observations indicate that survival differences are increased in droughty years. Competition control appears essential to obtaining desirable levels of survival when oak seedlings are planted in areas with established herbaceous competition.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0890-037X			WOS:000245166300031

We sought to investigate whether abused inner-city African American women reporting AP endorsed more depressive symptoms compared to women reporting either AP or IPV or reporting neither.Method. Participants for this cross-sectional study were 361 African American women seeking medical care at a large public hospital. Measurements included the Index of Spouse Abuse, Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, and the Brief Symptom Index-Depression Subscale to assess IPV, AP, and depressive symptoms, respectively. Based on IPV and AP status, participants were assigned to one of four non-hierarchical risk groups: (i) low or no IPV, no AP; (ii) high IPV alone; (iii) AP alone; or (iv) both high IPV and AP. Additive effect of high levels of IPV and AP on outcome were assessed using logistic regression techniques.Results. Thirty percent reported high IPV levels, and 18% had AP. Compared with participants reporting both no AP and low or no IPV, those reporting either high IPV levels or AP reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms 4 times more often (p < .001). Women reporting high IPV and AP endorsed moderate to severe depressive symptoms 8 times more often than women reporting neither (p < .001).Conclusions. Among inner-city, African American women, depressive symptoms are highest among those reporting both high IPV levels and AP. Health care systems serving similar communities should implement a systematic approach to identifying IPV, AP, and depression in patients.									6	0	0	1	0	6			1049-3867			WOS:000244878600006	17321946
