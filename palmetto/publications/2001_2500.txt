J	Zhang, Lynn X.; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Mass spectra of diverse organic species utilizing the liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) microplasma ionization source								JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY				31	1			145	151		10.1039/c5ja00376h			2016	2016	This laboratory has demonstrated the analytical versatility of the liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) ionization source. Demonstrations have included elemental analysis of solutions and laser ablation (LA)-produced aerosols, ambient desorption of small organic molecules on substrates, and direct speciation of organometallic complexes in solution. Here we present initial efforts in mapping the operation space of the device as it applies to obtaining molecular mass spectra from diverse organic molecules. An initial parametric evaluation is performed using caffeine as the test molecule, with a preliminary limit of detection of 5.9 x 10(-9) x M (43 pg) for 20 mu L injections. Conditions optimum for that molecule are applied in assessing the qualitative nature of spectra from caffeine, sinapinic acid, daidzin (a flavonoid), a FITC-labeled lipid tethered ligand, the mass marker Ultramark 1621, and the heme-protein myoglobin. The product spectra for the small molecules are very much like what would be obtained from electrospray and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization sources, predominately the production of the protonated pseudomolecular ion of the form(M + H)(+). Themid-range molecules show ion signatures of the thermally stable fragments. Finally, the macromolecules yield mass spectra that are very much like those from electrospray, producing a range of protonated charged states. While much optimization and understanding are needed to best apply the source to such solutes, the fact that the same ion source can be used across the spectrum from elemental/isotopic analysis to perhaps proteomics is totally unique and is worthy of continued development.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0267-9477	1364-5544		WOS:000367315200010

High-residue cover crops alone or with strategic tillage to manage glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) in southeastern cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)								JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION				71	1			1	11		10.2489/jswc.71.1.1			JAN-FEB 2016	2016	Glyphosate-resistant (GR) Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats) is redefining row crop weed management in the southeast United States due to its widespread distribution, high competitive ability, copious seed production, and resilience against standard weed management programs. Herbicides alone are failing to provide adequate control of GR Palmer amaranth; thus, use of conventional tillage is increasing in the Southeast in order to control GR Palmer amaranth. Cultural practices consistent with maintenance of conservation tillage were evaluated to determine if they could suppress weeds in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). An on-farm research and demonstration project was initiated in the fall of 2009 in Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee to address well-founded concerns that conservation tillage systems were at risk because of GR Palmer amaranth. The research continued in certain states for two additional years. Cultural practices contrasted in the conservation tillage system were a no-till planted high-residue cover crop, one-time fall inversion tillage followed by the planting of a high-residue cover crop, and winter fallow only without a cover crop. Cover crop biomass yields varied from 570 to 6,790 kg ha(-1) (509 to 6,063 lb ac(-1)) depending on location, type of cover crop, planting date, and environment. Fall inversion tillage increased cover crop biomass at all locations, likely due to preparation of a favorable seed bed for seedling establishment or alleviation of soil compaction or both. One-time fall inversion tillage reduced the number of GR Palmer amaranth escapes compared with the other treatments. Where GR Palmer amaranth densities were relatively low (approximately 1,000 plants ha-1 [405 plants ac-1] or fewer), there were few differences in the number of GR Palmer amaranth escapes among treatments. Where GR Palmer amaranth densities were relatively high (18,000 plants ha-1 [7,284 plants ac-1] or greater), winter fallow systems had higher Palmer amaranth densities escaping weed management programs compared to either cover crop system. The number of Palmer amaranth escapes declined exponentially as a function of cover crop biomass regardless of tillage. For sites with two years of data, no year by treatment interaction was detected, indicating that relative GR Palmer amaranth escape densities were sustained in each treatment for two seasons. Trends in cotton yields were the opposite of those for Palmer amaranth escapes. High-residue cover crops tended to suppress Palmer amaranth and increase cotton lint yields. However, no cultural management system consistently netted greater returns than other systems across locations and years.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4561	1941-3300		WOS:000367460000005		
J	Beita-Sandi, Wilson; Ersan, Mahmut Selim; Uzun, Habibullah; Karanfil, Tanju					Beita-Sandi, Wilson/0000-0002-3825-2858			Removal of N-nitrosodimethylamine precursors with powdered activated carbon adsorption								WATER RESEARCH				88				711	718		10.1016/j.watres.2015.10.062			JAN 1 2016	2016	The main objective of this study was to examine the roles of powdered activated carbon (PAC) characteristics (i.e., surface chemistry, pore size distribution, and surface area) in the removal of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential (FP) in surface and wastewater-impacted waters. Also, the effects of natural attenuation of NDMA precursors in surface waters, NDMA FP concentration, and carbon dose on the removal of NDMA FP by PAC were evaluated. Finally, the removal of NDMA FP by PAC at two full-scale DWTPs was monitored. Wastewater-impacted and surface water samples were collected to conduct adsorption experiments using different PACs and activated carbon fibers (ACFs) with a wide range of physicochemical characteristics. The removal efficiency of NDMA FP by PAC was significantly higher in wastewater-impacted than surface waters. Adsorbable NDMA precursors showed a size distribution in the waters tested; the adsorbable fraction included precursors accessing the pore size regions of 10-20 angstrom and <10 angstrom. Basic carbons showed higher removal of NDMA FP than acidic carbons on a surface area basis. The overall removal of NDMA FP by PAC on a mass basis depended on the surface area, pore size distribution and pHpzc. Thus, PACs with hybrid characteristics (micro and mesoporous), higher surface areas, and basic surface chemistry are more likely to be effective for NDMA precursor control by PAC adsorption. The application of PAC in DWTPs for taste and odor control resulted in an additional 20% removal of NDMA FP for the PAC doses of 7-10 mg/L. The natural attenuation of NDMA precursors through a combination of processes (biodegradation, photolysis and adsorption) decreased their adsorbability and removal by PAC adsorption.

Tourism development in the Dominican Republic: An examination of the economic impact to coastal households								TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH				16	1	SI		35	49		10.1177/1467358415613118			JAN 2016	2016	Coastal tourism projects are promoted in the Dominican Republic as national-level economic development initiatives that will create jobs for local residents, subsequently benefiting the households in these communities. However, the economic benefits of tourism can be severely weakened as a result of the neoliberal economic policies that guide such projects. Like other economically developing countriesparticularly small island nationsthe Dominican Republic embraced neoliberal policies that have ultimately reshaped the country's economic, political, cultural, and physical landscape. As a result, transnational companies, foreign investors, and large-scale enclave tourism projects are the dominant form of tourism development in the Dominican Republic. Though companies' revenue and profit data are not available for analysis of economic leakage, households can be investigated to understand the level of economic benefits obtained by residents of the local communities. Toward this end, 360 household surveys were collected to examine household income and material assets across 12 coastal communities in three regions of the Dominican Republic. Because of the noted differences in previous development literature, gender of the head of households and whether the household was dependent on income from tourism employment were compared across these measures after adjusting for regional differences. Results indicate that the gender of the head of the household and tourism dependency positively predicted household income, while only gender of the head of the household predicted material assets.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1467-3584	1742-9692		WOS:000366645800004		
J	Maleki, Farzam Safarzadeh; Khan, Abdul A.								A novel Local Time Stepping algorithm for shallow water flow simulation in the discontinuous Galerkin framework								APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING				40	1			70	84		10.1016/j.apm.2015.04.038			JAN 1 2016	2016	This paper introduces a generic and efficient Local Time Stepping (LTS) algorithm called Local Flux Flagged-Local Time Stepping (LFF-LTS). The applicability of LFF-LTS algorithm to the solution of shallow water flow equations, utilizing the discontinuous Galerkin finite element framework, is investigated for uniform and non-uniform meshes. The proposed algorithm can be incorporated in any numerical scheme using an explicit time integration scheme. The new scheme is developed by combining and modifying the two existing LTS algorithms, where the domain time step (maximum allowable time step within the domain based on the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition) and the local time step for an element is determined such that the stability criterion is satisfied for all elements. Frozen flux approximation is used during the intermediate time step as the solution for each element is advanced to the domain time step. The algorithm is applied to idealized and practical shallow water flow problems with wet/dry and partially wet bed conditions, and its accuracy and efficiency are compared to the traditional Global Time Stepping (GTS) method. Results show that, with no loss of accuracy, the new LTS algorithm achieves 47-73% CPU time reduction when compared to the GTS method. The accuracy of the LFF-LTS and GTS algorithms are compared with analytical/measured data and found to be in good agreement. The LFF-LTS algorithm is compared with the two existing LTS schemes and found to be more efficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Non-destructive discrimination of conventional and glyphosate-resistant soybean seeds and their hybrid descendants using multispectral imaging and chemometric methods								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE				154	1			1	12		10.1017/S0021859614001142			JAN 2016	2016	Soybean is an important oil- and protein-producing crop and over the last few decades soybean genetic transformation has made rapid strides. The probability of occurrence of transgene flow should be assessed, although the discrimination of conventional and transgenic soybean seeds and their hybrid descendants is difficult in fields. The feasibility of non-destructive discrimination of conventional and glyphosate-resistant soybean seeds and their hybrid descendants was examined by a multispectral imaging system combined with chemometric methods. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), least squares-support vector machines (LS-SVM) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) methods were applied to classify soybean seeds. The current results demonstrated that clear differences among conventional and glyphosate-resistant soybean seeds and their hybrid descendants could be easily visualized and an excellent classification (98% with BPNN model) could be achieved. It was concluded that multispectral imaging together with chemometric methods would be a promising technique to identify transgenic soybean seeds with high efficiency.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0021-8596	1469-5146		WOS:000367194200001

Wang, Jun/0000-0003-4485-7201			A CROSS-LAGGED MODEL OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MENTOR-MENTEE RELATIONSHIPS AND INTENTIONAL SELF-REGULATION IN ADOLESCENCE								JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY				44	1			118	138		10.1002/jcop.21746			JAN 2016	2016	Intentional self-regulatory, or goal-directed, skills are essential for positive social relationships, success, and well-being during adolescence. Prior theory has suggested that mentoring relationships may provide a key resource for building these skills. However, there is little direct evidence linking mentoring relationships to growth in youth intentional self-regulation (ISR). Accordingly, we examined the bidirectional relations between mentor-mentee relationship and ISR using data from 415 mentor-mentee dyads from programs around the United States. The 415 youth (48% female) ranged in age from 10.14 to 20.65 and were ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. The 114 mentors (58.8% female; 64% Caucasian) were, on average, 33.6 years of age. Results from cross-lagged structural equation modeling indicated that a latent factor of mentor-mentee relationship predicted growth in a latent factor of youth ISR. These findings support the role of mentors in promoting youth ISR. The implications of these findings for the training of practitioners are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-4392	1520-6629		WOS:000366832400008

The proposed structure exhibits a sharply narrow plasmon-induced transparency peak in the transmission spectrum at the terahertz regime. Obvious frequency shift in the transparency peak can be observed by varying the surrounding medium's refractive index or the Fermi level in graphene, which can be well applied in bio-sensing technology. Moreover, an electrical RLC circuit model is used to provide a reasonable explanation for the optical response process in the proposed structure. Our work can offer reference value for the application of graphene technology as well as new idea for designing novel biosensors.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0950-0340	1362-3044		WOS:000367162300004		
J	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying; Yan, Li								DSearching: Using Floating Mobility Information for Distributed Node Searching in DTNs								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING				15	1			121	136		10.1109/TMC.2015.2409867			JAN 2016	2016	In delay tolerant networks (DTNs), enabling a mobile node to search and find another interested mobile node is an important function in many applications. However, the movement of nodes in DTNs makes the problem formidable. Current node searching methods in disconnected networks mainly rely on fixed stations in the network and infrastructure-based communication to collect node position information, which is difficult to implement in DTNs. In this paper, we present DSearching, a distributed mobile node searching scheme for DTNs that requires no infrastructure. In DSearching, the entire DTN area is split into sub-areas, and each node summarizes its mobility information as both transient sub-area visiting record and long-term movement pattern. Upon arriving at a sub-area, a node generates a new visiting record for the sub-area and distributes it to nodes that are likely to stay in the previous sub-area, so that visiting records form a chain for the locators to trace the node. Each node also stores different parts of its long-term mobility pattern to long-staying nodes in different sub-areas for others to trace it when visiting records are absent. Considering that nodes in DTNs usually have limited resources, DSearching constrains the communication and storage cost in the information distribution while enabling efficient node searching. Advanced extensions that can further improve the searching efficiency is also proposed in this paper. Extensive trace-driven experiments with real traces demonstrate the high efficiency and high effectiveness of DSearching.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1536-1233	1558-0660		WOS:000365990700009

Here, we report a novel approach for layer-by-layer (LbL) fabrication of nanometer-size fibronectin and gelatin (FN-G) layers on electrospun fibrous poly(carbonate urethane)urea (PCUU) scaffolds. Alternate immersions into the solutions of fibronectin and gelatin provided thickness-controlled FN-G nano-layers (PCUUFN-G) which maintained the scaffold's 3D structure and width of fibrous bundle of PCUU as evidenced by scanning electron miscroscopy. The PCUUFN-G scaffold improved cell adhesion and proliferation of bladder smooth muscles (BSMCs) when compared to uncoated PCUU. The high affinity of PCUUFN-G for cells was further demonstrated by migration of adherent BSMCs from culture plates to the scaffold. Moreover, the culture of UROtsa cells, human urothelium-derived cell line, on PCUUFN-G resulted in an 11-15 m thick multilayered cell structure with cell-to-cell contacts although many UROtsa cells died without forming cell connections on PCUU. Together these results indicate that this approach will aid in advancing the technology for engineering bladder tissues in vitro. Because FN-G nano-layers formation is based on nonspecific physical adsorption of fibronectin onto polymer and its subsequent interactions with gelatin, this technique may be applicable to other polymer-based scaffold systems for various tissue engineering/regenerative medicine applications.

The authors used data from two national surveys to compare students interested in civil engineering and other engineering disciplines. Those interested in civil engineering are more likely to address such sustainability topics as environmental degradation, water supply, and climate change. However, civil engineering students are less likely to have outcome expectations related to disease and saving lives. Particularly, female students interested in civil engineering have similar expectations to males but also hope to address poverty and opportunities for women and minorities. The gaps in outcome expectations related to disease and saving lives are troubling for a profession that is so instrumental in providing, for example, clean water and safe shelter. Showing the connection between societal needs and civil engineering may broaden participation, including among underrepresented female students. Recruiting more undergraduates using these outcome expectations would bring sorely needed new ideas and ways of thinking to help civil engineering respond to sustainability challenges.(C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1052-3928	1943-5541		WOS:000366748900006

Researchers have examined the overall structure of online destination network, but further investigation is needed to understand the networking patterns of different tourism stakeholders in cyberspace. This study constructed and analyzed a hyperlink network of 745 tourism stakeholders in Charleston, South Carolina. Link impact analysis, hyperlink network analysis, and statistical methods were employed for exploring the structural characteristics of the online networks among tourism stakeholders and their networking behaviors on the Web. The results revealed a sparse online network within the tourism industry of a destination, and suggested that tourism stakeholders' online networking behaviors vary across sectors. The findings also confirmed destination marketing organizations' central position in online tourism network, and validated the use of hyperlink network as an alternative and promising data source for destination network research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0047-2875	1552-6763		WOS:000366607900002

Diaspora tourism experience of second-generation immigrants								TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES				18	1			59	79		10.1080/14616688.2015.1116597			JAN 1 2016	2016	Diaspora tourism is often considered a form of homecoming,' but for the children of immigrants who are born in the new country, the question remains as to whether they perceive their parents' homeland as home' or destination. Moreover, advancements in transportation and communication technologies allow contemporary immigrants to maintain transnational ties to their homeland, which in turn may affect the nature of diaspora tourism. The purpose of this study is to understand the lived experience of second-generation immigrants when they travel to their ancestral homeland, and explore the extent to which second-generation transnationalism shapes their diaspora tourism experiences. Using a phenomenological approach, 26 second-generation Chinese-Americans who had the experience of traveling in China were interviewed. Four themes were identified from semi-structured interviews: language and appearance, search for authenticity, family history, and sense of home.' Proficiency in their parental language was found to be a main cause of negative experiences, yet occasionally a source of pride and attachment. Their search for authentic experiences was not unlike other tourists, while familial obligations sometimes limited their experience. Traveling back to the homeland not only allowed them to understand their parents and family history, but also reflect upon their life through experiencing contemporary China. Finally, as the transnational attachment of second-generation immigrants was not rooted in a specific locale, they could feel connected to the homeland without actually visiting their family's place of origin. Findings contribute to transnationalism and diaspora tourism literature by comparing first- and second-generation immigrants and identifying the difference between contemporary transmigrants and classic diaspora groups with regard to their diaspora tourism experience.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1461-6688	1470-1340		WOS:000366837300006

The approach undertaken begins with finite element modeling of the arch bridge and identification of the most significant vibration modes of the bridge through ambient vibration testing. Uncertain parameters of the finite element model are then revised through systematic comparisons of the measured vibration models to those that are predicted by the model. The revised finite element model is used to predict the time history response for displacements and stresses through which the effect of the finite element model updating on model predictions are evaluated. Furthermore, displacements and stresses obtained considering both near and far fault ground motions are then compared. Results indicate that near fault ground motion imposes higher seismic demand on the arch bridge observed in both higher displacements and stresses.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1570-761X	1573-1456		WOS:000366328500010

Specifically, ultrasmooth (root mean squared average roughness between 1 and 3 nm), crack-free carbon films were produced. In our procedure, the PAN films were first deposited onto a silicon wafer by conventional dip-coating process. Next, the films were stabilized at 230 degrees C in air and then carbonized at 1000 degrees C in an inert atmosphere. Raman spectroscopy indicated that after carbonization the films with ordered graphite structure as well as disordered phase were obtained. The same basic procedure was used to form porous carbon films with tunable porous structures when PAN and polyethylene oxide (PEO) blend was used instead of PAN only. In PAN/PEO blended films, PEO functioned as the pore initiation agent and resulted in carbon films whose pore diameter could be varied from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers. The carbon films (solid and porous) obtained in this study exhibit relatively high electrical conductivity. We expect that the method reported here can be employed for scalable manufacturing of ultrasmooth as well as porous carbon films. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Ze								A Kautz-Based Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network for Real-Time, Fault-Tolerant and Energy-Efficient Transmission								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING				15	1			1	16		10.1109/TMC.2015.2407391			JAN 2016	2016	Wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) are composed of sensors and actuators to perform distributed sensing and actuating tasks. Most WSAN applications (e.g., fire detection) demand that actuators rapidly respond to observed events. Therefore, real-time (i.e., fast) and fault-tolerant transmission is a critical requirement in WSANs to enable sensed data to reach actuators reliably and quickly. Due to limited power resources, energy-efficiency is another crucial requirement. Such requirements become formidably challenging in large-scale WSANs. However, existing WSANs fall short in meeting these requirements. To this end, we first theoretically study the Kautz graph for its applicability in WSANs to meet these requirements. We then propose a Kautz-based REal-time, Fault-tolerant and EneRgy-efficient WSAN (REFER). REFER embeds Kautz graphs into the physical topology of a WSAN for real-time communication and connects the Kautz graphs using distributed hash table (DHT) for high scalability. We also theoretically study routing paths in the Kautz graph, based on which we develop an efficient fault-tolerant routing protocol. It enables a relay node to quickly and efficiently identify the next shortest path from itself to the destination based only on node IDs upon routing failure, rather than relying on retransmission from the source. REFER is advantageous over previous Kautz graph based works in that it does not need an energy-consuming protocol to find the next shortest path and it preserves the consistency between the overlay and physical topology. We further improve routing in REFER by multi-path based routing and energy-efficient multicasting within and between Kautz graph cells, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of REFER in comparison with existing WSAN systems in terms of real-time communication, energy-efficiency, fault-tolerance and scalability.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1536-1233	1558-0660		WOS:000365990700001

In this article, we suggest that organizational practice has outpaced the scientific study of SM assessments in an area that has important consequences for individuals (e.g., being selected for work), organizations (e.g., successfully predicting job performance or withdrawal), and society (e.g., consequent adverse impact/diversity). We draw on theory and research from various literatures to advance a research agenda that addresses this gap between practice and research. Overall, we believe this is a somewhat rare moment in the human resources literature when a new class of selection methods arrives on the scene, and we urge researchers to help understand the implications of using SM assessments for personnel decisions.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0149-2063	1557-1211		WOS:000366159100010

In Florida, T. obtusus causes more damage than other stubby-root nematodes encountered in turfgrass. The objective of this study was to use morphological analysis, mitochondrial DNA (COI: cytochrome oxidase 1) and nuclear (18S rRNA) sequence data to study the genetic structure and haplotype diversity of populations recovered from turfgrasses in South Carolina. Numerous morphological differences were observed among populations. Three 18S haplotypes were shared among South Carolina and Florida populations, and six mitochondrial haplotypes were identified in South Carolina samples. Of the six COI haplotypes, four haplotypes were restricted to one population from St Augustinegrass. The lowest haplotype diversity was found in samples from zoysiagrass. Sequences of the COI mtDNA gene of T. obtusus were published in GenBank and represent the first mtDNA sequences for the genus Trichodorus.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-5545			WOS:000366294900006		
J	Crickenberger, Sam								Predicting a range shift and range limits in an introduced tropical marine invertebrate using species distribution models								HYDROBIOLOGIA				763	1			193	205		10.1007/s10750-015-2376-0			JAN 2016	2016	A major goal of invasion biology is to predict range shifts and potential range limits of nonnative species. Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to achieve these goals, but the predictive accuracy of these models is rarely tested using natural range shifts. The barnacle Megabalanus coccopoma is native to the eastern tropical Pacific and has been introduced to a number of locations globally including the southeastern United States. During the unusually cold winter months of 2010, the range of M. coccopoma within the USA SE retracted 825 km. The ability of the SDM MaxEnt to accurately predict the range retraction and M. coccopoma's range within the USA SE was tested using distributional data from before and after the range retraction. Three MaxEnt models were trained using data from the global range, the native range, and the USA SE introduced range. Only the model trained on data from the USA SE was able to accurately predict the entire extent of the range retraction and most known populations prior to the range retraction. Globally trained models may provide the most conservative estimates of potential distributions; however, niche shifts may limit the ability of these models to accurately predict range shifts.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000365726600016

This is particularly true for those who are adopted or living in foster care, and are thought to be attributed to an interruption in the bonding between a child and his or her caregiver. Attachment disorders are divided into two distinct categories: a predominately withdrawn type (i.e., Reactive Attachment Disorder) and a predominately disinhibited type (i.e., Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder). This column provides an overview of the characteristics in the two types of attachment disorders and offers suggestions for educational programming.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1053-4512	1538-4810		WOS:000365759600009

Enjoyment fosters media use frequency and determines its relational outcomes: Toward a synthesis of uses and gratifications theory and media multiplexity theory								COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR				54				149	157		10.1016/j.chb.2015.07.053			JAN 2016	2016	Previous work has begun to incorporate psychological constructs into our understanding of media multiplexity (i.e., use of multiple media in a single interpersonal relationship). Following this approach, this investigation examined how a user's enjoyment of a communication medium might both predict medium use frequency and alter the extent to which closeness is an outcome of such use. Results supported this model across six popular interpersonal communication media (voice telephone, text messaging, e-mail, instant messaging, video chat, and social networking sites) in relationships with extended family members. Specifically, at low levels of medium enjoyment, use of a medium was not associated with relational closeness. Practically, these results suggest that communicating via an unsatisfying medium may not foster relational closeness; theoretically, these results argue for including psychological processes to strengthen MMT as a theory of interpersonal media choice.

Past research has focused on the quality and generalizability of social and behavioral science research conducted using MTurk as a source of research participants. However, MTurk and other crowdsourcing platforms also exemplify trends toward extremely short-term contract work. We apply principles of industrial organizational (I 0) psychology to investigate MTurk Worker job satisfaction, information sharing, and turnover. We also report the top best and worst Requester behaviors (e.g., building a relationship, unfair pay) that affect Worker satisfaction. Worker satisfaction was consistently negatively related to turnover as expected, indicating that this traditional variable operates similarly in the MTurk work context. However, few of the traditional predictors of job satisfaction were significant, signifying that new operational definitions or entirely new variables may be needed in order to adequately understand the experiences of crowdsourced workers. Coworker friendships consistently predicted information sharing among Workers. The findings of this study are useful for understanding the experiences of crowdsourced workers from the perspective of I-O psychology, as well as for researchers using MTurk as a recruitment tool.

Armagan; Eksioglu, Burak								The stochastic lot sizing problem with piecewise linear concave ordering costs								COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH				65				104	110		10.1016/j.cor.2015.07.004			JAN 2016	2016	We address the stochastic lot sizing problem with piecewise linear concave ordering costs. The problem is very common in practice since it relates to a variety of settings involving quantity discounts, economies of scales, and use of multiple suppliers. We herein focus on implementing the (R, S) policy for the problem under consideration. This policy is appealing from a practical point of view because it completely eliminates the setup-oriented nervousness - a pervasive issue in inventory control. In this paper, we first introduce a generalized version of the (R, S) policy that accounts for piecewise linear concave ordering costs and develop a mixed integer programming formulation thereof. Then, we conduct an extensive numerical study and compare the generalized (R, S) policy against the cost-optimal generalized (s,S) policy. The results of the numerical study reveal that the (R, S) policy performs very well - yielding an average optimality gap around 1%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce a reconstruction formula for c that is based on the Boundary Control method and incorporates features also from the complex geometric optics solutions approach. Moreover, we show that the reconstruction formula is locally Lipschitz stable for a low frequency component of C-2 under the assumption that the Riemannian manifold (M, c(-2)dx(2)) has a strictly convex function with no critical points. That is, we show that for all bounded C-2 neighborhoods U of c, there is a C-1 neighborhood V of c and constants C, R> 0 such that broken vertical bar F(c(-2) -c(-2))1 < C <= 2R(broken vertical bar xi broken vertical bar)parallel to A - A parallel to, xi is an element of R-nfor all EE Un V, where -A- is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map corresponding to the wave speed E and broken vertical bar.broken vertical bar, is a norm capturing certain regularity properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0002-9947	1088-6850		WOS:000363795000011

With a low input power of 12 mW, the microcantilever heater was found to reach a maximum temperature of 330 degrees C at the tip, which was verified through infrared microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Unique threshold voltages were observed for various organic analytes with different functional groups, beyond which the heater current started to increase sharply in presence of analytes, which correlated strongly with their latent heat of evaporation. Dilute vapors with concentrations as low as 50 parts per million (ppm) could be detected selectively with a noise limited resolution down to 5 ppm. On the other hand, the magnitude of change of current for a fixed applied voltage was found to be dependent on the molecular dipole moment of the analytes, which can likely be attributed to the strong surface polarization of AlGaN. A simple circuit model has been proposed to explain the observations. Heat transfer and Joule heating simulations were performed using finite element method to model the electro-thermal characteristics of the microcantilever heater, which were in good agreement with the experimental observations.

In vitro digestion of short-dough biscuits enriched in proteins and/or fibres using a multi-compartmental and dynamic system (2): Protein and starch hydrolyses								FOOD CHEMISTRY				190				164	172		10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.050			JAN 1 2016	2016	The influence of protein and/or fibre enrichment on the nutritional properties of biscuits was studied in terms of proteolysis and amylolysis. Biscuits were digested using a multi-compartmental and dynamic system that simulates the main physiological digestive functions of the upper tract of healthy adult humans: the TIM-1. A control biscuit and three biscuits enriched in proteins and/or fibres were digested under the same conditions. Samples were collected in each compartment of the TIM-1 (stomach, duodenum, jejunum and ileum) at different times of digestion and analysed in terms of proteolysis and amylolysis. Results indicate that both formulation and processing impacted the digestive fate of the biscuits. Incorporating proteins or fibres in biscuits lowered or delayed proteolysis. Moreover a protein-plus-fibre additional or synergic effect was observed. Biscuits enriched in proteins and/or fibres displayed a higher amylolysis degree than the control biscuit, probably due to lower starch amounts and higher gelatinization degrees.

In the model the dependence of the fluid viscosity on the velocity is replaced by a dependence on a smoothed (locally averaged) velocity. With appropriate assumptions on the smoothed velocity, existence of a solution to the model is shown. Two examples of smoothing operators are presented in the appendices. A numerical approximation scheme is presented and an a priori error estimate derived. A numerical example is given illustrating the approximation scheme and the a priori error estimate.

The origins of the disjunct distribution of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes elegans								FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY				12						39	10.1186/s12983-015-0131-z			DEC 30 2015	2015	Background: Studying species with disjunct distributions allows biogeographers to evaluate factors controlling species ranges, limits on gene flow, and allopatric speciation. Here, we use phylogeographic and population genetic studies of the barnacle Pollicipes elegans to discriminate between two primary hypotheses about the origin of disjunct distributions of extra-tropical populations: trans-tropical stepping-stone colonization versus an out-of-the tropics origin.Results: Nucleotide diversity peaked in the centre of the species' range in samples from El Salvador and was lower in samples from higher latitudes at Mexico and Peru. Haplotypes from El Salvador samples also had a deeper coalescent, or an older time to a most recent common ancestor. A deep phylogeographical break exists between Mexico and all samples taken to the south (El Salvador and Peru). Isolation-with-migration analyses showed no significant gene flow between any of the three regions indicating that the difference in genetic differentiation among all three regions is explained primarily by differences in population separation times. Approximate Bayesian Computation model testing found strong support for an out-of-the tropics origin of extra-tropical populations in P. elegans.Conclusions: We found little evidence consistent with a stepping-stone history of trans-tropical colonization, but instead found strong evidence for a tropical origin model for the largely disjunct distribution of P. elegans. Sea surface temperature and habitat suitability are likely mechanisms driving decline of populations in tropical regions, causing the disjunct distribution.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-9994			WOS:000367354700001	26719753	
J	Jimma, Betiglu Eshete; Rangaraju, Prasada Rao								Chemical admixtures dose optimization in pervious concrete paste selection - A statistical approach								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				101				1047	1058		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.10.003			DEC 30 2015	2015	Making good-quality portland cement pervious concrete (PCPC) requires utilization of chemical admixtures. Several types of admixtures, including superplasticizers (SPs), viscosity modifying admixtures (VMA), and set-retarding admixtures (RE) are commonly used in PCPC. These chemical admixtures significantly influence the flowability, film-forming ability and film-drying time (setting time) of the paste component. Consequently, the workability of the PCPC mixtures is greatly affected by the type and amount of chemical admixture added. This paper shows how the Box-Behnken (BBD) response surface design can be used to characterize the individual and combined effects of SP, VMA and RE on pervious concrete paste. The paste properties evaluated include flowability, film-forming ability and film-drying time. Using the BBD technique, ranges of admixture combinations were studied with a reasonable amount of data points. Finally, mathematical equations (models) and response surfaces were developed. The models and the response surfaces could be used to select admixture doses for different type of PCPC mixtures. Therefore, this method is highly recommended for situations where concrete producers are required to create PCPC mixtures, which have variable mixture composition and material properties.

We demonstrate in this work a shape-based separation of equal-volumed spherical and peanut particles in viscoelastic fluids through straight rectangular microchannels. This continuous sheath-free separation arises from the shape-dependent equilibrium particle position(s) as a result of the flow-induced elasto-inertial lift and shear thinning effects. A continuous transition from single to dual and to triple equilibrium positions is observed for both types of particles with the increase in flow rate. However, the flow rate at which the transition takes place differs with the particle shape. This phenomenon occurs only in microchannels with a large aspect ratio (width/height) and has not been reported before. It is speculated to correlate with the dissimilar dependences of elastic and inertial lift forces on particle size and flow rate as well as the rotational effects of non-spherical particles.

Reservoir based learning network for control of two-area power system with variable renewable generation								NEUROCOMPUTING				170				428	438		10.1016/j.neucom.2015.01.089			DEC 25 2015	2015	The penetration of renewable energy sources into the electric power system is rapidly increasing. Integrating variable renewable energy sources into the transmission grid introduces challenges in real time power system operation. This causes power and frequency fluctuations and raises stability concerns. In this paper, a 200 MW photovoltaic (PV) plant is integrated into a two-area four-machine power system. In order to maintain the system frequency, a dynamic tie-line power flow control is implemented using predicted PV power as an input to the automatic generation controller in Area 1, which transfers power to Area 2 with PV generation. The prediction performances of two learning reservoir based networks, an echo state network (ESN) and an extreme learning machine (ELM), are investigated for day and night time operations. The experimental study is performed using actual weather data from Clemson, SC and a real time simulation of a utility-scale PV plant integrated power system. Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are used to provide input signals to automatic generation controllers in the two area power system. Typical tie-line power flow control results based on ESN and ELM models are presented to show the impact of predicting PV power in improved automatic generation control with variable generation. ESN and ELM models provide minimal tie-line power flow deviations from reference power flows during day and night time operations, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Athermal distributed Brillouin sensors utilizing all-glass optical fibers fabricated from rare earth garnets: LuAG								NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS				18						015004	10.1088/1367-2630/18/1/015004			DEC 24 2015	2015	An all-glass optical fiber derived from single-crystal LuAG is investigated for its potential use in athermal Brillouin distributed strain sensors. Such sensor systems are comprised of fiber whose Brillouin frequency shift is independent of temperature, but not independent of strain. Bulk Brillouin spectroscopy measurements on the precursor LuAG crystal are performed to gain insight into the crystal-to-glass transition. Results suggest that both the mass density and acoustic velocity are reduced relative to the crystal phase, in common with the other rare earth aluminosilicates. Advantages of the LuAG derived fiber over other rare earth garnet-derived fibers for the sensing application are a stronger strain response and larger Brilloun gain with narrower Brillouin spectral width.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1367-2630			WOS:000372368900001

However, conventional synthesis and processing methods (alloying and thermomechanical processing) have reached certain limits in further improving the properties of magnesium and other metals(6). Ceramic particles have been introduced into metal matrices to improve the strength of the metals(7), but unfortunately, ceramic microparticles severely degrade the plasticity and machinability of metals(7), and nanoparticles, although they have the potential to improve strength while maintaining or even improving the plasticity of metals(8,9), are difficult to disperse uniformly in metal matrices(10-14). Here we show that a dense uniform dispersion of silicon carbide nanoparticles (14 per cent by volume) in magnesium can be achieved through a nanoparticle self-stabilization mechanism in molten metal. An enhancement of strength, stiffness, plasticity and high-temperature stability is simultaneously achieved, delivering a higher specific yield strength and higher specific modulus than almost all structural metals.									25	1	0	3	0	26			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000366991900049	26701055

Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)				21	1			E24	E24		10.3390/molecules21010024			2015 Dec 23	2015	The reversible reaction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) with primary amines to form alkyl-ammonium carbamates is demonstrated in this work to reduce amine reactivity against nucleophilic substitution reactions with benzophenone and phenyl isocyanate. The reversible formation of carbamates has been recently exploited for a number of unique applications including the formation of reversible ionic liquids and surfactants. For these applications, reduced reactivity of the carbamate is imperative, particularly for applications in reactions and separations. In this work, carbamate formation resulted in a 67% reduction in yield for urea synthesis and 55% reduction for imine synthesis. Furthermore, the amine reactivity can be recovered upon reversal of the carbamate reaction, demonstrating reversibility. The strong nucleophilic properties of amines often require protection/de-protection schemes during bi-functional coupling reactions. This typically requires three separate reaction steps to achieve a single transformation, which is the motivation behind Green Chemistry Principle #8: Reduce Derivatives. Based upon the reduced reactivity, there is potential to employ the reversible carbamate reaction as an alternative method for amine protection in the presence of competing reactions. For the context of this work, CO₂ is envisioned as a green protecting agent to suppress formation of n-phenyl benzophenoneimine and various n-phenyl-n-alky ureas.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		MEDLINE:26703563	26703563

Increasingly, forest scientists are finding genetic/genomic resources valuable in addressing forest health issues. For a set of ten ecologically and economically important native hardwood tree species representing a broad phylogenetic spectrum, we used low coverage whole genome sequencing from multiplex Illumina paired ends to economically profile their genomic content. For six species, the genome content was further analyzed by flow cytometry in order to determine the nuclear genome size. Sequencing yielded a depth of 0.8X to 7.5X, from which in silico analysis yielded preliminary estimates of gene and repetitive sequence content in the genome for each species. Thousands of genomic SSRs were identified, with a clear predisposition toward dinucleotide repeats and AT-rich repeat motifs. Flanking primers were designed for SSR loci for all ten species, ranging from 891 loci in sugar maple to 18,167 in redbay. In summary, we have demonstrated that useful preliminary genome information including repeat content, gene content and useful SSR markers can be obtained at low cost and time input from a single lane of Illumina multiplex sequence.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000367092600044	26698853

Depending on their relative concentrations in vitro, zinc could either promote or inhibit TAPP aggregation. Interestingly, genomewide association studies suggested both positive and negative correlations between T2D risks and activities of a beta-cell-specific zinc transporter upon mutations, which determines zinc concentration in vivo. To decipher the effect of zinc coordination on TAPP aggregation, we performed atomistic discrete molecular dynamics simulations to systemically study aggregation propensities of zinc-coordinated IAPP oligomers with different molecular weights (MWs), whose populations are determined by zinc concentrations We find that at low zinc:IAPP stoichiometry, zinc coordination promotes aggregation by forming high-MW oligomers. The aggregation is inhibited when the stoichiometry increases and zinc binds individual peptides. Our computationally derived predictions are validated by the complementary thioflavin-T fluorescence assay measuring the dependence of TAPP aggregation on a wide range of zinc concentrations. Our combined computational and experimental study offers detailed mechanistic insight into the complex role of zinc on IAPP aggregation and T2D development.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0006-2960			WOS:000367279700005	26603575

Together with the gravitationally lensed blazar QSO. B0218 +357 (z = 0.944), PKS. 1441+25 is the most distant very high energy (VHE) blazar detected to date. The observations were triggered by an outburst in 2015 April seen at GeV energies with the Large Area Telescope on board Fermi. Multi-wavelength observations suggest a subdivision of the high state into two distinct flux states. In the band covered by MAGIC, the variability timescale is estimated to be 6.4 +/- 1.9 days. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution with an external Compton model, the location of the emitting region is understood as originating in the jet outside the broad-line region (BLR) during the period of high activity, while being partially within the BLR during the period of low (typical) activity. The observed VHE spectrum during the highest activity is used to probe the extragalactic background light at an unprecedented distance scale for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy.									10	0	0	0	0	10			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000369081700007

The governing equations consist of a generalized Darcy's law combined with flow and continuity equations. The contribution to fouling as either a static surface cake or depth plugging in the media is governed by a distribution function representing the ratio of the two phenomena. The mathematical model and solution for the clean filter case (i.e. no fouling) are presented first, along with design parameters (characteristic length, flow rate, and pressure) that arise from the solutions. The analytical solutions for the no-fouling case yield limiting values of filter length, inlet flow rate, and inlet pressure drop. These bounds also provide reasonable limits for operating parameters in the transient model with fouling. Parameter studies that compare transient effects with fouling to the clean filter case are presented to illustrate the application of the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of Compost on the Chemistry of an Urban Upper Piedmont South Carolina Soil								COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS				46	22			2787	2797		10.1080/00103624.2015.1089270			DEC 16 2015	2015	Composting is an effective method to improve the fertility of degraded soils. However, the potential beneficial effects of composting on the fertility of urban soils have not been reported. This study compared nutrients measured in compost and soil samples collected from a residential urban plot in Clemson, SC. The dominant soil type present was an eroded Cecil sandy loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Kanhapludults), and the collected samples represented the following treatments: compost, garden, front lawn, backyard lawn, and basement (nonvegetated control). Tissues of leaf detritus were also analyzed to establish the nutrient contribution from leaves to soil. Standard soil tests were conducted to characterize soil macronutrients, macrominerals, and micronutrients, as well as soil parameters such as pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the treatment means for each soil parameter and nutrient measured. In all cases, the different treatments had significantly different levels of nutrients based on Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) (P<0.05). Our results show that composting can be a significant source for major soil nutrients and minerals in urban soils. Therefore, utilization of compost and leaf detritus should be beneficial for improving degraded soil in urban environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-3624	1532-2416		WOS:000365724000001

Cambarus (Hiaticambarus) andersoni and Cambarus (Hiaticambarus) diupalma differed from C. longirostris and from each other in aspects of chela morphometrics and in the presence or absence of qualitative characters. Cambarus andersoni has a corneous spine on the base of the ventral surface of the rostrum that is absent in the other two species; C. diupalma abdominal pleura are acute whereas they are subtruncate in C. andersoni and in C. longirostris. The known range of both of the new species is restricted to northern tributaries of the Tennessee River in south Tennessee and north Alabama. Cambarus diupalma is considered Endangered and C. andersoni is considered Vulnerable using American Fisheries Society conservation categorization.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1175-5326	1175-5334		WOS:000366450300001	26701517	
J	Petukh, Marharyta; Zhang, Min; Alexov, Emil								Statistical Investigation of Surface Bound Ions and Further Development of BION Server to Include pH and Salt Dependence								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY				36	32			2381	2393		10.1002/jcc.24218			DEC 15 2015	2015	Ions are engaged in multiple biological processes in cells. By binding to the macromolecules or being mobile in the solvent, they maintain the integrity of the structure of macromolecules; participate in their enzymatic activity; or screen electrostatic interactions. While experimental methods are not always able to assign the exact location of ions, computational methods are in demand. Although the majority of computational methods are successful in predicting the position of ions buried inside macromolecules, they are less effective in deciphering positions of surface bound ions. Here, we propose the new BION algorithm (http://compbio.clemson.edu/bion_server_ph/) that predicts the location of the surface bound ions. It is more efficient and accurate compared to the previous version since it uses more advanced clustering algorithm in combination with pairing rules. In addition, the BION webserver allows specifying the pH and the salt concentration in predicting ions positions.

However, little is known concerning effects of the fire triangle (heat, oxygen, and fuel) on DOM alteration. Using detritus from Pinus ponderosa and Abies concolor (dominant species in forests in the western United States), we prepared DOM from unburned and burned detritus under hypoxic (pyrolysis) and oxic conditions (thermal oxidation) at 250 and 400 degrees C. DOM characteristics and chlorine reactivity were evaluated by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and chlorination-based DBP formation potential tests. Spectroscopic results suggest that burned-detritus extracts had lower molecular weight (reflected by increased E2:E3 and fluorescence index) and divergent aromaticity (reflected by SUVA(254)) depending on oxygen availability. Temperature and oxygen availability interacted to alter the chlorine reactivity of fire-affected DOM. Increasing temperature from 50 to 400 degrees C resulted in decreased reactivities for trihalomethane and chloral hydrate formation and divergent reactivities for haloacetonitrile formation (unchanged for pyrolysis and increased for oxidation) and haloketone formation (increased for pyrolysis and decreased for oxidation). We demonstrate that DBP precursors in fire-affected forest detritus are highly dependent on temperature and oxygen availability.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000366872300017	26496434

SFU was used as cementitious material in addition to cement; SFL was used as filler material replacing part of the fine aggregate. The use of SFL in combination with SFU increased the early-age compressive strength of HPCM, but decreased the later-age compressive strengths. Based on the results of both thermo-gravimetric analysis and loss on ignition tests, this phenomenon was attributed to the improved hydration of cementitious materials by SFL at early ages, but inhibited continued hydration at later ages. The addition of SFL combined with SFU resulted in further reduction of chloride ion permeability and the volume of permeable voids. The addition of SFL slightly increased the drying shrinkage. Among SFLs with different fineness, the finest SFL which densified the microstructure of HPCM most resulted in the highest drying shrinkage. For HPCM cured under ambient-temperature the use of SFU alone will suffice when used at sufficient dosages; and the addition of SFL along with SFU presents advantages mostly in improving the early-age compressive strengths.

Strength activity index, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and mortar bar tests were conducted to study the pozzolanic behavior and ASR mitigation ability. The results from this study showed that ternary mixtures consisting of finely ground soda glass with either slag or Class C fly ash out-performed binary mixtures consisting of each of these SCMs at an equivalent dosage level. Binary mixtures consisting of meta-kaolin outperformed ternary mixtures consisting of ground glass powder with meta-kaolin at equivalent dosage level. Among all the binary and ternary mixtures that contained 30% level of SCMs, the maximum strength activity index and the most efficient ASR mitigation was obtained in ternary mixtures consisting of at least 10% glass powder. The results from TGA studies supported these findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									1	1	0	0	0	2			0950-0618	1879-0526		WOS:000364608000025		
J	Simpson, Catherine R.; Nelson, Shad D.; Melgar, Juan C.; Jifon, John; Schuster, Greta; Volder, Astrid								Effects of salinity on physiological parameters of grafted and ungrafted citrus trees								SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE				197				483	489		10.1016/j.scienta.2015.10.010			DEC 14 2015	2015	Subtropical and tropical climates are becoming more vulnerable to drought and salinity problems. Of the crops produced in these climates, citrus is especially sensitive to increasing salinity. In times of water scarcity and periodic drought alternative water sources that may be lower in quality may be required for irrigation, leading to reduced yield unless a mechanism of increasing salinity tolerance is found. The salinity tolerance of citrus rootstocks differs depending on species and cultivar in their ability to exclude or sequester toxic ions. Identifying rootstocks that are more salt tolerant is important to citrus production in susceptible areas. 'Olinda' Valencia trees budded to three rootstocks (sour orange [SO], C22, and C146) and the ungrafted rootstocks were subjected to 6 months of saline irrigation. Simulated brackish water at 1, 3, 5, and 10 dS m(-1) along with a 0 dS m(-1) control were used to irrigate trees over the course of the study. Throughout this time period chlorophyll fluorescence, stomatal conductance, electrolyte leakage, and SPAD were measured to identify how trees responded to different levels of salinity stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence, stomatal control, and SPAD decreased with increased salinity, while electrolyte leakage increased. These responses were more pronounced in grafted trees than ungrafted trees. C22 and C146 rootstocks showed more tolerance to increases in salinity than the SO rootstocks. The 'Olinda' Valencia scion reduces rootstock tolerance to salinity, however, trees grafted to the C22 and C146 rootstocks showed more salinity tolerance than those grafted to SO rootstocks. This study emphasizes that both rootstock and scion should be considered when selecting trees for saline conditions.

Different types of loss functions are considered for Bayesian estimation. Furthermore, the Bayes estimators and their respective posterior risks are computed and compared using Gibbs sampling. The different reliability characteristics including hazard function, stress and strength analysis, and mean residual life function are also derived. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the performances of the proposed methods of estimation and two real data sets have been analysed for illustrative purposes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-9655	1563-5163		WOS:000361612800003

Because of this regulatory role, miRNAs have become a new target for therapeutic compounds. Here, we outline an approach to target specific miRNAs using a high throughput capable assay and a 215 compound peptidic-aminosugar (PA) library. Aminosugars have been shown in a number of recent reports as important lead compounds that bind miRNA. In order to screen for compounds that bind miRNA, we have developed a high throughput displacement assay using a fluorescein-neomycin conjugated molecule (F-neo) as a probe for competitive miRNA binding compounds. We have applied the F-neo assay to four different miRNA constructs and the assay is applicable to most miRNAs, at various stages of processing. The results of the screen were validated by the determination of the IC50 for a select group of compounds from the library. For example, we identified eight compounds that bind to hsa-miR 504 with higher affinity than the parent neomycin. From the F-neo displacement assay we found that the number of binding sites differs for each miRNA, and the binding sites appear to differ both physically and chemically, with different affinity of the compounds resulting from the size of the molecule as well as the chemical structure. Additionally, the affinity of the compounds was dependent on the identity and position of the amino acid position of conjugation and the affinity of the compounds relative to other compounds in the library was miRNA dependent with the introduction of a second amino acid.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000366903600032	26656788

THE FIRST SAMPLE								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				815	1					5	10.1088/0004-637X/815/1/5			DEC 10 2015	2015	We present newly derived stellar parameters and the detailed abundances of 19 elements of seven stars with small planets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission. Each star, save one, has at least one planet with a radius <= 1.6 R-circle plus, suggesting a primarily rocky composition. The stellar parameters and abundances are derived from high signal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution echelle spectroscopy obtained with the 10 m Keck I telescope and High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer using standard spectroscopic techniques. The metallicities of the seven stars range from -0.32 to + 0.13 dex, with an average metallicity that is subsolar, supporting previous suggestions that, unlike Jupiter-type giant planets, small planets do not form preferentially around metal-rich stars. The abundances of elements other than iron are in line with a population of Galactic disk stars, and despite our modest sample size, we find hints that the compositions of stars with small planets are similar to stars without known planets and with Neptune-size planets, but not to those of stars with giant planets. This suggests that the formation of small planets does not require exceptional host-star compositions and that small planets may be ubiquitous in the Galaxy. We compare our derived abundances (which have typical uncertainties of less than or similar to 0.04 dex) to the condensation temperature of the elements; a correlation between the two has been suggested as a possible signature of rocky planet formation. None of the stars demonstrate the putative rocky planet signature, despite at least three of the stars having rocky planets estimated to contain enough refractory material to produce the signature, if real. More detailed abundance analyses of stars known to host small planets are needed to verify our results and place ever more stringent constraints on planet formation models.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000367105000005

Changes in reflectance such as that due to metal stress may occur before damage is visible, and existing studies have shown that metal stress does cause changes in plant reflectance. To further investigate the potential use of reflectance spectroscopy as a method for assessing metal stress in plants, an exploratory study was conducted in which Arabidopsis thaliana plants were treated twice weekly in a laboratory setting with varying levels (0, 0.5, or 5 mM (millimolar)) of caesium chloride (CsCl) solution, and reflectance spectra were collected every week for three weeks using an Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpec Pro spectroradiometer with both a contact probe (CP) and a field of view (FOV) probe at 36.8 and 66.7 cm, respectively, above the plant. Plants were harvested each week after spectra collection for determination of relative water content and chlorophyll content. A visual assessment of the plants was also conducted using point observations on a uniform grid of 81 points. A mixed-effects model analysis was conducted for each vegetation index (VI) considered to determine the effects of length of treatment, treatment level, view with which spectra were acquired, and the interactions of these terms. Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed on the aforementioned endpoints (e.g. chlorophyll content) to determine the significance of the effects of treatment level and length of treatment. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to develop a predictive model for each endpoint, considering VI acquired at each view (CP, high FOV, and low FOV). Of the 14 VI considered, 8 were included in the MLR models. Contact probe readings and FOV readings differed significantly, but FOV measurements were generally consistent at each height.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0143-1161	1366-5901		WOS:000365865600006		
J	Dandeneau, Christopher S.; Yang, YiHsun; Olmstead, Marjorie A.; Bordia, Rajendra K.; Ohuchi, Fumio S.								Polaronic conduction and Anderson localization in reduced strontium barium niobate								APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS				107	23					232901	10.1063/1.4937435			DEC 7 2015	2015	Electron transport mechanisms in reduced Sr0.5Ba0.5Nb2O6 (SBN50) are investigated from similar to 100 to 955K through an analysis of the electrical conductivity (sigma) and the Seebeck coefficient (S) with respect to temperature (T). Notably, experimental evidence is presented that supports a scenario of Anderson localization below 600K and carrier excitation across a mobility edge at higher temperature. As a relaxor ferroelectric, stoichiometric SBN has intrinsic disorder associated with both the distribution of Sr/Ba vacancies and the formation of polarized nanoregions. The removal of oxygen through reduction generates conduction electrons in SBN. At the lowest temperatures measured (100-155 K), the electrical conductivity exhibits a temperature dependence characteristic of variable range hopping, followed by a transition to small polaron hopping at intermediate temperatures (250-545 K). In both the variable range and small polaron hopping regimes, a semiconductor-like temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity (d sigma/dT>0) was observed. However, above 615 K, d sigma/dT decreases dramatically and eventually becomes metal-like (d sigma/dT<0). Concomitantly, the Seebeck coefficient exhibits a linear dependence on lnT from 615 to 955K with the same slope (similar to 104 mu V/K) for both polycrystalline SBN50 and single crystalline SBN61 (both reduced), indicating a similar, constant density of states near the Fermi level for both compositions. The application of Seebeck coefficient theory to this inherently disordered material reveals that the excitation of carriers across a mobility edge is likely responsible for the change in d sigma/dT at high temperature. Such findings may have a significant impact in the field of conductive ferroelectrics. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000367010800039

Investigation of molecular mechanisms of resistance is therefore of upmost importance. In this study the gene encoding the target protein for DMI fungicides (VvCYP51) was cloned and investigated. The VvCYP51 gene in the resistant mutant revealed both a change from tyrosine to histidine at position 137 (Y137H) and elevated gene expression compared to the parental isolate. In order to determine which of these mechanisms was responsible for the reduced sensitivity to DMI fungicide tebuconazole, transformants expressing the mutated or the wild type VvCYP51 gene were generated. Transformants carrying the mutated gene were more resistant to tebuconazole compared to control transformants lacking the mutation, but the expression of the VvCYP51 gene was not significantly correlated with EC50 values. The wild type VvCYP51 protein exhibited stronger affinity for tebuconazole compared to the VvCYP51/Y137H in both molecular docking analysis and experimental binding assays. The UV-generated mutant as well as transformants expressing the VvCYP51/Y137H did not exhibit significant fitness penalties based on mycelial growth and spore germination, suggesting that isolates resistant to DMI fungicides based on the Y137H mutation may develop and be competitive in the field.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000365726100001	26631591

Drawing on national survey data (2010 Baylor Religion Survey), we test whether holding neoliberal values is associated with greater support for same-sex adoption in general and across political or religious conservatives. We find no support for either theoryemphatically the opposite, in fact. Neoliberal values are negatively associated with support for same-sex adoption for Americans in general and among political and religious conservatives. We find little evidence of a tension among conservatives regarding same-sex adoption as both their neoliberal values and moral beliefs incline them to oppose same-sex adoption along with other same-sex family relationships.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0091-8369	1540-3602		WOS:000363741700006	26226393

Biochemistry and biophysics reports				4				33	38					2015-Dec-1	2015	Incubation of African trypanosomes with the lectin concanavalin A (conA) leads to alteration in cellular DNA content, DNA degradation, and surface membrane blebbing. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a conA-refractory Trypanosoma brucei line. These insect stage parasites were resistant to conA killing, with a mediun lethal dose at least 50-fold greater than the parental line. Fluorescence-based experiments revealed that the resistant cells bound less lectin when compared to the parental line. Western blotting and mass spectrometry confirmed that the resistant line lacked an N-glycan required for conA binding on the cellular receptors, EP procyclin proteins. The failure to N-glycosylate the EP procyclins was not the consequence of altered N-glycan precursor biosynthesis, as another glycosylated protein (Fla1p) was normally modified. These findings support the likelihood that resistance to conA was a consequence of failure to bind the lectin trigger.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:26393238	26393238	
J	Ryan, Colin; Furtick, Joshua; Kucera, Courtney J.; Stolen, Roger; Ballato, John; Dragic, Peter								Pockels Coefficients in Multicomponent Oxide Glasses								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED GLASS SCIENCE				6	4	SI		387	396		10.1111/ijag.12146			DEC 2015	2015	In this work, a corrected model for the additivity of the Pockels coefficients in multicomponent oxide glasses is derived. Given some material deformation, changes in density and electronic polarizability are known to be the dominant factors in the photoelastic effect. A trend of Pockels coefficients decreasing with increasing bond ionicity is postulated. This is discussed and shown to be due to the balancing of the relative changes in density and in polarization based on the bond strength and directionality. Alkali silicate data taken from the literature, shown to oppose the observed trends, is analyzed and compared to alkaline earth silicate data. The opposing trend is shown to be due to the bonding of the modifier ions. The alkali ions, associated with a single nonbridging oxygen (NBO), yield an increased relative density change and a decreased relative change in polarization. The alkaline earth ions, being associated with two NBOs, as expected experience significant density and polarizability changes that are more spatially distributed. Greater insights into the structural and chemical origins of the Pockels coefficient in multicomponent oxide glasses will enable the development of new optical fibers for high energy laser applications where photoelasticity-influenced parasitic effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering are mitigated.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2041-1286	2041-1294		WOS:000368596200009

SEISMIC HAZARD ANALYSIS FOR THE ALBERTINE REGION, UGANDA - A PROBABILISTIC APPROACH								SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY				118	4			411	424		10.2113/gssajg.118.4.411			DEC 2015	2015	The Albertine region of Uganda is characterized by high levels of seismic activity and by many active normal faults. The aim of this work is to assess the potential hazard accruing from earthquakes in the Albertine region, using the probabilistic approach to assess the seismic hazard for, specifically, the Hoima and Buliisa districts. The input parameters for the seismic hazard computation were obtained using the earthquake catalogue compiled for the period 1900 to 2012, including earthquakes within an area bounded by latitudes 1.5 degrees S to 4 degrees N and longitudes 29 degrees E to 33 degrees E. All magnitudes were homogenized to moment magnitude scale. The study area was divided into two seismic source zones based on seismotectonic analysis. The updated ground motion prediction equation by Pankow and Pechmann was used in the computations. Seismic hazard maps in terms of the Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) for 10%, 5% and 2% probabilities of exceedance in 50 years were derived. The results show that the PGA values for both districts fall in the range of 0.152 to 0.162 g, 0.187 to 0.195 g and 0.248 to 0.256 g (where g is the acceleration due to gravity), for return periods of 475, 975 and 2,475 years, respectively. The highest levels of seismic hazard were found in the southwestern part of the Hoima district, where PGA values were in excess of 0.162 g, 0.195 g and 0.256 g for 10%, 5% and 2% chances of exceedance in 50 years, respectively. We conclude that in the Albertine region, the return period for an earthquake capable of causing damage to engineering structures is, on average, 30 years. It is thus recommended that all important engineering structures in the region should be designed for earthquake resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1012-0750	1996-8590		WOS:000380072600005

J	Cha, Jinho; Cho, Byung Rae								Classical Statistical Inference Extended to Truncated Populations for Continuous Process Improvement: Test Statistics, P-values, and Confidence Intervals								QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL				31	8			1807	1824		10.1002/qre.1719			DEC 2015	2015	Statistical hypothesis testing is useful for controlling and improving processes, products, and services. This most fundamental, yet powerful, continuous improvement tool has a wide range of applications in quality and reliability engineering. Some application areas include statistical process control, process capability analysis, design of experiments, life testing, and reliability analysis. It is well-known that most parametric hypothesis tests on a population mean, such as z-test and t-test, require a random sample from the population under study. However, there are special situations in engineering, where the specification limits, such as the lower and upper specification limits, on the process are implemented externally, and the product is typically reworked or scrapped if the performance of a product does not fall in the range. As such, a random sample needs to be taken from a truncated distribution; however, there has been little work on the theoretical foundation of statistical hypothesis procedures under this special situation. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we provide the mathematical justifications that the central limit theorem works quite well for a large sample size, given samples taken from a truncated distribution. We also verify this finding using simulation. Second, we then develop the new one-sided and two-sided z-test and t-test procedures, including their test statistics, confidence intervals, and P-values, using appropriate truncated statistics.

Beams of normally incident Na+ ions with kinetic energies of 2 keV to 5 keV were focused onto N similar to 1900 angstrom SiO2 films. Aluminum top metal contacts were subsequently deposited onto these targets such that irradiated regions and unexposed (pristine) regions of the target could be compared using capacitance voltage (C V) measurements of individual metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices. The C V data reveal an energy-dependent shift in the Hatband voltage (V-FB) that can be returned to its near-pristine value by a low temperature anneal. An increase in the density of interface states (D-it) inferred from the C-V curves is found to have a superlinear dependence on the incident kinetic energy. These data are consistent with previously observed UV radiation effects on MOS oxides, where transferred energy leads to electron-hole pair production and the diffusion and trapping of holes throughout the oxide. Our measured trapped hole densities are compared with calculated densities, which are based on the incident ion dose and the predicted ion implantation range, to arrive at a fractional yield for hole survival and measurement within an encapsulated MOS device.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-9499	1558-1578		WOS:000372013500030

Freshwater Crayfish				21	1			33	41					December 2015	2015	Spatial distributions of South Carolina crayfish were geo-referenced for over 3900 museum and collection records. Collection site records are not evenly distributed across the state; some parts of the state are poorly represented while other parts have a disproportionate number of collection records. Currently, 38 described species in five genera occur in the state of which eight are endemic species and one an introduced species. Cambarus latimanus and Procambarus troglodytes were the two most widely distributed species while the four Distocambarus species have the narrowest distributions. Most of the records of Cambarus were from above the fall line, whereas, Procambarus records occurred mostly below the fall line; the exceptions were for the primary burrowers C. diogenes and C. reflexus and the stream dwelling P. spiculifer. Crayfish species were rarely restricted to single river systems or watershed units. The 27% of South Carolina crayfish species considered in the greatest conservation need included all four Distocambarus species, four Cambarus species and two Procambarus species. Conservation status of the South Carolina crayfish will require updating because of the potential taxonomic problems of species complexes, new species descriptions and limited distribution records for some species.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2076-4324; 2076-4332			ZOOREC:ZOOR15204026428

HIV-infected individuals survive longer with treatment, but are less likely to transmit the disease. The standard coverage measure improves with the deaths of untreated individuals and does not consider the fact that some individuals may acquire the disease and die before receiving treatment, making it susceptible to overestimating the long-run performance of antiretroviral treatment programs. Objective: The objective was to propose an alternative coverage definition to better measure the long-run performance of HIV treatment programs. Methods: We introduced cumulative incidence-based coverage as an alternative to measure an HIV treatment program's success. To numerically compare the definitions, we extended a simulation model of HIV disease and treatment to represent a dynamic population that includes uninfected and HIV-infected individuals. Also, we estimated the additional resources required to implement various treatment policies in a resource-limited setting. Results: In a synthetic population of 600,000 people of which 44,000 (7.6%) are infected, and eligible for treatment with a CD4 count of less than 500 cells/mm(3), assuming a World Health Organization (WHO)-defined coverage rate of 50% of eligible people, and treating these individuals with a single treatment regimen, the gap between the current WHO coverage definition and our proposed one is as much as 16% over a 10-year planning horizon. Conclusions: Cumulative incidence-based definition of coverage yields a more accurate representation of the long-run treatment success and along with the WHO and other definitions of coverage provides a better understanding of the HIV treatment progress.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1098-3015	1524-4733		WOS:000371231500022	26686798

First, individuals' gaze switching patterns, represented by fixated AOI sequences, are modeled as Markov chains. Second, Shannon's entropy coefficient of the fit Markov model is computed to quantify the complexity of individual switching patterns. To determine the overall distribution of attention over AOIs, the entropy coefficient of individuals' stationary distribution of fixations is calculated. The novelty of the method is that it captures the variability of individual differences in eye movement characteristics, which are then summarized statistically. The method is demonstrated on gaze data collected from two studies, during free viewing of classical art paintings. Normalized Shannon's entropy, derived from individual transition matrices, is related to participants' individual differences as well as to either their aesthetic impression or recognition of artwork. Low transition and high stationary entropies suggest greater curiosity mixed with a higher subjective aesthetic affinity toward artwork, possibly indicative of visual scanning of the artwork in a more deliberate way. Meanwhile, both high transition and stationary entropies may be indicative of recognition of familiar artwork.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1544-3558	1544-3965		WOS:000369773400004

Proximity to encroaching coconut palm limits native forest water use and persistence on a Pacific atoll								ECOHYDROLOGY				8	8			1514	1524		10.1002/eco.1601			DEC 2015	2015	Competition for fresh water between native and introduced plants is one important challenge facing native forests as rainfall variability increases. Competition can be especially acute for vegetation on Pacific atolls, which depend upon consistent rainfall to replenish shallow groundwater stores. Patterns of sap flow, water use, and diameter growth of Pisonia grandis trees were investigated on Sand Islet, Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands, during a period of low rainfall. Sap flow in the outer sapwood was reduced by 53% for P. grandis trees growing within coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) stands (n=9) versus away from coconut palm (n=9). This suggested that water uptake was being limited by coconut palm. Radial patterns of sap flow into the sapwood of P. grandis also differed between stands with and without coconut palm, such that individual tree water use for P. grandis ranged from 14 to 67Lday(-1), averaging 478Lday(-1) without coconut palm and 236Lday(-1) with coconut palm. Diameter growth of P. grandis was measured from nine islets. In contrast to sap flow, competition with coconut palm increased diameter growth by 89%, equating to an individual tree basal area increment of 54 versus 103mm(2)day(-1). Greater diameter growth countered by lower rates of water use by P. grandis trees growing in competition with coconut palm suggests that stem swell may be associated with water storage when positioned in the understory of coconut palm, and may facilitate survival when water becomes limiting until too much shading overwhelms P. grandis.

The cascaded multicell (CM) topologies reach higher output voltage and power levels, and also retain higher reliability due to their modular and fault-tolerant features. This paper initially proposes an optimized topology for symmetrical CM (SCM) multilevel converters. The superiority of the proposed SCM, as compared with the conventional CM converter structure, is that the number of required high-frequency power switches is reduced. Next, a new topology of an asymmetrical CM (ACM) converter, which is formed based on the proposed optimized modules of an SCM converter, is suggested. The advantage of the proposed new ACM converter in comparison with the traditional ACM topology is that the variety of the dc links with different voltage ratings reduces, which makes the proposed topology more modular. The simulation results and the experimental measurements taken from the laboratory prototypes are presented for the proposed converters in order to validate the effectiveness and the advantages of these converters as well as their control strategy.

The Use of Virtual Welding Simulators to Evaluate Experienced Welders								WELDING JOURNAL				94	12			389S	395S					DEC 2015	2015	Virtual reality welding simulations have been, and continue to be, a trend in welding training programs. The goal of this study was to examine the use of virtual reality simulations as an assessment tool for existing welders. This study used a virtual reality welding simulator, VRTEX (R) 360, to assess the existing skills of experienced and trained novice welders. This study also used the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process to perform simple and complex welds. Performance was evaluated through a quality score, which was based on the following five welding parameters: arc length, position, work angle, travel angle, and travel speed. The virtual reality welding simulator was able to evaluate performance, but it could not distinguish between experienced and trained novice welders. On average, experienced welders as a group scored 10 quality points higher than trained novice welders. Welding experience also had a large to very large effect on the quality score for each weld type. One identified trend for both experienced and trained novice welders was as weld difficulty increased, the quality score decreased. It is recommended that industries use virtual reality simulators to evaluate welders for ensuring high-quality welding in production practices.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0043-2296			WOS:000369035300020		
J	Jachowski, David S.; Washburn, Brian E.; Millspaugh, Joshua J.								Revisiting the Importance of Accounting for Seasonal and Diel Rhythms in Fecal Stress Hormone Studies								WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN				39	4			738	745		10.1002/wsb.592			DEC 2015	2015	Measurement of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) has been used to quantify stress responses by a wide variety of species; yet, few studies attempt to conduct baseline research prior to investigating effects of disturbances on FGM levels. We evaluated the potential confounding effect of seasonal and diel rhythms on the interpretation of FGM values, by studying long-term patterns of FGMs in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) between 2001 and 2002 in a controlled environment at facilities located at the Charles W. Green Conservation Area, near Ashland, Missouri, USA. For 1 year, we collected fresh fecal samples (<1 hr old) on a weekly basis from 17 captive deer and 8 captive doves. We also conducted hourly sampling over discrete 48-hour periods to evaluate diel rhythms. In deer, we observed that FGMs were nearly 2 times higher during spring months of April and May compared with late winter (i.e., Jan and Feb) and late summer (i.e., Jul and Aug). Dove FGMs were 50% higher during the late spring (i.e., May and Jun) compared with early spring and winter months (Jan-Apr), and twice as high as during late summer, autumn, and early winter months of August through December. In both species, we observed considerable variation in diel rhythms that was inconsistent across individuals. Collectively, our findings emphasize the need for researchers to design sampling schemes that account for high levels of individual and temporal variability in baseline FGMs- and consistently ask: What are "normal" FGM values in the context of the animal's environment and prevailing stressors.

J	Caesar, Lindsay; Adelberg, Jeffrey								USING A MULTIFACTOR APPROACH FOR IMPROVING STAGE II RESPONSES OF HELLEBORUS HYBRIDS IN MICROPROPAGATION								PROPAGATION OF ORNAMENTAL PLANTS				15	4			125	135					DEC 2015	2015	Plant quality and multiplication ratios of hellebores (Helleborus spp.) in vitro were observed with sucrose (1-3%), phosphate (1.25-6.25 mM), nitrate (39.8-69.8 mM), ammonium (5-35 mM), plant density, micronutrient dilution (from Woody Plant Medium), and thidiazuron (1-9 mu M) as treatment factors. Treatment combinations were chosen using D-optimal criteria and tested in liquid media for two hybrid hellebore genotypes (Helleborus x nigercors and Helleborus x ballardiae 'Raulston Remembered'). Analysis of variance indicated that sucrose, nitrate, and the sucrose x phosphate interaction had the largest positive effects on plant multiplication in liquid media. Multiplication was highest at maximum concentrations of phosphate and sucrose, indicating that ideal concentrations may be greater than the range tested. A 3 x 3 factorial study extending the range of sucrose and phosphate levels was conducted in gelled media. Optimal phosphate concentration for multiplication was 7.25 mM and optimal sucrose levels were 3% or less. The D-optimal response surface approach was successful for defining factors of interest to improve micropropagation of these hellebore hybtids. Plant nutrition appeared to be more important than the concentration of growth regulator present in the culture medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1311-9109			WOS:000367705900001		
J	Tang, Tilan								Bidder's Gain: Evidence from Termination Returns								INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCE				15	4			457	487		10.1111/irfi.12059			DEC 2015	2015	In most cases, bidder's stock returns around merger announcement convey more information than the synergy created from the acquisition. To overcome the interpretation problem, I study the bidder's return from the perspective of deal termination. Using a hand-collected dataset on terminated merger proposals, I investigate termination returns in deals canceled for reasons unrelated to the bidder's stand-alone valuation. I find that bidder's gain varies significantly with the type of target acquired. Further evidence suggests that the liquidity need of private target significantly contributes to the positive gain to the bidder.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1369-412X	1468-2443		WOS:000368607700001		
J	Carter, Michelle; Grover, Varun								ME, MY SELF, AND I(T): CONCEPTUALIZING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IDENTITY AND ITS IMPLICATIONS								MIS QUARTERLY				39	4			931	957					DEC 2015	2015	As social roles and relationships become increasingly inseparable from people's interactions with information technologies (ITs), new constructs representing this intertwinement are needed to expand understandings of human behavior. As part of that endeavor, this paper draws on structural symbolic interactionist identity theories to systematically develop a conceptual definition of one such construct, IT identity-defined as the extent to which an individual views use of an IT as integral to his or her sense of self-as a new form of identity. The construct is framed within a theoretical model. Our goal is to facilitate the establishment of IT identity as an important and relevant construct that can improve our understanding of a variety of phenomena. In doing so, this paper makes three contributions to the information systems (IS) literature. First, it delineates current understanding of IT as a medium, determinant, or consequent of identity. Second, it defines the conceptual domain and theme of IT identity, which is necessary for investigating the construct's theoretical influence. Third, it demonstrates the utility of IT identity to a wide range of IS topics relating to how people express, maintain, and expand their self-concepts. In doing so, it offers potential directions and opportunities for IS researchers to incorporate this novel concept into IS research.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0276-7783			WOS:000368424000010		
J	Peebles, E. D.; Jacob, R.; Branton, S. L.; Evans, J. D.; Leigh, S. A.; Gerard, P. D.								Effects of different vaccine combinations against Mycoplasma gallisepticum on the digestive and reproductive organ characteristics of commercial egg-laying hens								POULTRY SCIENCE				94	12			2898	2904		10.3382/ps/pev269			DEC 2015	2015	Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is a major and economically significant pathogen of avian species. When administered before lay, F-strain MG (FMG) can reduce egg production during lay, but the ts-11 strain of MG (ts11MG) does not exert this effect. Two trials were conducted to determine the effects of pre-lay vaccinations of ts11MG, MG-Bacterin (MGBac), or their combination, in conjunction with an FMG vaccination overlay after peak production on the digestive and reproductive organ characteristics of Hy-Line W-36 layers housed in biological isolation units (4 units per treatment, 10 birds per unit). The following vaccination treatments were administered at 10 wk of age (woa): 1) Control (no vaccinations); 2) MG-Bac; 3) ts11MG; and 4) ts11MG and MGBac combination (ts11MG+MGBac). At 45 woa, half of the birds were vaccinated with a laboratory stock of high passage FMG. In both trials, parameters determined in 4 birds per unit at 55 woa included: BW; fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome incidence; mean number of mature ovarian follicles; ovarian, oviduct, and small intestine weights; and the weights and lengths of the various portions of the oviduct and small intestine. Treatment effects were observed for the weights of the entire small intestine and the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, as percentages of BW; and for vagina weight as a percentage of total oviduct weight. In general, the weights of the small intestine and its 3 components were increased in response to the FMG vaccine that was administered at 45 woa. An FMG vaccination at 45 woa may increase relative intestine weight in layers; however, use of a prelay MGBac vaccine alone or in combination with ts11MG, with or without an FMG overlay, does not affect the gross characteristics of their digestive and reproductive organs, and may be used without having an adverse effect on their performance, as was observed in a previous companion study.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000366754100006	26467015	
J	Dunphy, Melissa A.; Weisensee, Katherine E.; Mikhailova, Elena A.; Harman, Melinda K.								Design and evaluation of a bioreactor with application to forensic burial environments								FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL				257				242	251		10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.08.014			DEC 2015	2015	Existing forensic taphonomic methods lack specificity in estimating the postmortem interval (PMI) in the period following active decomposition. New methods, such as the use of citrate concentration in bone, are currently being considered; however, determining the applicability of these methods in differing environmental contexts is challenging. This research aims to design a forensic bioreactor that can account for environmental factors known to impact decomposition, specifically temperature, moisture, physical damage from animals, burial depth, soil pH, and organic matter content. These forensically relevant environmental variables were characterized in a soil science context. The resulting metrics were soil temperature regime, soil moisture regime, slope, texture, soil horizon, cation exchange capacity, soil pH, and organic matter content. Bioreactor chambers were constructed using sterilized thin-walled polystyrene boxes housed in calibrated temperature units. Gravesoil was represented using mineral soil (Ultisols), and organic soil proxy for Histosols, horticulture mix. Gravesoil depth was determined using mineral soil horizons A and Bt2 to simulate surface scatter and shallow grave burial respectively. A total of fourteen different environmental conditions were created and controlled successfully over a 90-day experiment. These results demonstrate successful implementation and control of forensic bioreactor simulating precise environments in a single research location, rather than site-specific testing occurring in different geographic regions. Bone sections were grossly assessed for weathering characteristics, which revealed notable differences related to exposure to different temperature regimes and soil types. Over the short 90-day duration of this experiment, changes in weathering characteristics were more evident across the different temperature regimes rather than the soil types. Using this methodology, bioreactor systems can be created to replicate many different clandestine burial contexts, which will allow for the more rapid understanding of environmental effects on skeletal remains.

Typically, interface problems are characterized by discontinuities in the coefficients and/or the Dirac delta function singularities in the source term. Because of these irregularities, solutions to the differential equations are not smooth or discontinuous. In this paper, some new results on the jump conditions of the solution across the interface are derived using the distribution theory and the theory of weak solutions. Some theoretical results on the boundary singularity in which the singular delta function is at the boundary are obtained. Finally, the proof of the convergency of the immersed boundary (IB) method is presented. The IB method is shown to be first-order convergent in L-infinity norm.

J	Wang, Lin; Li, Lin; Alexov, Emil								pKa predictions for proteins, RNAs, and DNAs with the Gaussian dielectric function using DelPhi pKa								PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS				83	12			2186	2197		10.1002/prot.24935			DEC 2015	2015	We developed a Poisson-Boltzmann based approach to calculate the pK(a) values of protein ionizable residues (Glu, Asp, His, Lys and Arg), nucleotides of RNA and single stranded DNA. Two novel features were utilized: the dielectric properties of the macromolecules and water phase were modeled via the smooth Gaussian-based dielectric function in DelPhi and the corresponding electrostatic energies were calculated without defining the molecular surface. We tested the algorithm by calculating pKa values for more than 300 residues from 32 proteins from the PPD dataset and achieved an overall RMSD of 0.77. Particularly, the RMSD of 0.55 was achieved for surface residues, while the RMSD of 1.1 for buried residues. The approach was also found capable of capturing the large pKa shifts of various single point mutations in staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) from pK(a)-cooperative dataset, resulting in an overall RMSD of 1.6 for this set of pKa's. Investigations showed that predictions for most of buried mutant residues of SNase could be improved by using higher dielectric constant values. Furthermore, an option to generate different hydrogen positions also improves pK(a) predictions for buried carboxyl residues. Finally, the pK(a) calculations on two RNAs demonstrated the capability of this approach for other types of biomolecules.

J	Ding, Yihua; Wang, James Z.; Srimani, Pradip K.								Self-Stabilizing Algorithm for Minimal Dominating Set with Safe Convergence in an Arbitrary Graph								PARALLEL PROCESSING LETTERS				25	4					1550011	10.1142/S0129626415500115			DEC 2015	2015	In a graph or a network G = (V, E), a set S subset of V is a dominating set if each node in V - S is adjacent to at least one node in S. A dominating set S is called minimal when there does not exist a node i is an element of S such that the set S - {i} is a dominating set. In this paper, we propose a new self-stabilizing algorithm for minimal dominating set. It has safe convergence property under synchronous daemon in the sense that starting from an arbitrary state, it quickly converges to a dominating set (a safe state) in two rounds, and then stabilizes in a minimal dominating set (the legitimate state) in O(n) rounds without breaking safety during the convergence interval, where n is the number of nodes. Space requirement at each node is O(log n) bits.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-6264	1793-642X		WOS:000367594300006

J.; Gueron, Rodrigo; Mora, Nathalia; Owen, Dallas								REPRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT IN A PHYLETIC GIANT, THE CARIBBEAN KING CRAB DAMITHRAX SPINOSISSIMUS: EXPLORING EGG PRODUCTION COSTS IN LARGE BROODING MARINE INERTEBRATES								JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH				34	3			1049	1056		10.2983/035.034.0331			DEC 2015	2015	The Caribbean king crab Damithrax spinosissimus, a phyletic giant and the largest crab in the western Atlantic, was used to explore the costs of brooding, in terms of reproductive investment, in marine invertebrates. Given (i) the theoretical allometry between gamete production and brooding surfaces and (ii) increased physiological costs with increased brood mass, it was expected that larger broods from larger crabs should suffer higher mortality and brood loss than smaller broods from smaller crabs. It was also expected that smaller females should allocate disproportionably more resources to egg production than larger females. In D. spinosissimus, fecundity in females carrying early and late embryos varied, respectively, between 5,170 and 26,024 eggs/crab (mean +/- SD = 16,569 +/- 4,899) and between 1,966 and 26,906 eggs/crab (15,147 +/- 7,003). In disagreement with expectation, females did not experience brood loss during embryo development. Egg mortality in females carrying early and late eggs varied, respectively, between 0% and 69% (4.71 +/- 15.37) and between 2% and 100% (27.17 +/- 33.99). Also in disagreement with expectations, egg mortality did not increase disproportionably with parental female body size. Reproductive output varied between 10.45% and 43.79% (34.02% +/- 7.4) of crab body dry weight. Finally, in agreement with expectations, the slope (b = 0.54 +/- 0.17) of the line describing the relationship between brood and parental female dry weight was significantly less than unity. Overall, most of the results disagree with the notion that the allometry of gamete production and increased physiological costs with increased brood size explain the association between brooding and small body size in marine invertebrates. Comparative studies on the reproductive investment of brooding species pertaining to monophyletic clades with extensive disparity in body size are warranted to further our understanding about the evolution of brooding in marine invertebrates.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0730-8000	1943-6319		WOS:000367745300031

J	Pratt, S. L.; Andrae, J. G.								BILL E. KUNKLE INTERDISCIPLINARY BEEF SYMPOSIUM: Does tall fescue toxicosis negatively impact bull growth and breeding potential?								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				93	12			5522	5528					DEC 2015	2015	The predominant cool-season forage in the southeastern United States is the tall fescue cultivar Kentucky 31 (KY31). Kentucky 31 possesses an endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala), which produces a family of toxins called ergot alkaloids. These toxins negatively affect the physiology of animals on consumption and result in the syndrome known as fescue toxicosis. Currently, the United States annually produces approximately 11.4 billion kg of beef, of which 25% originates in the southeastern region of the United States where forage systems frequently are tall fescue based. Cattle within this forage system exhibit reduced gains and reproductive performance. The result is a reduction in the nation's beef supply with annual revenue losses recently estimated at approximately US$ 1 billion. Our hypothesis is that exposure to these ergot alkaloids in conjunction with limited availability of nutrients decreases bull semen quality and fertility. Although the literature is clear that these toxins affect BW, body temperature, blood flow, hair growth, and female reproduction in cattle, their effect on bull reproduction and the mechanisms through which the toxins act are not well defined. Six studies published from 2004 to 2015 assessed bull growth, body composition, and semen quality of young beef bulls exposed to ergot alkaloids. If semen quality or fertility is altered, the mechanisms involved may be either direct effects of ergot alkaloids through neurotransmitter receptors or indirect effects such as inhibiting the release of prolactin (PRL). The possible effects of ergot alkaloids or PRL require establishing the presence or absence of dopamine, adrenergic, serotonin, or PRL receptors in the testis, epididymis, and sperm cell of the bull. The objective of this review is to relate our findings to the few previous studies conducted that evaluated the impact of fescue toxicosis on bull reproduction and to propose possible mechanisms of action for lowered semen quality.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000366327000006	26641162

The proposed power converter is a hybrid topology realised by cascade connection of DFCM and cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converters while combining, employing, and featuring advantages of both converters. The dc voltage sources and also power switches forming CHB converters' structure in the proposed hybrid topology possess low voltage-ratings, hence imposing low additional costs and prices on DFCM converter whereas improving and enhancing output voltage power quality significantly by increasing the number of output voltage-levels and improving output voltage frequency spectrum. This progress results in reducing the bulky and costly FCs, their voltage ratings and stored energy. The FC voltages of DFCM topology in the proposed hybrid converter get stabilised naturally at their requisite voltage-levels because of the redundant charging/discharging states. First, experimental measurements of the three-cell-seven-level DFCM are provided. Afterward, simulation results and experimental observations of 15-level enhanced DFCM converter are presented to verify and validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed topology as well as its suggested control and modulation strategy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1755-4535	1755-4543		WOS:000367008000012

Self-propulsion of free solid bodies with internal rotors via localized singular vortex shedding in planar ideal fluids								EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS				224	17-18			3185	3197		10.1140/epjst/e2015-02548-x			DEC 2015	2015	Diverse mechanisms for animal locomotion in fluids rely on vortex shedding to generate propulsive forces. This is a complex phenomenon that depends essentially on fluid viscosity, but its influence can be modeled in an inviscid setting by introducing localized velocity constraints to systems comprising solid bodies interacting with ideal fluids. In the present paper, we invoke an unsteady version of the Kutta condition from inviscid airfoil theory and a more primitive stagnation condition to model vortex shedding from a geometrically contrasting pair of free planar bodies representing idealizations of swimming animals or robotic vehicles. We demonstrate with simulations that these constraints are sufficient to enable both bodies to propel themselves with very limited actuation. The solitary actuator in each case is a momentum wheel internal to the body, underscoring the symmetry-breaking role played by vortex shedding in converting periodic variations in a generic swimmer's angular momentum to forward locomotion. The velocity constraints are imposed discretely in time, resulting in the shedding of discrete vortices; we observe the roll-up of these vortices into distinctive wake structures observed in viscous models and physical experiments.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1951-6355	1951-6401		WOS:000367309500005

Mutations in pre-synaptic, synaptic and post-synaptic proteins have been demonstrated in human cases, with more than half involving aberrations in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits. CMS was first recognized in dogs in 1974 as an autosomal recessive trait in Jack Russell Terriers (JRTs). A deficiency of junctional AChRs was demonstrated. Here we characterize a CMS in 2 contemporary cases of JRT littermates with classic clinical and electromyographic findings, and immunochemical confirmation of an approximately 90% reduction in AChR protein content. Loci encoding the 5 AChR subunits were evaluated using microsatellite markers, and CHRNB1 and CHRNE were identified as candidate genes. Sequences of the splice sites and exons of both genes revealed a single base insertion in exon 7 of CHRNE that predicts a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon. We further demonstrated this pathogenic mutation in CHRNE in archival tissues from unrelated JRTs studied 34 years ago. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To test this hypothesis, we prepared porcine acellular pulmonary valves, seeded them with autologous adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) and implanted them in sheep and compared them to acellular valves.Methods: Fresh porcine pulmonary valve roots were decellularized with detergents and enzymes. ADSCs were isolated from subdermal fat and injected within the acellular cusps. Valves were then implanted in an extra-anatomic pulmonary position as RV to PA shunts: Group A (n=6) consisted of acellular valves and Group B (n=6) of autologous stem cell-seeded acellular xenografts. Sheep were followed up for 6 months by echocardiography and histologic analysis was performed on explanted valves.Results: Early evolution was favorable for both groups. All Group A animals had physiologic growth without any signs of heart failure and leaflets were found with preserved structure and mobility, lacking signs of thrombi, inflammation or calcification. Group B sheep however expressed signs of right ventricle failure starting at one month, accompanied by progressive regurgitation and right ventricle dilatation, and the leaflets were found covered with host tissue. No cells were found in any Group A or B explants.Conclusions: Acellular stabilized xenogeneic pulmonary valves are reliable, stable, non-immunogenic, non-thrombogenic and non-calcifying scaffolds with excellent hemodynamics. Seeding these scaffolds with autologous ADSCs was not conducive to tissue regeneration. Studies aimed at understanding these novel observations and further harnessing the potential of stem cells are ongoing.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1841-6624	2284-5623		WOS:000367470600005

One-Step Synthesis of Amphiphilic Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Block Copolymers by Surfactant-Free Heterogeneous Radical Polymerization								ACS MACRO LETTERS				4	12			1317	1320		10.1021/acsmacrolett.5b00745			DEC 2015	2015	Ultrahigh molecular weight (>10(6) g/mol) amphiphilic block copolymers were synthesized using one-step surfactant-free heterogeneous radical polymerization (SFHRP). The polymerization initially involves formation of water-soluble homopolymer blocks, followed by copolymerization of a hydrophobic monomer, resulting in ultrahigh molecular weight block copolymers. Facilitating heterogeneous reaction conditions and continuous supply of an initiator controls the process. Using this synthetic approach, we synthesized amphiphilic block copolymers of poly(2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(n-butyl acrylate) (pDMAEMA-b-pnBA), pDMAEMA-Nock-p(tert-butyl acrylate) (pDMAEMA-b-tBA), and pDMAEMA-block-polystyrene (pDMAEMA-b-pSt) with molecular weights of 1.98 x 10(6), 1.18 x 10(6), and 0.91 x 10(6) g/mol, respectively. These ultrahigh molecular weight block copolymers can self-assemble in nonpolar solvents to form thermochromic inverse polymeric micelles as well as other shapes and exhibit many potential applications.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2161-1653			WOS:000366869500002

Hydrothermal Formation of Calcium Copper Tetrasilicate								CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL				21	49			17560	17564		10.1002/chem.201503364			DEC 1 2015	2015	We describe the first hydrothermal synthesis of CaCuSi4O10 as micron-scale clusters of thin platelets, distinct from morphologies generated under salt-flux or solid-state conditions. The hydrothermal reaction conditions are surprisingly specific: too cold, and instead of CaCuSi4O10, a porous calcium copper silicate forms; too hot, and calcium silicate (CaSiO3) forms. The precursors also strongly impact the course of the reaction, with the most common side product being sodium copper silicate (Na2CuSi4O10). Optimized conditions for hydrothermal CaCuSi4O10 formation from calcium chloride, copper(II) nitrate, sodium silicate, and ammonium hydroxide are 350 degrees C at 3000 psi for 72 h; at longer reaction times, competitive delamination and exfoliation causes crystal fragmentation. These results illustrate that CaCuSi4O10 is an even more unique material than previously appreciated.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000367185700002	26482329

In all three the lead center is hemidirectionally coordinated and is thus sterically optimal for participation in tetrel bonding. In the crystal structures of all three compounds, the lead atoms participate in short contacts with thiocyanate sulfur or nitrogen atoms. These contacts are shorter than the sums of the van der Waals radii (3.04-3.47 angstrom for Pb center dot center dot center dot S and 3.54 angstrom for Pb center dot center dot center dot N) and interconnect the covalently bonded units (monomers, dimers, and 2D polymers) into supramolecular assemblies (chains and 3D structures). DFT calculations showed these contacts to be tetrel bonds of considerable energy (6.5-10.5 kcalmol(-1) for Pb center dot center dot center dot S and 16.5 kcalmol(-1) for Pb center dot center dot center dot N). A survey of structures in the CSD showed that similar contacts often appear in crystals of Pb-II complexes with regular geometries, which leads to the conclusion that tetrel bonding plays a significant role in the supramolecular chemistry of Pb-II.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000367185700051

Given committers' central role in development processes, we examine whether how they are organized influences FLOSS community performance. Specifically, drawing on the lens of Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT), we develop a model that explains how committal a structure's ability to manage information impacts FLOSS community performance. Based on archival data drawn from 237 active FLOSS communities, we found that the performance of centralized and decentralized FLOSS communities varied with three conditions tied to information flows: task routineness, uncertainty and task interdependence. Our empirical results support the idea that FLOSS communities performing development tasks that are generally routine, highly interdependent, and generate little contributor uncertainty will perform better under a centralized committal structure. On the other hand, decentralized committal structures thrive under the conditions of task non-routineness, low task interdependence, and high contributor uncertainty. We conclude with a discussion of results, limitations, and directions for future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Repeated measures general linear models tested if changes in risk factors corresponded with sexual aggression trajectory membership.Results: Changes in the risk factors corresponded with SA trajectories. Men who came to college with a history of SA but decreased their perpetration likelihood during college showed concurrent decreases in sexual compulsivity, impulsivity, hostile attitudes toward women, rape supportive beliefs, perceptions of peer approval of forced sex, and perceptions of peer pressure to have sex with many different women, and smaller increases in pornography use over their college years. Conversely, men who increased levels of SA over time demonstrated larger increases in risk factors in comparison to other trajectory groups.Conclusions: The odds that males engaged in sexual aggression corresponded with changes in key risk factors. Risk factors were not static and interventions designed to alter them may lead to changes in sexual aggression risk. (C) 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Inactivation was assessed in batch conditions using both laser and lens-concentrated sunlight excitation conditions. Under 840-mW argon laser excitation, the UC efficiency was estimated to be 1 order of magnitude greater than previously reported under lamp excitation and UVC emitted by the reactors resulted in 3.6-log inactivation in 20 min. However, experiments using similar to 1500 mW of concentrated natural sunlight showed no additional inactivation that could be attributed to UC within the timescale studied. Due to the fundamental and practical limitations of solar focusing, the optical concentration ratio employed herein prevented the excitation beam from achieving the power densities required to attain UC efficiencies comparable to the laser experiments. We also observed that the high intensity of both the laser and sunlight induced rapid photoreactivation by the bacteria, which detracted from net disinfection performance. The results suggest that current UC materials perform inadequately for environmental application; nonetheless, valuable qualitative and quantitative insight was gained that more explicitly defines materials development goals and considerations for application of UC to environmental technology.

In the present study, we report that isolates resistant to the SDHI fungicide boscalid, regardless of genotype, were also resistant to pyraclostrobin and thiophanate-methyl. Resistance to pyraclostrobin was due to the G143A mutation in cytochrome b and resistance to thiophanate-methyl was due to 167Y in beta-tubulin. Representatives of the two most commonly isolated SDHI resistance genotypes, H277Y in sdh subunit B and H134R in sdh subunit C, as well as genotype D123E in sdh subunit D, were selected for fitness evaluations. Genotypes H277Y and H134R suffered no fitness penalties based on mycelial growth on potato dextrose agar, spore production in vitro, osmotic sensitivity, oxidative sensitivity, germination ability, or the ability to cause disease on peach fruit. Hypersensitivity to oxidative stress and weak sporulation was observed only in genotype D123E. No competitive advantage was detected for sensitive isolates over the course of five consecutive transfers on peach fruit when spores were mixed with genotypes H277Y or H134R. Results suggest that, in the absence of fungicide pressure, A. alternata isolates resistant to methyl benzimidazole carbamate, quinone outside inhibitor, and SDHI fungicides carrying the H277Y mutation in SDHB and the H134R mutation in SDHC may effectively compete with the boscalid-sensitive populations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000366782800011

Three distinct colony morphologies (phenotypes) were observed on potato dextrose agar and two isolates per phenotype were selected for further analysis. Colony color, colony shape, conidia size, number of germ tubes per conidia, and pathogenicity on plum were investigated. The ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 as well as a polymerase chain reaction-based method that amplified fragments of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) and beta-tubulin (TUB2) genes were used to identify the isolates to the species level. The three phenotypes were identified to be three different species: Monilinia fructicola, Monilia mumecola, and Monilia yunnanensis. Phylogenetic analysis based on G3PDH and TUB2 nucleotide sequences revealed that isolates within species clustered together regardless of host or geographical origin, suggesting that these factors did not play an important role for the evolutionary separation of the described species.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000366782800015

The polymers filled the space between the particles thereby providing stabilization of the assemblies against particle aggregation when dried or chemically modified. The polymers did not coat the top surface of the nanoparticles offering the chemical accessibility to the metal surface. This was confirmed by converting the stabilized nanoparticles into silver sulfide and gold clusters. Etching the nanoparticles resulted in crater-like polymeric structures with the cavities extending down to the underlying substrate. Electrochemical reduction of silver inside the craters was performed. The approach can be extended to other nanoparticle assemblies and polymers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The complexity of HCD-mediated interruption dynamics needs to be studied using a Socio-technical Systems (STS) approach in order to holistically understand the problem and their effects.Methods: We conducted field observations in the acute care setting. A total of 12 nurses across two units were selected as participants in this study. Each participant was shadowed for 2.5 h totaling 30 h of observations. We iteratively coded the data into overarching themes using content analysis.Results: We determined three overarching themes: (1) assessment prior to interrupting, (2) interruption content delivery, and (3) response to interruptions. Based the coding structure and the observation events in each theme, we identified facilitators and barriers for nursing work related to the HCD-mediated interruption dynamics. The facilitators included "intact workflow continuity", "reduced time pressure", and "increased flexibility to respond to interruptions". The barriers included "interrupter-oriented nature", "interruptee's overprotection of workflow", "delay of information delivery", and "inaccuracy of information communicated".Conclusion: The findings of this study reflect the unique role of HCD in affecting interruption dynamics and nursing work. Based on the findings, we proposed system design recommendations, organizational-level interventions, and policy suggestions. (C) 2015 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We measure this trust by using rankings compiled by the Great Place to Work Institute (GPWI) from 1998 to 2011. Although the volume of M&A activity is not significantly different for firms with strong cultures of trust ("SCT firms") versus other firms, the relative size of acquisitions announced by SCT firms is significantly smaller than the size of acquisitions announced by other firms. Furthermore, when SCT firms announce relatively large acquisitions, bidder returns and the percent change in the combined values of bidders and targets are lower than the corresponding returns for other firms. Finally, when SCT firms make large acquisitions, they are significantly more likely to suffer a loss in their GPWI ranking as compared with other SCT firms. Overall, the results are consistent with the conclusion that the M&A policies of firms are influenced by a culture of trust between employees and management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Multiple realizations of each of the considered geostatistical models and their corresponding tomograms (based on inversion of noise-contaminated simulated data) are used as a multivariate training image. The training image is scanned with a direct sampling algorithm to obtain conditional realizations of hydraulic conductivity that are not only in agreement with the geostatistical model, but also honor the spatially varying resolution of the site-specific tomogram. Model comparison is based on the quality of the simulated geophysical data from the ensemble of conditional realizations. The tomogram in this study is obtained by inversion of cross-hole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) first-arrival travel time data acquired at the MAcro-Dispersion Experiment (MADE) site in Mississippi (USA). Various heterogeneity descriptions ranging from multi-Gaussian fields to fields with complex multiple-point statistics inferred from outcrops are considered. Under the assumption that the relationship between porosity and hydraulic conductivity inferred from local measurements is valid, we find that conditioned multi-Gaussian realizations and derivatives thereof can explain the crosshole geophysical data. A training image based on an aquifer analog from Germany was found to be in better agreement with the geophysical data than the one based on the local outcrop, which appears to under-represent high hydraulic conductivity zones. These findings are only based on the information content in a single resolution-limited tomogram and extending the analysis to tracer or higher resolution surface GPR data might lead to different conclusions (e.g., that discrete facies boundaries are necessary). Our framework makes it possible to identify inadequate geostatistical models and petrophysical relationships, effectively narrowing the space of possible heterogeneity representations.

Two different stoichiometric formulations are considered, namely those of ARE(2)F(7) and ARE(3)F(10) (A = K, Rb, Cs; RE = Y, La-Lu), over a wide range of ionic radii of both the alkali and rare earth (RE) ions. Previously reported and several new single-crystal structures are considered. The new single crystals are grown using hydrothermal methods and the structures are compared with literature reports of structures grown from both melts and hydrothermal fluids. The data reported here are combined with the literature data to gain a greater understanding of structural subtleties surrounding these systems. The work underscores the importance of the size of the cations to the observed structure type and also introduces synthetic technique as a contributor to the same. New insights based on single-crystal structure analysis in the work introduce a new disordered structure type in the case of ARE(2)F(7), and examine the trends and boundaries of the ARE(3)F(10) stoichiometry. Such fundamental structural information is useful in understanding the potential applications of these compounds as optical materials.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2052-5206			WOS:000366321100021	26634734

Our study aimed to determine gaps in prevention and control practices for HuNoV in LTCFs in South Carolina (SC).Methods: Two researchers visited a convenience sample of 26 LTCFs in SC during July-November 2013. Directors were interviewed to determine facility prevention and control practices. Relative frequencies and means were calculated using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).Results: Most directors had little knowledge of proper sanitizing and disinfecting products and reported missing written procedures for cleaning staff-visitor bathrooms. Only 18 had recommendations for when residents should wash hands. Many used the wrong products for pathogen removal after vomit-fecal events, had no written procedures for cleaning contaminated soft surfaces, did not remove other individuals during clean-up of vomit-fecal episodes, and did not clean a large area surrounding vomit-fecal episodes. Eighteen did not assign specific staff to care for sick; 16 did not designate specific toilets for sick; and 15 did not restrict visitors during an outbreak.Conclusion: Directors' responses indicated gaps in prevention and control practices for HuNoV in LTCFs in SC.

We resolve the inner disk cavity in polarized light, recover the thermal IR-bright arm, and identify one additional spiral arm. We easily recover HD 100546 b and show that much of its emission plausibly originates from an unresolved point source. The point-source component of HD 100546 b has extremely red IR colors compared to field brown dwarfs, qualitatively similar to young cloudy super-Jovian planets; however, these colors may instead indicate that HD 100546 b is still accreting material from a circumplanetary disk. Additionally, we identify a second point-source-like peak at r(proj) similar to 14 AU, located just interior to or at the inner disk wall consistent with being a < 10-20 M-J candidate second protoplanet-"HD 100546 c"-and lying within a weakly polarized region of the disk but along an extension of the thermal IR-bright spiral arm. Alternatively, it is equally plausible that this feature is a weakly polarized but locally bright region of the inner disk wall. Astrometric monitoring of this feature over the next 2 years and emission line measurements could confirm its status as a protoplanet, rotating disk hot spot that is possibly a signpost of a protoplanet, or a stationary emission source from within the disk.									7	0	0	0	0	7			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000366112000010

In this study, in vitro evidence is presented that continuous exposure of Monilinia fructicola mycelium to some fungicides can induce genetic change in form of transposon transposition. Three fungicide-sensitive M. fructicola isolates were exposed in 12 weekly transfers of mycelia to a dose gradient of demethylation inhibitor fungicide (DMI) SYP-Z048 and quinone outside inhibitor fungicide (QoI) azoxystrobin in solo or mixture treatments. Evidence of mutagenesis was assessed by monitoring Mftc1, a multicopy transposable element of M. fructicola, by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Movement of Mftc1 was observed following azoxystrobin and azoxystrobin plus SYP-Z048 treatments in two of the three isolates, but not in the non-fungicide-treated controls. Interestingly, the upstream promoter region of MfCYP51 was a prime target for Mftc1 transposition in these isolates. Transposition of Mftc1 was verified by Southern blot in two of three isolates from another, similar experiment following prolonged, sublethal azoxystrobin exposure, although in these isolates movement of Mftc1 in the upstream MfCYP51 promoter region was not observed. More research is warranted to determine whether fungicide-induced mutagenesis may also happen under field conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Among marine organisms, the larval stage is often the most physiologically sensitive; larvae are also often the main dispersal stage in the life history. However, studies that address the acclimatization of marine larvae are rare. We investigated whether larvae of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes elegans from two temperate populations, one from the Northern Hemisphere (Mexico) and one from the Southern Hemisphere (Peru), show patterns of seasonal acclimatization to temperature. We compared the effects of temperature on swimming activity, oxygen consumption, and mortality of larvae from the two populations in both warm and cold seasons. Larvae from Mexico had higher thermal tolerances when collected in the boreal summer compared to the boreal winter, while no similar indication of seasonal acclimatization was seen in larvae from Peru. The lack of acclimatization in larvae of P. elegans from Peru may be related to recent thermal history, low selection for acclimatization due to irregular patterns of seasonal temperature change during ENSO events, or to different phylogeographic histories of Northern-and Southern-hemisphere populations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1077-8306	1744-7410		WOS:000366403000004

Participants were 3888 infants with an invasive S aureus infection who were discharged from calendar year 1997 through calendar year 2012.EXPOSURE Invasive S aureus infection.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The incidence of invasive S aureus infections, as well as infant characteristics and mortality after MRSA or MSSA infection.RESULTS The 3888 infants had 3978 invasive S aureus infections (2868 MSSA and 1110 MRSA). The incidence of invasive S aureus infection was 44.8 infections per 10 000 infants. The yearly proportion of invasive infections caused by MRSA increased from calendar year 1997 through calendar year 2006 and has moderately decreased since then. Infants with invasive MRSA or MSSA infections had similar gestational ages and birth weights. Invasive MRSA infections occurred more often at a younger postnatal age. For infants with available mortality data, more infants with invasive MSSA infections (n = 237) died before hospital discharge than infants with invasive MRSA infections (n = 110). The proportions of infants who died after invasive MSSA and MRSA infections were similar at 237 of 2474 (9.6%) and 110 of 926 (11.9%), respectively (P = .05). The adjusted risk of death before hospital discharge was similar after invasive MSSA and MRSA infections (risk ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.96-1.49). The risks of death at 7 and 30 days after invasive infection were similar between infants with invasive MSSA infection and infants with invasive MRSA infection.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Infant mortality after invasive MRSA and MSSA infections is similar, but MSSA causes more infections and more deaths in infants than MRSA. Measures to prevent S aureus infection should include MSSA in addition to MRSA.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2168-6203	2168-6211		WOS:000366334600013	26502073

Abbey, Antonia/C-8303-2016				Trajectory Analysis of the Campus Serial Rapist Assumption								JAMA PEDIATRICS				169	12			1148	1154		10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.0707			DEC 2015	2015	IMPORTANCE Rape on college campuses has been addressed recently by a presidential proclamation, federal legislation, advocacy groups, and popular media. Many initiatives assume that most college men who perpetrate rape are serial rapists. The scientific foundation for this perspective is surprisingly limited.OBJECTIVE To determine whether a group of serial rapists exists by identifying cohesive groups of young men, indicated by their trajectories of rape likelihood across high school and college.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Latent class growth analysis of the 2 largest longitudinal data sets of adolescent sexual violence on college campuses using 2 distinct groups of male college students. The first group was used for derivation modeling (n = 847; data collected from August 1990 through April 1995) and the second for validation modeling (n = 795; data collected from March 2008 through May 2011). Final data analyses were conducted from February 16, 2015, through February 20, 2015.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rape perpetration assessed using the Sexual Experiences Survey.RESULTS Across samples, 178 of 1642 participants (10.8%) reported having perpetrated at least 1 rape from 14 years of age through the end of college. A 3-trajectory model best fit both the derivation and validation data sets. Trajectories reflected low or time-limited (92.6% of participants), decreasing (5.3%), and increasing (2.1%) rape patterns. No consistently high trajectory was found. Most men who perpetrated a rape before college were classified in the decreasing trajectory. During college, the increasing trajectory included 14 men (15.2%) who reported having perpetrated a rape, the decreasing trajectory included 30 men (32.6%), and the low or time-limited included 48 men (52.2%). No participant in the low or time-limited trajectory reported perpetrating a rape during more than 1 period. Most men (67 [72.8%]) who committed college rape only perpetrated rape during 1 academic year.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although a small group of men perpetrated rape across multiple college years, they constituted a significant minority of those who committed college rape and did not compose the group at highest risk of perpetrating rape when entering college. Exclusive emphasis on serial predation to guide risk identification, judicial response, and rape-prevention programs is misguided. To deter college rape, prevention should be initiated before, and continue during, college. Child and adolescent health care professionals are well positioned to intervene during the early teenage years by informing parents about the early onset of nonconsensual sexual behavior.									8	0	0	2	0	8			2168-6203	2168-6211		WOS:000366334600019	26168230

Postnatal Cytomegalovirus Infection and the Risk for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia								JAMA PEDIATRICS				169	12					e153785	10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.3785			DEC 2015	2015	IMPORTANCE Postnatally acquired cytomegalovirus (CMV) is typically benign in term infants but in very low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants can cause pneumonitis and sepsislike illness. Whether postnatal CMV infection results in long-term pulmonary sequelae in these infants is unknown.OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between postnatal CMV infection and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality in a large multicenter cohort of VLBW infants.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Conducted between October 2014 and June 2015, this propensity-matched retrospective cohort study involved 101 111 hospitalized VLBW (<1500 g) infants at 348 neonatal intensive care units in the United States from 1997 to 2012. We matched infants with postnatal CMV infection 1: 1 to comparison infants using propensity scores, and we used Poisson regression to examine the effect of postnatal CMV on the combined risk for death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. To describe features of postnatal CMV infection, we extracted clinical and laboratory data from 7 days before until 7 days after infants met criteria for postnatal CMV.EXPOSURES Postnatal CMV infection was defined as a diagnosis of CMV or detection of CMV from blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, or respiratory secretions on or after day of life 21. Infants with a CMV diagnosis or virologic detection of CMV prior to day of life 21 were not considered to have postnatal infection.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age.RESULTS Of 101 111 infants, 328 (0.3%) had postnatal CMV infection. We matched a comparison infant to 303 CMV-infected infants (92%) for a final cohort of 606 infants. The median gestational age and birth weight of this cohort were 25 weeks and 730 g, respectively. Postnatal CMV infection was associated with an increased risk for death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (risk ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.32) and BPD (risk ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.19-1.50). Changes in cardiorespiratory status associated with postnatal CMV infection included a new requirement for vasopressor medications (9%; n = 29), intubation for mechanical ventilation (15%; n = 49), a new oxygen requirement (28%; n = 91), and death (1.2%; n = 4).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In VLBW infants, postnatal CMV infection was associated with increased risk for BPD. Further studies are needed to determine the role of preventive measures against CMV in this population.									2	1	0	2	0	3			2168-6203	2168-6211		WOS:000366334600002	26642118

The Effect of High-Pressure Devitrification and Densification on Ballistic-Penetration Resistance of Fused Silica								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				24	12			4890	4907		10.1007/s11665-015-1775-8			DEC 2015	2015	Recent experimental and molecular-level computational analyses have indicated that fused silica, when subjected to pressures of several tens of GPa, can experience irreversible devitrification and densification. Such changes in the fused-silica molecular-level structure are associated with absorption and/or dissipation of the strain energy acquired by fused silica during high-pressure compression. This finding may have important practical consequences in applications for fused silica such as windshields and windows of military vehicles, portholes in ships, ground vehicles, spacecraft, etc. In the present work, our prior molecular-level computational results pertaining to the response of fused silica to high pressures (and shear stresses) are used to enrich a continuum-type constitutive model (that is, the so-called Johnson-Holmquist-2, JH2, model) for this material. Since the aforementioned devitrification and permanent densification processes modify the response of fused silica to the pressure as well as to the deviatoric part of the stress, changes had to be made in both the JH2 equation of state and the strength model. To assess the potential improvements in respect to the ballistic-penetration resistance of this material brought about by the fused-silica devitrification and permanent densification processes, a series of transient non-linear dynamics finite-element analyses of the transverse impact of a fused-silica test plate with a solid right-circular cylindrical steel projectile were conducted. The results obtained revealed that, provided the projectile incident velocity and, hence, the attendant pressure, is sufficiently high, fused silica can undergo impact-induced devitrification, which improves its ballistic-penetration resistance.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000366107300033

In addition, partial and total sleep deprivation had a greater negative effect on positive events than negative events.Conclusion: These results suggest that sleep-deprived persons are more likely to respond less to positive events than negative events. One explanation for the current findings is that negative events could elicit more attentive behavior and thus stable responding under sleep deprivation conditions. As such, sleep deprivation could impact reactivity to emotional stimuli through automated attentional and self-regulatory processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J	Cheung, Janelle H.; Sinclair, Robert R.; Shi, Junqi; Wang, Mo								Do Job Demands of Chinese Manufacturing Employees Predict Positive or Negative Outcomes? A Test of Competing Hypotheses								STRESS AND HEALTH				31	5			432	442		10.1002/smi.2568			DEC 2015	2015	Karasek's job demands-control (JDC) model posits that job control can buffer against the harmful effects of demands experienced by employees. A large volume of JDC research has obtained support for the main effects of demands and control, but not the interactive effects. Recent research on the challenge-hindrance stressors framework, however, found that work stressors may not always be deleterious, suggesting alternative hypotheses about the effects of demands and control. The present study therefore examined competing hypotheses concerning the effects of job demands on occupational health outcomes. Using a sample of 316 employees in a Chinese manufacturing company, we found that, consistent with the challenge-hindrance framework, production demands were challenge stressors associated with favourable outcomes (i.e. job satisfaction and psychological well-being). In addition, results showed that the interactive role of job control depended on the nature of outcome variables. Future recommendations and implications of findings are discussed.

The authors summarize the risks to the environment from D5 based on multiple lines of evidence and conclude that it presents negligible risk. Laboratory and field studies show that D5 is not toxic to aquatic organisms or benthic invertebrates up to its solubility limit in water or porewater or its sorptive capacity in sediment. Comparison of lipid-normalized internal concentrations with measured concentrations in benthos indicates that field-collected organisms do not achieve toxic levels of D5 in their tissues, suggesting negligible risk. Exposure to D5 resulted in a slight reduction of root biomass in barley at test concentrations 2 orders of magnitude greater than measured D5 levels in biosolids-amended soils and more than twice as high as the maximum calculated sorptive capacity of the soil. No effects were observed in soil invertebrates exposed to similar concentrations, indicating that D5 poses a de minimis risk to the terrestrial environment. High rates of metabolism and elimination of D5 compared with uptake rates from food results in biodilution in the food web rather than biomagnification, culminating in de minimis risk to higher trophic level organisms via the food chain. A fugacity approach substantiates all conclusions that were made on a concentration basis. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:2715-2722.

Mental Health of Cross-Cultural Healthcare Missionaries								JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY AND THEOLOGY				43	4			283	293					WIN 2015	2015	In this study of career healthcare missionaries (N = 393), 47.9% of female missionaries and 42.1% of male missionaries reported experiencing anxiety, while 32.5% of female missionaries and 27.5% of male missionaries reported experiencing depression. For both females and males, depression severity scores showed a bimodal distribution of more and less severe depression, suggesting a clearer delineation for mild and severe depression. Regression analyses found that low role satisfaction was associated with both anxiety (p = .006) and depression severity (p = .004). A model is proposed describing the relationship between role satisfaction and its correlates: job expectations prior to arriving on the field, receptivity of the host country, gender, and imbalance of work and ministry. This model also describes the bidirectional relationship between role satisfaction and the existence of depression and/or anxiety.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0091-6471			WOS:000365827400006

Thus, we developed a contextualized, extended model of knowledge sharing intentions based on the theory of planned behavior, and tested it using large samples of employees from the US, and from Ukraine, where anecdotal evidence suggests pandemic knowledge hoarding. Tests of the model in each country produced significant results for all of the path coefficients in the US, and for all but two paths in Ukraine. Comparative analysis for hypothesis testing indicated that, overall, individuals' dispositions and attitudes were more relevant for understanding knowledge sharing intentions in the individualistic context of the US, while collective, relational elements were stronger in Ukraine, but with notable exceptions, particularly the influence of societal knowledge control norms. The results provide important implications for theory concerning knowledge sharing across contexts, including institutional theory assumptions, and for efficaciously managing knowledge processes, including cross-national knowledge transfers.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0938-8249	1861-8901		WOS:000365879100001

Such constructs could be built by tissue engineering, with perspective of the unique structure and biology of the aortic root. The aortic valve root is composed of several different tissues, and careful structural and functional consideration has to be given to each segment and component. Previous work has shown that immersion techniques are inadequate for whole-root decellularization, with the aortic wall segment being particularly resistant to decellularization. The aim of this study was to develop a differential pressure gradient perfusion system capable of being rigorous enough to decellularize the aortic root wall while gentle enough to preserve the integrity of the cusps. Fresh porcine aortic roots have been subjected to various regimens of perfusion decellularization using detergents and enzymes and results compared to immersion decellularized roots. Success criteria for evaluation of each root segment (cusp, muscle, sinus, wall) for decellularization completeness, tissue integrity, and valve functionality were defined using complementary methods of cell analysis (histology with nuclear and matrix stains and DNA analysis), biomechanics (biaxial and bending tests), and physiologic heart valve bioreactor testing (with advanced image analysis of open-close cycles and geometric orifice area measurement). Fully acellular porcine roots treated with the optimized method exhibited preserved macroscopic structures and microscopic matrix components, which translated into conserved anisotropic mechanical properties, including bending and excellent valve functionality when tested in aortic flow and pressure conditions. This study highlighted the importance of (1) adapting decellularization methods to specific target tissues, (2) combining several methods of cell analysis compared to relying solely on histology, (3) developing relevant valve-specific mechanical tests, and (4) in vitro testing of valve functionality.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1937-3384	1937-3392		WOS:000365530000009	26467108	
J	Roach, Nicolette S.; Barrett, Kyle								Managed Habitats Increase Occupancy of Black Rails (Laterallus jamaicensis) and May Buffer Impacts from Sea Level Rise								WETLANDS				35	6			1065	1076		10.1007/s13157-015-0695-6			DEC 2015	2015	Global wetland degradation and loss are occurring at a rapid rate, and in the United States over 50 % of wetlands in the lower 48 states have been altered since European settlement. In some cases, wetlands that were historically transformed for agriculture are now managed as wetland habitat. We conducted occupancy surveys for black rails (Laterallus jamaicensis) in managed and unmanaged areas of coastal South Carolina. We modeled landscape and local variables potentially influencing black rail occupancy and we assessed whether these habitat associations indicated vulnerability following expected alterations from sea level rise. Black rails occupied 17 of 344 surveyed sites. Landscape factors had the strongest influence on black rail occupancy. Occupancy was associated with impounded marshes, decreasing distance to forest, and greater proportion of marsh landscape within a 200 m buffer. We mapped parameters from our top model to predict the amount of current and future suitable habitat under various sea level rise scenarios at Bear Island Wildlife Management Area, a black rail hotspot. Suitable habitat decreases in tidal marshes but increases in impounded areas. The current use of impoundments by black rails could represent a new management strategy for mitigating the loss of black rail habitat.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0277-5212	1943-6246		WOS:000365749900005

The basic idea of this approach is simple: the layer boundaries can be identified as the points at which a change occurs in the I-c profile. It is shown that these change points can be easily identified using the wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) method. This method is able to accurately pinpoint the locations of change points in the I-c profile and to produce graphs and plots that fit well with engineers' methods of visualization and intuition. Moreover, by virtue of the fast Fourier transform, the computation is very fast. Case studies show that the WTMM method is effective for the detection of change points in the I-c profile. It is also capable of detecting thin soil layers.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0008-3674	1208-6010		WOS:000365340400008

The Effects of Driver Distraction for Individuals With Traumatic Brain Injuries								HUMAN FACTORS				57	8			1472	1488		10.1177/0018720815594057			DEC 2015	2015	Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of secondary tasks on the driving performance of individuals with mild traumatic brain injuries (TBIs).Background: Studies suggest detrimental impacts of driving with TBI or while distracted but the impact of driver distraction on TBI drivers is not well documented.Method: Bayesian regression models were used to estimate the effect of relatively simple secondary tasks on driving performance of TBI and healthy control (HC) drivers. A driving simulator was used to develop prior distribution of task effects on driving performance for HCs. An on-road study was conducted with TBI and HC drivers to generate effect estimates for the posterior distributions. The Bayesian models were also compared to frequentist models.Results: During a coin-sorting task, all drivers exhibited larger maximum lateral acceleration and larger standard deviation of speed than in a baseline driving segment. There were no significant driving performance differences between the TBI and the HC drivers during the tasks. Across all tasks, TBI drivers spent more time looking at the tasks and made more frequent glances toward the tasks.Conclusions: The findings show that even drivers with mild TBI have significantly longer and more glances toward the tasks compared to the HCs.Application: This study demonstrates a Bayesian approach and how the results differ from frequentist statistics. Using prior distributions in a Bayesian model helps account for the probabilities associated with otherwise unknown parameters. This method strengthens the Bayesian parameter estimates compared to that of a frequentist model.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-7208	1547-8181		WOS:000365042600017	26186925

In this study, a high performance liquid chromatography procedure with improved separation was developed to determine carotenoids extracted from P. rhodozyma. Mixture design experiment was employed to optimize the organic solvent constitution, which showed that the optimal organic phase was composed (v/v) of 61% of methanol, 32% of tetrahydrofuran, and 7% of acetonitrile. Furthermore, the gradient elution procedure optimization demonstrated that the gradient elution started at the optimal organic phase concentration of 60% lead to the best separation effect. Meanwhile, 18 compounds in total 25 detected peaks were separated. Based on their absorption spectra, astaxanthin, -carotene, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin and lycopene were identified by matching their retention times with standards. Interestingly, our improved HPLC method was effective to classify P. rhodozyma strains and monitor the degradation of astaxanthin in accordance with their carotenoids composition.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1061-9348	1608-3199		WOS:000365316200014		
J	Udaipurwala, A.; Poursaee, A.; Schiff, S. D.								Corrosion Activity in Precast Concrete Elements and Cementitious Closure Pours								JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING				20	12					04015013	10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000757			DEC 2015	2015	The use of precast concrete elements in the construction of highway bridges has been a common practice in the United States since the 1950s. These bridges have generally performed well during the initial years after construction, but recent failures in Pennsylvania and Indiana have aroused a nationwide alarm to investigate the causes of failure and find solutions to repair these bridges or develop designs for new replacement bridges. It was found that the stressed and nonstressed embedded reinforcements were severely corroded owing to the ingress of chloride ions in the bridge deck through the surface cracks occurring within the closure pours (shear key) and at the interface of the joints between the precast elements and the closure pours. This paper addresses the corrosion activity of embedded steel bars within the closure pours. The experimental investigation consisted of two types of samples: uncracked and cracked slabs, containing regular precast concrete with different closure pours, namely, Quikrete with polyvinyl acetate (PVA) fibers, Ductal with PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) fibers, and Ductal with steel fibers. These specimens were exposed to 3% NaCl solution for the duration of 2 weeks in alternate cycles of wet and dry periods to accelerate the corrosion process. Electrochemical measurements along with the visual inspection revealed active corrosion at the interface of two materials, closure pour and precast concrete, regardless of the materials used in closure pours.

Crystal Chemistry of Cerium Oxyfluorides: ACe(3)OF(11) and A(2)Ce(3)OF(12) (A = K, Rb, Cs, NH4)								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY				45	10-12			445	452		10.1007/s10870-015-0613-z			DEC 2015	2015	The study of Ce4+ as a building block using CeF4 as a reagent in hydrothermal synthesis has resulted in several new cerium oxyfluorides that have been structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Two families of compounds are represented: ACe(3)OF(11) (A = K, Rb, NH4), and A(2)Ce(3)OF(12) (A = Cs). The ACe(3)OF(11) compounds represent a new structure type crystallizing in space group P-6m2 with a = 7.9794(11) and c = 8.2513(17) for KCe3OF11, a = 8.0351(11) and c = 8.3077(17) for RbCe3OF11, and a = 8.0457(11) and c = 8.2918(17) for (NH4)Ce3OF11. The structure of Cs2Ce3OF12 conforms to the same structure type as several other A(2)M(3)OF(12) (A = K, Rb, Tl; M = Hf, Zr) compounds in space group R-3m, and has unit cell parameters of a = 8.2663(12) and c = 31.851(6) . The two structures form different cerium oxyfluoride frameworks to accommodate the monovalent cations in different ways. Formation of the different oxyfluoride phases is thus sensitive to the size ratio of the monovalent and tetravalent cations. Synthesis of the ACe(3)OF(11) phases has enabled a comparative analysis of the crystal chemistry across these two families of compounds, and several trends and limitations of the two structure types are identified.The hydrothermal synthesis of oxyfluorides having compositions ACe(3)OF(11) (A = K, Rb, NH4) and A(2)Ce(3)OF(12) (A = Cs) is described. Structural comparisons are made between the two structure types, and crystal chemical relationships pertaining to their preferential formation are identified based on a broader examination of their constituent monovalent and tetravalent cations. The ACe(3)OF(11) structure type is a new structure type enabled by the size of the Ce4+ cation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1074-1542	1572-8854		WOS:000365444500003

Summers, Joshua/B-7362-2009	Summers, Joshua/0000-0002-6129-2663			Comparative Study of Optimization Techniques in Sizing Mesostructures for Use in NonPneumatic Tires								JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING				15	4					041009	10.1115/1.4031828			DEC 2015	2015	This paper presents a comparative study on the size optimization of four mesostructures to meet the design requirements for a nonpneumatic tire's (NPT) shear beam with 10% shear flexure (SF) at 10 MPa effective shear modulus. The need for such comparison is motivated from the previous research wherein a systematic design method is proposed to design a mesostructure with high SF by studying the strain energy distribution pattern in honeycomb, auxetic, and sinusoidal auxetic mesostructure. Based upon the distribution pattern, a new type of mesostructure termed S-type is invented. Although it exhibited higher SF than the other mesostructures for a comparable set of geometry, it is not possible to validate the design method without exploring the complete design space of both existing and newly invented mesostructures. In order to address this limitation, these four mesostructures are optimized using the following optimization algorithms: (i) particle swarm; (ii) genetic algorithm (GA); and (iii) FAST-SIMPLEX (using response surface method). The results show the S-type mesostructure can be configured to meet the design requirements, thereby validating the design method presented in previous research. Additionally, it is also observed that auxetic mesostructure is only 5% less than the required design target, which presents an opportunity in future, to develop an alternate design method to maximize SF other than the one that is being validated in this paper.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1530-9827	1944-7078		WOS:000365270500009

J	Hosseini, Narges; Taaffe, Kevin M.								Allocating operating room block time using historical caseload variability								HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				18	4			419	430		10.1007/s10729-014-9269-z			DEC 2015	2015	Operating room (OR) allocation and planning is one of the most important strategic decisions that OR managers face. The number of ORs that a hospital opens depends on the number of blocks that are allocated to the surgical groups, services, or individual surgeons, combined with the amount of open posting time (i.e., first come, first serve posting) that the hospital wants to provide. By allocating too few ORs, a hospital may turn away surgery demand whereas opening too many ORs could prove to be a costly decision. The traditional method of determining block frequency and size considers the average historical surgery demand for each group. However, given that there are penalties to the system for having too much or too little OR time allocated to a group, demand variability should play a role in determining the real OR requirement. In this paper we present an algorithm that allocates block time based on this demand variability, specifically accounting for both over-utilized time (time used beyond the block) and under-utilized time (time unused within the block). This algorithm provides a solution to the situation in which total caseload demand can be accommodated by the total OR resource set, in other words not in a capacity-constrained situation. We have found this scenario to be common among several regional healthcare providers with large OR suites and excess capacity. This algorithm could be used to adjust existing blocks or to assign new blocks to surgeons that did not previously have a block. We also have studied the effect of turnover time on the number of ORs that needs to be allocated. Numerical experiments based on real data from a large health-care provider indicate the opportunity to achieve over 2,900 hours of OR time savings through improved block allocations.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1386-9620	1572-9389		WOS:000365175800002	24590259

The impact of a magnesium zirconate thermal barrier coating on homogeneous charge compression ignition operational variability and the formation of combustion chamber deposits								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINE RESEARCH				16	8			968	981		10.1177/1468087414561274			DEC 2015	2015	The accumulation and burn-off of combustion chamber deposits create uncontrolled shifting of the homogeneous charge compression ignition operability range. This combustion chamber deposit-created operational variability places increased control burden on a multi-mode engine. However, the operational variability can be mitigated by manipulating combustion chamber deposit accumulation. A magnesium zirconate thermal barrier coating was applied to the piston of a homogeneous charge compression ignition engine in an effort to reduce combustion chamber deposit accumulation through elevated piston surface temperatures. While reduced combustion chamber deposit thicknesses were observed on the magnesium zirconate piston periphery, combustion chamber deposit accumulation in the bowl region increased relative to aluminum piston operation. Additionally, combustion chamber deposit thicknesses on the aluminum cylinder head were reduced during operation with the magnesium zirconate coated piston. Chamber-wide alterations to combustion chamber deposit accumulation taken together with the increased burn duration and hydrocarbon emissions measured during operation with the magnesium zirconate piston indicate significant interaction between the directly injected fuel spray and thermal barrier coating porosity. The porosity and surface roughness of the magnesium zirconate thermal barrier coating are speculated to create fuel pooling/absorption within the piston bowl, increasing combustion chamber deposit accumulation in the bowl and leaning the remaining fuel-air charge. The charge leaning lengthens the magnesium zirconate burn duration and reduces cylinder head combustion chamber deposit accumulation. Furthermore, hydrocarbon emissions were increased during magnesium zirconate operation due to late desorption and subsequent incomplete burning of fuel from piston bowl and the presence of incombustibly lean areas in the remaining cylinder charge.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1468-0874	2041-3149		WOS:000364814100004

Relationships of Positive and Negative Events With Nurses' Burnout and Engagement								RESEARCH IN NURSING & HEALTH				38	6			475	491		10.1002/nur.21696			DEC 2015	2015	Many investigators have reported the stressful aspects of nursing; fewer have focused on nurses' positive work experiences. For this study, we developed a 2x2 typology of positive and negative events related to the tasks of nursing work and the social and organizational context of that work: successes, supports, constraints, and conflicts. We hypothesized that positive events would predict engagement, negative events would predict burnout, and negative events would be more strongly related to both burnout and engagement. In secondary analyses of data from 310 acute care nurses who completed survey measures of workplace events at one time point and burnout and engagement measures approximately eight months later, regression results indicated that both positive and negative work events contributed to engagement, whereas only negative events were related to burnout. The results of dominance analyses established that constraints and conflicts more strongly predicted burnout than did supports and successes. Additionally, consistent with a bad is stronger than good perspective, the strongest predictor of engagement was lower constraints, although successes, supports, and conflicts also predicted engagement.

Subsequently, MTSs have grown in popularity in group and team research, spanning a breath of disciplines (psychology, organizational behavior, human factors, communication, and medicine). In this review, our goal is to highlight the existing research across a range of disciplines regarding MTSs that serves to answer the question, What do we know about MTSs? while also developing a future research agenda aimed at answering the question, Where does our research need to go to better understand MTSs? We specifically highlight the current trends, dynamics, and methodological issues in MTSs to further build the foundation for improving MTS effectiveness.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1046-4964	1552-8278		WOS:000364917000004

Biased Allele Expression and Aggression in Hybrid Honeybees may be Influenced by Inappropriate Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Signaling								FRONTIERS IN GENETICS				6						343	10.3389/fgene.2075.00343			DEC 1 2015	2015	Hybrid effects are often exhibited asymmetrically between reciprocal families. One way this could happen is if silencing of one parent's allele occurs in one lineage but not the other, which could affect the phenotypes of the hybrids asymmetrically by silencing that allele in only one of the hybrid families. We have previously tested for allele specific expression biases in hybrids of European and Africanized honeybees and we found that there was an asymmetric overabundance of genes showing a maternal bias in the family with a European mother. Here, we further analyze allelic bias in these hybrids to ascertain whether they may underlie previously described asymmetries in metabolism and aggression in similar hybrid families and we speculate on what mechanisms may produce this biased allele usage. We find that there are over 500 genes that have some form of biased allele usage and over 200 of these are biased toward the maternal allele but only in the family with European maternity, mirroring the pattern observed for aggression and metabolic rate. This asymmetrically biased set is enriched for genes in loci associated with aggressive behavior and also for mitochondrial-localizing proteins. It contains many genes that play important roles in metabolic regulation. Moreover we find genes relating to the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which is involved in chromatin modifications and epigenetic regulation and may help explain the mechanism underlying this asymmetric allele use. Based on these findings and previous work investigating aggression and metabolism in bees, we propose a novel hypothesis; that the asymmetric pattern of biased allele usage in these hybrids is a result of inappropriate use of piRNA-mediated nuclear-cytoplasmic signaling that is normally used to modulate aggression in honeybees. This is the first report of widespread asymmetric effects on allelic expression in hybrids and may represent a novel mechanism for gene regulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-8021			WOS:000366925900001	26648977

In response, we rely on often-competing planting strategies and details. Rarely, however, do we analyze the relative outcomes of our choices of soils systems, pavement details, and management practices. In response, two landscape architects, an arborist, and a soils scientist joined forces to undertake a comparative study - through fieldwork and laboratory testing - of plantings that have endured the stresses of an urban environment in Boston for between 5 and 45 years. Our findings are preliminary and suggest that additional data gathering and analysis is necessary, but they do begin to shed light below the surface of the city, indicating that soils under pavement are indeed highly dynamic systems that are influenced by their context and they mature and change over time.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-5405	2095-5413		WOS:000388173300006

The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the concentrations of LMWC in lentils grown in six locations, and (2) identify any genetic and environmental effects on those LMWC concentrations. We analyzed 335 samples from 10 locations throughout 6 countries using high-performance liquid chromatography for sugar alcohols and various mono-, di-, and oligo-saccharides, including raffinose-family oligosaccharides (RFO) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Mean LMWC concentrations from each country varied widely: sorbitol, 1250-1824 mg/100 g; mannitol, 57-132 mg/100 g; galactinol, 46-89 mg/100 g; sucrose, 1750-2355 mg/100 g; raffinose + stachyose, 3314-4802 mg/100 g; verbascose, 1907-2453 mg/100 g; nystose, 8-450 mg/100 g; and kestose, from not detected to 244 mg/100 g. The concentrations of many of these LMWC varied with average temperature and precipitation of the region/country of origin. Significant genotype and genotype x location effects contributed to the variability in the concentrations of several LMWC, a feature that could prove useful in breeding lentils for novel agro-ecological environments and for consumer preference. The range of LMWC in lentil may contribute to its survival as a crop and its organoleptic and nutritional properties as a whole food. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The formulation uses a Dirichlet condition for the normal component of vorticity and Neumann type conditions for the tangential components. In a Galerkin (integral) formulation the tangential condition is natural, i.e., it is enforced by a right-hand side functional and does not impose a boundary constraint on trial and test spaces. The functional involves the pressure variable, and we discuss several velocity-vorticity formulations where the proposed condition is appropriate. Several numerical experiments are given that illustrate the validity of the new approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0045-7825	1879-2138		WOS:000364061800002

Coastal Vertebrate Exposure to Predicted Habitat Changes Due to Sea Level Rise								ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				56	6			1528	1537		10.1007/s00267-015-0580-3			DEC 2015	2015	Sea level rise (SLR) may degrade habitat for coastal vertebrates in the Southeastern United States, but it is unclear which groups or species will be most exposed to habitat changes. We assessed 28 coastal Georgia vertebrate species for their exposure to potential habitat changes due to SLR using output from the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model and information on the species' fundamental niches. We assessed forecasted habitat change up to the year 2100 using three structural habitat metrics: total area, patch size, and habitat permanence. Almost all of the species (n = 24) experienced negative habitat changes due to SLR as measured by at least one of the metrics. Salt marsh and ocean beach habitats experienced the most change (out of 16 categorical land cover types) across the three metrics and species that used salt marsh extensively (rails and marsh sparrows) were ranked highest for exposure to habitat changes. Species that nested on ocean beaches (Diamondback Terrapins, shorebirds, and terns) were also ranked highly, but their use of other foraging habitats reduced their overall exposure. Future studies on potential effects of SLR on vertebrates in southeastern coastal ecosystems should focus on the relative importance of different habitat types to these species' foraging and nesting requirements. Our straightforward prioritization approach is applicable to other coastal systems and can provide insight to managers on which species to focus resources, what components of their habitats need to be protected, and which locations in the study area will provide habitat refuges in the face of SLR.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0364-152X	1432-1009		WOS:000363961900017	26163199

BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BZY) proton-conducting oxide possesses the highest level of proton conductivity reported to date, but poor sinterability hinders its widespread utilization. In this paper, we report a two-step reactive aid sintering (TRAS) method involving the introduction of BaCO3 and B2O3-Li2O for the preparation of dense BZY ceramics sintered at 1500A degrees C. The resulting BZY samples showed a pure perovskite structure with a dramatic increase in the relative density to 91.5%. In addition, the shrinkage during sintering was improved to 19.3% by a TRAS method as compared to 2.6% by the conventional solid date reaction method. The bulk conductivity was improved due to enhanced densification, while the grain boundary conductivity decreased due to the blocking behavior of the sintering aid resulting in a decrease in the total conductivity of the samples.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000363978700032

In this study, resins obtained from controlled reaction of maleic anhydride or phthalic anhydride (PtAH) with glycerol were used in the thermal processing of modified MBM (mod-MBM) bioplastics. Such resins have good chemical interaction with proteisns and have a capacity to cross-link, which results in less mobility and out-diffusion of plasticizers from the bioplastic. The synthesized resins possessed a viscosity of about 1 Pa s at 100 A degrees C, with an onset decomposition temperature of similar to 140 A degrees C. The bioplastics were prepared by intensively mixing the resin with 60 wt% MBM in a batch compounder at 100 A degrees C prior to thermal compaction into sheets and subsequent vacuum thermoforming. As compared with MBM plasticized with glycerol (gMBM), mod-MBM bioplastics had a nominal tensile strength of 3.7 MPa and a tensile modulus of 580 MPa that were, respectively, 4 times and 10 times greater; their strain to failure of similar to 1.2 % was 7 times lower. Mod-MBM bioplastics also had significantly improved water resistance such that those modified with PtAH (MBM-PtAH bioplastics) retained structural integrity after being soaked in water for more than 24 h whereas the gMBM bioplastics disintegrated in an hour. Therefore, current results clearly establish that sustainable bioplastics can be developed from biomass with enhanced properties using cost-effective conventional polymer processing routes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1566-2543	1572-8900		WOS:000363984000010

J	Weathers, Danny; Swain, Scott D.; Makienko, Igor								When and how should retailers rationalize the size and duration of price discounts?								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH				68	12			2610	2618		10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.04.010			DEC 2015	2015	Context: Price discounts are common retail promotional tools that are defined by their size and duration. Consumers possess a general schema in which they believe that retailers are motivated to associate larger price discounts with shorter durations and smaller price discounts with longer durations. However, factors influencing promotion management frequently lead retailers to present discount size/duration combinations that are incongruent with this schema. What are the consequences for retailers of presenting consumers with such discounts, and what can retailers do to overcome detrimental effects of incongruent discount terms?Objective: This research examines how incongruent pairings of discount size and duration affect consumer evaluations of the offer (i.e., perceptions of retailer credibility, product quality, retailer opportunism, and purchase intentions). Further, can retailers impact consumer evaluations by presenting rationales for incongruent discounts? If so, how should these rationales be constructed?Method: A preliminary study (n = 480) validates the critical assumption that, across a variety of products, consumers expect discount size and duration to be inversely related. Two experiments (n = 190, n = 226) assess the effects of discount size, discount duration, and rationales on consumer offer evaluations.Results: The experiments reveal that schema-incongruent (versus schema-congruent) price discounts diminish consumers' purchase intentions even when the incongruence reflects an ostensibly superior offer. Consistent with a theory-of-mind account of how consumers interpret retailers' behaviors, perceptions of retailer credibility and product quality mediate these effects. Addressing questions of whether and how retailers should provide rationales for incongruent discounts, analyses show that the same rationale can attenuate or exacerbate consumers' negative responses depending on how the rationale influences perceptions of discount congruency.Conclusion: Failing to consider the interactive effects of discount size and duration may lead retailers to design ineffective promotions. Further, while rationales can help overcome detrimental effects of incongruent discount size/duration pairings, improperly constructed rationales exacerbate these negative effects.

We assume that job processing times are subject to uncertainty. Accordingly, we construct three alternative uncertainty sets, each of which defines job processing times that can simultaneously occur. The robust optimization framework assumes that, given a job schedule, a worst-case set of processing times will be realized from among those allowed by the uncertainty set under consideration. For each combination of objective function and uncertainty set, we first analyze the problem of identifying a set of worst-case processing times with respect to a fixed schedule, and then investigate the problem of selecting a schedule whose worst-case objective is minimal.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1094-6136	1099-1425		WOS:000362911200003

Over 5000 social media posts from Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and mainstream news outlets were analyzed. Social media analysis outlined the scope of online communication during the first week following the incidents, revealed social media frequency, increases in conversation, misinformation, and differences between parent and student posts. Results revealed spikes in social media chatter following the release of the identities of shooters and victims. Consistent with media dependency theory and the high levels of uncertainty characteristic of the incident, users' social media posts contained more information than affect displays during the active shooter event. Implications for scholars and P-12 administrators are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0747-5632	1873-7692		WOS:000361921100024		
J	Tang, Ke; Venayagamoorthy, Ganesh K.								Damping inter-area oscillations using virtual generator based power system stabilizer								ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				129				126	141		10.1016/j.epsr.2015.08.004			DEC 2015	2015	In a power system, remote measurements are used by a controller to provide damping torque for inter-area oscillations. In this study, the operating conditions that give rise to inter-area oscillations are investigated using Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) based modal analysis. In a power system, generators can be grouped based on coherency and the groups can be represented by Virtual Generators (VGs). Damping inter-area oscillations using Virtual Generator based Power System Stabilizer (VG-PSS) that generates a supplementary control signal to the excitation system of one or more synchronous generators is presented. The generator choice for VG-PSS location is determined based on the generator that has maximum controllability on dominant weakly damped inter-area mode(s) in a power system. Modal analysis using SSI and real-time simulation results on the IEEE 68-bus power system are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of VG-PSSs in damping inter-area oscillations. In addition, the effect of time delays encountered as a result of wide area measurements and communications are considered in the studies presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wu, Bo; Shen, Haiying								Analyzing and predicting news popularity on Twitter								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT				35	6			702	711		10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2015.07.003			DEC 2015	2015	Twitter is not only a social network, but also an increasingly important news media. In Twitter, retweeting is the most important information propagation mechanism, and supernodes (news medias) that have many followers are the most important information sources. Therefore, it is important to understand the news retweet propagation from supernodes and predict news popularity quickly at the very first few seconds upon publishing. Such understanding and prediction will benefit many applications such as social media management, advertisement and interaction optimization between news medias and followers. In this paper, we identify the characteristics of news propagation from supernodes from the trace data we crawled from Twitter. Based on the characteristics, we build a news popularity prediction model that can predict the final number of retweets of a news tweet very quickly. Through trace-driven experiments, we then validate our prediction model by comparing our predicted popularity and real popularity, and show its superior performance in comparison with the regression prediction model. From the study, we found that the average interaction frequency between the retweeters and the news source is correlated with news popularity. Also, the negative sentiment of news has some correlations with retweet popularity while the positive sentiment of news does not have such obvious correlation.

The colloidal stability of the magnetic nanoparticles in a biological environment is crucial for efficient delivery. A surface that can be easily modifiable can also improve the delivery and imaging properties of the magnetic nanoparticle by adding targeting and imaging moieties, providing a platform for additional modification. The strategy presented in this work includes multiple nitroDOPA anchors for robust binding to the surface tied to the same polymer backbone as multiple poly(ethylene oxide) chains for steric stability. This approach provides biocompatibility and enhanced stability in fetal bovine serum (FBS) and phosphate buffer saline (PBS). As a proof of concept, these polymer-particles complexes were then modified with a near infrared dye and utilized in characterizing the integration of magnetic nanoparticles in biofilms. The work presented in this manuscript describes the synthesis and characterization of a nontoxic platform for the labeling of near IR-dyes for bioimaging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J	Sadigh, Arash Khoshkbar; Dargahi, Vahid; Corzine, Keith A.								New Multilevel Converter Based on Cascade Connection of Double Flying Capacitor Multicell Converters and Its Improved Modulation Technique								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS				30	12			6568	6580		10.1109/TPEL.2014.2387066			DEC 2015	2015	This paper proposes a new multilevel converter based on the cascade connection of double flying capacitor multicell (DFCM) converters, as multilevel modules, to decrease the voltage diversity of the flying capacitors. Furthermore, a new switching pattern based on the phase-shifted pulse-width modulation technique is proposed to reduce the voltage ripple across the flying capacitors. Moreover, the proposed modulation technique reduces the rms value of the current flowing through flying capacitors. This results in an increase in the life time of flying capacitors and a decrease in the capacitance of the flying capacitors, to keep the same amount of the ripple, meaning a reduction in the physical size of the converter. In addition, this paper presents an analytical approach to calculate the average and rms currents of the insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs)/diodes in the DFCM converter in a closed-form expression. The derived closed-form equations to calculate the average and rms currents of the IGBTs/diodes are utilized to investigate the conduction power losses in a DFCM converter and the proposed multilevel converter. Numerical results of the derived closed-form equations match the simulation results well, which validates the derived equations. Furthermore, simulation results and experimental measurements of the proposed multilevel power converter, configured by cascading two two-cell five-level DFCM converters, are presented to validate the performance of the proposed converter as well as the suggested modulation technique.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0885-8993	1941-0107		WOS:000360654500016

The model involves a large-eddy simulation closure that uses a novel deconvolution approach based on the introduction of two distinct filtering length scales. We establish connections between the MDM and two other models, and, on the basis of one of these connections, we establish an improved regularity estimate for MDM solutions. We also prove that the MDM preserves Taylor-eddy solutions of the Navier- Stokes equations and therefore does not distort this particular vortex structure. Simulations of the MDM are performed to examine the accuracy of the MDM and the effect of the filtering length scales on energy spectra for three-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic flows. Numerical evidence for all tests clearly indicates that the MDM gives very accurate coarse-mesh solutions and that this multiscale approach to deconvolution is effective.

J	Kholodenko, Arkady								Black magic session of concordance: Regge mass spectrum from Casson's invariant								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A				30	33					1550189	10.1142/S0217751X15501894			NOV 30 2015	2015	Recently, there had been a great deal of interest in obtaining and describing all kinds of knots in links in hydrodynamics, electrodynamics, non-Abelian gauge field theories and gravity. Although knots and links are observables of the Chern-Simons (CS) functional, the dynamical conditions for their generation lie outside the scope of the CS theory. The nontriviality of dynamical generation of knotted structures is caused by the fact that the complements of all knots/links, say, in S3 are 3-manifolds which have positive, negative or zero curvature. The ability to curve the ambient space is thus far attributed to masses. The mass theorem of general relativity requires the ambient 3-manifolds to be of nonnegative curvature. Recently, we established that, in the absence of boundaries, complements of dynamically generated knots/links are represented by 3-manifolds of nonnegative curvature. This fact opens the possibility to discuss masses in terms of dynamically generated knotted/linked structures. The key tool is the notion of knot/link concordance. The concept of concordance is a specialization of the concept of cobordism to knots and links. The logic of implementation of the concordance concept to physical masses results in new interpretation of Casson's surgery formula in terms of the Regge trajectories. The latest thoroughly examined Chew-Frautschi (CF) plots associated with these trajectories demonstrate that the hadron mass spectrum for both mesons and baryons is nicely described by the data on the corresponding CF plots. The physics behind Casson's surgery formula is similar but not identical to that described purely phenomenologically by Keith Moffatt in 1990. The developed topological treatment is fully consistent with available rigorous mathematical and experimentally observed results related to physics of hadrons.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0217-751X	1793-656X		WOS:000365678600002		
J	Wang, Dewei; McMahan, Christopher S.; Gallagher, Colin M.								A general regression framework for group testing data, which incorporates pool dilution effects								STATISTICS IN MEDICINE				34	27			3606	3621		10.1002/sim.6578			NOV 30 2015	2015	Group testing, through the use of pooling, has been widely implemented as a more efficient means to screen individuals for infectious diseases. Typically, in these settings, practitioners are tasked with the complimentary goals of both case identification and estimation. For these purposes, many group testing strategies have been proposed, which address issues such as preserving anonymity in estimation studies, quality control, and classification. In general, these strategies require that a significant number of the individuals be retested, either in pools or individually. In order to provide practitioners with a general methodology that can be used to accurately and precisely analyze data of this form, herein, we propose a binary regression framework that can incorporate data arising from any group testing strategy. Further, we relax previously made assumptions regarding testing error rates by relating the diagnostic testing results to the latent biological marker levels of the individuals being tested. We investigate the finite sample performance of our proposed methodology through simulation and by applying our techniques to hepatitis B data collected as part of a study involving Irish prisoners.

Recently, we demonstrated that a cell-penetrating endosome-disruptive peptide we synthesized, termed 599, enhanced the intracellular delivery and bioavailability of siRNAs designed to target the CIP2A oncoprotein (siCIP2A) into oral cancer cells and consequently inhibited oral cancer cell invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth in vitro. Thus, to further assess the therapeutic potential of the 599 peptide in mediating RNAi-based therapeutics for oral cancer and its prospective applicability in clinical settings, the objective of the current study was to determine whether intratumoral dosing of the 599 peptide-siCIP2A complex could induce silencing of CIP2A and consequently impair tumor growth using a xenograft oral cancer mousemodel. Our results demonstrate that the 599 peptide is able to protect siRNAs from degradation by serum and ribonucleases in vitro and upon intratumoral injection in vivo, confirming the stability of the 599 peptide-siRNA complex and its potential for therapeutic utility. Moreover, 599 peptide-mediated delivery of siCIP2A to tumor tissue induces CIP2A silencing without any associated toxicity, consequently resulting in reduction of themitotic index and significant inhibition of tumor growth. Together, these data suggest that the 599 peptide carrier is a clinically effective mediator of RNAi-based cancer therapeutics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

This paper reports observations of short-term variability in global observations of nonmigrating tides predicted to arise from the interaction of the migrating diurnal tide (DW1) with a quasi-stationary planetary wave number one (PW1). PW1 and tidal definitions are extracted from satellite temperatures and high-altitude meteorological analyses. During winter months, the evolution of westward traveling diurnal tides with zonal wave number 2 (DW2) generally tracks that of strong-amplitude stratospheric PW1. DW1 and PW1 spectra are used to compute nonlinear tidal forcing terms arising from advection. We then examine the response of a primitive equation model to the observation-based nonlinear forcing. The model experiments indicate that meridional advection of PW1 zonal momentum by DW1 is a significant source of lower thermospheric DW2. Modeled DW2 amplitudes are very consistent with observed DW2 amplitudes when stratospheric PW1 penetrates to equatorial latitudes. The model experiments also indicate that the interaction can imprint short-term variability associated with wintertime PW1 upon DW2 in the summer hemisphere and the lower thermosphere.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000367825200003

Characterizing the response of galloping energy harvesters using actual wind statistics								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				357				365	376		10.1016/j.jsv.2015.05.003			NOV 24 2015	2015	In this paper, we incorporate actual wind statistics into the response of galloping energy harvesters and shed light onto the influence of the wind probability distribution on the average power as compared to the deterministic scenario. Specifically, we obtain an expression for the average output power of the harvester as a function of the wind statistical averages, which are, in turn, obtained by fitting wind data using a Weibull Probability Density Function (PDF). The resulting expression is then used to demonstrate that knowledge of the actual PDF is essential for correct power predictions as well as for accurate electric load optimization. We discuss the influence of the wind direction on the average output power and show that the direction of the prevailing wind is not necessarily the ideal direction to maximize the average power.

These pairs can Compton-scatter the cosmic microwave background, creating a gamma-ray signature at slightly lower energies that is observable by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). This signal is strongly dependent on the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) strength (B) and its coherence length (L-B). We use IACT spectra taken from the literature for 5 VHE-detected BL Lac objects and combine them with LAT spectra for these sources to constrain these IGMF parameters. Low B values can be ruled out by the constraint that the cascade flux cannot exceed that observed by the LAT. High values of B can be ruled out from the constraint that the EBL-deabsorbed IACT spectrum cannot be greater than the LAT spectrum extrapolated into the VHE band, unless the cascade spectrum contributes a sizable fraction of the LAT flux. We rule out low B values (B less than or similar to 10(-19) G for L-B >= 1 Mpc) at >5 sigma in all trials with different EBL models and data selection, except when using >1 GeV spectra and the lowest EBL models. We were not able to constrain high values of B.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000365310200020

We demonstrate herein a continuous-flow shape-based separation of spherical and peanut-shaped rigid particles of equal volume (or equivalent spherical diameter) via elasto-inertial pinched flow fractionation (eiPFF). This microfluidic technique exploits the shape dependence of the flow-induced elasto-inertial lift (and hence the cross-stream migration) in viscoelastic fluids to increase the displacement of a sheath flow-focused particle mixture, for a high-purity separation. The parametric effects on this shape-based particle separation via eiPFF are systematically investigated in terms of five dimensionless numbers. It is found that the separation is strongly affected by the flow rate, fluid elasticity, and channel aspect ratio. Interestingly, the elasto-inertial deflection of the peanut particles can be either greater or smaller than that of equally volumed spherical particles. This phenomenon is speculated to correlate with the rotational effects of peanut particles.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000365151000050	26505113

Graphene synthesized by chemical vapor deposition and transferred on PLD deposited and annealed BN exhibited up to three times higher field effect mobility compared to graphene on the SiO2 substrate. Graphene field effect transistor devices fabricated on 5 nm BN/SiO2 (300 nm) yielded maximum hole and electron mobility of 4980 and 4200 cm(2) /V s, respectively. In addition, significant improvement in carrier homogeneity and reduction in extrinsic doping in graphene on BN has been observed. An average Dirac point of 3.5V and residual carrier concentration of 7.65 x 10(11) cm(-2) was observed for graphene transferred on 5 nm BN at ambient condition. The overall performance improvement on PLD BN can be attributed to dielectric screening of charged impurities, similar crystal structure and phonon modes, and reduced substrate induced doping.

However, how to increase the percentage of RAP in the surface layer mixtures of asphalt pavement and meet or exceed the standards is challenging to the state highway agencies in the USA. The objective of this study is to explore the rheological properties of the high percentage (up to 50%) of RAP binder with three base binders in terms of five RAP binder content, two RAP binder sources, one HMA and one warm mix additive (WMA) technologies at three aging states. The viscosity, failure temperature, rutting resistance, fatigue resistance of various asphalt binders were tested in this study. The results indicated that the combined binders after a short term aging and a long term aging procedures still satisfied the requirement of asphalt binder set by Superpave binder specifications. In addition, increasing the RAP binder concentration could improve the rutting resistance of asphalt binder but a reduction in the fatigue resistance was noticed. However, the WMA additive could offset these properties of combined binder. Moreover, the results indicated that the RAP source typically affected the performance properties of combined asphalt binder and should be investigated individually. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY				213				64	76		10.1016/j.agrformet.2015.06.015			NOV 15 2015	2015	Gap size is critically important to ecological processes that drive forest dynamics within the gap, yet its threshold has never been explicitly defined. Consequently, gap sizes reported in the literature ranged from 4 m(2) to 2 ha, which makes comparisons among and synthesis of the published gap studies difficult. We suggested that the lower size limit be defined by the mean shadow length (SL) of canopy trees surrounding the gap (CTSG) at local 12:00 during growing season (GS), while the upper size limit be defined by considering the farthest impact of CTSG on growth of shade intolerant tree species, which was determined by the mean of SL at the initial and the final times when 30-min photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) is more than the light saturation point for shade intolerant tree species each day during GS.The lower and upper limits of expanded gaps (the canopy gap plus the area extending to the bases of the canopy trees surrounding the gap) represented by gap diameter: CTSG height (R-D/H) were 0.49 and 3.49, respectively, for temperate forest areas. The lower limit of gap size is determined only by the location and the height of CTSG, which should be applicable worldwide. We also tried to provide a universal method for determining the upper limit of gap size without applying the observed PAR data, and using only sunshine duration, an easily obtained variable from meteorological stations worldwide. We suggest that expanded gaps may be classified as: small gap, 0.49 < R-D/H <= 1.0, medium gap, 1.0 < R-D/H <= 2.0; large gap, 2.0 < R-D/H <3.5 in temperate forests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Reduction in deep sternal wound infection with use of a peristernal cable-tie closure system: a retrospective case series								JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY				10						166	10.1186/s13019-015-0378-7			NOV 14 2015	2015	Background: Deep sternal wound infections are a rare but serious complication after median sternotomy. We evaluated the incidence of deep sternal wound infection associated with two techniques for sternal closure.Methods: In this retrospective case series, we recorded the method of sternal closure in consecutive patients undergoing a variety of cardiothoracic surgical procedures. Sternal closure in the historical control group was performed using trans-sternal, stainless-steel wire sutures; subsequent patients were closed using wire sutures in conjunction with a novel, peristernal cable-tie closure system to reinforce the corpus sterni. Perioperative care was standardized between groups. Demographics, risk factors, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed.Results: Between July 2010 and July 2014, 609 consecutive adult patients underwent sternal closure following open median sternotomy at a single hospital in Mobile, Alabama. Sternal closure was accomplished with wire sutures in the first 309 patients and with cable-tie reinforcement in the subsequent 300 patients. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups, except that the cable-tie group exhibited greater preoperative comorbidity. Mean body mass index was comparable between groups (30.2 +/- 6.6 kg/m(2) wire suture versus 30.5 +/- 7.7 cable-tie, p = 0.568). Deep sternal wound infection occurred in 2.6 % (8/309) patients in the wire-suture group, whereas no deep sternal wound infections were observed in the cable tie group (p = 0.008).Conclusions: The peristernal cable-tie system was a simple and reliable method for sternal closure after open median sternotomy, and was associated with a reduced risk of deep sternal wound infection, even in an obese and comorbid population.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1749-8090			WOS:000364804600002	26577944	
J	Hong, Gongbing; Martin, James; Westall, James M.								On fairness and application performance of active queue management in broadband cable networks								COMPUTER NETWORKS				91				390	406		10.1016/j.comnet.2015.08.018			NOV 14 2015	2015	We evaluate the performance of modern delay-based active queue management (AQM) algorithms in downstream DOCSIS 3.0 cable environments. Our simulation-based study involves scenarios that include tiered service levels and application workloads that include FTP, HTTP-based adaptive streaming (HAS), VoIP, and web traffic.Our results show that AQM maintains target queuing delays and consequently provides strong isolation between responsive high bandwidth and low bandwidth latency sensitive flows. We also show that lowering target queuing delays exacerbates TCP's RU unfairness. Nevertheless, in the scenarios that we studied, observed application performance was not significantly impacted by the specific AQM in use.With the potential large deployment of AQM imminent for DOCSIS 3.0, the analysis presented in this paper provides timely feedback to the community concerning how delay-based AQM can manage bandwidth allocation fairness and application performance in realistic downstream DOCSIS 3.0 cable network systems.

Since film residual stress has been known to alter system reliability, stress development within new film structures with high interfacial densities should be characterized to identify potential long-term performance barriers. To understand factors contributing to thermal stress evolution within nanoscale metallic multilayers, stress in Cu/Nb systems adhered to Si substrates was calculated from curvature measurements collected during cycling between 25 degrees C and 400 degrees C. Additionally, stress within each type of component layers was calculated from shifts in the primary peak position from in-situ heated X-ray diffraction. The effects of both film architecture (layer thickness) and layer order in metallic multilayers were tracked and compared with monolithic Cu and Nb films (1 mu m total thickness). Analysis indicated that the thermoelastic slope of nanoscale metallic multilayer films (with 20 nm and 100 nm individual layer thicknesses) depends on thermal expansion mismatch, elastic modulus of the components, and also interfacial density. The layer thickness (i.e. interfacial density) affected thermoelastic slope magnitude (-1.23 +/- 0.09 MPa/degrees C for 20 nm Cu/Nb vs. -0.89 +/- 0.03 MPa/degrees C for 100 nm Cu/Nb) while layer order had minimal impact on stress responses after the initial thermal cycle (-0.82 +/- 0.07 MPa/degrees C for 100 nm Cu/Nb). When comparing stress responses of monolithic Cu and Nb films to those of the Cu/Nb systems, the nanoscale metallic multilayers show a similar increase in stress above 200 degrees C to the Nb monolithic films, indicating that Nb components play a larger role in stress development than Cu. Phase specific stress calculations (Cu vs. Nb) from X-ray diffraction peak shifts in 20 nm Cu/Nb collected during heating reveal that the component layers within a rnultilayer film respond similarly to their monolithic counterparts.

The median of the intrinsic index distribution is 2.20 (versus 2.54 for the observed distribution). We also analyze the observed spectral breaks (i.e., the difference between the VHE and high energy, HE, 100 MeV <= E <= 300 GeV, spectral indices). The Fermi-LAT. has now provided a large sample of sources detected both at VHE and HE with comparable exposure that allows us to test models of extragalactic gamma-ray photon propagation. We find that our data are compatible with simulations that include intrinsic blazar curvature and EBL attenuation. There is also no evidence of evolution with redshift of the physics that drives the photon emission in high-frequency synchrotron peak (HSP) blazars. This makes HSP blazars excellent probes of the EBL.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000365035000012

Using the Fermi Large Area Telescope we have discovered an apparent quasi-periodicity in the gamma-ray flux (E > 100 MeV) from the GeV/TeV BL Lac object PG 1553+113. The marginal significance of the 2.18 +/- 0.08 year period gamma-ray cycle is strengthened by correlated oscillations observed in radio and optical fluxes, through data collected in the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, Tuorla, Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope, and Catalina Sky Survey monitoring programs and Swift-UVOT. The optical cycle appearing in similar to 10 years of data has a similar period, while the 15 GHz oscillation is less regular than seen in the other bands. Further long-term multiwavelength monitoring of this blazar may discriminate among the possible explanations for this quasi-periodicity.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000365035000019

The results indicated that liposomes modified by targeting antibodies exhibited an increase in apparent binding affinity, a result attributed to the avidity effect. More specifically, the targeting effect improved as the surface density of the targeting antibody increased, an increase primarily attributed to the decrease of the dissociation rate. However, this trend stopped when the surface density reached a threshold of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) antibody/mm(2). This surface density was found to be quite consistent regardless of the liposome size and the type of targeting antibody. In addition, a traditional cell binding experiment was conducted to confirm the saturation point obtained from SPR.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0743-7463			WOS:000364615100027	26484937

Prevention of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Progression by Targeted Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activity With Batimastat-Loaded Nanoparticles								CIRCULATION RESEARCH				117	11			E80	E89		10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307207			NOV 6 2015	2015	Rationale: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-mediated extracellular matrix destruction is the major cause of development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Systemic treatments of MMP inhibitors have shown effectiveness in animal models, but it did not translate to clinical success either because of low doses used or systemic side effects of MMP inhibitors. We propose a targeted nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery of MMP inhibitor at low doses to the abdominal aortic aneurysms site. Such therapy will be an attractive option for preventing expansion of aneurysms in patients without systemic side effects.Objective: Our previous study showed that poly(d,l-lactide) NPs conjugated with an antielastin antibody could be targeted to the site of an aneurysm in a rat model of abdominal aortic aneurysms. In the study reported here, we tested whether such targeted NPs could deliver the MMP inhibitor batimastat (BB-94) to the site of an aneurysm and prevent aneurysmal growth.Methods and Results: Poly(d,l-lactide) NPs were loaded with BB-94 and conjugated with an elastin antibody. Intravenous injections of elastin antibody-conjugated BB-94-loaded NPs targeted the site of aneurysms and delivered BB-94 in a calcium chloride injury-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms in rats. Such targeted delivery inhibited MMP activity, elastin degradation, calcification, and aneurysmal development in the aorta (269% expansion in control versus 40% elastin antibody-conjugated BB-94-loaded NPs) at a low dose of BB-94. The systemic administration of BB-94 alone at the same dose was ineffective in producing MMP inhibition.Conclusions: Targeted delivery of MMP inhibitors using NPs may be an attractive strategy to inhibit aneurysmal progression.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0009-7330	1524-4571		WOS:000364317200001	26443597

Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Surfactants and Denaturants to Elute and Denature Adsorbed Protein on Different Surface Chemistries								LANGMUIR				31	43			11814	11824		10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b02741			NOV 3 2015	2015	The elution and/or denaturation of proteins from material surfaces by chemical excipients such as surfactants and denaturants is important for numerous applications including medical implant reprocessing, bioanalyses, and biodefense. The objective of this study was to develop and apply methods to quantitatively assess how surface chemistry and adsorption conditions influence the effectiveness of three commonly used surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulfate, n-octyl-beta-D-glucoside, and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and two denaturants (guanidium hydrochloride and urea) to elute protein (hen egg white lysozyme and bovine pancreatic ribonudease A) from three different surface chemistries (silica glass, poly(methyl methacrylate), and high-density polyethylene). The structure and bioactivity of residual protein on the surface following elution were characterized using circular dichroism spectropolarimetry and enzyme assays to assess the extent of protein denaturation. Our results indicate that the denaturants were generally more effective than the surfactants in removing the adsorbed proteins from each type of surface. Also, the denaturing capacity of these excipients on the residual proteins on the surfaces was distinctly different from their influence on the proteins in solution and was unique for each of the adsorption conditions. Taken altogether, these results reveal that the effectiveness of surfactants and denaturants to elute and denature adsorbed protein is significantly influenced by surface chemistry and the conditions from which the protein was adsorbed. These results provide a basis for the selection, design, and further development of chemical agents for protein elution and surface decontamination.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0743-7463			WOS:000364354800009	26449787

The DNS is filtered over a range of filter widths to provide exact terms in the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) governing equations, including unclosed terms. The filtered pressure and the filtered heat flux vector are extensively compared with the pressure and the heat flux vector calculated as a function of the filtered primitive variables (i.e. the exact LES term is compared with its form available within an actual LES). The difference between these forms defines the subgrid pressure and the subgrid heat flux vector. The analyses are done both globally across the entire flame, as well as by conditionally averaging over specific regions of the flame; including regions of large subgrid kinetic energy, subgrid scalar dissipation, subgrid temperature variance, flame temperature, etc. In this work, although negligible for purely mixing cases, the gradient of the subgrid pressure is shown to be of the same order as, and larger than, the corresponding divergence of the turbulent subgrid stresses for reacting cases. This is despite the fact that all species behave essentially as ideal gases for this flame and holds true even when the ideal gas law is used to calculate the pressure. The ratio of the subgrid pressure gradient to the subgrid stress tensor divergence is shown to increase with increasing Reynolds number. Both the subgrid heat flux vector and its divergence are found to be substantially larger in reacting flows in comparison with mixing due to the associated larger temperature gradients. However, the divergence of the subgrid heat flux vector tends to be significantly smaller than other unclosed terms in the energy equation with decreasing significance with increasing Reynolds number.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1364-7830	1741-3559		WOS:000366248600006

Here, we report the use of an integrated approach combining metabolomics, transcriptomics, and gene function analyses to characterize gene-to-terpene and terpene pathway scenarios in a self-pollinating variety of this species. Eighty-eight metabolites including 22 sesquiterpenes (e.g., artemisinin), 26 monoterpenes, two triterpenes, one diterpene and 38 other non-polar metabolites were identified from 14 tissues. These metabolites were differentially produced by leaves and flowers at lower to higher positions. Sequences from cDNA libraries of six tissues were assembled into 18 871 contigs and genome-wide gene expression profiles in tissues were strongly associated with developmental stages and spatial specificities. Sequence mining identified 47 genes that mapped to the artemisinin, non-amorphadiene sesquiterpene, monoterpene, triterpene, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate and mevalonate pathways. Pearson correlation analysis resulted in network integration that characterized significant correlations of gene-to-gene expression patterns and gene expression-to-metabolite levels in six tissues simultaneously. More importantly, manipulations of amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene expression not only affected the activity of this pathway toward artemisinin, artemisinic acid, and arteannuin b but also altered non-amorphadiene sesquiterpene and genome-wide volatile profiles. Such gene-to-terpene landscapes associated with different tissues are fundamental to the metabolic engineering of artemisinin.									6	1	0	5	0	6			1674-2052	1752-9867		WOS:000365049200002	26192869

Methods that give a broad view of the proteomic landscape may prove valuable in uncovering new crosstalk connections, as well as in discovering new proteins within this regulatory framework. A multi-immunoblotting strategy was utilized to evaluate this concept on human and porcine spermatozoa samples. In human and porcine spermatozoa, a diversity of kinases were identified including protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase B (PKB), isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC), calmodulin-dependent kinases (CAMK), casein kinase (CK), and isoforms of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3). Several phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase (PP)-1, PP2A, PP2C, and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (MKP-1), were identified in human spermatozoa. The phosphorylation epitopes recognized belonged to members of the MAPK family, in addition to and isoforms of GSK3 and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Proteomic approaches that allow a broad view may aid in understanding the crosstalk between signaling systems in spermatozoal physiology.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1939-6368	1939-6376		WOS:000364486600003	26467841

This box is filled with countless interruptions coming from laptops, smartphones, and other devices, all of which constantly call for employees' attention. In this interruption era, workplace stress is a pervasive problem. To examine this problem, the present study hypothesizes that the three-way interaction among the frequency with which interrupting stimuli appear, their salience, and employees' deficits in inhibiting attentional responses to them impacts mental workload perceptions, ultimately leading to stress. The study, further, probes a related form of self-efficacy as a potential suppressor of interruption-based stress. Design: The study used a 2 (low vs. high frequency) x 2 (low vs. high salience) mixed model design. Methods: The 128 subjects completed a test of their inhibitory deficits and rated their mental workload perceptions and experiences of stress following a computer-based task. Results: Inhibitory deficits and increased interruption salience can alter the perception of mental workload in contemporary work environments for the worse, but interruption self-efficacy can help offset any resulting interruption-based stress. Conclusions: This study extends the literatures on work interruptions as well as on stress and coping in the workplace.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1061-5806	1477-2205		WOS:000360547400005	25626729

For the sake of quality control and regulation purposes, it is essential to be able to identify key odorants of various commercial sufus. To identify the aroma-active compounds in sufus, gas chromatography-olfactometry/aroma extract dilution analysis (GC-O/AEDA) was performed, and odour activity value (OAV) was estimated. The correlations between aroma profiles and identified aroma-active compounds were also investigated by principal component analysis. Results showed that 35 aroma-active compounds were detected through OAV calculation, while 28 compounds were identified by using GC-O/AEDA. Quantitative descriptive analysis revealed that aroma recombination model based on OAV calculation was more similar to original sufu in terms of aroma comparing to aroma recombination model based on GC-O/AEDA. Omission experiments further confirmed that the aroma compounds, such as ethyl butanoate, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, ethyl hexanoate, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal and 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, contributed most significantly to the characteristic aroma of a commercial sufu.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1478-6419	1478-6427		WOS:000360473900007	25790084

Chem. Phys. 122, 244713 (2005)]. A theory of atom surface collisions recently developed by the authors, based on the eikonal approximation, that includes multiphonon energy transfers is used to explain the temperature dependence of the measured scattered angular distribution spectra.

J	Stanley, Jonathan D.; Brandon, Duane M.; McMillan, Jeffrey J.								Does lowballing impair audit quality? Evidence from client accruals surrounding analyst forecasts								JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC POLICY				34	6			625	645		10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2015.05.007			NOV-DEC 2015	2015	The pricing of initial audit engagements has long been of interest to regulators because of audit quality concerns speculated to arise with lowball pricing tactics. However, there has been very little empirical investigation specifically aimed at understanding the link between audit fees and audit quality on new engagements. We examine a sample of initial engagements spanning 20002009 and find evidence suggesting that the magnitude of initial engagement discounting is positively associated with audit clients' ability to meet analyst forecasts using discretionary accruals. Additional analysis reveals that this effect is more pronounced before the passage of SOX. Further examination of the post-SOX period shows the effect is present in the latter half of our sample (2006-2009) but not in the years immediately following the passage of SOX (2002-2005). Additional supplemental tests suggest that the primary results are driven more by time and/or budget pressures than impaired independence. Overall, we interpret these results as consistent with longstanding concerns surrounding auditor lowballing and discuss the regulatory and practical implications for the audit profession with respect to the pricing and monitoring of new audit engagements.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), rotating disk electrode voltammetry (RDE), and rotating ring-disk electrode voltammetry (RRDE) have been used to determine the reduction product as hydrogen peroxide although in concentrations too small to observe by qualitative methods such as oxidation of NaI in solution. The dependence of the values of the peak potentials for the reduction on the pH of the solution and the-log[Me(2)Npy] are consistent with protonation up to pH 7.6 and pyridine ligand loss during the reduction. The addition of nitrite at 0.1 and 1 M to pH 7.0 solutions in contact with films of CoF16Pc on the glassy carbon electrode decreases the ORR current and shifts the peak potential of the ORR from -0.21 V vs. NHE to -0.19 V vs. NHE. The addition of nitrite at 0.1 and 1 M to films of Co(III)F16Pc(Me-2 Npy)(NO2) on glassy carbon, however, has no effect on either the current or the potential. While the electrochemical evidence for this proposal is not definitive, modeling has been used to examine the center of reduction in the alternative mechanisms by evaluation of the LUMOs of the hypothetical intermediates in both closed and open shell cases. The formation of five-coordinate Co(II)F16Pc(NO) is proposed to occur initially in the reduction mechanism. It is also possible that O-2 reduction takes place at the NO ligand center by way of a nitrogen-bound peroxynitrite intermediate. The NO/NO2- ligand appears to remain bound during the ORR. Direct coordination of O-2 to the metal center requiring a six-coordinate species, Co(III)F16Pc(O-2)(NO2), Co(II)F16Pc(O-2) (NO) or [Co(II)F16Pc(O-2)(NO2)](-) and has been considered in DFT modeling studies. The instability of the two-electron reduced, protonation species, [Co(I)F16Pc(NO2 OH)](-) in its loss of peroxynitrous acid suggests that the reduction of O-2 may occur by two one-electron reduction steps rather than a two-electron step.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1088-4246	1099-1409		WOS:000369341800005		
J	Hazare, Mandar; Venhovens, Paul								An Integrated Systems Engineering Method for Conceptual Design of Vehicle Handling Dynamics								SYSTEMS ENGINEERING				18	6			659	675		10.1002/sys.21333			NOV 2015	2015	The handling characteristics of road vehicles are important attributes that define a major part of its unique selling proposition. The engineering process of tuning vehicle handling dynamics is a challenging process due to the multitude of competing design requirements/parameters and requires a well-defined systematic approach. The primary objective of this publication is to describe an integrated system engineering method for the conceptual design of vehicle handling dynamics early in the product development process. A systems engineering-based simulation framework is described that connects subjective, customer-relevant handling expectations to higher-level, objective vehicle engineering targets and consequently breaks these targets down into subsystem-level requirements and component-level design specifications. A case study supporting this proposed system engineering method for vehicle handling design is also described in detail. The integrated systems engineering approach guides the engineering development process and provides insight into the compromises involved in vehicle handling layout, ultimately saving product development time and costs and helping to achieve a higher level of product maturity early in the design phase.

Horizontal neutral winds were inferred using bistatic observations from three NFPIs, together with monostatic and bistatic observations from two SDIs. All instruments were located in Alaska. Cross comparisons were made for a total of seven nights in January and February 2010. The results show a high degree of correlation between the diurnal behaviors of the line-of-sight (LOS) winds measured by both instruments. The SDI and NFPI LOS wind time series also often contained high-frequency fluctuations with similar overall characteristics, strongly suggesting that these fluctuations were geophysical in origin. However, the amplitude of the high-frequency component was stronger in the NFPI LOS wind than in the SDI data. Even the smallest SDI angular resolution element is much larger than the NFPI field of view, suggesting that its relative insensitivity to high frequencies is because these fluctuations are associated with local-scale structures whose spatial extent is smaller than similar to 40 km spanned by the smallest SDI viewing field. Upon fitting vectors to the LOS wind data, close agreement was found between the wind components estimated by the two types of instrument. Discrepancies that did arise occurred most often when the neutral wind speed was weak, suggesting that conditions capable of driving higher neutral wind speeds also suppressed the development of small-scale structures in the thermospheric neutral wind fields.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000368252100030

Electrochemical models, derived from the principles of electrochemistry, are arguably more accurate in capturing the physical mechanism of the battery cells than their counterpart data-driven or equivalent circuit models (ECM). Moreover, the electrochemical phenomena inside the battery cells are coupled with the thermal dynamics of the cells. Therefore, consideration of the coupling between electrochemical and thermal dynamics inside the battery cell can be potentially advantageous for improving the accuracy of the estimation. In this paper, a nonlinear adaptive observer scheme is developed based on a coupled electrochemical-thermal model of a Li-ion battery cell. The proposed adaptive observer scheme estimates the distributed Li-ion concentration and temperature states inside the electrode, and some of the electrochemical model parameters, simultaneously. These states and parameters determine the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) of the battery cell. The adaptive scheme is split into two separate but coupled observers, which simplifies the design and gain tuning procedures. The design relies on a Lyapunov's stability analysis of the observers, which guarantees the convergence of the combined state-parameter estimates. To validate the effectiveness of the scheme, both simulation and experimental studies are performed. The results show that the adaptive scheme is able to estimate the desired variables with reasonable accuracy. Finally, some scenarios are described where the performance of the scheme degrades.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-0434	1528-9028		WOS:000368472600005

A branch-and-price-and-cut method for computing an optimal bramble								DISCRETE OPTIMIZATION				18				168	188		10.1016/j.disopt.2015.09.005			NOV 2015	2015	Given an undirected graph, a bramble is a set of connected subgraphs (called bramble elements) such that every pair of subgraphs either contains a common node, or such that an edge (i, j) exists with node i belonging to one subgraph and node j belonging to the other. In this paper we examine the problem of finding the bramble number of a graph, along with a set of bramble elements that yields this number. The bramble number is the largest cardinality of a minimum hitting set over all bramble elements on this graph. A graph with bramble number k has a treewidth of k - 1. We provide a branch-and-price-and-cut method that generates columns corresponding to bramble elements, and rows corresponding to hitting sets. We then examine the computational efficacy of our algorithm on a randomly generated data set. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Thermal stability, surface morphology, barrier, and mechanical properties of the films were measured at varying IC (1, 3, 5, and 7%) and beta-CD (1 and 5%) concentrations. The PLA-IC-composite films (IC-PLA-CFs) showed uniform morphological structure, while samples containing beta-CD (beta-CD-PLA-CFs) showed high agglomeration of beta-CD due to poor interfacial interaction between beta-CD and PLA moieties. According to the thermal property analysis, the 5% IC-PLA-CFs showed 6.6 times lower dimensional changes (6.5%) at the temperature range of 20-80 degrees C than that of pure PLA film (43.0%). The increase of IC or beta-CD content in the PLA-composite films shifted the glass transition and crystallization temperature to higher temperature regions. The crystallinity of both composite films improved by increasing IC or beta-CD content. Both composite films had higher oxygen and water vapor permeability as IC or beta-CD content increased in comparison to pure PLA film. All the composite films had less flexibility and lower tensile strength than the pure PLA film. In conclusion, this study shows that the IC technique is valuable to improve the thermal expansion stability of PLA-based films.

The Role of Progress Feedback Type for Encouraging Intrinsic Motivation and Positive Brand Attitudes in Public Versus Private Gaming Contexts								JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING				32				1	12		10.1016/j.intmar.2015.07.001			NOV 2015	2015	With the popularity of video games and the resulting gamification of everyday activities comes an increase in in-game advertising (IGA). As a result, video game players' engagement and motivation to level-up or master a video game are becoming increasingly important for marketers hoping to increase exposure to their brands. Across two experimental studies, we provide evidence that games played publically (versus privately) are more motivating to players, and also demonstrate the important influence of feedback via building a character or completing a status bar. In study 1, we find that, for public gaming contexts, players experience more enjoyment, effort, and flow when progress is shown via building a character. Furthermore, in study 2 we extend study 1 's findings and discover a moderated mediation model for brand attitudes. Specifically, the relationship between public gaming context and brand attitude is mediated by enjoyment and flow. Further, the mediation of enjoyment and flow is moderated by feedback type, where progress affects brand attitude when a character is used for game feedback, but not for status bar feedback. We examine our research questions within the context of intrinsic motivation, specifically self-determination them. (C) 2015 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE.

The impact of fire and fire extinguishing method on the corrosion behavior of the steel bars in concrete pore solution								FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL				78				196	201		10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.10.001			NOV 2015	2015	Exposure of reinforced concrete structural elements to high temperatures, e.g. fire, remains one of the serious potential risks to such structures. This exposure can lead to losses in concrete structural capacity, possible plastic deformation of embedded steel and loss of bond between reinforcing steel and concrete. The level of temperature and the method of extinguishing the fire alter the microstructure of reinforcing steel bars. This microstructure alteration changes the corrosion behavior of steel in such structures, when exposes to chloride ions. The present study was undertaken to determine the impact of exposure of steel to high temperature and the method of extinguishing the fire on its corrosion behavior in alkaline environment of concrete in presence of chloride ions. Results indicated that exposure of steel to high temperatures, regardless of its level; made steel more susceptible to corrosion compared to the reference case, when steel was kept at room temperature. The worst case happened for the steel exposed to 850 degrees C for an hour, then cooled rapidly in water, where the corrosion rate increased approximately 60% in chloride contaminated concrete pore solution.

In order to successfully acquire and compare clinical results and correlate health trends, accurate, precise, and validated methods of analysis must be developed. Presented here is the development of a quantitative method for the determination of soy isoflavones (daidzin, glycitin, genistin, daidzein, and genistein) using LC-particle beam/electron ionization-MS (LC-PB/EIMS). An internal standard (IS) approach for quantitation with 7-hydroxy-4-chromone as the IS compound was used, with response factors for each individual isoflavone obtained from calibrant solutions. The results from this method were compared with the certified and reference values for National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SRM 3238 Soy-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form to demonstrate that the method was in control. Results obtained using LC-PB/EIMS were consistent with the NIST certified or reference values and their uncertainties for all five isoflavones, demonstrating that the LC-PB/EIMS approach is both accurate and precise when used for the determination of the target isoflavones in soy-containing dietary supplement finished products while simultaneously providing structural information.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1060-3271	1944-7922		WOS:000367206700002	26651559

The role of women governors in the policy arena is of particular interest with more women elected and appointed to these positions every year. A review of the literature related to gender differences in leadership styles, group behaviors, and policy interests is presented, followed by a binomial generalized linear model testing the relationship between gender, gubernatorial powers and gubernatorial policy effectiveness. As more women serve as high ranking policy executives, understanding the role of gender is both a timely and relevant research question.

Often, family or friends of patients adopt the role of primary caregiver (CG). Although this arrangement offsets the direct financial costs, the burden of caregiving can lead to detrimental physical, financial, and mental outcomes, including a 600 percent increased risk of spousal CGs developing dementia. The most successful interventions use multidisciplinary approaches, but results range from weak to moderate. This review presents current literature on CG burden, risk factors, and interventions, and proposes recommendations for future research. The authors advocate for a holistic, interdisciplinary team approach, including physicians, nurses, and social workers, focused on improving health and quality of life concurrently in both the CG and the care recipient.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-7283	1545-6854		WOS:000366624700006

This study focuses on non-synonymous mutations in the KDM5C ARID domain and evaluates the effects of two disease-associated missense mutations (A77T and D87G) and three not-yet-classified missense mutations (R108W, N142S, and R179H). We predict the ARID domain's folding and binding free energy changes due to mutations, and also study the effects of mutations on protein dynamics. Our computational results indicate that A77T and D87G mutants have minimal effect on the KDM5C ARID domain stability and DNA binding. In parallel, the change in the free energy unfolding caused by the mutants A77T and D87G were experimentally measured by urea-induced unfolding experiments and were shown to be similar to the in silico predictions. The evolutionary conservation analysis shows that the disease-associated mutations are located in a highly-conserved part of the ARID structure (N-terminal domain), indicating their importance for the KDM5C function. N-terminal residues' high conservation suggests that either the ARID domain utilizes the N-terminal to interact with other KDM5C domains or the N-terminal is involved in some yet unknown function. The analysis indicates that, among the non-classified mutations, R108W is possibly a disease-associated mutation, while N142S and R179H are probably harmless.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1422-0067			WOS:000365648300087	26580603

The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) has been extracted from the XAFS and analyzed using a novel, computational Latin hypercube sampling method. The methodology not only confirms the expected space group and crystal structure, it also identifies the origin of a previously reported split O shell. Since EXAFS is a local order analysis technique, the O shell splitting is identified as an O atom occupying an interstitial site. This result is significant for examining O-2-transport in a ThO2 matrix and corroborating research indicating partial Th 5f occupancy that is similar to hyper-stoichiometric UO2+x compounds.

The newly constructed microstructure-evolution model is based on the key physical metallurgy concepts and principles of the workpiece material and includes the basic thermodynamics and kinetics of various interacting and competing phase transformations, which may take place within the weld region. The microstructure-evolution model is subsequently applied to Carpenter Custom 465, H1000, a high-strength/high-corrosion resistance, precipitation-hardened martensitic stainless steel. Combined use of the thermo-mechanical process model and the workpiece material microstructure-evolution model enabled establishment of the basic relationships between the linear friction welding process parameters (e.g. friction pressure, reciprocating amplitude, reciprocating frequency, and forging pressure), temporal evolution and the spatial distribution of the as-welded material microstructure. Examination of the results yielded by the model clearly revealed: (a) the presence of three zones within the weld, that is, (1) a contact interface region, (2) a thermo-mechanically affected zone, and (3) a heat-affected zone and (b) the fact that the relative size and the extent of the associated microstructural changes are controlled by the selected linear friction welding process parameters. While there are no publicly available reports related to Carpenter Custom 465 linear friction welding behavior, to allow experimental validation of the attendant microstructure-evolution model, these findings are consistent with the results of our ongoing companion experimental investigation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4054	2041-2975		WOS:000366158800012

A new 250 m, interferometric vertical borehole strainmeter has been developed based completely on passive optical components. Details of the design and deployment at the Pinon Flat Observatory are presented. Power spectra show an intertidal noise level of -130 dB (re. 1 epsilon(2)/Hz), consistent within 1-3 dB between redundant components. Examination of its response to Earth tides and earthquakes relative to the areal strain recorded by an orthogonal pair of collocated, 730 m horizontal laser strainmeters yield a Poisson's ratio for local near surface material of 0.25 that is consistent with previous results.

Effects of Polymer Molecular Weight on Adsorption and Flocculation in Aqueous Kaolinite Suspensions Dosed with Nonionic Polyacrylamides								WATER				7	11			5896	5909		10.3390/w7115896			NOV 2015	2015	The effects of polyacrylamide (PAM) molecular weights (MWs) on the PAM adsorption capacities and PAM-mediated flocculation of kaolinite suspensions were investigated using a series of nonionic PAMs with different MWs. Adsorption tests using aqueous kaolinite suspensions dosed with a series of PAMs with MWs of 1.5 kg/mol, 10 kg/mol, 0.6-1 Mg/mol, 5-6 Mg/mol, and 18 Mg/mol (referred to as 1.5 K, 10 K, 0.6-1 M, 5-6 M, and 18 M PAMs) indicated that the adsorption capacity of the kaolinite for PAM increased with increasing MW. However, the capacity for 18 M PAM was 20 times smaller than those for the 0.6-1 M and 5-6 M PAMs, although it has the highest MW. In steady-shear viscosity tests, a 1 g/L stock solution of 18 PAM was found to cause polymeric chain entanglements, which reduced the adsorption capacity. The 0.6-1 M and 5-6 M PAMs were further used in flocculation tests, in order to investigate the effect of PAM MW on the flocculation capability. The 5-6 M PAM was found to have higher flocculation capabilities than 0.6-1 M PAM; 5-6 M PAM was more subject to nonequilibrium flocculation, resulting in the development of unstable, stretched polymeric structures on solid surfaces and increasing particle-particle bridging and flocculation. Higher-MW PAMs are more effective flocculation agents, because of their higher adsorption capacities and flocculation capabilities. However, an extremely high-MW PAM, such as 18 M PAM, decreases adsorption/flocculation, and the preparation and handling of working solutions become difficult, because of polymeric chain entanglements.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2073-4441			WOS:000365923400002

A ferrofluid-based energy harvester: An experimental investigation involving internally-resonant sloshing modes								EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS				224	14-15			2993	3004		10.1140/epjst/e2015-02602-9			NOV 2015	2015	The conformable nature of liquid-state transduction materials offers unprecedented opportunities for designing complex-shaped vibratory energy harvesters that are, otherwise, hard to realize using solid-state transduction elements. To achieve this goal, we propose an electromagnetic energy harvester which exploits the sloshing of a magnetized ferrofluid column in a base-excited container to transform vibratory energy into electricity. The sloshing of the magnetized ferrofluid column generates a change in magnetic flux which, in turn, induces a current in an adjacent closed-loop conductor. In this study, we specifically choose the dimensions of the container and the height of the fluid column such that the modal frequencies of the sloshing ferrofluid are nearly commensurate. It is shown that this choice of parameters activates a two-to-one internal energy pump between the commensurate modes resulting in two response peaks and large-amplitude voltages over a wide range of frequencies, thereby improving the steady-state bandwidth of the harvester. Influence of several of the key design parameters on the harvester's performance is also discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1951-6355	1951-6401		WOS:000365477600022		
J	Zhou, Kan; Ivanco, Andrej; Filipi, Zoran; Hofmann, Heath								Finite-Element-Based Computationally Efficient Scalable Electric Machine Model Suitable for Electrified Powertrain Simulation and Optimization								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS				51	6			4435	4445		10.1109/TIA.2015.2451094			NOV-DEC 2015	2015	Electric machines are a key component of electric/hybrid electric vehicle (EV/HEV) powertrains. Thus, computationally efficient models for electric machines are essential for powertrain-level design, simulation, and optimization. In this paper, a finite-element-based method for quickly generating torque-speed curves and efficiency maps for electric machines is presented. First, magnetostatic finite-element analysis (FEA) is conducted on a " base" machine design. This analysis produces torque, normalized losses, flux linkage, and the maximum magnetic field intensity in the permanent magnets for a wide range of currentmagnitudes and phase angles. These values are then scaled based upon changing the size of the machine and the effective number of turns of the machine windings to quickly generate a variety of new machine designs and their corresponding efficiency maps using postprocessing techniques. Results suggest that, by avoiding resolving the FEA for the scaled designs, the proposed techniques can be used to quickly generate efficiency maps, and thus are useful for EV/HEV powertrain-level simulation and optimization.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0093-9994	1939-9367		WOS:000365415700010

Not only are lentils a good source of energy, they also contain a range of micronutrients and prebiotic carbohydrates. Kale (Brassica oleracea v. acephala) has been considered as a health food, but its full range of benefits and composition has not been extensively studied. Recent studies suggest that foods are enrich in prebiotic carbohydrates and dietary fiber that can potentially reduce risks of non-communicable diseases, including obesity, cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Lentil and kale added to a cereal-based diet would enhance intakes of essential minerals and vitamins to combat micronutrient malnutrition. This review provides an overview of lentil and kale as a complementary nutrient-rich whole food source to combat global malnutrition and calorie issues. In addition, prebiotic carbohydrate profiles and the genetic potential of these crops for further micronutrient enrichment are briefly discussed with respect to developing sustainable and nutritious food systems.									3	0	0	2	0	3			2072-6643			WOS:000365656900029	26569296

This burst was followed by a faint X-ray afterglow but no optical counterpart was discovered. However, inside the X-ray error circle a potential host galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.102 was soon reported in the literature. If this system is the host, then GRB 100628A was the cosmologically most nearby unambiguous short burst with a measured redshift so far. We used the multi-colour imager GROND at the ESO/La Silla MPG 2.2 in telescope. ESO/VLT spectroscopy, and deep Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) radio-continuum observations together with publicly available Gemini imaging data to study the putative host and the galaxies in the field of GRB 100628A. We confirm that inside the X-ray error circle the most probable host-galaxy candidate is the morphologically disturbed, interacting galaxy system at z = 0.102. The interacting galaxies are connected by a several kpc long tidal stream, which our VLT/FORS2 spectroscopy reveals strong emission lines of [O II] [O III], H alpha and H beta, characteristic for the class of extreme emission-line galaxies and indicative of ongoing star formation. The latter leaves open the possibility that the ORB progenitor was a member of a young stellar population. However, we indentify a second host-galaxy candidate slightly outside the X-ray error circle. It is a radio-bright, luminous elliptical galaxy at a redshift z = 0.311. With a K-band luminosity of 2 x 10(11) L-circle dot this galaxy resembles the probable giant elliptical host of the first well-localized short burst. GRB 050509B. If this is the host, then the progenitor of GRB 100628A was a member of an old stellar population.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-0746			WOS:000365072200009		
J	Xu, Ke; Wang, Kuang-Ching; Amin, Rahul; Martin, Jim; Izard, Ryan								A Fast Cloud-Based Network Selection Scheme Using Coalition Formation Games in Vehicular Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY				64	11			5327	5339		10.1109/TVT.2014.2379953			NOV 2015	2015	Leveraging multiple wireless technologies and radio access networks (RANs), vehicles on the move have the potential to get robust connectivity and continuous service. To support the demands of as many vehicles as possible, an efficient and fast network selection scheme is critically important to achieve high performance and efficiency. So far, prior works have primarily focused on design of optimization algorithms and utility functions for either user or network performance. Most such studies do not address the complexities involved in the acquisition of needed information and the execution of algorithms, making them unsuitable for practical implementations in vehicles. This paper proposes a fast cloud-based network selection scheme for vehicular networks. By leveraging a compute cloud's abundant computing and data storage resources, vehicles can leverage wider scope network information for decision-making. Vehicles select best access networks through a coalition formation game approach. A one-iteration fast convergence algorithm is proposed to achieve the final state of coalition structure in the game. Through extensive simulation, the proposed network selection scheme was shown to balance system throughput and fairness with a built-in utility division rule of the framework. The algorithm efficiency showed eightfold enhancement over a conventional coalition formation algorithm. Such features validate the potential of implementation in practice.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9545	1939-9359		WOS:000365016700036		
J	Dehkordi, Arash Mehdizadeh; Zebarjadi, Mona; He, Jian; Tritt, Terry M.								Thermoelectric power factor: Enhancement mechanisms and strategies for higher performance thermoelectric materials								MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING R-REPORTS				97				1	22		10.1016/j.mser.2015.08.001			NOV 2015	2015	Thermoelectric research has witnessed groundbreaking progress over the past 15-20 years. The thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, a measure of the competition between electronic transport (i.e. power factor) and thermal transport (i.e. total thermal conductivity), has long surpassed once a longtime barrier of similar to 1 and thermoelectric scientists are targeting ZT > 2 as the new goal. A majority of this recent improvement in ZT has been achieved through the reduction of lattice part of thermal conductivity (KO using nanostructuring techniques. The rapid progress in this direction focused the efforts on the development of experimental methods and understanding phonon transport to decrease lattice thermal conductivity. This fact left the development of ideas to improve electronic transport and thermoelectric power factor rather overlooked. With thermal conductivity of the potential thermoelectrics approaching the minimum theoretical limit, on the journey to higherZTvalues, a paradigm shift is necessary toward the enhancement of the thermoelectric power factor. This article discusses the ideas and strategies proposed and developed in order to improve the thermoelectric power factor and thus hopefully move us closer to the target of a ZT > 2 !

J	Smith, T. J.; Gerard, P. D.; Drake, M. A.								Effect of temperature and concentration on benzoyl peroxide bleaching efficacy and benzoic acid levels in whey protein concentrate								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				98	11			7614	7627		10.3168/jds.2015-9890			NOV 2015	2015	Much of the fluid whey produced in the United States is a by-product of Cheddar cheese manufacture and must be bleached. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) is currently 1 of only 2 legal chemical bleaching agents for fluid whey in the United States, but benzoic acid is an unavoidable by-product of BP bleaching. Benzoyl peroxide is typically a powder, but new liquid BP dispersions are available. A greater understanding of the bleaching characteristics of BP is necessary. The objective of the study was to compare norbixin destruction, residual benzoic acid, and flavor differences between liquid whey and 80% whey protein concentrates (WPC80) bleached at different temperatures with 2 different benzoyl peroxides (soluble and insoluble). Two experiments were conducted in this study. For experiment 1, 3 factors (temperature, bleach type, bleach concentration) were evaluated for norbixin destruction using a response surface model central composite design in liquid whey. For experiment 2, norbixin concentration, residual benzoic acid, and flavor differences were explored in WPC80 from whey bleached by the 2 commercially available BP (soluble and insoluble) at 5 mg/kg. In liquid whey, soluble BP bleached more norbixin than insoluble BP, especially at lower concentrations (5 and 10 mg/kg) at both cold (4 degrees C) and hot (50 degrees C) temperatures. The WPC80 from liquid whey bleached with BP at 50 degrees C had lower norbixin concentration, benzoic acid levels, cardboard flavor, and aldehyde levels than WPC80 from liquid whey bleached with BP at 4 degrees C. Regardless of temperature, soluble BP destroyed more norbixin at lower concentrations than insoluble BP. The WPC80 from soluble-BP-bleached wheys had lower cardboard flavor and lower aldehyde levels than WPC80 from insoluble-BP-bleached whey. This study suggests that new, soluble (liquid) BP can be used at lower concentrations than insoluble BP to achieve equivalent bleaching and that less residual benzoic acid remains in WPC80 powder from liquid whey bleached hot (50 degrees C) than cold (4 degrees C), which may provide opportunities to reduce benzoic acid residues in dried whey ingredients, expanding their marketability.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000363495400019	26364115

Effect of forage level and replacing canola meal with dry distillers grains with solubles in precision-fed heifer diets: Digestibility and rumen fermentation								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				98	11			8054	8065		10.3168/jds.2015-9636			NOV 2015	2015	Objectives of this study were to determine the effects of feeding differing forage-to-concentrate ratios (F:C) and inclusion rates of corn dry distillers grain with solubles (DDGS) on digestion and rumen fermentation in precision-fed dairy heifer rations. A split-plot design with F:C as whole plot and DDGS inclusion level as sub-plot was administered in a 4-period (19 d) 4 x 4 Latin square. Eight rumen-cannulated Holstein heifers (12.5 +/- 0.5 mo of age and 344 +/- 15 kg of body weight) housed in individual stalls were allocated to 2 F:C [50:50, low forage, or 75:25 high forage; dry matter (DM) basis] and to a sequence of DDGS inclusion (0, 7, 14, and 21%; DM basis). Forage was a mix of 50% corn silage and 50% grass hay (DM basis). Diets were fed to allow for 800 g/d of body weight gain and fed lx/d. Rumen contents were sampled at -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 h after feeding for rumen fermentation measures. Low-forage rations had greater DM and organic matter apparent digestibility. We detected a quadratic effect for DM, organic matter, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fiber apparent digestibility, with the 14% DDGS inclusion level having the highest values. Nitrogen retention decreased with increasing levels of DDGS. Molar proportions of acetate tended to be greater for HF and decreased as DDGS increased; propionate increased as DDGS increased, resulting in the opposite effect on acetate to propionate ratio. Rumen protozoa count decreased as DDGS increased. Moderate levels (14% of DM) of DDGS appear to enhance nutrient utilization and fermentation in precision-fed dairy heifers fed different F:C diets.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000363495400059	26299163

Accumulated evidences have suggested that oxidative stress is closely associated with the dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD that can be protected by antioxidants. Biochanin A that is an O-methylated isoflavone in chickpea is investigated to explore its protective mechanism on dopaminergic neurons of the unilateral lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected rat. The results showed that biochanin A significantly improved the animal model's behavioral symptoms, prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons and inhibited the deleterious microglia activation in the LPS-induced rats. Moreover, biochanin A inhibited nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase) activation and malondialdehyde (MDA) production, increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in the rat brain. These results suggested that biochanin A might be a natural candidate with protective properties on dopaminergic neurons against the PD.

Empowering Teachers with Low-Intensity Strategies to Support Academic Engagement: Implementation and Effects of Instructional Choice for Elementary Students in Inclusive Settings								EDUCATION AND TREATMENT OF CHILDREN				38	4			473	504					NOV 2015	2015	Instructional choice is a low-intensity strategy that requires little preparation, is easy to implement, and supports content instruction in the classroom. In this study we explored the effectiveness of two types of instructional choice across-task and within-task choices implemented classwide during writing instruction by classroom teachers with limited university support in an inclusive first-grade classroom. Student participants were one boy (Neal) and one girl (Tina) who were identified using academic and behavioral screening procedures as needing more intensive supports in the classroom. Results established a functional relation between choice conditions and increases in academic engaged time and decreases in disruptive behavior for Tina, but not for Neal. Teachers functioned as both primary and reliability data collectors using momentary time sampling and implemented both choice conditions with high levels of fidelity. Social validity was assessed from the perspectives of all stakeholders. Limitations and future directions are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0748-8491	1934-8924		WOS:000364502100004

Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-based hydrogels possessing ionizable 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and cross-linked with varying concentrations (1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 mol%) tetra( ethylene glycol) diacrylate (TEGDA) were synthesized and studied for their degree of hydration, glass transition temperature and partitioning of zwitterionic Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB), a zwitterionic drug surrogate known to bind to amines. Using UV Vis spectroscopy, the partition coefficient of CBB within the hydrogels was found to average 6.69 +/- 0.12 but to rise monotonically from 6.54(1 mol%) to 6.84(12 mol%) as a function of TEGDA mol% or cross-link density in accord with a monotonic reduction of the degree of hydration. The absence of DMAEMA was found to reduce the partition coefficient of CBB from 6.5 to 4.1. Both formulations, with and without DMAEMA (pK(a) = 7.5), showed an independence of pH over the physiologically relevant range, pH 5 pH 9, confirming that this difference was not due to Henderson Hasselbalch ionization of the pendant group. The presence of DMAEMA resulted in a 1.44 fold increase in CBB loading confirming complex formation. The absence of DMAEMA still resulted in considerable partitioning of CBB into the hydrogel suggesting that the affinity between CBB and DMAEMA may not be the only relationship controlling the partition coefficient.

Although elemental nutrient resorption has been shown to respond modestly to temperature and precipitation, we know remarkably little about the influence of increasing intensities of drought and warming on the resorption of different classes of plant metabolites. We studied the effect of warming and altered precipitation on the production and resorption of metabolites in Quercus rubra. The combination of warming and drought produced a higher abundance of compounds that can help to mitigate climatic stress by functioning as osmoregulators and antioxidants, including important intermediaries of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, amino acids including proline and citrulline, and polyamines such as putrescine. Resorption efficiencies (REs) of extractable metabolites surprisingly had opposite responses to drought and warming; drought treatments generally increased RE of metabolites compared to ambient and wet treatments, while warming decreased RE. However, RE of total N differed markedly from that of extractable metabolites such as amino acids; for instance, droughted plants resorbed a smaller fraction of elemental N from their leaves than plants exposed to the ambient control. In contrast, plants in drought treatment resorbed amino acids more efficiently (>90%) than those in ambient (65-77%) or wet (42-58%) treatments. Across the climate treatments, the RE of elemental N correlated negatively with tissue tannin concentration, indicating that polyphenols produced in leaves under climatic stress could interfere with N resorption. Thus, senesced leaves from drier conditions might have a lower nutritive value to soil heterotrophs during the initial stages of litter decomposition despite a higher elemental N content of these tissues. Our results suggest that N resorption may be controlled not only by plant demand, but also by climatic influences on the production and resorption of plant metabolites. As climate-carbon models incorporate increasingly sophisticated nutrient cycles, these results highlight the need to adequately understand plant physiological responses to climatic variables.									2	0	0	1	1	2			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000364777200022	26179236

Fungicide Sensitivity of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum: A Thorough Assessment Using Discriminatory Dose, EC50, High-Resolution Melting analysis, and Description of New Point Mutation Associated with Thiophanate-Methyl Resistance								PLANT DISEASE				99	11			1537	1543		10.1094/PDIS-11-14-1231-RE			NOV 2015	2015	Thiophanate-methyl (TM), fluazinam, and procymidone are fungicides extensively used for white mold control of common bean in Brazil. We assessed the sensitivity of Brazilian isolates of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum to these three fungicides using discriminatory doses and concentration that results in 50% mycelial growth inhibition (EC50) values. In total, 282 isolates from the most important production areas were screened and none was resistant to fluazinam or procymidone. The EC50 values varied from 0.003 to 0.007 and from 0.11 to 0.72 mu g/ml for fluazinam and procymidone, respectively. One isolate was resistant to TM. The EC50 of the TM-resistant isolate was greater than 100 mu g/ml, whereas the EC50 of the sensitive isolates varied from 0.38 to 2.23 mu g/ml. The TM-resistant isolate had a L240F mutation in the B-tubulin gene. This is the first report of mutation at codon 240 causing resistance to a benzimidazole fungicide in S. sclerotiorum. The high-resolution melting analysis allowed the distinction of TM-sensitive and -resistant isolates by specific melting peaks and curves. The TM-resistant isolate had mycelial growth, sclerotia production, and aggressiveness comparable with that of the sensitive isolates, indicating that this genotype will likely compete well against sensitive isolates in the field. This study demonstrates that resistance to TM, fluazinam, and procymidone is nonexistent or rare. Resistance management practices should be implemented, however, to delay the spread of TM-resistant genotypes.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000364354300010		
J	Liu, Shuaishuai; Tong, Chenning								Investigation of subgrid-scale mixing of reactive scalar perturbations from flamelets in turbulent partially premixed flames								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				162	11			4149	4157		10.1016/j.combustflame.2015.07.048			NOV 2015	2015	Recent studies of subgrid-scale (SGS) mixing and turbulence-chemistry interaction have shown that turbulent flames contain different structures. In flamelet structures diffusion of reactive scalars and chemical reaction are tightly coupled. Most mixing models used in probability density and filtered density methods, however, are based on non-reactive scalars. To investigate the effects of the coupling on the diffusion we decompose a reactive scalar into a steady flamelet part and perturbations from it. The diffusion of the former can be obtained from a suitably chosen flamelet solution while the latter is unclosed. The conditionally filtered diffusion and dissipation of the reactive scalar perturbations are analyzed using high-resolution line images obtained in turbulent partially premixed (Sandia) flames. For SGS scalar containing flamelets, the perturbation diffusion has characteristics similar to that of a non-reactive scalar, in contrast with the flamelet part. The functional form of the conditionally filtered diffusion is well described by the Interaction by Exchange with the Mean (IEM) model. Our perturbation analysis of the flamelet equation shows that for perturbations having length scales smaller than the reaction zone width, the reactive scalar diffusion is largely controlled by the mixture fraction field, thus having the characteristics of non-reactive scalar mixing. For perturbations with length scales larger than the reaction width, the conditionally filtered diffusion has the same form as non-reactive scalar mixing, with the mixing time scale determined by the flamelet. The IEM model predictions based on this mixing time scale are in good agreement with the experimental results for a range of SGS conditions, suggesting that the perturbations are consistent with unsteady flamelets for the conditions studied. Thus, mixing models based on non-reactive scalars can potentially model the SGS mixing accurately. The results in the present study can be useful for developing a unified mixing model that can predict all combustion regimes accurately. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Au, Sarah Y.; Bruce, Terri F.; Bridges, William C.; Klaine, Stephen J.								Responses of Hyalella azteca to acute and chronic microplastic exposures								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				34	11			2564	2572		10.1002/etc.3093			NOV 2015	2015	Limited information is available on the presence of microplastics in freshwater systems, and even less is known about the toxicological implications of the exposure of aquatic organisms to plastic particles. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of microplastic ingestion on the freshwater amphipod, Hyalella azteca. Hyalella azteca was exposed to fluorescent polyethylene microplastic particles and polypropylene microplastic fibers in individual 250-mL chambers to determine 10-d mortality. In acute bioassays, polypropylene microplastic fibers were significantly more toxic than polyethylene microplastic particles; 10-d lethal concentration 50% values for polyethylene microplastic particles and polypropylene microplastic fibers were 4.64x10(4) microplastics/mL and 71.43 microplastics/mL, respectively. A 42-d chronic bioassay using polyethylene microplastic particles was conducted to quantify effects on reproduction, growth, and egestion. Chronic exposure to polyethylene microplastic particles significantly decreased growth and reproduction at the low and intermediate exposure concentrations. During acute exposures to polyethylene microplastic particles, the egestion times did not significantly differ from the egestion of normal food materials in the control; egestion times for polypropylene microplastic fibers were significantly slower than the egestion of food materials in the control. Amphipods exposed to polypropylene microplastic fibers also had significantly less growth. The greater toxicity of microplastic fibers than microplastic particles corresponded with longer residence times for the fibers in the gut. The difference in residence time might have affected the ability to process food, resulting in an energetic effect reflected in sublethal endpoints. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:2564-2572.

J	Tiwari, Santosh; Dong, Hong; Fadel, Georges; Fenyes, Peter; Kloess, Artemis								A physically-based shape morphing algorithm for packing and layout applications								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING - IJIDEM				9	4			277	289		10.1007/s12008-014-0237-0			NOV 2015	2015	In this paper, a fast and efficient shape morphing algorithm specifically designed for packing and layout applications is presented. The shape morphing algorithm is based on a modified mass-spring system which is used to model the morphable object. The shape morphing algorithm mimics a quasi-physical process similar to inflation/deflation of a balloon filled with air. The morphing algorithm starts with an initial manifold geometry and morphs it to obtain a desired volume such that the obtained geometry does not interfere with the objects surrounding it. The change in geometry is achieved by simulating the motion of mass points situated at the vertices of the surface mesh. We propose several modifications to the original mass-spring system and to the underlying physics that governs it to significantly speed-up the shape morphing process. The proposed shape morphing algorithm is designed to address the specific requirements for layout design. The morphable object is represented as a closed non-intersecting surface mesh consisting of triangular facets. An algorithm to automatically generate the mass-spring model from an arbitrary manifold geometry is also proposed. The surface mesh generated by the morphing algorithm is suitable for use during the conceptual design phase of the vehicle layout.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1955-2513	1955-2505		WOS:000364009400003		
J	Garland, Anthony; Fadel, Georges								Design and Manufacturing Functionally Gradient Material Objects With an Off the Shelf Three-Dimensional Printer: Challenges and Solutions								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				137	11	SI				111407	10.1115/1.4031097			NOV 2015	2015	This paper presents the challenges and solutions encountered while designing and then printing functionally gradient material (FGM) objects using an off the shelf fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer. The printer, Big Builder Dual-Feed Extruder from 3dprinter4u, Noordwijkerhout, The Netherlands, has the unique design of extruding two different filaments out of one nozzle. By controlling the rate at which the two filaments are pulled into the melt chamber, FGM objects can be printed. Software challenges associated with process planning required to print an FGM object are solved by showing a method for printing a discretized gradient and by designing an open-loop control mechanism for the extruder motors. A design method is proposed that models an object using a level-set function (LSF) with a material gradient. Instead of merely identifying the boundaries of the object, the level set also models the material gradient within the object. This representation method along with a genetic algorithm finds an optimal design for an FGM cantilever beam that is then printed on the FDM printer. The model and genetic algorithm are also used to solve a standard topology optimization problem. The results are compared to a similar FGM topology optimization method in the literature. All the codes for this paper are made open source to facilitate future research.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1050-0472			WOS:000363865600008

Multipoint Monin-Obukhov Similarity and Its Application to Turbulence Spectra in the Convective Atmospheric Surface Layer								JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES				72	11			4337	4348		10.1175/JAS-D-15-0134.1			NOV 2015	2015	A generalized Monin-Obukhov similarity hypothesis for the atmospheric surface layer is proposed. It employs the Monin-Obukhov length as a length scale in both the horizontal and vertical directions, in contrast to the original Monin-Obukhov similarity. Therefore, the horizontal turbulence scales, which are contained in multipoint statistics, must be explicitly included. The similarity hypothesis is formulated for the joint probability density function (JPDF) of multipoint velocity and temperature differences and is termed the multipoint Monin-Obukhov similarity (MMO). In MMO, the nondimensional JPDF in the surface layer depends on the separation vectors and the heights from the ground, both nondimensionalized by the Monin-Obukhov length. A key aspect of MMO is that at heights much smaller than the absolute value of the Monin-Obukhov length, both shear and buoyancy can be important. As an application, MMO is used to predict the two-dimensional horizontal turbulence spectra in the convective surface layer. It predicts a two-layer structure with three scaling ranges. Comparisons of the predicted spectra with those obtained using high-resolution large-eddy simulations show general agreement, supporting MMO. Within MMO, full similarity is only achieved for multipoint statistics, while similarity properties (or a lack thereof) for one-point statistics (the original Monin-Obukhov similarity) can be derived from those of multipoint statistics. MMO provides a new framework for analyzing the turbulence statistics and for understanding the dynamics in the atmospheric surface layer.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4928	1520-0469		WOS:000364192700014

Getting Students Hooked on the Reading Habit								READING TEACHER				69	3			259	263		10.1002/trtr.1423			NOV-DEC 2015	2015	We know that students who enjoy reading are likely to choose to read more often than students who do not enjoy reading. We also know that the more students read the better readers they become. The bottom line is that reading proficiency has been linked to a better and more productive academic, social, and civic life. We really don't need to be convinced that reading is a good thing for our students. The larger question is how do we help out students develop the reading habit? Recent research suggests three promising practices for supporting and nurturing the reading habit: design reading instruction based on principles of motivation, make reading relevant to the real world, and provide reading texts and tasks that are high-interest and moderately challenging.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0034-0561	1936-2714		WOS:000363928300002

The Covering Chain of a Graph								UTILITAS MATHEMATICA				98				183	196					NOV 2015	2015	In the study of domination in graphs, relationships between the concepts of maximal independent sets, minimal dominating sets and maximal irredundant sets are used to establish what is known as the domination chain of parameters:ir(G) <= gamma(G) <= i(G) <= beta(0) (G) <= Gamma(G) <= IR(G).This chain of inequalities has become one of the major focal points in domination theory. Starting from the concept of vertex cover, we introduce six graph-theoretic parameters which obey a chain of inequalities, which we call the covering chain of the graph G. We prove that this covering chain is the dual of the domination chain.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0315-3681			WOS:000363912200014

One common approach to make high porosity ceramics is to use fugitive pore formers followed by partial densification. The resultant ceramic has hierarchical porosity: extrinsic large pores from the burnout of the pore former; and intrinsic small inter-particle pores. In this study, the effect of sintering conditions and pore former on porosity and microstructure of hierarchically porous ceramics has been investigated. Pore size and pore volume fraction evolution of intrinsic and extrinsic pores were quantified as a function of sintering conditions. The effect of porosity and sintering conditions on average grain size is also investigated. It is shown that during sintering both the extrinsic and the intrinsic porosity decrease but along different trajectories. It is shown that the intrinsic pores control the grain growth. The results are discussed in terms of standard mechanisms and models available in the literature.					7th International Conference on Sintering7th International Conference on Sintering	AUG 24-28, 2014AUG 24-28, 2014		Dresden, GERMANYDresden, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000363683600003

Effects of in ovo injection of organic trace minerals and post-hatch holding time on broiler performance and bone characteristics								POULTRY SCIENCE				94	11			2677	2685		10.3382/ps/pev249			NOV 2015	2015	Effects of the in ovo injection of organic Mn, Zn, and Cu in association with post-hatch (POH) feed and water restriction on the performance and physical-chemical bone parameters of male Ross x Ross 708 broilers were examined. On 17 d of incubation, a total of 1,872 eggs were subjected to in ovo injection using a commercial multi-egg injector. Treatments (TRT) includingd non-injected and diluent-injected controls. The respective Zn, Mn, and Cu levels (mg/mL) added to the diluent of the low (LMD) and high mineral (HMD) TRT groups were 0.181, 0.087, and 0.010, and 0.544, 0.260, and 0.030, respectively. The 4 TRT groups were then sub-divided into 2 POH holding time (HT) groups, with 15 birds randomly allocated to each of 6 replicate pens in each of the 8 groups. The first HT group (0HT) had immediate access to water and feed, and the second HT group (24HT) contained birds that were kept in transport baskets for 24 h before being released. Performance was determined and selected birds were subsequently necropsied and their tibiae extracted for analysis. In comparison to birds from 24HT group, those in the 0HT group had a higher BW gain and feed intake, and a lower FCR through 21 d POH. The percentage of bone ash of the birds belonging to the HMD group was higher than all other TRT on d 1 POH and was higher than the non-injection control group on d 21 POH. On d 1, the LMD and HMD groups had higher tibial Mn concentrations than those of the control groups. On d 7, bones from the HMD group had a higher concentration of Mn than did the non-injected control group, and likewise, on d 21 POH, had a higher concentration of Zn than did the control groups. In conclusion, a 24HT negatively affected the performance of the birds during the first 2 wk POH; however, the LMD and HMD TRT had a positive influence on bone mineralization.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000363708400012	26450915

J	Weathers, Danny; Swain, Scott D.; Grover, Varun								Can online product reviews be more helpful? Examining characteristics of information content by product type								DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS				79				12	23		10.1016/j.dss.2015.07.009			NOV 2015	2015	Many online retailers and other product-oriented websites allow people to post product reviews for use by shoppers. While research indicates that these reviews influence consumers' shopping attitudes and behaviors, questions remain about how consumers evaluate the product reviews themselves. With the current research, we introduce a new methodology for identifying the review factors that shoppers use to evaluate review helpfulness, and we integrate prior literature to provide a framework that explains how these factors reflect readers' general concerns about the diagnosticity (uncertainty and equivocality) and credibility (trust and expertise) of electronic word-of-mouth. Based on this framework, we offer predictions about how the relative importance of diagnosticity and credibility should vary systematically across search and experience product types. By analyzing secondary data consisting of over 8000 helpfulness ratings from product reviews posted by shoppers on Amazon.com, we find that, while review content affects helpfulness in complex ways, these effects are well explained by the proposed framework. Interestingly, the data suggest that review writers who explicitly attempt to enhance review diagnosticity or credibility are often ineffective or systematically unhelpful. Our findings have implications for both IS developers and retailers for designing online decision support systems to optimize communication practices and better manage consumer-generated content and interactions among consumers.

The LAU is a multiinput, multioutput, overactuated, nonlinear, dynamic system and is part of a 7.5-MW wind turbine nacelle test bench. First, a plant model of the system is developed. Second, a sliding mode control strategy is developed. This control strategy uses a pseudoinverse of the input influence matrix to account for the system being overactuated. The resulting reference signals are inputs to a sliding controller responsible for controlling the system's 24 hydraulic actuators. The results show that the proposed control strategy performs well and that the LAU may be suitable for replicating full-scale time-varying wind loads on the main shaft of a test nacelle. Also discussed are key areas for improvement and future research directions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6536	1558-0865		WOS:000363253300011

We consider how political attitudes and environmental concern influence the relationship between gender and ERBs. Ordinary least squares regression models were estimated using the 1994 and 2010 General Social Survey. The study results indicate that women had higher levels of private ERBs than men in 1994 and 2010. Political ideology and environmental concern partially explain gender differences in private ERBs in 1994 and fully explain them in 2010. Men and women have similar levels of public ERBs in 1994; in 2010, men's level of public ERBs is significantly higher than women's, after controlling for political ideology and environmental concern. In addition, there are some gender differences in the effects of political orientation and environmental concern on ERBs. Our study indicates that the relationship between gender and environmentalism is complex and that concern and political orientation should be considered when designing strategies to enhance ERBs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-0245	1475-682X		WOS:000363463400001

A bipartition pi = {S, V \ S} is called very cost effective if both S and V \ S are very cost effective sets. Not all graphs have a very cost effective bipartition, for example, the complete graphs of odd order do not. We characterize the cactus graphs having a very cost effective bipartition. Also, we show that if a graph G or H has a very cost effective bipartition, then so does the Cartesian product G square H.

Using data from 11 Midwestern U.S. counties, this study (1) found a maximally parsimonious 20-item SUS-TAS that facilitates data collection efficiency without compromising the psychometrical properties, (2) verified SUS-TAS's predictive validity as in predicting residents' intention to engage in tourism planning at different levels, and (3) suggested that SUS-TAS is best interpreted by seven separate dimensions rather than a global factor.

A High Spatiotemporal Assessment of Consumptive Water Use and Water Scarcity in the Conterminous United States								WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT				29	14			5185	5200		10.1007/s11269-015-1112-x			NOV 2015	2015	There is an inextricable link between energy production and food/feed/fiber cultivation with available water resources. Currently in the United States, agriculture represents the largest sector of consumptive water use making up 80.7 % of the total. Electricity generation in the U.S. is projected to increase by 24 % in the next two decades and globally, the production of liquid transportation fuels are forecasted to triple over the next 25-years, having significant impacts on the import/export market and global economies. The tension between local water supply and demand across water use sectors needs to be evaluated with regards to risk evaluation and planning. To this end, we present a systematic method to spatially and temporally disaggregate nationally available 5-year county-scale water use data to a monthly 1/8A degrees scale. Our study suggests that while 81.9 % of the U.S. exhibits unstressed local conditions at the annual scale, 13.7 % is considered water scarce; this value increases to 17.3 % in the summer months. The use of mean annual water scarcity at a coarser basin scale (similar to 373,000 ha) was found to mask information critical for water planning whereas finer spatiotemporal scales revealed local areas that are water stressed or water scarce. Nationally, similar to 1 % of these "unstressed" basins actually contained water stressed or water scarce areas equivalent to at least 30 % and 17 %, respectively, of the basin area. These percentages increase to 34 % and 48 % in the summer months. Additionally, 15 % of basins classified as "unstressed" contained water scarce areas in excess of 10 % during the summer.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0920-4741	1573-1650		WOS:000362422100017

The main objective of this study was to examine the leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved nitrogen (DN), and selected inorganic constituents from scrap tires. Different sizes of tire chips and crumb rubber were exposed to leaching solutions with pH's ranging from 3.0 to 10.0 for 28 days. The leaching of DOC and DN were found to be higher for smaller size tire chips; however, the leaching of inorganic constituents was independent of the size. In general, basic pH conditions increased the leaching of DOC and DN, whereas acidic pH conditions led to elevated concentrations of metals. Leaching was minimal around the neutral pH values for all the monitored parameters. Analysis of the leaching rates showed that components associated with the rubbery portion of the tires (DOC, DN, zinc, calcium, magnesium, etc.) exhibited an initial rapid followed by a slow release. On the other hand, a constant rate of leaching was observed for iron and manganese, which are attributed to the metal wires present inside the tires. Although the total amounts that leached varied, the observed leaching rates were similar for all tire chip sizes and leaching solutions.

One such material, saltstone, includes slag, fly ash and Portland cement to enhance the immobilization of contaminants (e.g., Cr, Tc-99) in alkaline liquid wastes. To evaluate the stability of such redox sensitive contaminants in saltstone, the effects of slag as a source of reductant on Cr immobilization was evaluated in aged (<300 d) saltstone monoliths. Specifically, we investigated the effects of artificial cement pore waters on the Cr release and the spatially resolved Cr chemical state analysis using synchrotron based microfocused X-ray microprobe analysis. The microprobe analysis indicated the heterogeneous distribution of insoluble Cr(III)-species in saltstone. Although at most of 20% Cr-total was leached at the top few (2-3) millimeter depth, the release of Cr(VI) was small (<5%) at 5-30 mm with slight changes, indirectly suggesting that Cr is likely present as insoluble Cr(III) species throughout the depths. The study suggests that this saltstone formulation can effectively retain/immobilize Cr under the oxic field condition after <= 300 d of aging time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Directed-assembly of carbon structures in a nonpolar dielectric liquid under the influence of DC-generated electric fields								CARBON				93				32	38		10.1016/j.carbon.2015.05.026			NOV 2015	2015	Externally applied direct current (DC) electric fields have been examined as a means of controllable organization of carbon structures (one-dimensional multi-walled carbon nanotubes of three sizes, quasi two-dimensional exfoliated graphene platelets, and three-dimensional bulk graphite) suspended in a high dielectric strength (i.e., highly resistive) solvent (perfluorocarbon FC-40). The net particle charge of the carbon structures in FC-40 was negligible. This eliminates non-dielectrophoretic (DEP) kinetic motions and allows for examination of isolated DEP forces on the assembly process. At a sufficiently high DC field strength and carbon structure concentration, DEP directed assembly and subsequent formation of electrically conductive networks were observed. The influences of particle size, aspect ratio, concentration, and structure on the assembly and electrical conduction in this system were investigated. Threshold voltage, an operationally defined measure of the applied voltage where current flow first occurred, was used as a characteristic measure of the assembly process. Consistent with charge percolation theory, the threshold voltage was found to be inversely related to the particle concentration and directly proportional to particle size as measured by light scattering. Accordingly, we developed an agglomeration model that accounts for the influence of particle size on the threshold voltage.

A three-year field study was conducted in South Carolina with the purpose of examining the population dynamics and spatial distribution patterns of CLN as influenced by soil texture, the presence of Rotylenchulus reniformis, reniform nematode (RN), and a cotton-corn-soybean rotation scheme. Four plots with different soil textures inferred by soil electrical conductivity were sampled at plant and at harvest for each crop. Population densities of CLN were aggregated and the host plant did not affect the pattern of spatial distribution. Columbia lance nematode and RN were found in spatially distinct areas in the field influenced by differences in soil texture. Columbia lance nematode was mainly found in areas with high sand content (above 75%) and RN in areas with 60-65% sand content. Therefore, depending on the sand content, whenever there are concomitant infestations of CLN and RN in a field, only one species is likely to be the key pest. Knowledge of the distribution patterns of CLN is essential for selecting sampling strategies and for site-specific management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The thermal behaviour and non-uniform heat distribution at the local weld area were investigated. The effect of heat generation on precipitates dissolution and natural aging of Al6111-T4 was studied. The maximum hardness in TMAZ was 10-15Hv higher than natural aging which is because of higher rate of precipitation due to reduction in grain/subgrain size. The performance of soft hot-dipped DX56-Z and hard galvannealed DX53-ZF zinc coated steels was discussed in terms of mechanical properties and joinability, in comparison with uncoated steel. The highest peak load (3.25 kN) and fracture energy (similar to 5 kN mm) was reached in the case of aluminium to hot dipped DX56-Z zinc coated steel joints owing to the maximum ductility. In contrast, in aluminium to galvannealed DX53-ZF zinc coated steel joints failure was promoted earlier with low mechanical properties of 2.6 kN shear strength and 1.25 kN mm fracture energy as a result of damage to the zinc layer. Formation of brittle Al-Fe intermetallic layer at the interface of aluminium to bare steel was the main effect of reduction in similar to 3.0 kN lap shear strength at the maxima. Surface damage due to sonotrode welding tip penetration was seen to be more severe in aluminium to bare DC04 steel compared to other weld combinations that resulted strength loss when the thickness of the weld nugget is reduced at the optimum condition.

J	Liu, Jianbin; Liu, Mengya; He, Congcong; Song, Huanlu; Chen, Feng								Effect of thermal treatment on the flavor generation from Maillard reaction of xylose and chicken peptide								LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				64	1			316	325		10.1016/j.lwt.2015.05.061			NOV 2015	2015	In this research, effect of the thermal treatment on the flavor generation from Maillard reaction of xylose and chicken peptide was studied. In summary, high temperature (>100 degrees C) could remarkably increase the formation of meaty aroma generated by xylose and chicken peptide through a Maillard reaction system, while lower temperature and longer heating tended to generate a broth-like taste (i.e., umami and kokumi). Pyrazines were the major contributors to the nutty/roast and basic meaty aroma in the Maillard reaction products (MRP), while the Glu released under the low temperature heating was considered an important contributor to the umami taste of MRPs. The low molecular weight peptide (<500 Da) was considered as the main contributor of the generation of pyrazines and 2-furfurylpyrrole, which could be due to the high reaction activity of the amidogen in these compounds. In addition, cross-linking compounds with molecular weight >1000 Da formed from peptides <500 Da in the low temperature heating might be involved in formation of important kokumi-active compounds, while the high molecular compounds MRPs >3000 Da were very likely responsible for the bitter taste.

Infection occurs through the binding formed by viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin and certain types of glycan receptors on host cell membranes. Studies have shown that the alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid motif (SA2,3Gal) in avian, equine, and canine species; the alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid motif (SA2,6Gal) in humans; and SA2,3Gal and SA2,6Gal in swine are responsible for the corresponding host tropisms. However, more detailed and refined substructures that determine host tropisms are still not clear. Thus, in this study, we applied association mining on a set of glycan microarray data for 211 influenza viruses from five host groups: humans, swine, canine, migratory waterfowl, and terrestrial birds. The results suggest that besides Neu5Ac alpha 2-6Gal beta, human-origin viruses could bind glycans with Neu5Ac alpha 2-8Neu5Ac alpha 2-8Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc substructures; Gal beta and GlcNAc beta terminal substructures, without sialic acid branches, were associated with the binding of human-, swine-, and avian-origin viruses; sulfated Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 substructures were associated with the binding of human- and swine-origin viruses. Finally, through three-dimensional structure characterization, we revealed that the role of glycan chain shapes is more important than that of torsion angles or of overall structural similarities in virus host tropisms.									0	0	0	1	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000363526200001	26508590

Developing expressed sequence tag libraries and the discovery of simple sequence repeat markers for two species of raspberry (Rubus L.)								BMC PLANT BIOLOGY				15						258	10.1186/s12870-015-0629-8			OCT 26 2015	2015	Background: Due to a relatively high level of codominant inheritance and transferability within and among taxonomic groups, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are important elements in comparative mapping and delineation of genomic regions associated with traits of economic importance. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are a source of SSRs that can be used to develop markers to facilitate plant breeding and for more basic research across genera and higher plant orders.Methods: Leaf and meristem tissue from 'Heritage' red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and 'Bristol' black raspberry (R. occidentalis) were utilized for RNA extraction. After conversion to cDNA and library construction, ESTs were sequenced, quality verified, assembled and scanned for SSRs. Primers flanking the SSRs were designed and a subset tested for amplification, polymorphism and transferability across species. ESTs containing SSRs were functionally annotated using the GenBank non-redundant (nr) database and further classified using the gene ontology database.Results: To accelerate development of EST-SSRs in the genus Rubus (Rosaceae), 1149 and 2358 cDNA sequences were generated from red raspberry and black raspberry, respectively. The cDNA sequences were screened using rigorous filtering criteria which resulted in the identification of 121 and 257 SSR loci for red and black raspberry, respectively. Primers were designed from the surrounding sequences resulting in 131 and 288 primer pairs, respectively, as some sequences contained more than one SSR locus. Sequence analysis revealed that the SSR-containing genes span a diversity of functions and share more sequence identity with strawberry genes than with other Rosaceous species.Conclusion: This resource of Rubus-specific, gene-derived markers will facilitate the construction of linkage maps composed of transferable markers for studying and manipulating important traits in this economically important genus.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1471-2229			WOS:000363289900002	26499487	
J	Osterberg, Jeffrey; Wang, Pingshan								Two-stage radio-frequency interferometer sensors								APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS				107	17					172907	10.1063/1.4934622			OCT 26 2015	2015	We show that simple radio-frequency (RF) interferometers can have slow-wave positive group delay (PGD) or negative group delay (NGD), as well as superluminal propagation (SP) regions, due to a destructive interference process. These properties are easily tunable, which makes RF interferometers unique among systems that have NGD and SP regimes. A two-stage interferometer arrangement, which includes a first stage interferometer in the material-under-test path of a second stage, has significantly improved sensitivity in comparison with a one-stage reference interferometer. With a power divider based first stage and at its maximum NGD frequency, the frequency sensitivity improvement is as high as 7 times. With a quadrature based first stage, the sensitivity is increased by as much as 20 times. Sensitivity improvements are also observed at PGD and SP frequency regions.

At 8 h after treatment (HAT), compared to the respective water-treated control, cellular metabolism of both biotypes were similarly perturbed by glyphosate, resulting in abundance of most metabolites including shikimic acid, amino acids, organic acids and sugars. However, by 80 HAT the metabolite pool of glyphosate-treated R-biotype was similar to that of the control S- and R-biotypes, indicating a potential physiological recovery. Furthermore, the glyphosate-treated R-biotype had lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, higher ROS scavenging activity, and higher levels of potential antioxidant compounds derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. Thus, metabolomics, in conjunction with biochemical assays, indicate that glyphosate-induced metabolic perturbations are not limited to the shikimate pathway, and the oxidant quenching efficiency could potentially complement the glyphosate resistance in this R-biotype.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000363438700027	26329798

We hypothesized that HIIT would result in similar improvements in body composition, cardiovascular fitness, blood lipids, and SI as compared to the MIT group, despite requiring only one hour of activity per week compared to five hours per week for the MIT group.Methods28 sedentary overweight or obese men (age, 20 +/- 1.5 years, body mass index 29.5 +/- 3.3 kg/m(2)) participated in a six week exercise treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to HIIT or MIT and evaluated at baseline and post-training. DXA was used to assess body composition, graded treadmill exercise test to measure cardiovascular fitness, oral glucose tolerance tomeasure SI, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess lipoprotein particles, and automatic auscultation tomeasure blood pressure.ResultsA greater improvement in VO2peak was observed in MIT compared to HIIT (11.1% vs 2.83%, P = 0.0185) in the complete-case analysis. No differences were seen in the intention to treat analysis, and no other group differences were observed. Both exercise conditions were associated with temporal improvements in% body fat, total cholesterol, medium VLDL, medium HDL, triglycerides, SI, and VO2peak (P < 0.05).Conclusion Participation in HIIT or MIT exercise training displayed: 1) improved SI, 2) reduced blood lipids, 3) decreased % body fat, and 4) improved cardiovascular fitness. While both exercise groups led to similar improvements for most cardiometabolic risk factors assessed, MIT led to a greater improvement in overall cardiovascular fitness. Overall, these observations suggest that a relatively short duration of either HIIT or MIT training may improve cardiometabolic risk factors in previously sedentary overweight or obese young men, with no clear advantage between these two specific regimes									6	0	0	3	0	6			1932-6203			WOS:000363248400012	26489022

Depending on the substructure of the DM halo of a galaxy cluster and the cross sections for DM annihilation channels, these signals might be detectable by the latest generation of gamma-ray telescopes. Here we use three years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope data, which are the most suitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. Our analysis reveals statistically significant extended emission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profile with a radius of 3 degrees that moreover is offset from the cluster center. We demonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends on the adopted interstellar emission model (IEM) and is most likely an artifact of our incomplete description of the IEM in this region. We also search for and find new point source candidates in the region. We then derive conservative upper limits on the velocity-averaged DM pair annihilation cross section from Virgo. We take into account the potential gamma-ray flux enhancement due to DM sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. For DM annihilating into b (b) over bar, assuming a conservative sub-halo model setup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above the expectation from the thermal cross section for m(DM) <= 100 GeV. In a more optimistic scenario, we exclude <sigma v > similar to 3 x 10(-26)cm(3)s(-1) for m(DM)less than or similar to 40 GeV for the same channel. Finally, we derive upper limits on the gamma-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-ray interactions in the inter cluster medium. We find that the volume-averaged cosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than similar to 6%.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000365206600071

It is demonstrated that the vast majority of frequently occurring mutations in the human population indeed alter the MBD folding free energy by a fraction of a kcal/mol up to more than 1 kcal/mol. While the absolute magnitude of the change of the free energy is small, the effect on the MBD functionality may be substantial since the folding free energy of MBD is about 2 kcal/mol only. Thus, it is emphasized that the effect of mutations on protein integrity should be evaluated with respect to the wild-type folding free energy but not with the absolute value of the folding free energy change. Furthermore, it was observed that the magnitude of the effect is correlated neither with the burial of the mutation sites nor with the basic amino acid physicochemical property change. Mutations that strongly perturb the immediate structural features were found to have little effect on folding free energy, while very conservative mutations resulted in large changes of the MBD stability. This observation was attributed to the protein's ability to structurally relax and reorganize to reduce the effect of mutation. Comparison between in silk and in vitro results indicated that some Web servers perform relatively well, while the free energy perturbation approach frequently overpredicts the magnitude of the free energy change especially when a charged amino acid is involved.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0006-2960			WOS:000363347600009	26418480

For brightly fluorescent carbon dots with optoelectronic polymers, a hybrid approach was developed to use pre-processed and selected carbon nanoparticles as precursor for surface passivation by poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) in one-pot thermochemical processing, thus taking advantage of the more controllable feature from the deliberate functionalization and also the versatility associated with the one-pot synthesis. The PVK-carbon dots were characterized by optical spectroscopy, microscopy, and other techniques. The broad applicability of the hybrid approach is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using X-ray nanotomography we studied morphological transformations of the surface of tungsten wires in a specially designed electrochemical cell where the wire is vertically submersed into the KOH electrolyte. It is shown that stability and uniformity of the probe span is supported by a porous shell growing at the surface of tungsten oxide and shielding the wire surface from flowing electrolyte. It is discovered that the kinetics of shell growth at the triple line, where meniscus meets the wire, is very different from that of the bulk of electrolyte. Many metals follow similar electrochemical transformations hence the discovered morphological transformations of metal surfaces are expected to play significant role in many natural and technological applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000362808300001	26469184	
J	Ji, Jie; Li, Man; Li, Kaiyuan; Yuan, Mengyuan; Sun, Jinhua				Li, Kaiyuan/L-6549-2016				Ambient wind effect on combustion characteristics in compartment with simultaneous door and window opened								ENERGY AND BUILDINGS				105				217	225		10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.07.046			OCT 15 2015	2015	The work in this paper is to clarify and quantify the effect of ambient wind on compartment fires. Under ambient wind conditions, a set of experiments were conducted in a compartment with a window and a door at the opposite walls. The effect of ambient wind on flame behavior, airflow characteristic, temperature distribution and mass loss rate (MLR) was investigated. Results show that at low wind velocities the air flows into the compartment from lower part of the door while hot gases and flame flow out from the window and upper part of the door. For the wind velocity being equal to the velocity at the transitional phase, the flame can no longer flow out of the window. At high wind velocities, the flame spilled out from the door. An optimistic opening distance is determined for a theoretical model from the literature predicting the critical velocity for opposing wind force with downward flow. Moreover to predict the MLR, the heat feedback is taken into account by involving the compartment temperature in a modified model with wind velocity and the make-up air at the door. Involving ambient wind and the make-up air at the door, a new characteristic length I is proposed using theoretical analysis, which is related to the amount of make-up air at the door. The characteristic length I can be used to estimate wind effects on fuel mass loss rate and it reflects that increasing the wind velocity would push the flame flowing out from the door and restrains the air entrainment at the door way thus reduces the MLR.

Factors affecting broadleaf woody vegetation in upland pine forests managed for longleaf pine restoration								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				354				130	138		10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.028			OCT 15 2015	2015	Controlling broadleaf woody plant abundance is one of the greatest challenges in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystem restoration. Numerous factors have been associated with broadleaf woody plant abundance in longleaf pine ecosystems, including site quality, stand structure, and fire frequency and intensity, yet the way in which these factors vary and interact across a landscape is poorly understood. The goal of this study was to quantify the importance of environmental and management factors and their interactions on the abundance of hardwood tree and shrub species in upland pine forests managed for longleaf pine restoration in Fort Benning, GA. We measured understory, midstory, and overstory vegetation in 189 fixed-area plots, and we assembled descriptive plot data about soil texture classes, slope and aspect, and fire management history. We used classification and regression trees to model broadleaf woody species abundance. Regression trees identified fire return interval, soil texture, and slope as the most important factors affecting understory woody plant cover, with high mean cover occurring in areas with longer fire return intervals (i.e. less frequent fire), on fine-textured soils (sandy clay barns and sandy loams), and on slopes less than 6%. An interaction between soil texture and fire return interval was present and suggested that frequent fire was especially important in controlling understory broadleaf woody plants on fine-textured soils. A significant interaction emerged between soil texture and pine basal area as well, suggesting that the potential to release woody competitors with canopy removal was higher on fine-textured soils than on coarse-textured soils. The presence of hardwood stems in the midstory was most dependent upon time since burn. Other factors, such as the number of burns conducted during the growing season and topographic aspect, did not contribute significantly to variation in woody plant cover or density. Of the woody species encountered, sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) was the most abundant, especially on plots with fire return intervals >= 2.6 years, on fine-textured soils, and at low pine basal areas (<9.4 m(2)/ha). Other species such as persimmon (Diospyros virginiana L.), winged sumac (Rhus copallinum L.), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata Michx.) were commonly encountered but at low densities. Our results demonstrate the general complexity of woody species control, but more importantly indicate site differences that could be used to prioritize prescribed fire application at the landscape scale.

This report highlights the synthesis of novel biodegradable iodinated poly(epsilon-caprolactone) copolymers by oxime Click ligation reactions. A series of ketone-bearing materials are built by tin (II)-mediated ring-opening polymerization followed by a postpolymerization deprotection step. The intended X-ray opacity is imparted through acid-catalyzed oxime postpolymerization modification of the resultant polymers with an iodinated hydroxylamine. All small molecules and polymeric materials are characterized using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for purity, functional group stoichiometry, and number-averaged molecular weight calculations. Additionally, the polymers are evaluated with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to determine polymer sample polydispersity and general molecular weight distribution shapes and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for thermal properties.

Despite reduction in total emissions through implementation of best available techniques (BATs), industrial waste generators still need guidance to minimize environmental impacts of manufacturing processes. The metal industry remains one of the most important waste generating sector and therefore, this study focused on one specific process, iron casting and used a life-cycle approach (LCA) to evaluate the performance and cross-media effects of the BATs applicable for this industry.A streamlined LCA (raw material transformation to production of ductile iron casting piece) was performed to evaluate the impact of eleven BATs. The life cycle inventory was created using industrial average data for European iron casting industry from the literature. The avoided burdens originating from reduced raw material consumption and reuse of process residues were considered. Since economic factors largely influence methods to be implemented, the most preferable strategies towards cleaner production in iron foundries was determined using a combination of achieved benefits, environmental impacts and cost of implementation.Among the techniques evaluated, on-site recovery and external reuse of waste sand were capable of decreasing overall environmental impact of casting by 60-90%. Additionally, these techniques created revenues and savings for the manufacturers, which lead to the possibility of a step-wise implementation scheme to reduce financial burden of cleaner production programs in foundries. Overall environmental and economic evaluation suggested that planning towards cleaner production should adopt a holistic approach rather than being restricted to waste hierarchy principle.

A new multimodal membrane adsorber for monoclonal antibody purifications								JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE				492				137	146		10.1016/j.memsci.2015.05.013			OCT 15 2015	2015	This contribution describes research on the use of a newly developed multimoclal membrane (MMM) adsorber that can be used as a chromatographic stationary phase in bioseparation processes. Compared with commercial cationic multimodal adsorbers, this MMM has superior static binding capacity (SBC=180 mg IgG/ml), dynamic binding capacity (DBC10%=60 mg IgG/m1), and load productivity ( > 10 mg/ml/min). Furthermore, the incorporation of functional groups that provide orthogonal modes of interactions increases the range of ionic strength for operation of the MMM relative to conventional ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography media. The effects of different salt types (kosmotropic, neutral, chaotropic salts) and ionic strength on IgG binding were investigated. To further understand the protein adsorption on the MMM, a thermodynamic model was employed to describe lgG adsorption isotherms on the MMM by providing a unique set of physically meaningful parameters for each salt type. The model was also a precise predictor of the adsorption isotherms under non-test conditions. A breakthrough analysis was used to determine dynamic binding capacities. The MMM maintained 70% DBC as ionic strength increased from 0 to 300 mM NaCl. Finally, a range of flow rates was used to study the effect of volumetric throughput on DBC. Because DBC was insensitive to flow rate, process productivity increased with flow rate nearly linearly up to high linear velocity (535 cm/h). A kinetic study indicated that the rate limiting step of IgG binding on the MMM was the adsorption rate, not the convective mass transport of protein molecules to binding sites.

We used 24 parent and progeny trees - representing Pc susceptible, European and American chestnut (C. dentata), and Pc resistant, Japanese and Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima), species and some of their inter-species hybrids - to evaluate the EST-SSR markers' polymorphism and transferability rates within and among species, respectively. The set of EST-SSR markers showed a remarkably high interspecific transferability rate among the four Castanea species tested, ranging from 90.7% for Chinese chestnut and 100% for European chestnut. Only three EST-SSR markers were monomorphic (7%) and the average value of expected heterozygosity was 0.61, higher than that in other studies using EST-SSRs in chestnut.The novel EST-SSR markers developed and characterized here are useful for constructing genetic linkage maps, conducting QTL analyses of phenotypic traits, genotype-phenotype association studies (especially in relation of resistance to Pc), high-throughput genotyping for clonal identification or marker-assisted selection, and comparative genomics.

J	Baldwin, Robert F.; Leonard, Paul B.								Interacting Social and Environmental Predictors for the Spatial Distribution of Conservation Lands								PLOS ONE				10	10					e0140540	10.1371/journal.pone.0140540			OCT 14 2015	2015	Conservation decisions should be evaluated for how they meet conservation goals at multiple spatial extents. Conservation easements are land use decisions resulting from a combination of social and environmental conditions. An emerging area of research is the evaluation of spatial distribution of easements and their spatial correlates. We tested the relative influence of interacting social and environmental variables on the spatial distribution of conservation easements by ownership category and conservation status. For the Appalachian region of the United States, an area with a long history of human occupation and complex land uses including public-private conservation, we found that settlement, economic, topographic, and environmental data associated with spatial distribution of easements (N = 4813). Compared to random locations, easements were more likely to be found in lower elevations, in areas of greater agricultural productivity, farther from public protected areas, and nearer other human features. Analysis of ownership and conservation status revealed sources of variation, with important differences between local and state government ownerships relative to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and among U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) GAP program status levels. NGOs were more likely to have easements nearer protected areas, and higher conservation status, while local governments held easements closer to settlement, and on lands of greater agricultural potential. Logistic interactions revealed environmental variables having effects modified by social correlates, and the strongest predictors overall were social (distance to urban area, median household income, housing density, distance to land trust office). Spatial distribution of conservation lands may be affected by geographic area of influence of conservation groups, suggesting that multi-scale conservation planning strategies may be necessary to satisfy local and regional needs for reserve networks. Our results support previous findings and provide an ecoregion-scale view that conservation easements may provide, at local scales, conservation functions on productive, more developable lands. Conservation easements may complement functions of public protected areas but more research should examine relative landscape-level ecological functions of both forms of protection.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000363183100139	26465155

TIGER2 with solvent energy averaging (TIGER2A): An accelerated sampling method for large molecular systems with explicit representation of solvent								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				143	14					144105	10.1063/1.4932341			OCT 14 2015	2015	The recently developed "temperature intervals with global exchange of replicas" (TIGER2) accelerated sampling method is found to have inaccuracies when applied to systems with explicit solvation. This inaccuracy is due to the energy fluctuations of the solvent, which cause the sampling method to be less sensitive to the energy fluctuations of the solute. In the present work, the problem of the TIGER2 method is addressed in detail and a modification to the sampling method is introduced to correct this problem. The modified method is called "TIGER2 with solvent energy averaging," or TIGER2A. This new method overcomes the sampling problem with the TIGER2 algorithm and is able to closely approximate Boltzmann-weighted sampling of molecular systems with explicit solvation. The difference in performance between the TIGER2 and TIGER2A methods is demonstrated by comparing them against analytical results for simple one-dimensional models, against replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations for sampling the conformation of alanine dipeptide and the folding behavior of (AAQAA)(3) peptide in aqueous solution, and by comparing their performance in sampling the behavior of hen egg-white lysozyme in aqueous solution. The new TIGER2A method solves the problem caused by solvent energy fluctuations in TIGER2 while maintaining the two important characteristics of TIGER2, i.e., (1) using multiple replicas sampled at different temperature levels to help systems efficiently escape from local potential energy minima and (2) enabling the number of replicas used for a simulation to be independent of the size of the molecular system, thus providing an accelerated sampling method that can be used to efficiently sample systems considered too large for the application of conventional temperature REMD.

We developed biodegradable functional nanoparticles comprised of poly(D,L-lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ethyleneimine) (PDLLA-PEG-PEI) block co-polymers that capture these VOCs by chemical reaction. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) preparation involved nanoprecipitation and surface functionalization with branched PEI. The PDLLA-PEG-PEI NPs were characterized by using TGA, IR, H-1 NMR, elemental analysis, and TEM. The materials feature 1 degrees, 2 degrees, and 3 degrees amines on their surface, capable of capturing aldehydes and carboxylic acids from gaseous mixtures. Aldehydes were captured by a condensation reaction forming imines, whereas carboxylic acids were captured by acid/base reaction. These materials reacted selectively with target contaminants obviating off-target binding when challenged by other VOCs with orthogonal reactivity. The NPs outperformed conventional activated carbon sorbents.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000363331900025	26331393

In an inversion-symmetry-breaking Weyl semimetal the left and the right handed Weyl points can occur at different energies and the energy mismatch between the Weyl points of opposite chirality is known as the chiral chemical potential. In the presence of the chiral chemical potential, the nontrivial Berry curvature of the Weyl fermions gives rise to the dynamic chiral magnetic effect. This describes how a time-dependent magnetic field leads to an electrical current along the applied field direction, which is also proportional to the field strength. We derive a general formula for the dynamic chiral magnetic conductivity of the inversion-symmetry-breaking Weyl semimetal. We show that the measurement of the natural optical activity or rotary power provides a direct confirmation of the existence of the dynamic chiral magnetic effect in inversion-symmetry-breaking Weyl semimetals.									7	0	0	0	0	7			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000362891800003

This system transformed a temporal image sequence to a spatial one so that multiple images could be acquired during one exposure period. The improvement factor of the frame rate was dependent on the number of sub-images that could be tiled on the sensor without overlapping each other and was therefore a trade-off with the image size. As a demonstration, we achieved 960 frames/s (fps) on a CCD camera that was originally capable of recording images at only 30 fps (full frame). This allowed us to observe millisecond or sub-millisecond events with ordinary CCD cameras.

In a subset of the experiments, the CDW has been found to be accompanied by a d-wave intra-unit-cell form factor, indicating modulation of charge density on the oxygen orbitals sandwiched between neighboring Cu atoms on the CuO planes [the so-called bond density wave (BDW) phase]. Here we take a mean field Q(1) = (2 pi/3,0) and Q(2) = (0,2 pi/3) bidirectional BDW phase with a d-wave form factor, which closely resembles the experimentally observed charge ordered states in underdoped cuprates, and we calculate the Fermi surface topology and the resulting quasiparticle Nernst coefficient as a function of temperature and doping. We establish that, in the appropriate doping ranges where the low-temperature phase (in the absence of superconductivity) is a BDW, the Fermi surface consists of electron and hole pockets, resulting in a low-temperature negative Nernst coefficient as observed in experiments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000362493400003

These are proposed as a new paradigm in the field of biological materials science as they can serve as a toolbox for rationalizing the complex mechanical behavior of structural biological materials and for systematizing the development of bioinspired designs for structural applications. They are employed to improve the mechanical properties, namely strength, wear resistance, stiffness, flexibility, fracture toughness, and energy absorption of different biological materials for a variety of functions (e.g., body support, joint movement, impact protection, weight reduction). The structural elements identified are: fibrous, helical, gradient, layered, tubular, cellular, suture, and overlapping. For each of the structural design elements, critical design parameters are presented along with constitutive equations with a focus on mechanical properties. Additionally, example organisms from varying biological classes are presented for each case to display the wide variety of environments where each of these elements is present.

The entropic gain upon such pattern formation due to difference in chain lengths and/or bulkiness has been proposed as the driving force in literature. Using atomistic discrete molecular dynamics simulations it is shown that stripe-like pattern could indeed emerge, but only for a subset of binary SAM systems. In addition to entropic contributions, the formation of a striped pattern also strongly depends upon interligand interactions governed by the physicochemical properties of the ligand constituents. Due to the interplay between entropy and enthalpy, a binary SAM system can be categorized into three different types depending on whether and under what condition a striped pattern can emerge. The results help clarify the ongoing debate and our proposed principle can aid in the engineering of novel binary SAMs on a NP surface.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000362819400012	26191774

Anticipatory Life Cycle Analysis of In Vitro Biomass Cultivation for Cultured Meat Production in the United States								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				49	19			11941	11949		10.1021/acs.est.5b01614			OCT 6 2015	2015	Cultured, or in vitro, meat consists of edible biomass grown from animal stem cells in a factory, or carnery. In the coming decades, in vitro biomass cultivation could enable the production of meat without the need to raise livestock. Using an anticipatory life cycle analysis framework, the study described herein examines the environmental implications of this emerging technology and compares the results with published impacts of beef, pork, poultry, and another speculative analysis of cultured biomass. While uncertainty ranges are large, the findings suggest that in vitro biomass cultivation could require smaller quantities of agricultural inputs and land than livestock; however, those benefits could come at the expense of more intensive energy use as biological functions such as digestion and nutrient circulation are replaced by industrial equivalents.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible (UV vis), diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (DR-UV-vis) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize and follow the synthesis of the cobalt (II) Salen complex The UV vis absorption spectra confirmed the formation of the Salen ligand and its coordination with the Co (II). FTIR spectra showed the incorporation of the Co Salen complex and its anchoring to the support was confirmed by DR-UV-vis. The catalytic activity was evaluated measuring the oxidation of phenol by air in a buffer solution using micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). The effects of support, initial substrate concentration, pH, oxidant (O-2 vs H2O2) and temperature were investigated. The best catalytic performance was obtained when the Co Salen complex was immobilized on SBA-15 (Co Salen/SBA-15). Conversely, the results suggest that the activated carbon promoted the irreversible adsorption of the substrate. The Co Salen support was also characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to elucidate the morphology. Elemental analysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) exhibited better Co Salen dispersion on the SiO2 and SBA-15 supports. The cobalt loading calculated from atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was 0.22, 0.20, 0.14 and 0.09 mmol/g for the Co Salen supported on SiO2, SBA-15, Al2O3 and C, respectively. A specific surface area of 736.13 m(2)/g and a nanoporosity of 3.62 nm were obtained for SBA-15 using N-2 physisorption analysis; this high specific surface area is characteristic of SBA-15 and plays a critical role in the reported activity. According to these results and the corresponding data analysis, the catalyst promoted the oxidation of phenol with a reversible first-order kinetic reaction in air, as observed from the data obtained at 3 different temperatures (25,38 and 50 degrees C). These results enabled the calculation of activation energy values of 63 and 57 kJ/mol. In addition, the Co Salen/SBA-15 showed very good selectivity toward the production of catechol, which is one of the most important precursors in the chemical industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These resources enable comparative genomics analyses relative to model plants. We assessed the degree of conservation between the chestnut genome and other well annotated and assembled plant genomic sequences, focusing on the QTL regions of most interest to the chestnut breeding community.Results: The integrated physical and genetic map of Chinese chestnut has been improved to now include 858 shared sequence-based markers. The utility of the integrated map has also been improved through the addition of 42,970 BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) end sequences spanning over 26 million bases of the estimated 800 Mb chestnut genome. Synteny between chestnut and ten model plant species was conducted on a macro-syntenic scale using sequences from both individual probes and BAC end sequences across the chestnut physical map. Blocks of synteny with chestnut were found in all ten reference species, with the percent of the chestnut physical map that could be aligned ranging from 10 to 39 %.The integrated genetic and physical map was utilized to identify BACs that spanned the three previously identified QTL regions conferring blight resistance. The clones were pooled and sequenced, yielding 396 sequence scaffolds covering 13.9 Mbp. Comparative genomic analysis on a microsytenic scale, using the QTL-associated genomic sequence, identified synteny from chestnut to other plant genomes ranging from 5.4 to 12.9 % of the genome sequences aligning.Conclusions: On both the macro-and micro-synteny levels, the peach, grape and poplar genomes were found to be the most structurally conserved with chestnut. Interestingly, these results did not strictly follow the expectation that decreased phylogenetic distance would correspond to increased levels of genome preservation, but rather suggest the additional influence of life-history traits on preservation of synteny. The regions of synteny that were detected provide an important tool for defining and cataloging genes in the QTL regions for advancing chestnut blight resistance research.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1471-2164			WOS:000362253000005	26438416

As these symptoms often hinder a woman's successful functioning in everyday life, hormone therapy is commonly prescribed as a means to diminish symptoms. Many women, however, are seeking complementary and alternative treatments due to side effects and/or detrimental health-risks associated with conventional therapies. We completed a mixed methods study to determine changes in physiological symptoms associated with menopause and changes in women's quality of life, as a result of participation in a 10-week yoga intervention.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0739-9332	1096-4665		WOS:000361983000005	26155717

Despite this concern, there are multiple different viewpoints on the current state of environmental issues and how to understand these problems. Understanding how different communities conceive of the environment and sustainability is paramount in efforts to increase the frequency of environmentally conscious choices. If an awareness of others' perspectives of the environment is lacking, then the development of sustainable choices is placed at risk because of potentially competing views of what sustainability means in a particular context. As such, solutions to these environmental problems are frequently viewed as 'wicked problems.' This study investigates the shared and divergent environmental viewpoints of teachers and community members in Kenya. This study utilized photo-methodologies and qualitative in vivo analysis. The shared viewpoints were on positive and negative notions of environmental issues. The divergent viewpoints were on solutions that included types of innovations and amount of government involvement.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1350-4622	1469-5871		WOS:000360824600007

Sequence composition of BAC clones and SSR markers mapped to Upland cotton chromosomes 11 and 21 targeting resistance to soil-borne pathogens								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				6						791	10.3389/fpls.2015.00791			OCT 2 2015	2015	Genetic and physical framework mapping in cotton (Gossypium spp.) were used to discover putative gene sequences involved in resistance to common soil-borne pathogens. Chromosome (Chr) 11 and its homoeologous Chr 21 of Upland cotton (G. hirsutum) are foci for discovery of resistance (R) or pathogen induced R (PR) genes underlying QTLs involved in response to root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita), reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis), Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum), Verticillium wilt (Verticillium dahliae), and black root rot (Thielaviopsis basicola). Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAG) clones from a BAG library developed from the Upland cotton Acala Maxxa were mapped on Chr 11 and Chr 21. DNA sequence through Gene Ontology (GO) of 99 of 256 Chr 11 and 109 of 239 Chr 21 previously mapped SSRs revealed response elements to internal and external stimulus, stress, signaling process, and cell death. The reconciliation between genetic and physical mapping of gene annotations from new DNA sequences of 20 BAG clones revealed 467 (Chr 11) and 285 (Chr 21) G. hirsutum putative coding sequences, plus 146 (Chr 11) and 98 (Chr 21) predicted genes. GO functional profiling of Unigenes uncovered genes involved in different metabolic functions and stress response elements (SRE). Our results revealed that Chrs 11 and 21 harbor resistance gene rich genomic regions. Sequence comparisons with the ancestral diploid D-5 (G, raimondii), A(2) (G. arboreum) and domesticated tetraploid TM-1 AD(1) (G. hirsutum) genomes revealed abundance of transposable elements and confirmed the richness of resistance gene motifs in these chromosomes. The sequence information of SSR markers and BAG clones and the genetic mapping of BAG clones provide enhanced genetic and physical frameworks of resistance gene rich regions of the cotton genome, thereby aiding discovery of R and PR genes and breeding for resistance to cotton diseases.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-462X			WOS:000362427300001	26483808

Batsch]								PLOS ONE				10	10					e0139406	10.1371/journal.pone.0139406			OCT 2 2015	2015	Low-cost, high throughput genotyping methods are crucial to marker discovery and marker-assisted breeding efforts, but have not been available for many 'specialty crops' such as fruit and nut trees. Here we apply the Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) method developed for cereals to the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a peach F-2 mapping population. Peach is a genetic and genomic model within the Rosaceae and will provide a template for the use of this method with other members of this family. Our F-2 mapping population of 57 genotypes segregates for bloom time (BD) and chilling requirement (CR) and we have extensively phenotyped this population. The population derives from a selfed F-1 progeny of a cross between 'Hakuho' (high CR) and 'UFGold' (low CR). We were able to successfully employ GBS and the TASSEL GBS pipeline without modification of the original methodology using the ApeKI restriction enzyme and multiplexing at an equivalent of 96 samples per Illumina HiSeq 2000 lane. We obtained hundreds of SNP markers which were then used to construct a genetic linkage map and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for BD and CR.									11	0	0	10	0	11			1932-6203			WOS:000362178700053	26430886

However, the benefit of small incisions has a drawback of limited visualization of subsurface tissues, which can lead to navigational challenges in the delivering of therapy. Image-guided surgery uses the images to map subsurface structures and can reduce the limitations of laparoscopic surgery. One particular laparoscopic camera system of interest is the vision system of the daVinci-Si robotic surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, California). The video streams generate approximately 360 MB of data per second, demonstrating a trend toward increased data sizes in medicine, primarily due to higher-resolution video cameras and imaging equipment. Processing this data on a bedside PC has become challenging and a high-performance computing (HPC) environment may not always be available at the point of care. To process this data on remote HPC clusters at the typical 30 frames per second (fps) rate, it is required that each 11.9 MB video frame be processed by a server and returned within 1/30th of a second. The ability to acquire, process, and visualize data in real time is essential for the performance of complex tasks as well as minimizing risk to the patient. As a result, utilizing high-speed networks to access computing clusters will lead to real-time medical image processing and improve surgical experiences by providing real-time augmented laparoscopic data. We have performed image processing algorithms on a high-definition head phantom video (1920 x 1080 pixels) and transferred the video using a message passing interface. The total transfer time is around 53 ms or 19 fps. We will optimize and parallelize these algorithms to reduce the total time to 30 ms.

Equatorial F region neutral winds and shears near sunset measured with chemical release techniques								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				120	10			9004	9013		10.1002/2015JA021462			OCT 2015	2015	The period near sunset is a dynamic and critical time for the daily development of the equatorial nighttime ionosphere and the instabilities that occur there. It is during these hours that the preconditions necessary for the later development of Equatorial Spread F (ESF) plasma instabilities occur. The neutral dynamics of the sunset ionosphere are also of critical importance to the generation of currents and electric fields; however, the behavior of the neutrals is experimentally understood primarily through very limited single-altitude measurements or measurements that provide weighted altitude means of the winds as a function of time. To date, there have been very few vertically resolved neutral wind measurements in the F region at sunset. We present two sets of sounding rocket chemical release measurements, one from a launch in the Marshall Islands on Kwajalein atoll and one from Alcantara, Brazil. Analysis of the release motions has yielded vertically resolved neutral wind profiles that show both the mean horizontal winds and the vertical shears in the winds. In both experiments, we observe significant vertical gradients in the zonal wind that are unexpected by classical assumptions about the behavior of the neutral wind at these altitudes at sunset near the geomagnetic equator.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000366135200060

An introduction to lightweight materials couples that of lightweight joining with a thermomechanical process, flow drill screwdriving (FDS). This process is favored in terms of robustness, short installation time, and only requiring access to one side. The current limitation with FDS occurs with the imposed 8.3 N.m maximum installation torque standardized for M5 self-tapping screws. Warm forming of aluminum has been shown to increase ductility and formability of the material, and thus a reduction in installation torque is sought after along with an expected decrease in process time. In this study, different preprocess material temperatures of Al6063-T5A are studied to determine the effect of material temperature on the process time, installation torque, and other joint measurables. As a result, with the thermal assistance, a reduction in the process time up to 52% and installation torque by 20% was attained. The increase in preprocess material temperature did not affect the hardness of the material outside of the minimal heat-affected zone, as the maximum preprocess material temperature did not exceed the tempering temperature.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1087-1357	1528-8935		WOS:000370851000020

However, efficient use of renewable energy is possible only with advances in both energy generation and storage. Today's batteries and capacitors, which are the main energy storage devices, cannot meet the world's demand for combined power and energy densities. To enhance the viability of such energy storing devices, the Clemson Nanomaterials Center (CNC) has developed a mix of scalable processes for carbon nanotube-based hybrid electrodes that show promise as a costeffective alternative to standard activated carbon-based electrodes. Working together with industrial partners, CNC has fabricated supercapacitors with energy and power densities in the range of similar to 11-35 Wh/kg and similar to 1.2-9 W/kg, respectively. Although this research development is transformative, further studies to optimize the separator and electrolyte technologies are needed to maximize both the energy and power density in a single device.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2191-9089	2191-9097		WOS:000364369000013

Impact of the blood meal on humoral immunity and microbiota in the gut of female Culicoides sonorensis								VETERINARIA ITALIANA				51	4			385	392					OCT-DEC 2015	2015	Although Culicoides sonorensis is an important vector of orbiviruses causing significant disease in domestic and wild ruminants in the US, little is known about factors contributing to midge vector competence. In other vectors such as mosquitoes, interactions among the humoral immune response, microbiota, and ingested pathogens within the vector gut directly impact pathogen survival and therefore vectoring potential. We recently described components of the humoral immune response in the reference transcriptome for adult female C. sonorensis and analysed their temporal expression profiles across several dietary states (unfed, blood, or sugar fed). Blood feeding altered the transcription of several humoral immune components of the Immune deficiency (Imd), dual-oxidase (DUOX), and Janus Kinase and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways. Genes for immune effectors, such as antimicrobial peptides, were in particular highly induced. Since blood feeding also stimulated proliferation and diversification of bacterial populations colonising the gut of female midges, we infer that changes in immune gene expression were a result of fluctuations in gut microbiota. Thus, diet can indirectly (via microbiota) impact gut immune status and therefore should be carefully considered in subsequent studies assessing vector competence in biting midges.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0505-401X	1828-1427		WOS:000368512300015	26741251

There are currently no mass-production sensors available to directly measure in-cylinder residual gas mass, so prediction models must be utilized for control. Residual gas content of the cylinder can be difficult to directly model for control purposes because it involves complex flows during gas exchange that are driven by fluctuating pressures in the intake and exhaust systems. Capturing these effects in an accurate manner generally requires high model complexity and computational effort outside of the capability of most production intent engine controllers. This paper presents a semi-physics-based control oriented residual gas mass (RGM) prediction method. The RGM model is based on Bernoulli's principle and considers engine operating conditions, valve timing and geometry, and piston motion effects. Moreover, to more accurately estimate the burned gas back flow, this model captures gas wave dynamic effects in intake and exhaust manifold pressures. The model is described in detail and its prediction accuracy is compared to that of a high fidelity simulation that utilizes experimentally measured crank angle resolved intake, exhaust, and cylinder pressures as boundary conditions. The new model is incorporated into a rapid-prototype control system for real-time operation during transient and steady-state engine operation. The results show that the proposed RGM model provides real-time predictions within 1.9-2.3% RGF, creating relative estimation errors in the range of 10-24%, and is capable of running real-time for engine control.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1468-0874	2041-3149		WOS:000361493000003		
J	Yebi, Adamu; Ayalew, Beshah								Partial Differential Equation-Based Process Control for Ultraviolet Curing of Thick Film Resins								JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				137	10					101010	10.1115/1.4030818			OCT 2015	2015	This paper proposes a feedback control system for curing thick film resins using ultraviolet (UV) radiation. A model-based distributed parameter control scheme is constructed for addressing the challenge of achieving through cure while reducing temperature gradients in thick films in composite laminates. The UV curing process is modeled with a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) that includes an in-domain radiative input along with a nonlinear spatial attenuation function. The control problem is first cast as a distributed temperature trajectory-tracking problem where only surface temperature measurements are available. By transforming the original process model to an equivalent boundary input problem, backstepping boundary PDE control designs are applied to explicitly obtain both the controller and the observer gain kernels. Offline optimization may be used to generate the desired temperature trajectory, considering quality constraints such as prespecified spatial gradients and UV source limitations. The workings and the performance of the proposed control scheme are illustrated through simulations of the process model. It is shown that feedforward compensation can be added to achieve improved tracking with the PDE controller in the presence of measurement noise and other process disturbances.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-0434	1528-9028		WOS:000368472500010

Disassembly line balancing is a technique that enables a product to be disassembled as efficiently and economically viable as possible; however, considering all possible end of life (EOL) states of a product makes disassembly line balancing very difficult. The EOL state and the possibility of multiple recovery options of a product can alter both disassembly tasks and task times for the disassembly of the EOL product. This paper shows how generating a joint precedence graph based on the different EOL states of a product is beneficial to achieving an optimal line balance where traditional line balancing approaches are used. We use a simple example of a pen from the literature to show how a joint disassembly precedence graph is created and a laptop example for joint precedence graph generation and balancing. We run multiple scenarios where the EOL conditions have different probabilities and compare results for the case of deterministic task times. We also consider the possibility where some disassembly task times are normally distributed and show how a stochastic joint precedence graph can be created and used in a stochastic line balancing formulation.

We measure these divisions using automated text analysis methods to scale the positions that legislators express in budget debates in an effort to avoid punishment by voters for supporting austerity measures while still adhering to strict party discipline by voting along party lines. Our test case is Ireland, a country that has experienced periods of rapid economic growth as well as one deep financial and economic crisis. Tracking dissent from 1987 to 2013, we show that austerity measures undermine government cohesion as verbal opposition markedly increases in direct response to the economic pain felt in a legislator's constituency. The economic vulnerability of a legislator's constituency also directly explains position taking on austerity budgets among both government and opposition.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3816	1468-2508		WOS:000367653500029		
J	Feliciano, David M.; Bordey, Angelique; Bonfanti, Luca								Noncanonical Sites of Adult Neurogenesis in the Mammalian Brain								COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN BIOLOGY				7	10					a018846	10.1101/cshperspect.a018846			OCT 2015	2015	Two decades after the discovery that neural stem cells (NSCs) populate some regions of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), deep knowledge has been accumulated on their capacity to generate new neurons in the adult brain. This constitutive adult neurogenesis occurs throughout life primarily within remnants of the embryonic germinal layers known as "neurogenic sites." Nevertheless, some processes of neurogliogenesis also occur in the CNS parenchyma commonly considered as "nonneurogenic." This "noncanonical" cell genesis has been the object of many claims, some of which turned out to be not true. Indeed, it is often an "incomplete" process as to its final outcome, heterogeneous by several measures, including regional location, progenitor identity, and fate of the progeny. These aspects also strictly depend on the animal species, suggesting that persistent neurogenic processes have uniquely adapted to the brain anatomy of different mammals. Where as some examples of noncanonical neurogenesis are strictly parenchymal, others also show stem cell niche-like features and a strong link with the ventricular cavities. This work will review results obtained in a research field that expanded from classic neurogenesis studies involving a variety of areas of the CNS outside of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ). It will be highlighted how knowledge concerning noncanonical neurogenic areas is still incomplete owing to its regional and species-specific heterogeneity, and to objective difficulties still hampering its full identification and characterization.									12	2	0	11	0	13			1943-0264			WOS:000367446000003	26384869

Cole								A Robust Sensor Covering and Communication Problem								NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS				62	7			582	594		10.1002/nav.21665			OCT 2015	2015	We consider the problem of placing sensors across some area of interest. The sensors must be placed so that they cover a fixed set of targets in the region, and should be deployed in a manner that allows sensors to communicate with one another. In particular, there exists a measure of communication effectiveness for each sensor pair, which is determined by a concave function of distance between the sensors. Complicating the sensor location problem are uncertainties related to sensor placement, for example, as caused by drifting due to air or water currents to which the sensors may be subjected. Our problem thus seeks to maximize a metric regarding intrasensor communication effectiveness, subject to the condition that all targets must be covered by some sensor, where sensor drift occurs according to a robust (worst-case) mechanism. We formulate an approximation approach and develop a cutting-plane algorithm to solve this problem, comparing the effectiveness of two different classes of inequalities.

J	Culin, Joseph; Finney, Michael								Incorporating Citizen Science into Monitoring Hemlock Following Predator Releases for Adelges tsugae (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) Management								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				50	4			335	349					OCT 2015	2015	A photograph-based monitoring system was developed to involve citizen scientists in monitoring sites in western North Carolina and northern Georgia where the predators Sasajiscymnus tsugae (Sasaji & McClure) and Laricobius nigrinus Fender had been released as part of the U.S. Forest Service's biological control program for Adelges tsugae Annand (hemlock woolly adelgid). The study was divided into an initial phase conducted during 2006 and 2007 in Jackson and Macon counties, NC, and Rabun County, GA, and a second phase conducted from 2008 to 2010 in Fannin, Gilmer, Lumpkin, and Union counties, GA. Over the course of the study, 32 volunteers monitored 27 predator release sites and provided 4,356 photographs from which data were obtained. Data from photographs included the number of A. tsugae ovisacs present at each sample site and hemlock needle loss on photographed branches. To ensure accuracy in counting A. tsugae and assessing hemlock needle loss, personnel from Clemson University's A. tsugae insectary evaluated each photograph for data collection. The citizen scientist volunteers participating in this study allowed us to obtain a large amount of quality data from across the wide geographic range of predator release sites. Obtaining that amount of data would not have been possible using only our laboratory personnel. This study shows that including dedicated and properly trained volunteers in large-scale forest surveys was an effective way to dramatically increase the amount of data we could obtain for use in assessing trends in both the numbers of A. tsugae present and hemlock needle loss at predator release sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0749-8004			WOS:000364107400007

Comparative allelopathic potentials of American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima)								ALLELOPATHY JOURNAL				36	2			303	314					OCT 2015	2015	We investigated the allelopathic potential of American and Chinese chestnut leaves on germination and seedling growth (radicle, plumule, length, dry weight) of dicotyledons (lettuce, radish and cucumber) and monocotyledons (onion, rice and wheat). The allelopathic intensity of water extracts of two chestnuts along with 11 eluting fractions (separated by X-5 macroporous resins) was compared. The most allelopathic fraction of the two water extracts was analyzed by standard substance counter evidence experiment. The water extract of Chinese chestnut leaf was more allelopathic than American chestnut leaf extracts, to inhibit the seed germination and seedling growth of cucumber, lettuce, onion, radish, rice and wheat. In bioassays, the 7:3, 6:4 and 5:5 elution fractions of both American chestnut and Chinese chestnut extracts contained allelochemicals, and the strongest allelopathic fraction (5:5) contained chlorogenic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, etc. The differences in chemical ecology characteristics between American chestnut and Chinese chestnut should not be ignored by restoration ecologists.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0971-4693	0974-1240		WOS:000365088500012

Effect of forage type with or without corn supplementation on animal performance, beef fatty acid composition, and palatability								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				93	10			5047	5058		10.2527/jas.2015-8939			OCT 2015	2015	Thirty-two steers were used to examine forage type (legumes [Medicago sativa and Glycine max] vs. grasses [Lolium arundinaceum and Sorghum bicolor]) with or without individual corn grain supplementation (0 vs. 0.75% of live weight [LW]/d) on beef fatty acid composition and palatability. In each year, steers (n = 16/yr) were randomly assigned to forage type (n = 8/forage type per yr) and to supplementation treatments within forage type (n = 4/supplementation treatment/forage type per yr). Forage types (grasses vs. legumes) were replicated in 2 paddocks of perennial and annual forage type pastures. A mixed model was developed with forage type, corn grain supplementation, and the 2-way interaction as fixed effects and 2 different error terms, one for testing forage and another for testing grain supplement and grain supplement x forage interaction. Corn grain supplementation increased (P = 0.01) ADG by 0.29 kg/d and final LW by 13 kg. Hot carcass weight, dressing percentage (DP), and KPH were greater (P < 0.05) for steers supplemented with corn grain. Carcasses from steers grazing legumes had greater (P = 0.04) DP compared with carcasses from steers grazing grasses. Alpha-linolenic acid concentration was higher (P < 0.05) in LM of steers grazing legumes than in LM of steers grazing grasses, both without supplementation. Supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) linolenic acid levels for both forage types; however, the magnitude of this reduction was greater for legumes than for grasses. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFA was greater (P = 0.03) in the LM of corn grain-supplemented steers than in the LM of nonsupplemented steers. Supplementation of corn grain decreased (P < 0.05) the percentage of odd-chain fatty acids and increased (P < 0.05) the percentage of MUFA in the LM. Warner-Bratzler shear force values were not altered (P > 0.05) by forage type, supplementation, or the 2-way interaction. Beef finished on legumes had greater concentrations of n-3 PUFA, whereas beef supplemented with corn grain had a greater ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids. On a gravimetric basis (mg/100 g LM), n-3 PUFA and CLA contents were not altered with supplementation, indicating that corn grain can be supplemented at this level in a forage-finishing beef system without negative consequences on perceived beneficial fatty acids.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000366326100047	26523597	
J	Trontz, Adam; Cheng, Baokai; Zeng, Shixuan; Xiao, Hai; Dong, Junhang								Development of Metal-Ceramic Coaxial Cable Fabry-Perot Interferometric Sensors for High Temperature Monitoring								SENSORS				15	10			24914	24925		10.3390/s151024914			OCT 2015	2015	Metal-ceramic coaxial cable Fabry-Perot interferometric (MCCC-FPI) sensors have been developed using a stainless steel tube and a stainless steel wire as the outer and inner conductors, respectively; a tubular -alumina insulator; and a pair of air gaps created in the insulator along the cable to serve as weak reflectors for the transmitting microwave (MW) signal. The MCCC-FPI sensors have been demonstrated for high temperature measurements using MW signals in a frequency range of 2-8 GHz. The temperature measurement is achieved by monitoring the frequency shift (integral) of the MW interferogram reflected from the pair of weak reflectors. The MW sensor exhibited excellent linear dependence of integral on temperature; small measurement deviations (+/- 2.7%); and fast response in a tested range of 200-500 degrees C. The MCCC has the potential for further developing multipoint FPI sensors in a single-cable to achieve in situ and continuous measurement of spatially distributed temperature in harsh environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1424-8220			WOS:000364242300012	26404280

In search of compassion: a new taxonomy of compassionate physician behaviours								HEALTH EXPECTATIONS				18	5			1672	1685		10.1111/hex.12160			OCT 2015	2015	Background Compassion has been extolled as a virtue in the physician-patient relationship as a response to patient suffering. However, there are few studies that systematically document the behavioural features of physician compassion and the ways in which physicians communicate compassion to patients.Objective To develop a taxonomy of compassionate behaviours and statements expressed by the physician that can be discerned by an outside observer.Design Qualitative analysis of audio-recorded office visits between oncologists and patients with advanced cancer.Setting and Participants Oncologists (n = 23) and their patients with advanced cancer (n = 49) were recruited in the greater Rochester, New York, area. The physicians and patients were surveyed and had office visits audio recorded.Main Outcome Measures Audio recordings were listened to for qualitative assessment of communication skills.Results Our sensitizing framework was oriented around three elements of compassion: recognition of the patient's suffering, emotional resonance and movement towards addressing suffering. Statements of compassion included direct statements, paralinguistic expressions and performative comments. Compassion frequently unfolded over the course of a conversation rather than being a single discrete event. Additionally, non-verbal linguistic elements (e.g. silence) were frequently employed to communicate emotional resonance.Discussion and Conclusions This study is the first to systematically catalogue instances of compassionate communication in physician-patient dialogues. Further refinement and validation of this preliminary taxonomy can guide future education and training interventions to facilitate compassion in physician-patient interactions.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1369-6513	1369-7625		WOS:000365046700086	24305037	
J	Hunter, Gary K.; Panagopoulos, Nikolaos G.								Commitment to technological change, sales force intelligence norms, and salesperson key outcomes								INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT				50				162	179		10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.03.023			OCT 2015	2015	Despite increasing interest in sales technology investments, companies continue to struggle with getting their salespeople to use these expensive technologies. In this context, two under-researched issues warrant attention. First, although sales technology represents a continuous source of change, little is known about why salespeople commit to technology-induced changes. Second, knowledge on whether sales force intelligence norms play a role into translating use of sales technology to performance gains is remarkably sparse. To address these gaps, this study develops a conceptual framework that explores the linear and non-linear effects of commitment to technological change (i.e., affective, normative, and continuance) on sales technology infusion, and, in turn, on two key outcomes (i.e., customer-oriented selling and sales performance). Our framework also advances knowledge on how sales force intelligence norms (i.e., analytical sales processes and knowledge sharing with customers) moderate the relationships between sales technology infusion and key outcomes. Analysis is done using multi-level structural equation modeling on a sample of 303 salespeople nested within 22 firms. Findings support the view that the three components of commitment are distinct, with some counter-intuitive results. Specifically, affective commitment does not exert a significant positive influence as expected; yet, normative commitment does. In contrast, while lower levels of continuance commitment reduce infusion, higher levels have positive effects, thus depicting a U-shaped effect. Finally, sales technology infusion influences both key outcomes and findings support the importance of fostering sales force intelligence norms. Implications of the study are discussed.

J	Chernykh, Lucy; Cole, Rebel A.					Cole, Rebel/0000-0001-9830-662X			How should we measure bank capital adequacy for triggering Prompt Corrective Action? A (simple) proposal								JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY				20				131	143		10.1016/j.jfs.2015.08.003			OCT 2015	2015	In this study, we test the predictive power of several alternative measures of bank capital adequacy in identifying U.S. bank failures during the recent crisis period. We find that an unconventional ratio - the non-performing asset coverage ratio (NPACR) - significantly outperforms Basel-based ratios including the Tier 1 ratio, the Total Capital Ratio, and the Leverage ratio - throughout the crisis period. It also outperforms in predicting failures among "well-capitalized" banks (as defined by the current Prompt Corrective Action guidelines). Based on our results, we argue that NPACR outperforms other ratios in at least five aspects: (i) it aligns capital and credit risks - the two primary risks of bank failures - in one measure; (ii) it is easier to calculate than the Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios, as it requires calculation of no complex risk weights; (iii) it allows one to account for various time period and cross-country provisioning rules and regimes, including episodes of regulatory forbearance and cross-country differences; (iv) it removes the incentives of both banks and regulators to mask capital deficiencies by creating/requiring insufficient loan-loss reserves; and (v) it outperforms all other commonly used capital ratios in predicting bank failures. We believe that all the above features of proposed measure promise its effective use in the prompt corrective actions by bank regulators. We also expect that this single and informative measure of bank risk can be efficiently used in empirical banking studies. The results of this study also shed light on regulatory forbearance during the recent banking crisis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Spontaneous fermentation with the use of the Chinese starter and wheat Qu lead to the growth of various microorganisms during the complete brewing process. It's of great importance to fully understand the composition of bacteria diversity in rice wine in order to improve the quality and solve safety problems. In this study, a more comprehensive bacterial description was shown with the use of bacteria diversity analysis, which enabled us to have a better understanding. Rarefaction, rank abundance, alpha Diversity, beta diversity and principal coordinates analysis simplified their complex bacteria components and provide us theoretical foundation for further investigation. It has been found bacteria diversity is more abundant at mid-term and later stage of brewing process. Bacteria community analysis reveals there is a potential safety hazard existing in the fermentation, since most of the sequence reads are assigned to Enterobacter (7900 at most) and Pantoea (7336 at most), followed by Staphylococcus (2796 at most) and Pseudomonas (1681 at most). Lactic acid bacteria are rare throughout the fermentation process which is not in accordance with other reports. This work may offer us an opportunity to investigate micro ecological fermentation system in food industry.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-1147	1750-3841		WOS:000364783600004	26409170	
J	Hiesl, Patrick; Waring, Timothy M.; Benjamin, Jeffrey G.								The effect of hardwood component on grapple skidder and stroke delimber idle time and productivity - An agent based model								COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE				118				270	280		10.1016/j.compag.2015.09.010			OCT 2015	2015	The forest industry is a capital intensive business and therefore high efficiency in management and forest operations is a must. Maine has millions of acres of forest stands with tree diameters smaller than 30 cm. The harvest productivity in such stands is low compared to stands with larger diameter trees. A recent harvest productivity study in Maine identified operational constraints for whole tree harvest systems, but efforts to improve active operations would be expensive and time consuming. A common practice to reduce costs and time consumption is to develop simulation models and implement new ideas within them. We developed a production efficiency model that leverages an agent-based modeling approach. The model is based on the interaction of two common forest machines (grapple skidder and stroke delimber) and incorporates empirical cycle time estimates from research in Maine. Three scenarios have been developed to investigate baseline conditions, and two GPS and GIS aided communication improvements. The goal of this paper is to document a new agent based model and to investigate the effect of hardwood component on machine idle time and productivity. Results showed that system productivity was affected by skidding distance, bunch spacing, and removal intensity. An increase in hardwood component led to a decrease in stroke delimber idle time but did not affect grapple skidder idle time. Further, hardwood component did not affect system productivity, and none of the three single-skidder scenarios tested performed any better than another. We validated the model by conducting a sensitivity analysis to confirm previous research results. The modeled waiting times are well within the range of observed values and therefore suggest that this model is accurate and well calibrated. Our conclusions are that when operating under average harvesting conditions there is no loss in productivity due to a change in hardwood component and that a stroke delimber idle time of 40% or more is unavoidable unless the stroke delimber can work independently. Future applications of this model may target specific production forestry conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0168-1699	1872-7107		WOS:000364603500029

These samples were prepared by spark plasma sintering of an admixture of Si, Ge, B and NaBH4 powders. In particular, the degasing process during the spark plasma sintering process, the combined results of X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Hall coefficient, electrical resistivity, and Seebeck coefficient measurements indicated that NaBH4 decomposed into Na, B, Na2B29, and H-2 during the spark plasma sintering process; Na and B were doped into the SiGe lattice, resulting in favorable changes in the carrier concentration and the power factor. In addition, the ball milling process and the formation of Na2B29 nanoparticles resulted in stronger grain boundary scattering of heat-carrying phonons, leading to a reduced lattice thermal conductivity. As a result, a significant improvement in the figure of merit ZT (60%) was attained in p-type Si80Ge20-(NaBH4)(1.7) and Si80Ge20-B-1.5(NaBH4)(0.7) at 1100 K as compared to the p-type B-doped Si80Ge20 material used in the NASA's radioactive thermoelectric generators. This single-step doping-nanostructuring procedure can possibly be applied to other thermoelectric materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1996-1073			WOS:000364230500017

One such molecule is cysteine (Cys), which acts as a biomarker for diseases like cancer, HIV, sepsis, etc., making its rapid detection imperative and essential. In this study, we report the sensitive detection of the thiolated amino acid Cys, from the non-thiolated amino acid arginine (Arg), using the novel surface plasmon coupled emission (SPCE) platform, characterized with high signal-to-noise ratios. Our studies were performed on the conventional silver (Ag) SPCE substrate, where Cys was detected to a nanomolar level, which is a major improvement to the previously reported level of sensitivity. This can be attributed to the highly sensitive SPCE platform and the unique thiol-Ag interactions associated specifically with Cys. We have also shown the role and influence of the coating process on sensitivity of detection and substantiated the advantages of SPCE over the SPR-based strategy of detection. The simplistic and economical SPCE platform enabled the sensitive detection of Cys that is of biological and medical relevance.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2191-9089	2191-9097		WOS:000364369000003

This method is advantageous since it is quick and flexible for incorporating other dopants such as graphene for vortex pinning. We observed that FeSe0.5Te0.5 exhibits a coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and superconductivity signature plausibly arising from a FM core-superconducting shell structure. More importantly, the H-c2 values observed from resistivity data are higher than 7 T, indicating that SPS process synthesized FeSe0.5Te0.5-samples could lead to next-generation superconducting wires and cables.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2191-9089	2191-9097		WOS:000364369000005		
J	Wang, Chunjian; Ayalew, Beshah; Rhyne, Timothy; Cron, Steve; Dailliez, Benoit								Static analysis of a thick ring on a unilateral elastic foundation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES				101				429	436		10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2015.08.015			OCT 2015	2015	A thick ring on a unilateral elastic foundation can be used to model important applications such as non-pneumatic tires or bushing bearings. This paper presents a reduced-order compensation scheme for computing the static deformation response of a thick ring supported by a unilateral elastic foundation to an arbitrary applied force. The ring considered is an orthotropic and extensible ring that can be treated as a Timoshenko beam. The elastic foundation is a two-parameter foundation with a linear torsional stiffness but a unilateral radial stiffness whose value vanishes when compressed or tensioned. The paper first derives the deformation response for the linear foundation case for which Fourier expansion techniques can be applied to obtain an analytical solution. Then, the nonlinear unilateral foundation problem is solved via an iterative compensation scheme that identifies regions with vanishing radial stiffness and applies a compensation force to the linear foundation model to counteract the excessive foundation forces that would not be there with the unilateral foundation. This scheme avoids the need for solving the complex set of nonlinear differential equations and gives a computationally efficient tool for rapidly analyzing and designing such systems. Representative results are compared with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Insecticidal Control of Megacopta cribraria (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) in Soybean								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				50	4			263	283					OCT 2015	2015	The invasive kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (F.) (Hemiptera: Plataspidae), has become an economic pest of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, in the southeastern United States since its initial discovery in Georgia. Information on management practices, including insecticides, is limited due to its uncertain pest status in its native range and recent introduction to the United States. We evaluated the efficacy in controlling M. cribraria and economic benefits of a variety of insecticides labeled for use in soybean from different chemical classes in field trials in South Carolina and Georgia from 2010 through 2012. Several pyrethroids were among the most effective insecticides for control of M. cribraria. The pyrethroid bifenthrin had an immediate (2-6 d after treatment application) percentage of control of 97.5 +/- 0.2% (SEM), which was the highest of the active ingredients tested. Likewise, net marginal benefits were typically greatest for pyrethroids, either alone or tank-mixed with other materials. Our results confirm that chemical control of M. cribraria in commercial soybean production is economically viable, but the number of effective chemical classes is limited.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0749-8004			WOS:000364107400001

Chicken litter inoculated with desiccation-adapted Salmonella cells was heat-treated at 75, 80, 85, and 150 degrees C. Salmonella populations decreased in all these samples during heat treatment, and the inactivation rates became lower in chicken litter when storage time was extended from 0 to 6 months. There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in thermal resistance of Salmonella in 6- and 9-month litter samples, indicating that a threshold for thermal resistance was reached after 6 months. Overall, the thermal resistance of Salmonella in chicken litter was affected by the storage time of the litter. The changes in some chemical, physical, and microbiological properties during storage could possibly contribute to this difference. Moisture and ammonia could be two of the most significant factors influencing the thermal resistance of Salmonella cells in chicken litter. Our results emphasize the importance of adjusting time and temperature conditions for heat processing chicken litter when it is removed from the chicken house at different time intervals.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000363459800036	26209673

All 10 participants had chronic stroke (>6 months), self-reported falling or fear of falling, and used a mobility device. Group Occupational Therapy for Falls included six sessions and focused on individual fall risk factor management. Assessments were completed before and after the intervention and assessed management of fall risk factors (five assessments, including the Falls Control Scale and Falls Prevention Strategy Survey), fear of falling (yes/no) question, falls self-efficacy, and activity and participation with the IMPACT (ICF Measure of Participation and ACTivity). Alpha was set at .10 owing to the small sample size and feasibility/pilot-study design.Results: Group Occupational Therapy for Falls was feasible and management of fall risk factors improved overall, with significant improvements noted in the Falls Control Scale (p = .046) and Falls Prevention Strategy Survey (.064). The number of people with FoF significantly decreased (p = .076).Conclusion: Group Occupational Therapy for Falls for fall prevention after stroke should be further developed and assessed in people with stroke as a promising intervention that may manage fall risks and possibly fall rates in the future.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0308-0226	1477-6006		WOS:000363194800009

Longitudinal determinants of mental health treatment-seeking by US soldiers								BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY				207	4			346	350		10.1192/bjp.bp.114.146506			OCT 2015	2015	BackgroundStudies with members of the armed forces have found a gap between reports of mental health symptoms and treatment-seeking.AimsTo assess the impact of attitudes on treatment-seeking behaviours in soldiers returning from a combat deployment.MethodA sample of 529 US soldiers were surveyed 4 months (time 1) and 12 months (time 2) post-deployment. Mental health symptoms and treatment-seeking attitudes were assessed at time 1; reported mental healthcare visits were assessed at time 2.ResultsFactor analysis of the total time 1. sample revealed four attitude factors: professional concerns, practical barriers, preference for self-management and positive attitudes about treatment. For the subset of 160 soldiers reporting a mental health problem at time 1, and controlling for mental health symptom severity, self-management inversely predicted treatment-seeking; positive attitudes were positively related.ConclusionsResults demonstrate the importance of broadening the conceptualisation of barriers and facilitators of mental healthcare beyond stigma. Techniques and delivery models emphasising self-care may help increase soldiers' interest in using mental health services.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0007-1250	1472-1465		WOS:000363222900015	25858176

Hsein; Atamturktur, Sez; Brownlow, Andrew								Improved shield tunnel design methodology incorporating design robustness								CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL				52	10			1575	1591		10.1139/cgj-2014-0458			OCT 2015	2015	This paper presents an improved design methodology for shield tunnels. Here, a new framework for three-dimensional analysis of shield tunnel "performance" (defined herein as the structural safety and serviceability of each tunnel ring) is developed, which considers the effect of the longitudinal variation of input parameters on the tunnel performance. Within this framework, random fields are used to simulate the longitudinal variation of input parameters, and the three-dimensional problem of shield tunnel performance is solved through a two-stage solution involving a one-dimensional model (for tunnel longitudinal behavior) and a two-dimensional model (for performance of segment rings). Furthermore, the robust design concept is integrated into the design of shield tunnels to guard against the longitudinal variation of tunnel performance caused by the longitudinal variation of input parameters. In the context of robust design, a new measure is developed for determining the robustness of the tunnel performance against the longitudinal variation of noise factors. A multi-objective optimization is then performed to optimize the design with respect to the design robustness and the cost efficiency, while satisfying the safety and serviceability requirements. Through an illustrative example, the effectiveness and significance of the improved shield tunnel design methodology is demonstrated.					5th International Colloquium on Geomechanics and Geophysics5th International Colloquium on Geomechanics and Geophysics	JUN 25-27, 2014JUN 25-27, 2014		CZECH REPUBLICCZECH REPUBLIC	1	0	0	0	0	1			0008-3674	1208-6010		WOS:000363475700016

Predicting Geologic Corrosion with Electrodes								ELEMENTS				11	5			331	336		10.2113/gselements.11.5.331			OCT 2015	2015	Ever since humans discovered how to separate metal from its ore mineral, preserving its metallic luster has been a driving force in the advancement of materials science. In modern times, developing materials that will contain and isolate nuclear waste has pushed corrosion science to new limits. We must now predict corrosion rates over geologic time scales, upwards of a million years. This article reviews the electrochemical basics that underpin metal and mineral corrosion and uses that to understand the case study of copper corrosion in nuclear-waste containers. Electrochemistry can also explain electron-transfer processes on mineral surfaces and so offer insight into weathering and environmentally relevant natural redox processes, such as those forming supergene metal deposits.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1811-5209	1811-5217		WOS:000363076900006

CEDAR: A Low-Latency and Distributed Strategy for Packet Recovery in Wireless Networks								IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING				23	5			1514	1527		10.1109/TNET.2014.2332980			OCT 2015	2015	Underlying link-layer protocols of well-established wireless networks that use the conventional "store-and-forward" design paradigm cannot provide highly sustainable reliability and stability in wireless communication, which introduce significant barriers and setbacks in scalability and deployments of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a Code Embedded Distributed Adaptive and Reliable (CEDAR) link-layer framework that targets low latency and balancing en/decoding load among nodes. CEDAR is the first comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing and designing distributed and adaptive error recovery for wireless networks. It employs a theoretically sound framework for embedding channel codes in each packet and performs the error correcting process in selected intermediate nodes in a packet's route. To identify the intermediate nodes for the decoding, we mathematically calculate the average packet delay and formalize the problem as a nonlinear integer programming problem. By minimizing the delays, we derive three propositions that: 1) can identify the intermediate nodes that minimize the propagation and transmission delay of a packet; and 2) and 3) can identify the intermediate nodes that simultaneously minimize the queuing delay and maximize the fairness of en/decoding load of all the nodes. Guided by the propositions, we then propose a scalable and distributed scheme in CEDAR to choose the intermediate en/decoding nodes in a route to achieve its objective. The results from real-world testbed "NESTbed" and simulation with MATLAB prove that CEDAR is superior to schemes using hop-by-hop decoding and destination decoding not only in packet delay and throughput but also in energy-consumption and load distribution balance.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1063-6692	1558-2566		WOS:000363254100011

Although the theory has been successfully used to model a wide variety of important EMC problems over the past 14 years, it has not been rigorously derived. This paper provides a strict derivation of the theory and carefully defines the important quantities. The derivation demonstrates that imbalance difference calculations are exact provided that the differential-mode propagation is TEM and the current division factor, h, represents the actual ratio of currents on the two transmission line conductors excited by a common-mode source. The paper also discusses the acquisition of the current division factor from 2-D calculations of the cross section of the transmission line.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-9375	1558-187X		WOS:000363189200013		
J	Martin-Hammond, Aqueasha M.; Abegaz, Tamirat; Gilbert, Juan E.								Designing an over-the-counter consumer decision-making tool for older adults								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS				57				113	123		10.1016/j.jbi.2015.07.006			OCT 2015	2015	Purpose: Older adults are at increased risk of adverse drug events due to medication. Older adults tend to take more medication and are at higher risk of chronic illness. Over-the-counter (OTC) medication does not require healthcare provider oversight and understanding OTC information is heavily dependent on a consumer's ability to understand and use the medication appropriately. Coupling health technology with effective communication is one approach to address the challenge of communicating health and improving health related tasks. However, the success of many health technologies also depends on how well the technology is designed and how well it addresses users needs. This is especially true for the older adult population. This paper describes (1) a formative study performed to understand how to design novel health technology to assist older adults with OTC medication information, and (2) how a user-centered design process helped to refine the initial assumptions of user needs and help to conceptualize the technology.Methods: An iterative design process was used. The process included two brainstorming and review sessions with human-computer interaction researchers and design sessions with older adults in the form of semi-structured interviews. Methods and principles of user-centered research and design were used to inform the research design. Two researchers with expertise in human-computer interaction performed expert reviews of early system prototypes. After initial prototypes were developed, seven older adults were engaged in semi-structured interviews to understand usability concerns and features and functionality older adults may find useful for selecting appropriate OTC medication.Results: Eight usability concerns were discovered and addressed in the two rounds of expert review, and nine additional usability concerns were discovered in design sessions with older adults. Five themes emerged from the interview transcripts as recommendations for design. These recommendations represent opportunities for technology such as the one described in this paper to support older adults in the OTC decision-making process.Discussion: This paper illustrates the use of an iterative user-centered process in the formative stages of design and its usefulness for understanding aspects of the technology design that are useful to older adults when making decisions about OTC medication. The technology support mechanisms included in the initial model were revised based on the results from the iterative design sessions and helped to refine and conceptualize the system being designed.

Decreased Mechanical Strength and Collagen Content in SPARC-Null Periodontal Ligament Is Reversed by Inhibition of Transglutaminase Activity								JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH				30	10			1914	1924		10.1002/jbmr.2522			OCT 2015	2015	The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a critical tissue that provides a physical link between the mineralized outer layer of the tooth and the alveolar bone. The PDL is composed primarily of nonmineralized fibrillar collagens. Expression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC/osteonectin), a collagen-binding matricellular protein, has been shown to be essential for collagen homeostasis in PDL. In the absence of SPARC, PDL collagen fibers are smaller and less dense than fibers that constitute WT PDL. The aim of this study was to identify cellular mechanisms by which SPARC affected collagen fiber assembly and morphology in PDL. Cross-linking of fibrillar collagens is one parameter that is known to affect insoluble collagen incorporation and fiber morphology. Herein, the reduction in collagen fiber size and quantity in the absence of SPARC expression was shown to result in a PDL with reduced molar extraction force in comparison to that of WT mice (C57Bl/6J). Furthermore, an increase in transglutaminase activity was found in SPARC-null PDL by biochemical analyses that was supported by immunohistochemical results. Specifically, collagen I was identified as a substrate for transglutaminase in PDL and transglutaminase activity on collagen I was found to be greater in SPARC-null tissues in comparison to WT. Strikingly, inhibition of transglutaminase activity in SPARC-null PDL resulted in increases in both collagen fiber thickness and in collagen content, whereas transglutaminase inhibitors injected into WT mice resulted in increases in collagen fiber thickness only. Furthermore, PDL treated with transglutaminase inhibitors exhibited increases in molar extraction force in WT and in SPARC-null mice. Thus, SPARC is proposed to act as a critical regulator of transglutaminase activity on collagen I with implications for mechanical strength of tissues.

J	Chong, Juang-Horng; Hinson, Kevin R.								A Comparison of Trap Types for Assessing Diversity of Scarabaeoidea on South Carolina Golf Courses								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				108	5			2383	2396		10.1093/jee/tov209			OCT 2015	2015	A 2-yr survey was conducted on golf courses in South Carolina to 1) document the species richness and seasonal activity of Scarabaeoidea; 2) assess any species compositional differences among three trap types (ultraviolet light, unbaited flight-intercept, and unbaited pitfall); and 3) identify any dominant taxa in each trap type. A total of 74,326 scarabaeoid beetles were captured, of which 77.4% were Aphodiinae (not identified to species). The remaining specimens belong to 104 species in 47 genera and 6 families. The most abundant species were Cyclocephala lurida Bland, Dyscinetus morator (F.), Euetheola humilis (Burmeister), Hybosorus illigeri Reiche, and Maladera castanea (Arrow). In all trap types, >90% of all specimens and taxa were collected between April and August. Ultraviolet light traps collected similar to 94% of total specimens consisting of 83 taxa (of which 51 were unique to this trap type), whereas flight-intercept traps captured similar to 2% of all specimens representing 53 taxa (18 of which were unique), and pitfall traps captured similar to 4% of all specimens representing 15 taxa (no unique species; all species also captured by ultraviolet light traps). Indicator species analysis identified 2-3 and 10-13 taxa that were most frequently collected by flight-intercept and ultraviolet light traps, respectively. Flight-intercept traps complemented ultraviolet light traps by capturing more species of dung and carrion beetles and diurnal phytophagous scarab beetles. Results suggested that a similar survey for domestic or exotic scarabaeoid beetles in turfgrass systems should be conducted between April and August using ultraviolet light and flight-intercept traps at 13-58 sites.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000362828300026	26453727

The compounds have the general formula NaBa(3)Ln(3)Si(6)O(20) (Ln = Y, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd), and crystallize in the space group Ama2 (No.40). As a representative example, the unit cell parameters of NaBa3Gd3Si6O20 are a = 14.731(3) angstrom, b = 23.864(5) angstrom, c = 5.5449(11) angstrom and Z = 4. The title compounds adopt a three dimensional polar acentric framework made of Ln-O-Si bonding. The framework is comprised of LnO(8) and LnO(7) units forming edge-sharing infinite chains along the c-axis. These oxy-bridged infinite chains are also linked by [Si4O13] tetrasilicate and [Si2O7] disilicate units to form the three-dimensional framework structure, with Ba2+ and Na+ cations residing inside channels of the framework. The polarity in the structure is imparted by the unusual tetrasilicate arrangement. The luminescence and magnetic properties were investigated on selected compounds. The temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements on the Nd, Sm, and Gd derivatives reveal a Curie-Weiss behavior with an anti-ferromagnetic coupling parameter. For the Eu-derivative, the temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility deviates significantly from Curie-Weiss behavior. Luminescence properties of NaBa3Eu3Si6O20 and NaBa3Sm3Si6O20 compounds exhibited the characteristic transitions of Eu3+ (D-5(0) -> F-7(J), J = 0-4) and Sm3+ ((4)G(5/2) -> H-6(J), J = 5/2, 7/2), respectively, leading to strong visible red and orange emissions, respectively.

J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Ze; Chen, Kang								Social-P2P: An Online Social Network Based P2P File Sharing System								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				26	10			2874	2889		10.1109/TPDS.2014.2359020			OCT 2015	2015	A peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system provides a platform that enables a tremendous number of nodes to share their files. Retrieving desired files efficiently and trustworthily is critical in such a large and jumbled system. However, the issues of efficient searching and trustworthy searching have only been studied separately. Simply combining the methods to achieve the two goals doubles system overhead. In this paper, we first study trace data from Facebook and BitTorrent. Guided by the observations, we propose a system that integrates a social network into a P2P network, named Social-P2P, for simultaneous efficient and trustworthy file sharing. It incorporates three mechanisms: (1) interest/trust-based structure, (2) interest/trust-based file searching, and (3) trust relationship adjustment. By exploiting the social interests and relationships in the social network, the interest/trust-based structure groups common-multi-interest nodes into a cluster and further connects socially close nodes within a cluster. The comparably stable nodes in each cluster form a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for inter-cluster file searching. In the interest/trust-based file searching mechanism, a file query is forwarded to the cluster of the file by the DHT routing first. Then, it is forwarded along constructed connections within a cluster, which achieves high hit rate and reliable routing. Moreover, sharing files among socially close friends discourages nodes from providing faulty files because people are unlikely to risk their reputation in the real-world. In the trust relationship adjustment mechanism, each node in a routing path adaptively decreases its trust on the node that has forwarded a faulty file in order to avoid routing queries towards misbehaving nodes later on. We conducted extensive trace-driven simulations and implemented a prototype on PlanetLab. Experimental results show that Social-P2P achieves highly efficient and trustworthy file sharing compared to current file sharing systems and trust management systems.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000362791400020		
J	Kirk, Colleen P.; McSherry, Bernard; Swain, Scott D.								Investing the self: The effect of nonconscious goals on investor psychological ownership and word-of-mouth intentions								JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS				58				186	194		10.1016/j.socec.2015.04.013			OCT 2015	2015	This research examines the impact of nonconscious goal activation on investors feelings of psychological ownership of their investment choices. An initial experiment finds that psychological ownership is greater when an investment choice is incongruent with a nonconsciously-activated financial goal. Consistent with the notion that psychological ownership engenders self-enhancement motivation, ownership is also positively associated with word-of-mouth intentions. However, two additional experiments show that these effects are attenuated when an investor's decision process focuses on deciding in the "right way" (versus focusing on making the "best choice"). Findings across all studies support an integrative perspective on theories of psychological ownership and regulatory engagement When individuals overcome personal resistance by choosing an option that is incongruent with a nonconscious goal, they experience greater feelings of engagement, which in turn lead to enhanced feelings of psychological ownership of the chosen option and greater word-of-mouth intentions.

A screening evaluation was used for the determination of the impact of both porogen content and porogen size on pore structure, strength, and permeability characteristics of planar specimens. By optimizing both the composition as well as cross-linking parameters, maximum characteristic biaxial flexural strengths of 65MPa and porosities of 42% were achieved. The evolution of an interconnected, open-pore network during thermal porogen removal and conversion of the preceramic polymer led to air permeabilities in the order of 10(-14)m(2). The materials were further exposed to long-term heat treatments to demonstrate the stability of properties after 100h at 800 degrees C in oxidizing, inert, and reducing environments. The determined performance, in combination with the versatile preparation method, illustrates the feasibility of this processing approach for the generation of porous ceramic support structures for applications at elevated temperatures in a variety of fields, including membrane and catalysis science.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000362599000015	26681809

Notwithstanding the excellent mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of individual carbon nanotubes (CNTs), bulk CNT-based composites suffer from CNT anisotropy and high interjunction resistance. We provide a brief overview of scalable methods that can tune electrical and thermal connectivity in bulk CNT composites by tuning CNT shape, intertubular bonding, and packing density. These scalable production methods are posited to open new avenues for incorporating CNTs into thermal interface materials, structural reinforcement, and auxiliary power units in the form of energy-storage devices, especially for use in aerospace applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0883-7694	1938-1425		WOS:000362951300015

Optimizing the performance of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled battery electric vehicles through a smart charge scheduling model								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY				16	5			827	837		10.1007/s12239-015-0085-3			OCT 2015	2015	A smart charge scheduling model is presented for potential (1) vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled battery electric vehicle (BEV) owners who are willing to participate in the grid ancillary services, and (2) grid operators. Unlike most V2G implementations, which are considered from the perspective of power grid systems, this model includes a communication network architecture for connecting system components that supports both BEV owners and grid operators to efficiently monitor and manage the charging and ancillary service activities. This model maximizes the net profit to each BEV participant while simultaneously satisfying energy demands for his/her trips. The performance of BEVs using the scheduling model is validated by estimating optimal annual financial benefits under different scenarios. An analysis of popular BEV models revealed that one of the existing BEVs considered in the study can generate an annual regulation profit of $454, $394 and $318 when the average daily driving distance is 20 miles, 40 miles and 60 miles, respectively. All popular BEV models can completely compensate the energy cost and generate a positive net profit, through the application of the scheduling model presented in this paper, with an annual driving distance of approximately 15,000 miles. Simulation analysis indicated that the extra load distribution from the optimized BEV charging operations were well balanced compared to the unmanaged BEV operations.									2	1	0	0	0	3			1229-9138	1976-3832		WOS:000355218500013

In this study, both the recovery and inactivation of two human norovirus surrogates, feline calicivirus (FCV) and murine norovirus (MNV), on hard nonporous surfaces (glass) and soft porous surfaces (polyester and cotton) were evaluated by both plaque assay and reverse transcription quantitative PCR method. Two disinfectants, sodium hypochlorite (8.25%) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP, at 4.25%) were evaluated for disinfection efficacy. Five coupons per surface type were used to evaluate the recovery of FCV and MNV by sonication and stomaching and the disinfection of each surface type by using 5 ml of disinfectant for a contact time of 5 min. FCV at an initial titer of ca. 7 log PFU/ml was recovered from glass, cotton, and polyester at 6.2, 5.4, and 3.8 log PFU/ml, respectively, compared with 5.5, 5.2, and 4.1 log PFU/ml, respectively, for MEW with an initial titer of ca. 6 log PFU/ml. The use of sodium hypochlorite (5,000 ppm) was able to inactivate both FCV and MNV (3.1 to 5.5 log PFU/ml) below the limit of detection on all three surface types. AHP (2,656 ppm) inactivated FCV (3.1 to 5.5 log PFU/ml) below the limit of detection for all three surface types but achieved minimal inactivation of MNV (0.17 to 1.37 log PFU/ml). Reduction of viral RNA by sodium hypochlorite corresponded to 2.72 to 4.06 log reduction for FCV and 2.07 to 3.04 log reduction for MNV on all three surface types. Reduction of viral RNA by AHP corresponded to 1.89 to 3.4 log reduction for FCV and 0.54 to 0.85 log reduction for MNV. Our results clearly indicate that both virus and surface types significantly influence recovery efficiency and disinfection efficacy. Based on the performance of our proposed testing method, an improvement in virus recovery will be needed to effectively validate virus disinfection of soft porous surfaces.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000362611100009	26408133

Volume erosion wear rate of MgSZ ceramics was measured at up to 1400 degrees C with an impact angle of 90 degrees. The effects of erosion temperature on erosion wear behavior and mechanism for different temperature ranges have been discussed. The results indicate that volume erosion wear rate of MgSZ ceramics increased with temperature. Specifically, volume erosion wear rate increased at a rate of 1.87 x 10(-4) from room temperature to 600 degrees C, 5.99 x 10(-4) from 800 to 1000 degrees C, and tended to be constant from 1000 to 1400 degrees C. Volume erosion wear rate reached its maximum value of 0.60mm(3)/g at around 1000 degrees C. The increase in erosion wear rate is related to the decrease in mechanical performance of MgSZ with increasing temperature. When MgSZ ceramics were impacted by corundum particles, the main material removal mechanism was found to be plastic deformation from room temperature to 600 degrees C and crack crisscross leading to flaky exfoliation of material from 1000 to 1400 degrees C. Between 600 and 800 degrees C, a transition region from plastic deformation to flaky exfoliation was found. (C)2015 The Ceramic Society of Japan.

Three kinds of specimens were cut from this plate with their tensile directions aligned 0 degrees,45 degrees, and 90 degrees to the normal direction (ND), and they were referred as 0ND, 45ND and 90ND specimens, respectively. A crystal plasticity model was developed to demonstrate the relationship between textures and deformation modes. The results show that the general features of flow curves and texture evolutions of AZ31 alloy during tension can be well explained by the relative activities of deformation modes, which exhibit a pronounced orientation dependence on both the starting and current textures. The obvious yielding behaviors in 0ND and 45ND specimens are induced by the initial activity of {10-12} twinning, and the strain hardening behavior is related to the activities of {10-12} twinning, basal slip and prismatic slip. Due to the existence of {10-11} twinning at low strain, the elongation to rupture of 90ND specimen is much lower than those the elongation of 0ND and 45ND specimens. Although prismatic slip activity depends on the initial texture, its activities always increases during tension, affecting the flow curves, microstructure and texture evolutions. The high prismatic slip activities in 0ND and 90ND specimens result in a strong {10-10} prismatic texture, while the activity of pyramidal <c + a> slip is always negligible in all specimens and insensitive to the initial texture during tension.

Comparative genomic analyses between rosaceous species are increasingly being used to assign putative function. With the wealth of new data, there is a need to standardize nomenclature to ensure uniformity and clarity across research groups. The Rosaceae Gene Name Standardization Committee was formed to develop a naming guideline for genes in Rosaceae family members. This manuscript details the issues involved with naming genes and proposes a common nomenclature system. The Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR) (www.rosaceae.org) has developed a gene database that will support user-submitted gene names and annotations in addition to the predicted genes from whole genome sequences. GDR also hosts user-curated lists of gene class symbols. To facilitate standardization of gene names and avoid misinterpretation, the committee recommends that the GDR serve as the database of record for the names of Rosaceae genes and that gene names, gene class symbols, and gene annotation be registered in GDR prior to publication in peer reviewed journals.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000362431600022

The results showed that the pretreatment with sodium hydroxide prior the inoculation of lactic acid bacteria effectively removed the lignin content from biomass of water lettuce and increased the extractable portion of the biomass. Experimental sets that had received alkali pretreatment had more total organic acids and fewer butyric acids generated than non-pretreated sets. The results also showed that the integrated process can preserve more carbohydrate content of biomass and can give higher fermentable sugar yields than without pretreatment. Overall, the study suggests that treatment with NaOH improves preservation of fresh harvested water lettuce but further investigation of optimal conditions is needed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rahman, Mizanur; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Khan, Taufiquar; Bhavsar, Parth								Improving the Efficacy of Car-Following Models With a New Stochastic Parameter Estimation and Calibration Method								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				16	5			2687	2699		10.1109/TITS.2015.2420542			OCT 2015	2015	Microscopic roadway traffic simulators, which attempt to mimic real-world driver behaviors, are based on car-following models and have been widely used as a cost-effective tool for intelligent transportation system (ITS) evaluation. In addition to evaluation, ITSs can benefit from accurate car-following models that can provide current estimations and future predictions of various traffic situations to support real-time traffic management. The accuracy and reliability of these applications are greatly dependent on the appropriate calibration of car-following models. In this paper, the authors developed a process to apply a stochastic calibration method with appropriate regularization to estimate the distribution of parameters for car-following models. The calibration method is based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation that uses the Bayesian estimation theory. An intelligent driver model and Helly's car-following model were utilized to evaluate this method. The Bayesian approach provided better results in terms of the cost function than the deterministic optimization algorithm. With the Bayesian approach, the mean square error per vehicle is decreased with the increased number of vehicles. Analysis also revealed that the Bayesian approach predicted drivers' speed and acceleration/deceleration profiles more closely to the real-world data compared with the deterministic approach evaluated in this paper. Positive validation outcomes suggest potential efficacy of the calibration approach presented in this paper for future applications.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000362084600032

EIT is a severely ill-posed inverse problem. In this paper, we formulate the EIT problem in the Bayesian framework using mixed total variation (TV) and non-convex l(p) regularization prior. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for sampling the posterior distribution to solve the ill-posed inverse problem in EIT. We present simulations to estimate the distribution for each pixel for the image reconstruction of the conductivity in EIT.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0928-0219	1569-3945		WOS:000362193500009

This is a rapid, inexpensive technique to fabricate robust microfluidics devices. Straight, curved and square serpentine as well as zigzag channels of different dimensions are studied. General guidelines are provided to assess feasibility of a particular geometry a priori. The mechanics of the cut are explored with the aim at identifying the bottlenecks that limit the maximum resolution achieved in xurography of adhesive films. A number of advantages and disadvantages of this technique compared to other common fabrication techniques are also provided.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1613-4982	1613-4990		WOS:000361986400021

Effects of in ovo injection of organic zinc, manganese, and copper on the hatchability and bone parameters of broiler hatchlings								POULTRY SCIENCE				94	10			2488	2494		10.3382/ps/pev248			OCT 2015	2015	Effects of the in ovo injection of commercial diluent containing supplemental microminerals (Zn, Mn, and Cu) on hatchability and hatching chick quality variables in Ross x Ross 708 broilers were examined. On 17 d of incubation (doi) eggs were subjected to 1 of 4 treatments using a commercial multi-egg injector. Treatments included non-injected (treatment 1) and diluent-injected (treatment 2) control groups. Those in treatment 3 received diluent containing 0.181, 0.087, and 0.010 mg/mL of Zn, Mn, and Cu, respectively, and those in treatment 4 received diluent containing 0.544, 0.260, and 0.030 mg/mL of Zn, Mn, and Cu, respectively. A total of 1,872 eggs were distributed among 4 treatment groups on each of 6 replicate tray levels. Hatchability of fertile eggs set (HF) was determined on 20.5 and 21.5 doi. On 21.5 doi, HF and mean hatching chick weight (MHW) were determined. One bird from each treatment replicate group was randomly selected, weighed, and necropsied for the extraction of their livers and tibiae. The tibiae fresh and dry weight, length, width, bone breaking strength (BBS), and percentage of bone ash (PBA) were determined. The dry livers were weighed and ashed. Injection treatment had no significant effect on HF at 20.5 doi. However, there was a significant injection treatment effect on HF at 21.5 doi. The HF of eggs at 21.5 doi in treatment 4 was significantly lower than that of the non-injected control group, with treatment 3 being intermediate. Furthermore, there were no significant treatment effects noted for MHW fresh and dry tibia weights, tibia length and width, tibia length to weight ratio, BBS, liver ash content, or percentage of minerals (Ca, P, Mg, Mn, and Zn) in the tibia ash. However, embryos from eggs that received treatment 4 had a significantly higher PBA in comparison to all other treatments. In conclusion, although treatment 4 negatively affected HF, the injection of diluent containing the high micromineral concentration has the potential to improve bone mineralization.									1	0	0	1	2	2			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000361945600022	26330613

Driven primarily by an opportunity to develop life-like materials on one hand, and sustainable technologies on the other, several successful approaches to repair mechanically damaged materials have been explored. This review examines chemical and physical processes occurring during self-healing of polymers as well as examines the role of interfaces in rigid nano-objects in multi-component composites. The complex nature of processes involved in self-healing demands understanding of multi-level molecular and macroscopic events. Two aspects of self-healing are particularly intriguing: physical flow (macro) of matter at or near a wound and chemical re-bonding (molecular) of cleaved bonds. These events usually occur concurrently, and depending upon interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics of the processes involved, these transient relations as well as efficiency are critical in designing self-healing materials. This review examines covalent bonding and supramolecular chemistry in the context of molecular heterogeneities in repair processes. Interfacial regions in nanocomposites also facilitate an opportunity for supramolecular assemblies or covalent bonding which, if designed properly, are capable of self-repairs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of equilibration time on Pu desorption from goethite								RADIOCHIMICA ACTA				103	10			695	705		10.1515/ract-2015-2404			OCT 2015	2015	It has been suggested that strongly sorbing ions such as plutoniummay become irreversibly bound to mineral surfaces over time which has implications for near and far-field transport of Pu. Batch adsorption-desorption data were collected as a function of time and pH to study the surface stability of Pu on goethite. Pu(IV) was adsorbed to goethite over the pH range 4.2 to 6.6 for different periods of time (1, 6, 15, 34 and 116 d). Following adsorption, Pu was leached from the mineral surface with desferrioxamine B (DFOB), acomplexant capable of effectively competing with the goethite surface for Pu. The amount of Pu desorbed from the goethite was found to vary as a function of the adsorption equilibration time, with less Pu removed from the goethite following longer adsorption periods. This effect was most pronounced at low pH. Logarithmic desorption distribution ratios for each adsorption equilibration time were fit to a pH-dependent model. Model slopes decreased between 1 and 116 d adsorption time, indicating that overall Pu(IV) surface stability on goethite surfaces becomes less dependent on pH with greater adsorption equilibration time. The combination of adsorption and desorption kinetic data suggest that non-redox aging processes affect Pu sorption behavior on goethite.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0033-8230			WOS:000361895900003		
J	Yang, Chunli; Powell, Brian A.; Zhang, Shengdong; Rao, Linfeng								Surface complexation modeling of neptunium(V) sorption to lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH)								RADIOCHIMICA ACTA				103	10			707	717		10.1515/ract-2015-2405			OCT 2015	2015	Lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH), an important iron-bearing mineral found to exist with a relatively high abundance in the soils of the Chinese nuclear test sites, has rarely been studied for its sorption of transuranic elements from the nuclear wastes. This work develops a quantitative surface complexation model describing the sorption and speciation of Np(V) on synthetic lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH). Batch sorption experiments on gamma-FeOOH were performed under a range of conditions (25 C, 0.1M NaClO4, pH = 4-11, 5 mu M Np(V), and atmospheric conditions). The Diffuse Layer Model (DLM) was applied to describe the surface-complexation reaction. The data were best-fitted with a single surface-complexation reaction, ( XOH + NpO2+ = XONpO2 + H+) that occurred at the lepidocrocite/water interface to form an inner-sphere Np(V) complex with lepidocrocite. The results are complemented by the Np L-III-edge EXAFS data that show that Np(V) was absorbed on gamma-FeOOH as monomeric neptunyl ions, with no observations of multinuclear surface complexes or surface precipitates. A prominent peak at in the EXAFS Fourier Transform spectra can be attributed to aNp-Fe scattering path, consistent with the formation of an inner sphere Np(V)-lepidocrocite surface complex. Formation of aqueous NpO2 (CO3)(x)(1-2x) x complexes prevents Np(V) sorption at higher pH values but it is unclear if ternary lepidocrocite-Np-carbonate complexes may also form. These data indicate that there are subtle differences in Np(V) interactions with hematite, goethite, and lepidocrocite which is likely amanifestation of the differences in surface reactivity of the three minerals.									1	1	0	1	0	2			0033-8230			WOS:000361895900004

Framed with stakeholder theory, this study developed and piloted the Stakeholder Understanding of Sustainable Tourism Development Index (SUSTDI), a tool that assesses awareness of tourism impacts and agreement to principles of sustainable tourism development. The results produced a six-factor solution (=.93); resource preservation, environmental education, stakeholder inclusion, economic planning, cultural awareness, and community resource identification. Differences between community groups were also examined. Though continued validation of the SUSTDI is needed, this is an initial step in providing a tool for tourism planners to assess a community's level of awareness and agreement as a precursor to developing education and training programs to increase understanding and knowledge of sustainable tourism development.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1467-3584	1742-9692		WOS:000361590900003

This study identifies gender-specific behavioral factors associated with type 2 diabetes diagnoses among middle-aged and older adults in a Chinese context.Data are selected from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) 2009. There are 259 male cases and 280 female cases individually matched with their nondiabetic controls on age.Higher level of total carbohydrate intake and physical inactivity is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes diagnoses in both genders (p < .001). Odds ratios of type 2 diabetes diagnoses are higher only among male cigarette smokers and heavy alcohol drinkers.This study provides evidence regarding gender-specific behavioral risks of type 2 diabetes suggesting the need for improving type 2 diabetes related research, prevention, education, and healthcare services for middle-aged and older adults in China.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1070-5503	1532-7558		WOS:000361736300007	25772488

Embedded within any such rating system is choice architecture, which refers to the way information is presented to a decision maker. This research examines the impact on design choices of changes to defaults in the choice architecture of the Envision rating system for sustainable infrastructure. Currently, the default score in each category of Envision is zero points. Points are earned by improving upon industry norms. To test the impact of changing these defaults, participants (senior-level and graduate students) randomly received either the current Envision version or a modified version with a higher default score, endowing participants with points in sustainability. All participants used their randomly assigned rating system to design an outdoor community center and stream restoration brownfield site. Simply modifying the default, by endowing points, led to setting significantly higher design goals. There were no significant differences in other variables measured, including student motivation or perceptions about Envision or sustainability. These findings suggest that how choices are presented to engineers influences their decision-making process and can lead to higher sustainability goals. The construction engineering and management community can use this understanding to encourage more desired infrastructure outcomes.

Laboratory Evaluation of Long-Term Draindown of Porous Asphalt Mixtures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				27	10					04015009	10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0001260			OCT 2015	2015	Long-term draindown is the term adopted in this study to describe the downward flow of binder in a porous asphalt mixture due to the force of gravity at high temperatures experienced during service, especially in warmer climates. The concept of long-term draindown has been qualitatively noted in field observations of porous asphalt mixtures, including open graded friction courses (OGFC). This research quantified the long-term draindown of three different OGFC mixtures by measuring the permeability of the mixes throughout an 84-day conditioning period at 60 degrees C. The results showed that the permeability of all three mixtures decreased over the first 56 days and then leveled off or increased for the remaining 28 days. To verify that the permeability reduction was due to binder draindown, the distribution of binder content of randomly selected specimens was measured. The results from this study indicated that cellulose fibers did not have any influence on the long-term draindown of the mixtures evaluated as the other mixtures [ one made with ground tire rubber modified binder and the other with Evotherm 3G (MWV Specialty Chemicals, North Charleston, South Carolina)] exhibited slightly lower rates of permeability loss despite not containing fibers.

The effects of oxygen level and glucose concentration on the metabolism of porcine TMJ disc cells								OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE				23	10			1790	1796		10.1016/j.joca.2015.05.021			OCT 2015	2015	Objective: To determine the combined effect of oxygen level and glucose concentration on cell viability, ATP production, and matrix synthesis of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc cells.Design: TMJ disc cells were isolated from pigs aged 6-8 months and cultured in a monolayer. Cell cultures were preconditioned for 48 h with 0, 1.5, 5, or 25 mM glucose DMEM under 1%, 5%, 10%, or 21% O-2 level, respectively. The cell viability was measured using the WST-1 assay. ATP production was determined using the Luciferin-Luciferase assay. Collagen and proteoglycan synthesis were determined by measuring the incorporation of [2, 3-H-3] proline and [S-35] sulfate into the cells, respectively.Results: TMJ disc cell viability significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) without glucose. With glucose present, decreased oxygen levels significantly increased viability (P < 0.0001), while a decrease in glucose concentration significantly decreased viability (P < 0.0001). With glucose present, decreasing oxygen levels significantly reduced ATP production (P < 0.0001) and matrix synthesis (P < 0.0001). A decreased glucose concentration significantly decreased collagen synthesis (P < 0.0001). The interaction between glucose and oxygen was significant in regards to cell viability (P < 0.0001), ATP production (P = 0.00015), and collagen (P = 0.0002) and proteoglycan synthesis (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: Although both glucose and oxygen are important, glucose is the limiting nutrient for TMJ disc cell survival. At low oxygen levels, the production of ATP, collagen, and proteoglycan are severely inhibited. These results suggest that steeper nutrient gradients may exist in the TMJ disc and it may be vulnerable to pathological events that impede nutrient supply.

Incubation history prior to the canonical thermosensitive period determines sex in the American alligator								REPRODUCTION				150	4			279	287		10.1530/REP-15-0155			OCT 2015	2015	Despite the widespread occurrence of environmental sex determination (ESD) among vertebrates, our knowledge of the temporal dynamics by which environmental factors act on this process remains limited. In many reptiles, incubation temperature determines sex during a discrete developmental window just prior to and coincident with the differentiation of the gonads. Yet, there is substantial variation in sex ratios among different clutches of eggs incubated at identical temperatures during this period. Here, we test the hypothesis that temperatures experienced prior to the reported thermosensitive period for alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) can impact how the sex determination system responds to thermal cues later in development. Temperature shift experiments on eggs collected from the field within 24 h of oviposition were employed to decouple various maternal influences from thermal effects, and results demonstrate a previously undefined window of thermosensitivity occurring by stage 15 of embryonic development, six stages earlier than previously reported. We also examine the intrasexual expression of several male-and female-biased genes and show that while male-biased genes display no intrasexual differences, ovarian CYP19A1 (aromatase) transcript abundance differs by approximately twofold depending on thermal exposures experienced at early stages of embryonic development. These findings expand our understanding of the ESD in the alligator and provide the rationale for reevaluation of the temporal dynamics of sex determination in other crocodilians.									4	0	0	4	0	4			1470-1626			WOS:000361908800007	26183894

On page 4894, F. Ding and co-workers illustrate thermodynamic renditions of two immiscible ligands evolving from phase-separated, striped, and mixed initial states on the surface of a gold nanoparticle. While the mixed state is a common endpoint, weakly striped patterns only occur for a subset of molecular systems, and often at short range and low temperatures. This study highlights the contributions of both entropy and enthalpy in determining binary SAM systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1613-6829		MEDLINE:26428705	26428705	
J	Tohidi, Ali; Kaye, Nigel; Bridges, William								Statistical description of firebrand size and shape distribution from coniferous trees for use in Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations of firebrand flight distance								FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL				77				21	35		10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.07.008			OCT 2015	2015	The process of ember/firebrand formation, lofting, wind driven transport, and resulting spot fire ignition during a wildfire is still poorly understood. Lack of a tractable firebrand formation model along with a detailed statistical description of the size and shape distribution of typical firebrand that could be used in simulations of firebrand flight and combustion may result in unrealistic outcomes. In this regard, a simple, yet quite informative, mechanical failure model of the firebrand break-off process is proposed. This model suggests that the previous laboratory scale firebrand generation experiments would likely provide a reasonable analogue for the formation process in a full scale wildfire. In addition, geometric scaling analysis is conducted and shows that the firebrand surface area scales with the firebrand mass raised to the 2/3rds power. This is in close agreement with measurements of firebrand from previously published data in the literature that are obtained under controlled laboratory combustion of coniferous tress of different sizes. Also, a detailed statistical characterization of the size and shape of these firebrands are presented. A nonlinear regression model on the firebrands' data led to the generation of a set of virtual firebrands. The resulting data could be used as inputs to a Monte-Carlo simulation of firebrands' transport through the velocity field induced by the interaction of a fire plume and the atmospheric boundary layer. Moreover, it is shown that the size distribution of firebrands is more dependent on the mechanics of combustion and limb failure than on a simple geometric relationship with the tree height.

J	Shen, Haiying; Liu, Guoxin; Chandler, Harrison								Swarm Intelligence Based File Replication and Consistency Maintenance in Structured P2P File Sharing Systems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS				64	10			2953	2967		10.1109/TC.2015.2389845			OCT 2015	2015	In peer-to-peer file sharing systems, file replication helps to avoid overloading file owners and improve file query efficiency. There exists a tradeoff between minimizing the number of replicas (i.e., replication overhead) and maximizing the replica hit rate (which reduces file querying latency). More replicas lead to increased replication overhead and higher replica hit rates and vice versa. An ideal replication method should generate a low overhead burden to the system while providing low query latency to the users. However, previous replication methods either achieve high hit rates at the cost of many replicas or produce low hit rates. To reduce replicas while guaranteeing high hit rate, this paper presents SWARM, a file replication mechanism based on swarm intelligence. Recognizing the power of collective behaviors, SWARM identifies node swarms with common node interests and close proximity. Unlike most earlier methods, SWARM determines the placement of a file replica based on the accumulated query rates of nodes in a swarm rather than a single node. Replicas are shared by the nodes in a swarm, leading to fewer replicas and high querying efficiency. In addition, SWARM has a novel consistency maintenance algorithm that propagates an update message between proximity-close nodes in a tree fashion from the top to the bottom. Experimental results from the real-world PlanetLab testbed and the PeerSim simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the SWARM mechanism in comparison with other file replication and consistency maintenance methods. SWARM can reduce querying latency by 40-58 percent, reduce the number of replicas by 39-76 percent, and achieves more than 84 percent higher hit rates compared to previous methods. It also can reduce the consistency maintenance overhead by 49-99 percent compared to previous consistency maintenance methods.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9340	1557-9956		WOS:000361480400018

Also, the system reliability modelling is performed based on a new approach, which is considering values of reactive component of currents flowing through branches of the feeder and applying different feeder's failure rate models. The aim of this study is minimising total cost of the system including system power loss cost, system risk cost, investment cost and maintenance cost. Herein, in order to achieve practical outcomes, inflation and interest rates as the economic factors considered in the planning, and yearly load growth, hourly and daily varying load, and customers' load types are applied in the modelling, and also load model-based power flow is run rather than simple power flow. In this study, it is demonstrated that considering unreal model for the system load types or ignoring dependence of system reliability on the reactive component of current can significantly affect the results of the capacitor placement problem and also it can impose extra cost to the local distribution company.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1751-8687	1751-8695		WOS:000361521600007

After offering some background on 1Hood Media and a discussion of constitutive rhetoric, this study offers a close reading of 1Hood's rhetorical appeal, focusing on the ways in which the audience is constituted as both collective and individual subjects whose participation in the narrative is essential to its closure. 1Hood Media's texts focus on a diverse range of victims of injustice who suffer at the hands of police brutality and murder, and other forms of systemic oppression. The villains in these narratives are institutional forces, such as racist police forces, or corrupt Wall Street banks. By focusing on music, lyrical and visual features of 1Hood's cultural products, this study contributes to studies of popular music, hip-hop, rhetoric and cultural politics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0261-1430	1474-0095		WOS:000361304300004		
J	Granberg, Ellen M.; Simons, Leslie G.; Simons, Ronald L.								The Role of Body Size in Mate Selection among African American Young Adults								SEX ROLES				73	7-8			340	354		10.1007/s11199-015-0530-9			OCT 2015	2015	A profusion of studies have demonstrated that body size is a major factor in mate selection for both men and women. The particular role played by weight, however, has been subject to some debate, particularly with respect to the types of body sizes deemed most attractive, and scholars have questioned the degree to which body size preferences are constant across groups. In this paper, we drew from two perspectives on this issue, Sexual Strategies Theory and what we termed the cultural variability perspective, and used survey data to examine how body size was associated with both casual dating and serious romantic relationships. We used a United States sample of 386 African American adolescents and young adults between ages 16 and 21, living in the Midwest and Southeast, and who were enrolled in either high school or college. Results showed that overweight women were more likely to report casually dating than women in the thinnest weight category. Body size was not related to dating status among men. Among women, the results suggest stronger support for the cultural variability argument than for Sexual Strategies Theory. Potential explanations for these findings are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-0025	1573-2762		WOS:000361494900007	26973377	
J	Land, Tonia J.; Tyminski, Andrew M.; Drake, Corey								Examining pre-service elementary mathematics teachers' reading of educative curriculum materials								TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION				51				16	26		10.1016/j.tate.2015.05.009			OCT 2015	2015	Educative curriculum materials are intended to support teacher learning. An assumption underlying the design of educative curriculum, however, has been that teachers will read features that are designed to be educative in educative ways. This study investigated what text features 47 preservice teachers (PSTs) attended to in their reading of 5 mathematics lessons from Standards-based curriculum series and how they read those features. We found that PSTs tended to not read educative text feature in potentially educative ways and instead read them in other ways (e.g., descriptively). This study has significant implications for curriculum developers, researchers, and mathematics teacher educators. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Three different cellulosic materials were used to reinforce polyamide 6 (PA6) at three loading levels (2.5, 5 and 10 % by weight): (1) microcrystalline cellulose, (2) spray-dried cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and (3) spray-dried cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). The particle size, morphology, and thermostability of cellulose were determined using laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis. Compounding of cellulose with PA6 was conducted using a batch mixer at 232 A degrees C and testing samples were produced using an injection molder at 270 A degrees C. Slight mass loss of cellulose was observed at 232 A degrees C while serious thermal degradation occurred at 270 A degrees C. No serious thermal degradation of cellulose was observed in the composites because the cellulose materials were exposed to injection molding processing temperatures for a short time period. The mechanical testing results indicated that tensile modulus and strength of the composites were improved by adding cellulose while cellulose had negligible effect on the flexural properties. Impact strength decreased significantly by adding cellulose because of the poor distribution of cellulose particles throughout the matrix using the batch mixing process. Optimized mixing with improved distribution of cellulose are necessary to explore the potential reinforcing effect of cellulose, especially CNF and CNC in PA6. The SEM micrographs showed that there were no agglomerations among the cellulose particles, indicating that spray-dried cellulose materials could be suitable reinforcements in polymer-based composites.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0969-0239	1572-882X		WOS:000361002000028		
J	Afshinnia, Kaveh; Poursaee, Amir								The potential of ground clay brick to mitigate Alkali-Silica Reaction in mortar prepared with highly reactive aggregate								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				95				164	170		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.07.155			OCT 1 2015	2015	The objective of this work was to study the effect of ground clay brick on mitigating the Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR) in mortar bars prepared with highly reactive aggregates. To evaluate the potential of ground crushed clay brick to mitigate ASR distress in mortar, mortar bars and mortar cubes were cast with combination of different dosages of ground clay brick (partial replacement of portland cement). The pozzolanic reactivity of ground clay brick was also evaluated using strength activity index test. In addition, the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) were conducted to evaluate the microstructure and location of the ASR gel and its chemical composition. The results from this study indicated satisfactory level of pozzolanic reactivity when cement was partially replacement by the ground clay brick. Also, it was found that replacing 25% of cement with ground clay brick (by weight) could significantly decrease the ASR expansion by 67% at the age of 14 days. However, this study suggested that the compressive strength values of the specimens containing higher dosages of ground crushed brick (i.e. 50% replacement level) were significantly lower than that of the control specimens.

To accomplish this task, the thermostat valve, radiator, radiator fan(s), and water pump circulate cooling fluid through the engine block and reject heat to the local environment. Since the cooling system consumes a portion of the engine's power, it is important that its operation uses minimal input energy. In this paper, a multiple radiator fan matrix was controlled to minimize energy usage for subsequent efficiency gains. A mathematical model for the radiator fan(s) and the forced convection heat transfer process was developed to establish a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. An interior points approach was introduced to solve the minimization problem. A series of laboratory tests have been conducted with different fan and speed combinations, with the objective to cool a thermal-loaded engine. Both the mathematical approach and test results indicated similar control strategies. Based on the tests data and accompanying mathematical analysis, an optimization control strategy reduced the fan matrix power consumption by up to 67% for the specified thermal load. An improvement in cooling system performance can offer greater vehicle fuel economy to help meet legislated mobility standards.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1083-4435	1941-014X		WOS:000360831900033

The influence of inter-phosphonium spacer flexibility on the ability of the polyelectrolyte to form ordered films via layer-by-layer supramolecular assembly with anionic polythiophene and anionic poly(p-phenylenevinylene) derivatives was also assessed through a combination of UV-visible spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The more flexible ionic polymers were found to be capable of forming thicker films and to maintain growth linearity up to at least 800 bilayers in some cases.

Our results refine existing knowledge of relationships among major groups of beetles. Strepsiptera was confirmed as sister to Coleoptera and each of the suborders of Coleoptera was recovered as monophyletic. Interrelationships among the suborders, namely Polyphaga (Adephaga (Archostemata, Myxophaga)), in our study differ from previous studies. Adephaga comprised two clades corresponding to Hydradephaga and Geadephaga. The series and superfamilies of Polyphaga were mostly monophyletic. The traditional Cucujoidea were recovered in three distantly related clades. Lymexyloidea was recovered within Tenebrionoidea. Several of the series and superfamilies of Polyphaga received moderate to maximal clade support in most analyses, for example Buprestoidea, Chrysomeloidea, Coccinelloidea, Cucujiformia, Curculionoidea, Dascilloidea, Elateroidea, Histeroidea and Hydrophiloidea. However, many of the relationships within Polyphaga lacked compatible resolution under maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference, and/or lacked consistently strong nodal support. Overall, we recovered slightly younger estimated divergence times than previous studies for most groups of beetles. The ordinal split between Coleoptera and Strepsiptera was estimated to have occurred in the Early Permian. Crown Coleoptera appeared in the Late Permian, and only one or two lineages survived the end-Permian mass extinction, with stem group representatives of all four suborders appearing by the end of the Triassic. The basal split in Polyphaga was estimated to have occurred in the Triassic, with the stem groups of most series and superfamilies originating during the Triassic or Jurassic. Most extant families of beetles were estimated to have Cretaceous origins. Overall, Coleoptera experienced an increase in diversification rate compared to the rest of Neuropteroidea. Furthermore, 10 family-level clades, all in suborder Polyphaga, were identified as having experienced significant increases in diversification rate. These include most beetle species with phytophagous habits, but also several groups not typically or primarily associated with plants. Most of these groups originated in the Cretaceous, which is also when a majority of the most species-rich beetle families first appeared. An additional 12 clades showed evidence for significant decreases in diversification rate. These clades are species-poor in the Modern fauna, but collectively exhibit diverse trophic habits. The apparent success of beetles, as measured by species numbers, may result from their associations with widespread and diverse substrates - especially plants, but also including fungi, wood and leaf litter - but what facilitated these associations in the first place or has allowed these associations to flourish likely varies within and between lineages. Our results provide a uniquely well-resolved temporal and phylogenetic framework for studying patterns of innovation and diversification in Coleoptera, and a foundation for further sampling and resolution of the beetle tree of life.									37	0	0	35	0	39			0307-6970	1365-3113		WOS:000360760000009		
J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Ze; Qiu, Chenxi								A Distributed Three-Hop Routing Protocol to Increase the Capacity of Hybrid Wireless Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING				14	10						10.1109/TMC.2015.2388476			OCT 2015	2015	Hybrid wireless networks combining the advantages of both mobile ad-hoc networks and infrastructure wireless networks have been receiving increased attention due to their ultra-high performance. An efficient data routing protocol is important in such networks for high network capacity and scalability. However, most routing protocols for these networks simply combine the ad-hoc transmission mode with the cellular transmission mode, which inherits the drawbacks of ad-hoc transmission. This paper presents a Distributed Three-hop Routing protocol (DTR) for hybrid wireless networks. To take full advantage of the widespread base stations, DTR divides a message data stream into segments and transmits the segments in a distributed manner. It makes full spatial reuse of a system via its high speed ad-hoc interface and alleviates mobile gateway congestion via its cellular interface. Furthermore, sending segments to a number of base stations simultaneously increases throughput and makes full use of widespread base stations. In addition, DTR significantly reduces overhead due to short path lengths and the elimination of route discovery and maintenance. DTR also has a congestion control algorithm to avoid overloading base stations. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the superiority of DTR in comparison with other routing protocols in terms of throughput capacity, scalability, and mobility resilience. The results also show the effectiveness of the congestion control algorithm in balancing the load between base stations.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1536-1233	1558-0660		WOS:000360744700001

The good stability of sesame seed oil against autoxidation has been ascribed not only to its inherent lignans and tocopherols but also to browning reaction products generated when sesame seeds are roasted. Also, there is a strong synergistic effect among these components. The lignans in sesame seed oil can be categorized into two types, i.e. inherent lignans (sesamin, sesamolin) and lignans mainly formed during the oil production process (sesamol, sesamolinol, etc.). The most abundant tocopherol in sesame seed oil is -tocopherol. This article reviews the antioxidant activities of lignans and tocopherols as well as the browning reaction and its products in sesame seed and/or its oil. It is concluded that the composition and structure of browning reaction products and their impacts on sesame ingredients need to be further studied to better explain the remaining mysteries of sesame oil.

Combined with passband filter operation, the modified RF interferometer effectively expands its frequency coverage. A simple model is described to analyze and predict interferometer performance. A high-pass filter and a low-pass filter are designed and built to demonstrate the interferometer operation as well as to verify the model over a frequency of 1-4 GHz. Lossy materials are shown to significantly degrade filter sensitivity enhancement effects due to reduced group delay and lower RF fields.

Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs), derived from glutaraldehyde crosslinked (GLUT) porcine aortic valve leaflets or bovine pericardium are often used. However, valve failure can occur within 12-15 years due to calcification and/or progressive degeneration. In this study, we have developed a novel fabrication method that utilizes carbodiimide, neomycin trisulfate, and pentagalloyl glucose crosslinking chemistry (TRI) to better stabilize the extracellular matrix of porcine aortic valve leaflets. We demonstrate that TRI treated leaflets show similar biomechanics to GLUT crosslinked leaflets. TRI treated leaflets had better resistance to enzymatic degradation in vitro and demonstrated better tearing toughness after challenged with enzymatic degradation. When implanted subcutaneously in rats for up to 90 days, GLUT control leaflets calcified heavily while TRI treated leaflets resisted calcification, retained more ECM components, and showed better biocompatibility.

J	Tsai, Kuo-Pei								Effects of two copper compounds on Microcystis aeruginosa cell density, membrane integrity, and microcystin release								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				120				428	435		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.06.024			OCT 2015	2015	Microcystin release following Microcystis aeruginosa cell lysis after copper-based algaecide treatment is often cited as a concern leading to restricted use of algaecide in restoration of natural water resources. To examine this concern, bench-scale experiments were conducted to study responses of M. aeruginosa to 8-day copper exposures as copper sulfate and copper ethanolamine (Cu-EA). M aeruginosa UTEX 2385 was cultured in BG11 medium to cell density of 10(6) cells/mL with total and extracellular microcystin of 93 and 53 mu g/L, respectively. Exposures of copper concentration ranged from 40 to 1000 mu g Cu/L. Cell membrane integrity was indicated by etythrosine B. In the end of experiment, total microcystin and cell density in untreated control (313 mu g/L and 10(7) cells/mL) was 33 and 10 times greater than pretreatment value, respectively. Minimum amount of copper required to reduce M. aeruginosa population within 8 days was 160 mu g Cu/L as copper sulfate and 80 mu g Cu/L as Cu-EA, where total and extracellular microcystin concentrations (47 and 44 mu g/L for copper sulfate; 56 and 44 mu g/L for Cu EA) were degraded with degradation rate coefficient 0.1 day(-1) and were less than pretreatment values. Given a copper concentration at 80 mu g Cu/L as Cu-EA, M. aeruginosa cells were intact and less microcystin were released compared to treatments at 160-1000 mu g Cu/L, where lysed cells and relatively greater microcystin release were observed. Based on the laboratory results, a minimum amount of copper required for reducing M. aeruginosa population could decrease total microcystin concentration and not compromise cells and minimize microcystin release.

J	Yang, Qingbo; Chen, Sisi; Shi, Honglan; Xiao, Hai; Ma, Yinfa								In vitro study of improved wound-healing effect of bioactive borate-based glass nano-/micro-fibers								MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				55				105	117		10.1016/j.msec.2015.05.049			OCT 1 2015	2015	Because of the promising wound-healing capability, bioactive glasses have been considered as one of the next generation hard- and soft-tissue regeneration materials. The lack of understanding of the substantial mechanisms, however, indicates the need for further study on cell-glass interactions to better interpret the rehabilitation capability. In the present work, three bioactive glass nano-/micro-fibers, silicate-based 45S5, borate-based 13-93B3 and 1605 (additionally doped with copper oxide and zinc oxide), were firstly compared for their in vitro soaking/conversion rate. The results of elemental monitoring and electron microscopic characterization demonstrated that quicker ion releasing and glass conversion occurred in borate-based fibers than that of silicate-based one. This result was also reflected by the formation speed of hydroxyapatite (HA). This process was further correlated with original boron content and surrounding rheological condition. We showed that an optimal fiber pre-soaking time (or an ideal dynamic flow rate) should exist to stimulate the best cell proliferation and migration ability. Moreover, 13-93B3 and 1605 fibers showed different glass conversion and biocompatibility properties as well, indicating that trace amount variation in composition can also influence fiber's bioactivity. In sum, our in vitro theological module closely simulated in vivo niche environment and proved a potentially improved wound-healing effect by borate-based glass fibers, and the results shall cast light on future improvement in bioactive glass fabrication.

Entamoeba histolytica Dmc1 Catalyzes Homologous DNA Pairing and Strand Exchange That Is Stimulated by Calcium and Hop2-Mnd1								PLOS ONE				10	9					e0139399	10.1371/journal.pone.0139399			SEP 30 2015	2015	Meiosis depends on homologous recombination (HR) in most sexually reproducing organisms. Efficient meiotic HR requires the activity of the meiosis-specific recombinase, Dmc1. Previous work shows Dmc1 is expressed in Entamoeba histolytica, a eukaryotic parasite responsible for amoebiasis throughout the world, suggesting this organism undergoes meiosis. Here, we demonstrate Dmc1 protein is expressed in E. histolytica. We show that purified ehDmc1 forms presynaptic filaments and catalyzes ATP-dependent homologous DNA pairing and DNA strand exchange over at least several thousand base pairs. The DNA pairing and strand exchange activities are enhanced by the presence of calcium and the meiosis-specific recombination accessory factor, Hop2-Mnd1. In combination, calcium and Hop2-Mnd1 dramatically increase the rate of DNA strand exchange activity of ehDmc1. The biochemical system described herein provides a basis on which to better understand the role of ehDmc1 and other HR proteins in E. histolytica.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000362175700112	26422142

Durability of concrete incorporating crushed brick as coarse aggregate								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				94				426	432		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.07.056			SEP 30 2015	2015	Using crushed bricks as coarse aggregates in concrete is of particular interest to preserve natural aggregate sources as well as to reduce waste and waste storage. The objective of this experimental work was to study the durability of reinforced concrete made with crushed brick as aggregate. For this purpose, a comparative study was performed on the durability properties of concrete made with crushed brick as coarse aggregates and with natural aggregates. Results show that the natural coarse aggregates can be replaced by crushed bricks, without significant change in the durability of concrete when the steel is not present. However, when concrete is reinforced with steel, replacing natural aggregates with crushed brick is not recommended. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Kenneth								Evidence for the Intercalation of Lipid Acyl Chains into Polypropylene Fiber Matrices								LANGMUIR				31	38			10418	10425		10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b01964			SEP 29 2015	2015	Headgroup-functionalized lipids are being developed as ligand tethers for high selectivity separations on polypropylene capillary-channeled polymer fiber stationary phases. Surface modification is affected under ambient conditions from aqueous solution. This basic methodology has promise in many areas where robust modifications are desired on hydrophobic surfaces. In order to understand the mode of adsorption of the lipid tail to the polypropylene surface, lipids labeled with the environmentally sensitive 7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl (NBD) fluorophore were used, with NBD covalently attached to the headgroup (NBD-PE) or the acyl chain (acyl NBD-PE) of the lipid. When modified with the acyl NBD-PE, fluorescence imaging of the fiber at excitation wavelengths increasing from 470 to 510 nm caused a 32 nm shift in emission toward the red edge of the absorption band, indicating that the NBD molecule (and thus the lipid tail) is motionally restricted. Fluorescence imaging on fibers modified with NBD-PE or the free NBD-Cl dye molecule yields no change in the emission response. The results of these imaging studies provide evidence that the acyl chain portions of the lipids intercalate into free volume, of the polypropylene fiber structure, yielding a robust means of surface modification and the potential for high ligand densities.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0743-7463			WOS:000362243600012	26381380

Solvent controlled ion association in structured copolymers: Molecular dynamics simulations in dilute solutions								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				143	12					124905	10.1063/1.4931657			SEP 28 2015	2015	Tailoring the nature of individual segments within ion containing block co-polymers is one critical design tool to achieve desired properties. The local structure including the size and distribution of the ionic blocks, as well as the long range correlations, are crucial for their transport ability. Here, we present molecular dynamics simulations on the effects of varying the concentrations of the ionizable groups on the conformations of pentablock ionomer that consist of a center block of ionic sulfonated styrene tethered to polyethylene and terminated by a bulky substituted styrene in dilute solutions. Sulfonation fractions f (0 <= f <= 0.55), spanning the range from ionomer to polyelectrolytes, were studied. Results for the equilibrium conformation of the chains in water and a 1: 1 mixture of cyclohexane and heptane are compared to that in implicit poor solvents with dielectric constants epsilon = 1.0 and 77.73. In water, the pentablock collapses with the sulfonated groups on the outer surface. As f increases, the ionic, center block increasingly segregates from the hydrophobic regions. In the 1: 1 mixture of cyclohexane and heptane, the flexible blocks swell, while the center ionic block collapses for f > 0. For f = 0, all blocks swell. In both implicit poor solvents, the pentablock collapses into a nearly spherical shape for all f. The sodium counterions disperse widely throughout the simulation cell for both water and epsilon = 77.73, whereas for epsilon = 1.0 and mixture of cyclohexane and heptane, the counterions largely condense onto the collaps ed pentablock.

Aggregation and Association of NDVI, Boll Injury, and Stink Bugs in North Carolina Cotton								JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE				15						134	10.1093/jisesa/iev119			SEP 27 2015	2015	Sampling of herbivorous stink bugs in southeastern U.S. cotton remains problematic. Remote sensing was explored to improve sampling of these pests and associated boll injury. Two adjacent 14.5-ha cotton fields were grid sampled in 2011 and 2012 by collecting stink bug adults and bolls every week during the third, fourth, and fifth weeks of bloom. Satellite remote sensing data were collected during the third week of bloom during both years, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were calculated. Stink bugs were spatially aggregated on the third week of bloom in 2011. Boll injury from stink bugs was spatially aggregated during the fourth week of bloom in 2012. The NDVI values were aggregated during both years. There was a positive association and correlation between stink bug numbers and NDVI values, as well as injured bolls and NDVI values, during the third week of bloom in 2011. During the third week of bloom in 2012, NDVI values were negatively correlated with stink bug numbers. During the fourth week of bloom in 2011, stink bug numbers and boll injury were both positively associated and correlated with NDVI values. During the fourth week of bloom in 2012, stink bugs were negatively correlated with NDVI values, and boll injury was negatively associated and correlated with NDVI values. This study suggests the potential of remote sensing as a tool to assist with sampling stink bugs in cotton, although more research is needed using NDVI and other plant measurements to predict stink bug injury.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1536-2442	2250-2645		WOS:000361889800004		
J	Underwood, Nicolas G.; Valentini, Antony								Quantum field theory of relic nonequilibrium systems								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				92	6					063531	10.1103/PhysRevD.92.063531			SEP 23 2015	2015	In terms of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory, we develop field-theoretical models of quantum nonequilibrium systems which could exist today as relics from the very early Universe. We consider relic excited states generated by inflaton decay, as well as relic vacuum modes, for particle species that decoupled close to the Planck temperature. Simple estimates suggest that, at least in principle, quantum nonequilibrium could survive to the present day for some relic systems. The main focus of this paper is to describe the behavior of such systems in terms of field theory, with the aim of understanding how relic quantum nonequilibrium might manifest experimentally. We show by explicit calculation that simple perturbative couplings will transfer quantum nonequilibrium from one field to another (for example from the inflaton field to its decay products). We also show that fields in a state of quantum nonequilibrium will generate anomalous spectra for standard energy measurements. Possible connections to current astrophysical observations are briefly addressed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1550-7998	1550-2368		WOS:000361673100003

Evidence for the Convergence Model: The Emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) in Viet Nam								PLOS ONE				10	9					e0138138	10.1371/journal.pone.0138138			SEP 23 2015	2015	Building on a series of ground breaking reviews that first defined and drew attention to emerging infectious diseases (EID), the 'convergence model' was proposed to explain the multifactorial causality of disease emergence. The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model's predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000361797500053	26398118	
J	Stride, Christopher; Thomas, Ffion; Ramshaw, Gregory								Standing Out from the Crowd: Imaging Baseball Fans through Sculpture								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF SPORT				32	14	SI		1611	1641		10.1080/09523367.2015.1038521			SEP 22 2015	2015	Sculptures of athletes that immortalize heroic feats have long been part of the sporting world. More recently, statues of sports fans have appeared, particularly at baseball stadiums across North America. Whilst athlete statues usually represent specific subjects, fan statues typically depict anonymous figures, giving commissioners and sculptors broader license to incorporate particular ideals. This paper investigates how the fan statuary's form reflects commissioners' motivations, values, and views of fandom, and whether fan statues promote a preferred (but often imaginary) narrative regarding the fan experience. A tripartite fan statue design typology is proposed: hero worship, family experiences, and the crowd. By examining an example of each type, with context provided by a unique database of baseball statuary, the fan statuary's predominant themes and tensions are illustrated. Fan statues are concentrated at Minor League ballparks, and all feature children. The majority are alloys of both real and imagined components of the idealized fan experience of the baseball organization's 'ideal fan', projecting inclusive, family-friendly, and timeless game day experiences, and evoking nostalgia for childhood. Crowd-type statues offer a more free-spirited and spontaneous aesthetic, with the crowd creating and becoming part of the spectacle - a reality that sports organizations may be less comfortable with.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0952-3367	1743-9035		WOS:000370515900001		
J	Glenn, D. Michael; Gasic, Ksenija								Influence of within year treatments and between year environmental differences on peach leaf ash and carbon isotopic discrimination responses								SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE				193				258	260		10.1016/j.scienta.2015.07.028			SEP 22 2015	2015	Plant ash content is related to water use efficiency (WUE) (dry matter accumulation per unit of transpiration) and Delta C-13 in a range of C-3 species. In breeding programs, the genetic X environment interaction is measured with multiple locations and multiple years of evaluation but the genetic X environment interaction of ash or Delta C-13 has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess how within year cultural variation and yearly environmental variation affect peach leaf ash and carbon discrimination as measures of water use efficiency using cultural practices evaluated over a 13 year period of time. 'Loring' peach (Prunus persica) on seedling 'Halford' rootstock were planted in 1983 in a 4.5 m x 6 m spacing in square vegetation-free-areas (VFA) around each tree (0.36 and 13.0 m(2)). Three irrigation treatments (none, drip irrigated during stage 3 of fruit development, and fertigation during stage 3 of fruit development) were imposed on each VFA. Leaf ash and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) were measured in leaf tissue collected prior to harvest. Analysis of variance indicated that there were no differences in VFA or irrigation for either ash or Delta C-13, however there were yearly interactions. Delta C-13 was significantly related to the growing season pan evaporation but the slope was low indicating a minimal response while leaf ash was not significantly related. In contrast, leaf ash was significantly related to the growing season rainfall amount while Delta C-13 was unrelated. Both leaf ash and Delta C-13 were unrelated to the growing season water deficit. The coefficient of variation for leaf ash and Delta C-13 are 0.16 and 0.04, respectively, over a 13 year sampling period. These data suggest that breeding programs screening for increased water use efficiency using leaf ash or Delta C-13 can anticipate a minimal amount of within location variation and thus place more emphasis on environmental or between-location variation.

DeID - a data sharing tool for neuroimaging studies								FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE				9							10.3389/fnins.2015.00325			SEP 22 2015	2015	Funding institutions and researchers increasingly expect that data will be shared to increase scientific integrity and provide other scientists with the opportunity to use the data with novel methods that may advance understanding in a particular field of study. In practice, sharing human subject data can be complicated because data must be de identified prior to sharing. Moreover, integrating varied data types collected in a study can be challenging and time consuming. For example, sharing data from structural imaging studies of a complex disorder requires the integration of imaging, demographic and/or behavioral data in a way that no subject identifiers are included in the de-identified dataset and with new subject labels or identification values that cannot be tracked back to the original ones. We have developed a Java program that users can use to remove identifying information in neuroimaging datasets, while still maintaining the association among different data types from the same subject for further studies. This software provides a series of user interaction wizards to allow users to select data variables to be de-identified, implements functions for auditing and validation of de-identified data, and enables the user to share the de-identified data in a single compressed package through various communication protocols, such as FTPS and SFTP. DelD runs with Windows. Linux, and Mac operating systems and its open architecture allows it to be easily adapted to support a broader array of data types, with the goal of facilitating data sharing.

The overall influence of polymer binder on the anode supports was evaluated. Sulfide impurity in the anode substrate was identified when sulfur-containing PESf was used as the polymer binder. Single cells based on different anode supports were characterized in anode-supported MT-SOFCs with the cell configuration of Ni-BZCYYb anode, BZCYYb proton-conducting electrolyte and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-BZCYYb cathode at 650 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 550 degrees C, using humidified hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant. MT-SOFCs of the anode fabricated using PEI show maximum power density of 0.45 Wcm(-2), 0.34 Wcm(-2) and 0.23 Wcm(-2) at 650 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 550 degrees C respectively, compared with 0.35 Wcm(-2), 0.27 Wcm(-2) and 0.18 Wcm(-2) for cells fabricated with PESE The difference in cell performance was attributed to the phase purity of the anode fabricated by different polymer binders. Sulfur-free polymer binder PEI exhibits advantages over the commonly applied PESf and other sulfur-free polymer binders, pointing to a new direction in the fabrication of micro-tubular oxide substrates for energy conversion and storage.

The equilibrium aggregate modulus and hydraulic permeability between the central and lateral regions were examined by confined compression testing. Biochemical assays were conducted to quantify the amount of water, collagen, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG). The equilibrium aggregate modulus of the CEP in the central region (0.23 +/- 0.15 MPa) was significantly lower than for the lateral region (0.83 +/- 0.26 MPa). No significant regional difference was found for the permeability of the CEP (central region: 0.13 +/- 0.07 x 10(-15) m(4)/N s and lateral region: 0.09 +/- 0.03 x 10(-15) m(4)/N s). CEPs were an average of 75.6% water by wet weight, 41.1% collagen, and 20.4% GAG by dry weight in the central region, as well as an average of 70.2% water by wet weight, 73.8% collagen, and 11.7% GAG by dry weight in the lateral region. Regional differences observed for the equilibrium aggregate modulus were likely due to the regional variation in biochemical composition. The lateral bovine endplate is much stiffer and may share a greater portion of the load. Compared with the nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF), a smaller hydraulic permeability was found for the CEP in both the central and lateral regions, which could be due to its lower water content and higher collagen content. Our results suggest that the CEP may block rapid fluid exchange and solute convection, allow pressurization of the interstitial fluid, and play a significant role in nutrient supply in response to loading.

Due to the unavailability of a commercial watermelon variety that is resistant to PM, grafting susceptible cultivars on wild resistant rootstocks is being explored as a short-term management strategy to combat this disease. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolic profiles of susceptible and resistant rootstocks of watermelon and their corresponding susceptible scions (Mickey Lee) were compared to screen for potential metabolites related to PM resistance using multivariate principal component analysis. Significant score plot differences between the susceptible and resistant groups were revealed through Mahalanobis distance analysis. Significantly different spectral buckets and their corresponding metabolites (including choline, fumarate, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetate, and melatonin) have been identified quantitatively using multivariate loading plots and verified by volcano plot analyses. The data suggest that these metabolites were translocated from the powdery mildew resistant rootstocks to their corresponding powdery mildew susceptible scions and can be related to PM disease resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000361502000024	26302171

The number of microplastics was counted by a fluorescence microscope, an instrument that is rarely used in the detection of microplastics in sediments. This instrument led to results that were satisfactory. Compared with other sampled areas, microplastics were found in massive concentrations in China. Four types of microplastics, HOPE, PET, PE and PS, were identified. The results will provide useful background information for further investigations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Estrogen (E2), as a steroid hormone, is a highly pleiotropic agent; with anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neurotrophic properties, it is ideal for use in treatment of patients with SCI. Safety concerns around the use of high doses of E2 have limited clinical application, however. To address these concerns, low doses of E2 (25 mu g and 2.5 mu g) were focally delivered to the injured spinal cord using nanoparticles. A per-acute model (6 h after injury) was used to assess nanoparticle release of E2 into damaged spinal cord tissue; in addition, E2 was evaluated as a rapid anti-inflammatory. To assess inflammation, 27-plex cytokine/chemokine arrays were conducted in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and spinal cord tissue. A particular focus was placed on IL-6, GRO-KC, and MCP-1 as these have been identified from CSF in human studies as potential biomarkers in SCI. S100 beta, an additional proposed biomarker, was also assessed in spinal cord tissue only. Tissue concentrations of E2 were double those found in the plasma, indicating focal release. E2 showed rapid anti-inflammatory effects, significantly reducing interleukin (IL)-6, GRO-KC, MCP-1, and S100 beta in one or all compartments. Numerous additional targets of rapid E2 modulation were identified including: leptin, MIP-1 alpha, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, IFN gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, etc. These data further elucidate the rapid anti-inflammatory effects E2 exerts in an acute rat SCI model, have identified additional targets of estrogen efficacy, and suggest nanoparticle delivered estrogen may provide a safe and efficacious treatment option in persons with acute SCI.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0897-7151	1557-9042		WOS:000360828900004	25845398

The use of chemical disinfection is necessary in desalination plants for pre-treatment to control both biofouling as well as the post-disinfection of desalinated water. Although chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant in desalination plants, its reaction with organic matter produces various disinfection by-products (DBPs) (e.g., trihalomethanes [THMs], haloacetic acids [HAAs], and haloacetonitriles [HAN]), and some DBPs are regulated in many countries due to their potential risks to public health. To reduce the formation of chlorinated DBPs, alternative oxidants (disinfectants) such as chloramines, chlorine dioxide, and ozone can be considered, but they also produce other types of DBPs. In addition, due to high levels of bromide and iodide concentrations in seawater, highly cytotoxic and genotoxic DBP species (i.e., brominated and iodinated DBPs) may form in distribution systems, especially when desalinated water is blended with other source waters having higher levels of organic matter. This article reviews the knowledge accumulated in the last few decades on DBP formation during seawater desalination, and summarizes in detail, the occurrence of DBPs in various thermal and membrane plants involving different desalination processes. The review also identifies the current challenges and future research needs for controlling DBP formation in seawater desalination plants and to reduce the potential toxicity of desalinated water.

The poly-parameter LSER model was also compared to those previously generated for the adsorption of aromatic compounds by CNTs. The adsorption affinity of aliphatic compounds was greater on the SWCNT than MWCNT with similar oxygen contents. This was attributed to the pore-filling mechanism that was enhanced by higher micropore volume of the SWCNT bundles over the MWCNT bundles. LSER models showed that, at higher concentrations, B (the hydrogen bond accepting ability) was the most influential descriptor for both SWCNT and MWCNT. Other important descriptors were V followed by P, both of which exhibited a positive correlation with adsorption, indicating that their size and polarizability favors adsorption. The contribution of these descriptors to overall adsorption was 2-3 times less than the B. In comparison, V was the most important descriptor in the aromatic compound LSER models. This difference indicates that adsorbate hydrophobicity greatly affects the adsorption of aromatic compounds by CNTs, whereas, aliphatic compounds are affected by both the hydrophobic driving force and other interactions.

Both their phase and stoichiometry were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The Seebeck coefficient, S, and electrical resistivity, q, increase with increasing temperature for all specimens over the entire measured temperature range. The thermal conductivity for the two low Ba content specimens decreases with increasing temperature up to 550 K at which point it increases with temperature due to bipolar diffusion. Bipolar diffusion becomes negligible with increasing Ba content. Due to this low bipolar diffusion, the ZT values of the higher Ba content specimens increase linearly with temperature, with the highest ZT value obtained for Ba0.9Yb0.1Fe3CoSb12.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000361630700004

The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies indicated the evolution of nucleation centers (spherical) into nanocubes with the addition of the Pb and Te atoms. The spark plasma sintered PbTe nanocubes exhibited an enhanced Seebeck coefficient, S > +400 mu V, higher than the reported values of the bulk PbTe over an extended temperature range of 300-425 K, and a moderate electrical conductivity, sigma similar to 8000 S/m at 300 K. A significant reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity was observed due to effective phonon scattering from the presence of numerous interfaces introduced by nanostructuring. The resulting figure-of-merit (ZT) similar to 0.45 at 300 K is higher than the reported values at this temperature in other PbTe nanostructures. Moreover, a moderate thermoelectric compatibility factor makes the PbTe nanocubes a potential candidate for green energy generation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000361630700013

We show that the polytropic index is the derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure. We then augment the traditional polytrope theory by including a variable polytrope index within the confines of the Lane-Emden differential equation. To investigate the possibilities of this method, we create a high-quality universal equation of state, transforming the traditional polytrope method to a tool with the potential for excellent predictive power. The theoretical foundation of our equation of state is the same elastic observable which we found equivalent to the polytrope index, the derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure. We calculate the density-pressure of six common materials up to 10(18) Pa, mass-radius relationships for the same materials, and produce plausible density-radius models for the rocky planets of our Solar system. We argue that the bulk modulus and its derivatives have been underutilized in previous planet formation methods. We constrain the material surface observables for the inner core, outer core, and mantle of planet Earth in a systematic way including pressure, bulk modulus, and the polytrope index in the analysis. We believe that this variable polytrope method has the necessary apparatus to be extended further to gas giants and stars. As supplemental material we provide computer code to calculate multi-layered planets.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000360851900023

Zootaxa				4015	1			1	177					Sep 11 2015	2015	Short-horned lizards (Phrynosoma douglasii species complex) occur throughout the inter-montane West and Great Plains of western North America. The comparative morphology and color pattern variation of short-horned lizards was studied in 3,174 specimens. Multivariate analyses of 20 morphological and color-pattern characters were applied to 977 specimens, and univariate statistics were summarized for 52 samples totaling 1,134 specimens. The results of the morphological data analyses support the recognition of P. douglasii (Bell 1828) as a distinct species, and the resurrection of P. brevirostris Girard 1858a and P. ornatissimum Girard 1858a as species distinct from P. hernandesi Girard 1858a. Two new species allied to P. brevirostris are described: P. bauri sp. nov. from the eastern plains of Colorado and northeastern New Mexico, southeastern Wyoming and southwestern Nebraska south of the North Platte River, and P. diminutum sp. nov. endemic to the San Luis Valley of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. The Mexican taxon brachycercum Smith 1942 is reassigned as a subspecies of P. ornatissimum, based on non-discrete character differences and overall morphometric similarity. The ranges of P. hernandesi and P. ornatissimum broadly overlap in central New Mexico, the former taxon occupying the coniferous forests of disjunct mountain ranges, the latter occuring in the surrounding desert grasslands. Principal components analysis has revealed morphological evidence of hybridization where the two taxa meet, generally within ecotones between montane forest associations and grasslands. Principal components analysis has also revealed a high level of morphological variability in populations occurring in the Colorado Plateau region of northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, extreme southwestern Colorado and adjacent Utah. The evidence suggests that these populations arose through past hybridization between the two species. The taxon ornatum Girard 1858b, although sharing several traits with P. brevirostris, is morphologically close to P. hernandesi. It is regarded as a stabilized population of hybrid origin, but treated taxonomically as a subspecies of P. hernandesi. The taxonomic arrangement in this study, with the exception of P. douglasii, is largely discordant with the proposed taxonomy from a previously published study based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1175-5326; 1175-5334			ZOOREC:ZOOR15111078348	26624023

(NYMPHALIDAE) AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO FLUID UPTAKE								JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS SOCIETY				69	3			183	191					SEP 9 2015	2015	The morphometrics of proboscises of Vanessa cardui were examined to determine potential allometric growth relationships. Butterfly mass and six proboscis measurements were recorded from V. cardui reared on artificial diet treatments, in conjunction with fluid uptake rates. Log10 transformed data revealed negative allometry with proboscis length, butterfly mass, and drinking region length as the independent variables. Fluid uptake rates, however, had a nearly isometric relationship with most proboscis measurements, but not the total number of sensilla styloconica, which indicated inverse allometry with fluid uptake rates. The patterns exposed here show that the studied proboscis structures are important predictors for fluid uptake, but the selection pressures associated with feeding strategies and the substrates from which V. cardui feed favor a particular proboscis architecture, deviations from this configuration might require different feeding strategies and food sources.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0024-0966			WOS:000361422000004		
J	Yu, Xubiao; Wei, Chaohai; Wu, Haizhen; Jiang, Zhengming; Xu, Ranghua								Improvement of biodegradability for coking wastewater by selective adsorption of hydrophobic organic pollutants								SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY				151				23	30		10.1016/j.seppur.2015.07.007			SEP 4 2015	2015	As a typical industrial wastewater, coking wastewater is characterized as high organic load, complicated composition and strong biological inhibition. Based on the analysis between organic composition and toxicity contribution of coking wastewater, a selective removal for targeting hydrophobic contaminants was conducted by organic modified acid-vermiculites (Chlorotrimethylsilane modification, CTMS-V; and Chlorotriethysilane modification, CTES-V), powdered activated carbon (PAC) and XAD-16 polymer adsorbent. Binary solution containing hydrophilic (phenol) and hydrophobic (diethyl phthalate, DEP) compounds was employed to evaluate the performance of selective adsorption then coking wastewater was further tested. Results of binary adsorption indicated that the average adsorption percentages of DEP for PAC, XAD-16, CTMS-V and CTES-V were 32.6 +/- 11.1%, 50.8 +/- 17.4%, 68.7 +/- 22.6%, 75.5 +/- 27.4% (mean standard deviation, n = 5) at varying phenol:DEP ratios (10-100, mol:mol). Coking wastewater treated by PAC, XAD-16 CTMS-V and CTES-V had a decrease of chemical oxygen demand (COD) at 24.6 +/- 3.0%, 11.3 +/- 1.5%, 4.4 +/- 0.08% and 6.8 +/- 1.1%. For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), PAC and XAD-16 gave a decrease of 47.5 +/- 5.6% and 7.8 +/- 1.4%, whereas CTMS-V and CTES-V gave an increase of 36.7 +/- 4.1% and 57.2 +/- 4.6%, respectively. The resulting BOD5:COD were 0.21 +/- 0.03, 0.31 +/- 0.04, 0.42 +/- 0.05 and 0.50 +/- 0.05 after treatment by PAC, XAD-16, CTMS-V and CTES-V, respectively. Post incubation of treated coking wastewater showed that the residual TOC after ten-day incubation were 73.1 +/- 1.5%, 77.9 +/- 3.5%, 73.2 +/- 3.7% and 59.2 +/- 3.0% for PAC, XAD-16 CTMS-V and CTES-V, respectively. The non-it functional surface (i.e., -CH3 and -CH2CH3) of modified acid-vermiculites played a critical role for capturing hydrophobic compounds from the solution with high concentration of hydrophilic competitive compounds.

In this study, surface modified PET C-CP fibers were evaluated for the anion exchange separation of proteins. The native PET C-CP fibers were aminated using polyethylenimine (PEI) followed by a 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BUDGE) cross-linking step. Subsequent PEI/BUDGE treatments can be employed to further develop the polyamine layer on the fiber surfaces. The PEI densities of the modified fibers were quantified through the ninhydrin reaction, yielding values of 0.43-0.89 mu mol g(-1). The surface modification impact on column permeability was found to be 0.66 x 10(-11) to 1.33 x 10(-11) m(2), depending on the modification time and conditions. The dynamic binding capacities of the modified fiber media were determined to be 1.99-8.54 mg mL(-1) bed volume, at linear velocities of 88-438 cm min(-1) using bovine serum albumin as the model protein. It was found that increasing the mobile phase linear velocity (up to 438 cm min-1) had no effect on the separation quality for a synthetic protein mixture, reflecting the lack of van Deemter C-term effects for the C-CP fiber phase. The low-cost, easy modification method and the capability of fast protein separation illustrate great potential in the use of PEI/BUDGE-modified PET C-CP fibers for high-throughput protein separation and downstream processing.

To date most nanophases are binary, while reports on ternary nanoinclusions are scarce. In this work, we conducted an exploratory study of introducing ternary (Ag2Te)(x)(Sb2Te3)(1-x) inclusions in the host matrix of Yb0.25Co4Sb12. Yb0.25Co4Sb12-4vvt% (Ag2Te)(x)(Sb2Te3)(1-x) nanocomposites were prepared by a melting-milling-hot-pressing process. Microstructural analysis showed that poly-dispersed nanosized Ag-Sb-Te inclusions are distributed on the grain boundaries of Yb0.25Co4Sb12 coarse grains. Compared to the pristine nanoinclusion-free sample, the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity were optimized simultaneously upon nanocompositing, while the carrier mobility was largely remained. A maximum ZT of 1.3 was obtained in Yb0.25Co4Sb12-4wt% (Ag2Te)(0.42)(Sb2Te3)(0.58) at 773 K, a similar to 40% increase compared to the pristine sample. The electron and phonon mean-free-path were estimated to help quantify the observed changes in the carrier mobility and lattice thermal conductivity.									1	0	0	0	0	1				2296-2646		WOS:000373364100001	26389111

We have proposed elsewhere that the subjective nature of judging the worth of a goal may on occasion lead to bad courage: When an actor voluntarily assumes personal risk for a goal he or she believes is noble but society views as a wrong. Twenty publicly available first person written statements or transcripts made before or during a suicide attempt (n=12) or a terrorist action or spree killing (n=8) were coded for the presence or absence of key defining features of courage (Volition, Risk, and Value of the Goal). Volition was found in 75% of the narratives, Risk in 50%, and Value of the Goal in 80%. All three types of statements were present in 40% of narratives, providing evidence that bad courage can and does occur. Implications for courage interventions are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-9760	1743-9779		WOS:000358149200001

For the cancer cell lines, the cellular uptake of the carbon dots was generally efficient, resulting in the labeling of the cells with bright fluorescence emissions for both one- and two-photon excitations from predominantly the cell membrane and cytoplasm. In the exploration on labeling the live stem cells, the cellular uptake of the carbon dots was relatively less efficient, though fluorescence emissions could still be adequately detected in the labeled cells, with the emissions again predominantly from the cell membrane and cytoplasm. This combined with the observed more efficient internalization of the same carbon dots by the fixed stem cells might suggest some significant selectivity of the stem cells toward surface functionalities of the carbon dots. The needs and possible strategies for more systematic and comparative studies on the fluorescence labeling of different cells, including especially live stem cells, by carbon dots as a new class of brightly fluorescent probes are discussed.									20	1	0	5	0	20			1944-8244			WOS:000360868700066	26262834

In terms of applications, we concentrate on enrichment polymer layers (EPLs), which are polymer thin films employed in sensor devices for the detection of chemical and biological substances. Specifically, we have studied the influence of gamma irradiation on nanoscale poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) grafted EPL films. First, it was determined that a significant level of cross-linking was caused by irradiation in pure PGMA films. The cross-linking is accompanied by the formation of conjugated ester, carbon double bonds, hydroxyl groups, ketone carbonyls, and the elimination of epoxy groups as determined by FTIR. Polystyrene, 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl, dimethylphenylsilanol, nanoparticles were incorporated into the films and were found to mitigate different aspects of the radiation BaF2, and gold damage.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244			WOS:000360868700068	26259102

Gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) with the method of aroma intensity (AI) was employed to investigate the aroma-active compounds in tea infusions. The results presented forty-three, forty-five, and forty-eight aroma-active compounds in the TGY, DHP, and DDWL infusions, including six, seven, and five sulfur compounds, respectively. In addition, the concentration of volatile compounds in the tea infusions was further quantitated by solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography (SPME)-GC-MS and SPME-GC-flame photometric detection (FPD). Totally, seventy-six and thirteen volatile and sulfur compounds were detected in three types of tea infusions, respectively. Quantitative results showed that forty-seven aroma compounds were at concentrations higher than their corresponding odor thresholds. On the basis of the odor activity values (OAVs), 2-methylpropanal (OAV: 230-455), 3-methylbutanal (1-353), 2-methylbutanal (34-68), nerolidol (108-184), (E)-2-heptenal (148-294), hexanal (134-230), octanal (28-131), beta-damascenone (29-59), indole (96-138), 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (34-67), (R)-(-)-linalool (63-87), and dimethyl sulfide (7-1320) presented relatively higher OAVs than those of other compounds, indicating the importance of these compounds in the overall aroma of tea infusions.									6	3	0	4	0	9			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000360866500006	26257073

This paper presents findings from a case study research intervention with 5 th grade students at an arts magnet school in a small urban municipality in the Southeastern United States. This research iteration is part of a larger, ongoing design-based research project, pioneering the design, development, and testing of a virtual environment and associated curriculum for blending creative movement and computer programming for upper elementary and middle school students. After conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis, researchers found students' computational knowledge improved through their engagements in a "constellation" of multimodal literacy practices (Steinkuehler, 2007, n.p.) during the process of choreographing and programming a complimentary virtual character's movements based on a 5 th grade biology standard about cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-9035			WOS:000379653500005

Interspecific hybridization among crocodiles is known to occur in captivity and has been documented between some species in the wild. The identification of hybrid individuals is of importance for management and monitoring of crocodilians, many of which are Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) listed. In this study, both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers were evaluated for their use in confirming a suspected hybrid zone between American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) populations in southern Belize where individuals and nests exhibiting atypical phenotypic features had previously been observed. Patterns observed in both phenotypic and molecular data indicate possible behavioural and ecological characteristics associated with hybridization events. The results of the combined analyses found that the majority of suspected hybrid samples represent crosses between female C. acutus and male C. moreletii. Phenotypic data could statistically identify hybrids, although morphological overlap between hybrids and C. moreletii reduced reliability of identification based solely on field characters. Ecologically, C. acutus was exclusively found in saline waters, whereas hybrids and C. moreletii were largely absent in these conditions. A hypothesized correlation between unidirectional hybridization and destruction of C. acutus breeding habitats warrants additional research.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2054-5703			WOS:000377966900026	26473062

Effects of Aggregate Masking on Soil Infiltration under an Aggregate Bed								JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING				141	9					04015008	10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000879			SEP 2015	2015	This research seeks to address questions about the reduction in soil infiltration rates due to masking or embedding when a layer of open-graded aggregate is placed on top of soil. This is pertinent to the design and modeling of many low impact development ( LID) technologies that incorporate infiltration such as porous pavements, infiltration trenches, and dry wells. A large permeameter was used to first measure the infiltration rate of five different soils and a No. 67 aggregate separately, and then measure the effective infiltration rate of the soils with an aggregate layer on top and with aggregate embedded in the top of the soil. The actual effective infiltration was then compared to the theoretical effective infiltration, assuming no masking or embedding effect. It was found that the measured infiltration rate was consistently lower than predicted, indicating a reduction in infiltration due to the presence of the aggregate layer. The average reductions were 29 and 43% for masking and embedding, respectively, which are consistent with computer modeling results from a previous study, but are significantly less than the reduction factors used in other porous pavement modeling applications. As such, existing modeling approaches for LID infiltration technologies may underpredict actual performance.

J	Liu, Zifan; Ivanco, Andrej; Filipi, Zoran								Naturalistic drive cycle synthesis for pickup trucks								JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH				54				109	115		10.1016/j.jsr.2015.06.005			SEP 2015	2015	Problem: Future pick-up trucks are meeting much stricter fuel economy and exhaust emission standards. Design tradeoffs will have to be carefully evaluated to satisfy consumer expectations within the regulatory and cost constraints. Boundary conditions will obviously be critical for derision making: thus, the understanding of how customers are driving in naturalistic settings is indispensable. Federal driving schedules, while critical for certification, do not capture the richness of naturalistic cycles, particularly the aggressive maneuvers that often shape consumer perception of performance. While there are databases with large number of drive cycles, applying all of them directly in the design process is impractical. Therefore, representative drive cycles that capture the essence of the naturalistic driving should be synthesized from naturalistic driving data. Method: Naturalistic drive cycles are firstly categorized by investigating their micro-trip components, defined as driving activities between successive stops. Micro-trips are expected to characterize underlying local traffic conditions, and separate different driving patterns. Next, the transitions from one vehicle state to another vehicle state in each cycle category are captured with Transition Probability Matrix (TPM). Candidate drive cycles can subsequently be synthesized using Markov Chain based on TPMs for each category. Finally, representative synthetic drive cycles are selected through assessment of significant cycle metrics to identify the ones with smallest errors. Summary: This paper provides a framework for synthesis of representative drive cycles from naturalistic driving data, which can subsequently be used for efficient optimization of design or control of pick-up truck powertrains. Impact on industry: Manufacturers will benefit from representative drive cycles in several aspects, including quick assessments of vehicle performance and energy consumption in simulations, component sizing and design, optimization of control strategies, and vehicle testing under real-world conditions. This is in contrast to using federal certification test cycles, which were never intended to capture pickup truck segment. (C) 2015 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

Area Sensitivity of Grassland Sparrows Overwintering in a South Carolina Forested Landscape								SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST				14	3			438	446		10.1656/058.014.0305			SEP 2015	2015	We assessed area sensitivity of overwintering Peucaea aestivalis (Bachman's Sparrow), Ammodramus savannarum (Grasshopper Sparrow), and A. henslowii (Henslow's Sparrow) within utility rights-of-way (ROWs) at the US Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina. We compared sparrow abundance among 4 ROW-width classes (25-44.9 m, 45-64.9 m, 65-84.9 m, and >= 85 m) and used landform index (LFI; a measure of topography and environmental exposure) as a covariate in our analyses to assess potential effects of abiotic characteristics. Total number of sparrows flushed/ha, Grasshopper Sparrows flushed/ha, and Henslow's Sparrows flushed/ha were positively related to ROW-width class. Total number of sparrows flushed/ha and Bachman's Sparrows flushed/ha were negatively related to LFI, indicating a positive relationship with site exposure. Utility ROWs in the Southeast provide wintering habitat for grassland sparrows, especially on exposed elevated plateaus within wide ROWs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1528-7092	1938-5412		WOS:000370892500003

A New Record for the Maximum Length of the American Alligator								SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST				14	3			N38	N43		10.1656/058.014.0302			SEP 2015	2015	An unusually large Alligator mississippiensis (American Alligator) was harvested in Alabama in 2014. We report on the animal's length and mass, and document the techniques used to obtain those measurements. We compare our measurements to other extreme lengths and weights reported for the species. We show that the size of the American Alligator is consistent with known allometric relationships of head length, total length, snout-vent length, tail girth, and weight. The specimen's straight-line total length of 450.0 cm (14 ft 9.25 in) makes it the longest officially measured American Alligator for Alabama and arguably the longest credible record for the species. We recommend using standardized techniques, particularly the straight-line total-length measurement, for documenting record-length or near-record-length American Alligators.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1528-7092	1938-5412		WOS:000370892500014

Less is known about the factors influencing the development of osteoporosis in the male population. This pilot study attempted to identify variables associated with osteopenia or osteoporosis in men. The 101 male participants completed a questionnaire that examined modifiable and nonmodifiable variables: alcohol consumption, smoking, exercise history, fracture history as an adult, and family history of osteoporosis. Objective variables collected included age, height, and weight to calculate body mass index. Bone mineral density was calculated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Osteopenia or osteoporosis was identified in 62 of the male participants. Consumption of alcohol and cigarettes with higher body mass index was correlated with greater likelihood of osteopenia and osteoporosis.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0744-6020	1542-538X		WOS:000369706100006	26375839

We explore the implications of universal access to treatment along with HIV education scale-up in the region. We develop an HIV transmission model to investigate the impacts of universal access to treatment, as well as an analytical framework to estimate the effects of HIV education scale-up on the epidemic. We calibrate the model with data from South Africa and simulate the impacts of universal access to treatment along with HIV education scale-up on prevalence, incidence, and HIV-related deaths over a course of 15 years. Our results show that the impact of combined interventions is significantly larger than the summation of individual intervention impacts (super-additive property). The combined strategy of universal access to treatment and HIV education scale-up decreases the incidence rate by 74% over the course of 15 years, whereas universal access to treatment and HIV education scale up will separately decrease that by 43% and 8%, respectively. Combination HIV prevention could be notably effective in transforming HIV epidemic to a low-level endemicity. Our results suggest that in designing effective combination prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, priorities should be given to achieving universal access to treatment as quickly as possible and improving compliance to condom use.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-7974	1536-5964		WOS:000369372500001	26376383

To address this need for landscape-scale monitoring of raptor populations, we developed a novel, baited photographic observation network termed the "Appalachian Eagle Monitoring Program" (AEMP). During winter months of 2008-2012, we partnered with professional and citizen scientists in 11 states in the United States to collect approximately 2.5 million images. To our knowledge, this represents the largest such camera-trap effort to date. Analyses of data collected in 2011 and 2012 revealed complex, often species-specific, spatial and temporal patterns in winter raptor movement behavior as well as spatial and temporal resource partitioning between raptor species. Although programmatic advances in data analysis and involvement are needed, the continued growth of the program has the potential to provide a long-term, cost-effective, range-wide monitoring tool for avian and terrestrial scavengers during the winter season. Perhaps most importantly, by relying heavily on citizen scientists, AEMP has the potential to improve long-term interest and support for raptor conservation and serve as a model for raptor conservation programs in other portions of the world.

Evaluation of a Waistband for Attaching External Radiotransmitters to Anurans								WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN				39	3			610	615		10.1002/wsb.554			SEP 2015	2015	Radiotelemetry provides fine-scale temporal and spatial information about an individual's movements and habitat use; however, its use for monitoring amphibians has been restricted by transmitter mass and lack of suitable attachment techniques. We describe a novel waistband for attaching external radiotransmitters to anurans and evaluate the percentages of resulting abrasions, lacerations, and shed transmitters. We used radiotelemetry to monitor movements and habitat use of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) in 2006 and 2011-2013 in Maine, USA; American toads (Anaxyrus americanus) in 2012 in North Carolina, USA; and, wood frogs, southern leopard frogs (L. sphenocephalus), and green frogs (L. clamitans) in 2012 in South Carolina, USA. We monitored 172 anurans for 1-365 days (56.4 +/- 59.4) in a single year and 1-691 days (60.5 +/- 94.1) across years. Our waistband resulted in an injury percentage comparable to 7 alternative anuran waistband attachment techniques; however, 12.5% fewer anurans shed their waistband when attached with our technique. Waistband retention facilitates longer monitoring periods and, thus, provides a greater quantity of data per radiotagged individual.

MOCHA Investigators						In Vitro Assessment of the Assisted Bidirectional Glenn Procedure for Stage One Single Ventricle Repair								CARDIOVASCULAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY				6	3			256	267		10.1007/s13239-015-0232-z			SEP 2015	2015	This in vitro study compares the hemodynamic performance of the Norwood and the Glenn circulations to assess the performance of a novel assisted bidirectional Glenn (ABG) procedure for stage one single ventricle surgery. In the ABG, the flow in a bidirectional Glenn procedure is assisted by injection of a high-energy flow stream from the systemic circulation using an aorta-caval shunt with nozzle. The aim is to explore experimentally the potential of the ABG as a surgical alternative to current surgical practice. The experiments are directly compared against previously published numerical simulations. A multiscale mock circulatory system was used to measure the hemodynamic performance of the three circulations. For each circulation, the system was tested using both low and high values of pulmonary vascular resistance. Resulting parameters measured were: pressure and flow rate at left/right pulmonary artery and superior vena cava (SVC). Systemic oxygen delivery (OD) was calculated. A parametric study of the ratio of ABG nozzle to shunt diameter was done. We report time-based comparisons with numerical simulations for the three surgical variants tested. The ABG circulation demonstrated an increase of 30-38% in pulmonary flow with a 2-3.7 mmHg increase in SVC pressure compared to the Glenn and a 4-14% higher systemic OD than either theNorwood or the Glenn. The nozzle/shunt diameter ratio affected the local hemodynamics. These experimental results agreed with those of the numerical model: mean flow values were not significantly different (p > 0.05) while mean pressures were comparable within 1.2 mmHg. The results verify the approaches providing two tools to study this complicated circulation. Using a realistic experimental model we demonstrate the performance of a novel surgical procedure with potential to improve patient hemodynamics in early palliation of the univentricular circulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1869-408X	1869-4098		WOS:000380356800005

An improved theoretical description of the cosmological DM annihilation signal, based on two complementary techniques and assuming generic weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) properties, renders more precise predictions compared to previous work. More specifically, we estimate the cosmologically-induced gamma-ray intensity to have an uncertainty of a factor similar to 20 in canonical setups. We consistently include both the Galactic and extragalactic signals under the same theoretical framework, and study the impact of the former on the IGRB spectrum derivation. We find no evidence for a DM signal and we set limits on the DM-induced isotropic gamma-ray signal. Our limits are competitive for DM particle masses up to tens of TeV and, indeed, are the strongest limits derived from Fermi LAT data at TeV energies. This is possible thanks to the new Fermi LAT IGRB measurement, which now extends up to an energy of 820 GeV. We quantify uncertainties in detail and show the potential this type of search offers for testing the WIMP paradigm with a complementary and truly cosmological probe of DM particle signals.									18	0	0	0	0	18			1475-7516			WOS:000365690000008

When patients in these countries initiate treatment, they typically remain on it until death; thus, policy makers and physicians follow nonabandonment policies. However, treated patients develop resistance to treatment, so in many cases untreated patients might benefit more from the drugs. In this paper we quantify the opportunity cost associated with restricting attention to nonabandonment policies. For this, we use an approximate dynamic programming framework to bound the benefit from allowing premature treatment termination. Our results indicate that in sub-Saharan Africa, the price associated with restricting attention to nonabandonment policies lies between 4.4% and 8.1% of the total treatment benefit. We also derive superior treatment allocation policies, which shed light on the role behavior and health progression play in prioritizing treatment initiation and termination.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1523-4614	1526-5498		WOS:000366055400010

In this study, coconut water and oatmeal were used with the probiotic, Lactobacillus plantarum Lp 115-400B (L. plantarum) as a starter culture. Two separate treatments were carried out probiotic (P) and probiotic and prebiotic (PP) added. In both treatments, oatmeal-coconut water matrix was inoculated with 7 log CFU/g of L. plantarum and fermented at 27 degrees C for 10 h. For the PP treatment, 1 g of inulin/100 mL of the product was added additionally. The fermented products were then refrigerated (4 degrees C) and the viability of L. plantarum, pH, total acidity, and apparent viscosity of the matrix were monitored at selected time intervals. The shelf life to reach was defined by maintenance of L. plantarum count of 7 log CFU/g product. Refrigerated shelf life was determined to be seven-weeks for the P treatment and five-weeks for PP treatment. A significant reduction of pH was observed at the end of the considered shelf life; conversely, the apparent viscosity of the product did not change significantly.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2304-8158			WOS:000364151200006	28231208	
J	Jing, Yiming; Ahn, Gail-Joon; Zhao, Ziming; Hu, Hongxin								Towards Automated Risk Assessment and Mitigation of Mobile Applications								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING				12	5			571	584		10.1109/TDSC.2014.2366457			SEP-OCT 2015	2015	Mobile operating systems, such as Apple's iOS and Google's Android, have supported a ballooning market of feature-rich mobile applications. However, helping users understand and mitigate security risks of mobile applications is still an ongoing challenge. While recent work has developed various techniques to reveal suspicious behaviors of mobile applications, there exists little work to answer the following question: are those behaviors necessarily inappropriate? In this paper, we seek an approach to cope with such a challenge and present a continuous and automated risk assessment framework called RISKMON that uses machine-learned ranking to assess risks incurred by users' mobile applications, especially Android applications. RISKMON combines users' coarse expectations and runtime behaviors of trusted applications to generate a risk assessment baseline that captures appropriate behaviors of applications. With the baseline, RISKMON assigns a risk score on every access attempt on sensitive information and ranks applications by their cumulative risk scores. Furthermore, we demonstrate how RISKMON supports risk mitigation with automated permission revocation. We also discuss a proof-of-concept implementation of RISKMON as an extension of the Android mobile platform and provide both system evaluation and usability study of our methodology.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1545-5971	1941-0018		WOS:000364504000007

Our research develops a numerical taxonomy that provides a deeper understanding of usage and value of customer-facing technology-based innovations in the U.S. restaurant industry. In this study, utility is a proxy for intrinsic customer value. Usage was estimated by past visits to restaurants and utility was calculated by using a specific type of discrete choice experiment known as Best-Worst (or max-diff) experiment. We offer insights for service strategy technology choices and customer value in service delivery systems research and practice. Furthermore, we advance service science by discussing the inherent management pitfalls of failing to distinguish between technology usage and utility in services.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2164-3962	2164-3970		WOS:000364565600007		
J	Godage, Isuru S.; Wirz, Raul; Walker, Ian D.; Webster, Robert J., III								Accurate and Efficient Dynamics for Variable-Length Continuum Arms: A Center of Gravity Approach								SOFT ROBOTICS				2	3			96	106		10.1089/soro.2015.0006			SEP 2015	2015	To achieve their full potential, soft and compliant continuum robots must move faster and more accurately than they can today. To facilitate this, accurate and computationally efficient dynamic models are essential. While the integral Lagrangian approach can produce accurate models, it is complex and computationally intensive. In this article we propose a new dynamic model based on numerically stable modal kinematics that is both accurate and computationally efficient. The proposed model is a lumped parameter model, but one that is more accurate than prior lumped parameter models because mass locations and quantities are derived from a detailed description of the total energy in a continuum arm with continuously distributed mass. We experimentally validated the model using a pneumatic muscle-actuated continuum arm, and the proposed model successfully simulates the transient and steady-state dynamics of the prototype arm. Further, the model is also compared to the integral Lagrangian and a lumped parameter model to highlight its advantages in terms of computational efficiency and its accuracy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-5172	2169-5180		WOS:000364571300003

J	Adelberg, Jeffrey; Adelberg, Jacqueline Naylor; Rapaka, Vijay								A NOVEL ROOTING MATRIX AND VESSEL SYSTEM RESULTED IN LARGER PLANTS AND FASTER GROWTH DURING GREENHOUSE ACCLIMATIZATION OF HYDRANGEA QUERCIFOLIA 'SIKES DWARF'								PROPAGATION OF ORNAMENTAL PLANTS				15	3			89	94					SEP 2015	2015	Hydrangea quercifolia 'Sikes Dwarf' were grown in agar and the Oasis foam (InVitro Express -IVE) for 6 weeks in vitro and placed in varied ventilation and acclimatization treatments. Following six weeks in vessels, plants from all treatments rooted well (91%). Shoots from agar and the Oasis (R) IVE that remained in the laboratory were a little taller than shoots that received pre-transplant bright-light acclimatization in the greenhouse while remaining sterile in flexible film tissue culture vessels. Plants were then transferred to a peat-based soilless media and subsequent greenhouse growth was measured. Although the agar grown plants had started out taller they did not gain height in the greenhouse, while the IVE rooted plants that were acclimatized in the lab increased 1.5- to 1.7-fold and the pre-transplant, bright light acclimatized doubled in height. Leaf size of plants from agar doubled in the greenhouse, whereas the IVE rooted plants increased 3-fold, or more depending on the acclimatization treatment. Hydrangea plants with the largest leaves and best canopies came from treatments that were rooted in IVE and brought through the pre-transplant, bright light, acclimatization while in the flexible film vessels. Improved water, oxygen, and nutrient availability during the in vitro rooting, minimal damage or disturbance to the root system upon transfer, and the pre-hardened shoots allowed for superior greenhouse growth.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1311-9109			WOS:000362699200001

Cardiovascular engineering and technology				6	3			256	67		10.1007/s13239-015-0232-z			2015-Sep	2015	This in vitro study compares the hemodynamic performance of the Norwood and the Glenn circulations to assess the performance of a novel assisted bidirectional Glenn (ABG) procedure for stage one single ventricle surgery. In the ABG, the flow in a bidirectional Glenn procedure is assisted by injection of a high-energy flow stream from the systemic circulation using an aorta-caval shunt with nozzle. The aim is to explore experimentally the potential of the ABG as a surgical alternative to current surgical practice. The experiments are directly compared against previously published numerical simulations. A multiscale mock circulatory system was used to measure the hemodynamic performance of the three circulations. For each circulation, the system was tested using both low and high values of pulmonary vascular resistance. Resulting parameters measured were: pressure and flow rate at left/right pulmonary artery and superior vena cava (SVC). Systemic oxygen delivery (OD) was calculated. A parametric study of the ratio of ABG nozzle to shunt diameter was done. We report time-based comparisons with numerical simulations for the three surgical variants tested. The ABG circulation demonstrated an increase of 30-38% in pulmonary flow with a 2-3.7 mmHg increase in SVC pressure compared to the Glenn and a 4-14% higher systemic OD than either the Norwood or the Glenn. The nozzle/shunt diameter ratio affected the local hemodynamics. These experimental results agreed with those of the numerical model: mean flow values were not significantly different (p > 0.05) while mean pressures were comparable within 1.2 mmHg. The results verify the approaches providing two tools to study this complicated circulation. Using a realistic experimental model we demonstrate the performance of a novel surgical procedure with potential to improve patient hemodynamics in early palliation of the univentricular circulation.									2	0	0	1	0	2				1869-4098		MEDLINE:26577359	26577359

The utilization of three-dimensional bioprinting in tissue engineering has generated new methods for the printing of cells and matrix to fabricate biomimetic tissue constructs. The solid freeform fabrication (SFF) method developed for three-dimensional bioprinting uses an additive manufacturing approach by depositing droplets of cells and hydrogels in a layer-by-layer fashion. Bioprinting fabrication is dependent on the specific placement of biological materials into three-dimensional architectures, and the printed constructs should closely mimic the complex organization of cells and extracellular matrices in native tissue. This paper highlights the use of the Palmetto Printer, a Cartesian bioprinter, as well as the process of producing spatially organized, viable constructs while simultaneously allowing control of environmental factors. This methodology utilizes computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing to produce these specific and complex geometries. Finally, this approach allows for the reproducible production of fabricated constructs optimized by controllable printing parameters.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1940-087X			WOS:000364222300038

Life cycle principles are often retrospectively incorporated in the design phase resulting in incremental environmental improvement rather than selection of fuel pathways that minimize environmental impacts across the life cycle. Further, designing sustainable biofuel supply chains requires joint consideration of economic, environmental, and social factors that span multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, traditional life cycle assessment (LCA) ignores economic aspects and the role of ecological goods and services in supply chains, and hence is limited in its ability for guiding decision-making among alternativesoften resulting in sub-optimal solutions. Simultaneously incorporating economic and environment objectives in the design and optimization of emerging biofuel supply chains requires a radical new paradigm. This work discusses key research opportunities and challenges in the design of emerging biofuel supply chains and provides a high-level overview of the current state of the art in environmental sustainability assessment of biofuel production. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis of over 20,000 biofuel research articles from 2000-to-present is performed to identify active topical areas of research in the biofuel literature, quantify the relative strength of connections between various biofuels research domains, and determine any potential research gaps.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2227-9717			WOS:000363981100008

Seasonal and spatial dispersal patterns of select ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) from forest habitats into production nurseries								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				98	3									SEP 2015	2015	Exotic ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) are important pests of ornamental tree nurseries. Although these beetles reportedly disperse in early spring from peripheral forested areas into nurseries, few studies have determined how far they fly to infest new host trees, or whether a mass-trapping strategy can adequately protect a nursery crop. Field monitoring with ethanol baits in South Carolina (2011-2012), Mississippi (2013-2014), and Louisiana (2013-2014), USA, determined the timing of peak ambrosia beetle flights, dispersal distance, and optimal trap location. In addition to the well-documented spring flight peak, southeastern nursery managers may need to be aware of a second, late-summer flight. Captures from traps placed in a nursery at various distances (-25 to 200 m) from the forest-nursery interface showed a significant linear and quadratic trend in decreasing numbers of beetles captured with increasing distance from the forest in South Carolina, whereas significant linear, quadratic, and cubic trends were detected in Louisiana and Mississippi. Although captures at the nursery edge were lower than within the forest, traps placed at the nursery edge may still represent the optimal tool for both monitoring and mass-trapping programs because of easier access for personnel. Susceptible tree cultivars may gain added protection when placed deeper within nursery interiors and when baited traps line adjacent nursery edges.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0015-4040	1938-5102		WOS:000361915000010

Prediction of the Grain-Microstructure Evolution Within a Friction Stir Welding (FSW) Joint via the Use of the Monte Carlo Simulation Method								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				24	9			3471	3486		10.1007/s11665-015-1635-6			SEP 2015	2015	A thermo-mechanical finite element analysis of the friction stir welding (FSW) process is carried out and the evolution of the material state (e.g., temperature, the extent of plastic deformation, etc.) monitored. Subsequently, the finite-element results are used as input to a Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm in order to predict the evolution of the grain microstructure within different weld zones, during the FSW process and the subsequent cooling of the material within the weld to room temperature. To help delineate different weld zones, (a) temperature and deformation fields during the welding process, and during the subsequent cooling, are monitored; and (b) competition between the grain growth (driven by the reduction in the total grain-boundary surface area) and dynamic-recrystallization grain refinement (driven by the replacement of highly deformed material with an effectively "dislocation-free" material) is simulated. The results obtained clearly revealed that different weld zones form as a result of different outcomes of the competition between the grain growth and grain refinement processes.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000360014000030

Effect of Vertical Casting Position on Transfer and Development Length								ACI MATERIALS JOURNAL				112	5			619	629					SEP-OCT 2015	2015	This investigation includes the effect of vertical casting position on transfer and development lengths of prestressing strand. Current code provisions account for the top-bar effect in the calculation of development length for standard reinforcing bars, but fail to recognize the phenomenon when calculating transfer and development lengths of prestressing strand. Historically, this phenomenon has been dependent on the amount of concrete cast below a bar or strand. Recent research shows the amount of concrete cast above a strand to be more influential. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on the influence of vertical casting position of prestressing strand on transfer and development lengths. The study includes data from 20 T-beam test specimens and four sets of top-strand blocks. The results from 119 transfer zones and 39 flexural tests were evaluated and compared to vertical casting position along with current code provisions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0889-325X	1944-737X		WOS:000363004800003

This communication demonstrates a new harvesting technology by utilizing the phase separation of thermoresponsive polymers and charged copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide and allylamine. Chlorella protothecoides cells are separated from solution when the mixture of algae and polymers is heated above the lower critical solution temperature of polymers (similar to 32 degrees C), where the polymer phase separates from the aqueous media and aggregates into a solid-gel phase. It was found that copolymer concentration, allylamine content (mol%) and charge (based on initial solution pH) affect the extent of polymer phase separation and alga separation efficiency. The copolymer containing allylamine with lower than 2.6 mol% displayed nearly complete algal cell separation at polymer concentrations of 25-50 mg/mL and pH 7. The results indicated that thermoresponsive polymers provide a promising technology for alga harvesting using recyclable and reusable materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Validation of an in vitro model of erbB2(+) cancer cell redirection								IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-ANIMAL				51	8			776	786		10.1007/s11626-015-9889-8			SEP 2015	2015	Overexpression of the oncoprotein erbB2/HER2 is present in 20-30% of breast cancer patients and inversely correlates with patient survival. Reports have demonstrated the deterministic power of the mammary microenvironment where the normal mammary microenvironment redirects cells of non-mammary origin or tumor-derived cells to adopt a mammary phenotype in an in vivo model. This phenomenon is termed tumor cell redirection. Tumor-derived cells that overexpress the erbB2 oncoprotein lose their tumor-forming capacity in this model. In this model, phosphorylation of erbB2 is attenuated thus reducing the tumor cell's tumor-forming potential. In this report, we describe our results using an in vitro model based on the in vivo model mentioned previously. Tumor-derived cells are mixed in predetermined ratios with normal mammary epithelial cells prior to seeding in vitro. In this in vitro model, the tumor-derived cells are redirected as determined by attenuated phosphorylation of the receptor and reduced sphere and colony formation. These results match those observed in the in vivo model. This in vitro model will allow expanded experimental options in the future to determine additional aspects of tumor cell redirection that can be translated to other types of cancer.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1071-2690	1543-706X		WOS:000361559800003	25898824

To accomplish this central educational objective, this article describes a systematic process of introducing reasoning skills into the curriculum and assessing how well students have learned those skills. To facilitate assessment, a comprehensive inventory of principles for reasoning about correctness that captures the finer details of basic skills that students need to learn has been defined and used. The principles can be taught at various levels of depth across the curriculum in a variety of courses.The use of a particular instructional process is illustrated to inculcate reasoning principles across several iterations of a sophomore-level development foundations course and a junior-level software engineering course. The article summarizes how learning outcomes motivated by the inventory of reasoning principles lead to questions that in turn form the basis for a careful analysis of student understanding and for fine-tuning teaching interventions that together facilitate continuous improvements to instruction.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1946-6226			WOS:000362663600004

It is based on the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL) of sources detected between 100 MeV and 300 GeV with a Test Statistic greater than 25, between 2008 August 4 and 2012 July 31. The 3LAC includes 1591 AGNs located at high Galactic latitudes (vertical bar b vertical bar > 10 degrees), a 71% increase over the second catalog based on 2 years of data. There are 28 duplicate associations, thus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3FGL catalog are AGNs. Most of them (98%) are blazars. About half of the newly detected blazars are of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficient quality to determine the strength of their emission lines. Based on their gamma-ray spectral properties, these sources are evenly split between flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacs. The most abundant detected BL Lacs are of the high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) type. About 50% of the BL Lacs have no measured redshifts. A few new rare outliers (HSP-FSRQs and high-luminosity HSP BL Lacs) are reported. The general properties of the 3LAC sample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. The fraction of 3LAC blazars in the total population of blazars listed in BZCAT remains non-negligible even at the faint ends of the BZCAT-blazar radio, optical, and X-ray flux distributions, which hints that even the faintest known blazars could eventually shine in gamma-rays at LAT-detection levels. The energy-flux distributions of the different blazar populations are in good agreement with extrapolation from earlier catalogs.									78	4	0	0	0	80			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000361800900014

The compound crystallized in a monoclinic space group P2(1)/n with a = 13.215(3) , b = 17.823(4) , c = 19.823(4) , beta = 96.80(3)A degrees and V = 4636.1(16) (3) with Z = 4. The cobalt(III) metal center has a slightly distorted octahedral geometry. 1,10-Phenanthroline and 2,2'-bipyridine ligands were generally planar, and did not exhibit pi-pi overlap. The packing of the cations was stabilized by hydrogen bonding with hexafluorophosphate anions. The electrochemical studies revealed the Co-III/II, Co-II/I and Co-I/0 redox couples at E (1/2) = +0.32, -0.91 and -1.61 V (vs AgCl/Ag) respectively in acetonitrile.

In Phase 1, we asked 41 landowners to identify a range of behaviors that might enhance local environmental quality. We then developed a 13-item PEB scale based on interview responses and literature review. In Phase 2, we incorporated this self-reported PEB scale into a survey of 1082 rural landowners and recreationists. Confirmatory factor analysis identified four key PEB domains: conservation lifestyle behaviors (e.g., household actions in the private sphere), social environmentalism (e.g., peer interactions and group membership), environmental citizenship (e.g., civic engagement in the policy arena), and land stewardship (e.g., support for wildlife and habitat conservation). Results revealed variable participation rates in each type of PEB, confirmed the need to account for land stewardship in rural settings, and highlighted challenges and opportunities for PEB assessment across various social and geographical contexts.

Surface energy of cellulosic materials: The effect of particle morphology, particle size, and hydroxyl number								TAPPI JOURNAL				14	9			565	576					SEP 2015	2015	Understanding the surface properties of cellulose materials is important for proper commercial applications. The effect of particle size, particle morphology, and hydroxyl number on the surface energy of three microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) preparations and one nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) preparation were investigated using inverse gas chromatography at column temperatures ranging from 30 degrees C to 60 degrees C. The mean particle sizes for the three MCC samples and the NFC sample were 120.1, 62.3, 13.9, and 9.3 mu m. The corresponding dispersion components of surface energy at 30 degrees C were 55.7 +/- 0.1, 59.7 +/- 1.3, 71.7 +/- 1.0, and 57.4 +/- 0.3 mJ/m(2). MCC samples are agglomerates of small individual cellulose particles. The different particle sizes and morphologies of the three MCC samples resulted in various hydroxyl numbers, which in turn affected their dispersion component of surface energy. Cellulose samples exhibiting a higher hydroxyl number have a higher dispersion component of surface energy. The dispersion component of surface energy of all the cellulose samples decreased linearly with increasing temperature. MCC samples with larger agglomerates had a lower temperature coefficient of dispersion component of surface energy.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0734-1415			WOS:000362429100002

Informal property rights as stable conventions in hawk-dove games with many players								JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS				25	4			849	873		10.1007/s00191-015-0412-x			SEP 2015	2015	This paper investigates the evolution of conventions (Young Econometrica 61(1):57-84, 1993) in n-player hawk-dove games where multiple players share the same payoff-irrelevant label, such as "blue" or "green". With more than two players, the stochastically stable equilibrium depends on how many players in the contest share each label. If the cost of fighting is high, then the long-run equilibrium is favorable to the label shared by fewer players - those players play hawk - while if the cost is low, then the opposite convention develops. This result provides one explanation for the emergence of informal property rights. In disputes over property, a fundamental distinction exists between the possessor, who is unique, and non-possessors, who can be several. For objects whose value is low relative to the cost of conflict over them, this asymmetry favors the development of informal property rights conventions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0936-9937	1432-1386		WOS:000361639300006

In this study, the objective was to conduct an investigation of plant and laboratory (e. g., after reheating) compaction effects on performance properties of plant produced foamed asphalt mixtures with various recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) contents. The main properties of failure temperature and G*/sin delta of recovered binders and compaction effort, air void, indirect tensile strength (ITS), tensile strength ratio, flow, rut depth, resilient modulus, and fatigue life of plant directly compacted specimens and laboratory reheated and compacted specimens were determined in this research. The experimental design included the warm mix (foamed) asphalt mixtures from four asphalt plants in South Carolina, containing two surface mixtures. A total of over 150 specimens and 36 fatigue beams were tested in this study. The test results indicated that, as expected, the recovered binders from laboratory reheated mixtures generally have higher failure temperatures and G*/sin delta values, and lower phase angles compared with the extracted binders from plant compacted mixtures. In addition, laboratory mixtures have greater gyration numbers and higher air voids than plant mixtures. Moreover, higher ITS values, lower rut depths and resilient modulus values can be found from laboratory compacted specimens regardless of the asphalt plant site. Furthermore, fatigue life values varied from mixtures obtained from different asphalt plants.

Dexamethasone-conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA-DXM) was synthesized and combined with hydrolytically degradable, photo-cross-linkable PEG-bis(2-acryloyloxy propanoate) (PEG-bis-AP) to form semi-IPNs. Dexamethasone (DX) release was limited in physiological buffer and substantially increased in the presence of encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) or exogenous hyaluronidase, confirming that release occurred primarily by a cell-mediated enzymatic mechanism. hMSCs encapsulated in PEG-bis-AP/HA-DXM semi-IPNs increased osteoblast-specific gene expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, and matrix mineralization, attaining levels that were not significantly different from positive controls consisting of hMSCs in PEG-bis-AP/native HA cultured with DX supplementation in the culture medium. These studies demonstrate that PEG-bis-AP/HA-DXM semi-IPNs can provide cell-mediated release of bioactive free DX that induces hMSC osteogenic differentiation. This approach offers an efficient system for local delivery of osteogenic molecules empowering point of care applications.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1525-7797	1526-4602		WOS:000361341700022	26259127

The Yosida method uses an inexact block LU factorization to create linear algebraic systems that are easier to solve, but at the expense of accuracy. We prove the difference between solutions of the exact and approximated linear algebraic systems is O(gamma(-2)) in the natural norms of the associated finite element problems, and thus that full accuracy can be obtained by the Yosida method if large gamma is used (gamma >= 10 is sufficient in our numerical examples). The proof is based on transforming the Yosida inexact linear algebraic system into finite element problems, and analyzing these problems with finite element techniques based on pointwise divergence-free subspaces and their orthogonal complements.

J	Gerow, Jennifer E.; Thatcher, Jason Bennett; Grover, Varun								Six types of IT-business strategic alignment: an investigation of the constructs and their measurement								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS				24	5			465	491		10.1057/ejis.2014.6			SEP 2015	2015	Top management has been concerned with IT-business strategic alignment (hereafter referred to as alignment) for the past 30 years. Consequently, alignment researchers have developed many models to explain how alignment generates value for firms. However, these models use inconsistent definitions and measures of alignment, which has led to conflicting results and has potentially inhibited the progress of research on this critical topic. This paper emphasizes the importance of demarcating the six alignment types that are sometimes confused in the literature into a single, unified model. It also reports on the development of definitions and measures of these six types of alignment including alignment between IT and business strategies (i.e., intellectual alignment), between IT and business infrastructures and processes (i.e., operational alignment), and across these two domains such that strategies are linked with infrastructures and processes (i.e., four types of cross-domain alignment). Analyzing survey data collected from 140 Chief Information Officers, we found each measure possesses desirable psychometric properties. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0960-085X	1476-9344		WOS:000361345000002

In contrast to existing chain polymerization routes for the preparation of PPV derivatives, this route takes advantage of a symmetric monomer to preclude head-to-head or tail-to-tail coupling that ultimately leads to alkyne or alkyl defects in the polymer chain. Mechanistic studies were performed and revealed that the DPD route can be carried out with the desirable intermediacy of a soluble, isolable polymer precursor. Unsubstituted PPV, poly(p-(2,5-dihexyloxyphenylene)vinylene) and a PPV derivative with a sterically encumbering side chain were all readily prepared by the new DPD route. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients had microcephaly, short stature, mild spasticity, thoracic scoliosis, hyperextendable MCP joints, rocker-bottom feet, hyperextended elbows and knees. A mutation, p.L66H, in ZC4H2, was identified in a XLID resequencing project. Additional screening of linked families and next generation sequencing of XLID families identified three ZC4H2 mutations: p.R18K, p.R213W and p.V75in15aa. The families shared some relevant clinical features. In silico modeling of the mutant proteins indicated all alterations would destabilize the protein. Knockout mutations in zc4h2 were created in zebrafish and homozygous mutant larvae exhibited abnormal swimming, increased twitching, defective eye movement and pectoral fin contractures. Because several of the behavioral defects were consistent with hyperactivity, we examined the underlying neuronal defects and found that sensory neurons and motoneurons appeared normal. However, we observed a striking reduction in GABAergic interneurons. Analysis of cell-type-specificmarkers showed a specific loss of V2 interneurons in the brain and spinal cord, likely arising from mis-specification of neural progenitors. Injected human wt ZC4H2 rescued the mutant phenotype. Mutant zebrafish injected with human p.L66Hor p.R213W mRNA failed to be rescued, while the p.R18K mRNA was able to rescue the interneuron defect. Our findings clearly support ZC4H2 as a novel XLID gene with a required function in interneuron development. Loss of function of ZC4H2 thus likely results in altered connectivity of many brain and spinal circuits.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0964-6906	1460-2083		WOS:000361316300007	26056227

Effects of different vaccine combinations against Mycoplasma gallisepticum on blood characteristics in commercial layer chickens								POULTRY SCIENCE				94	9			2108	2113		10.3382/ps/pev225			SEP 2015	2015	Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is a major and economically significant pathogen of avian species. When administered before lay, F-strain MG (FMG) can reduce egg production during lay, but the ts-11 strain of MG (ts11MG) does not exert this effect. Two trials were conducted to determine the effects of pre-lay vaccinations of ts11MG, MG-Bacterin (MGBac), or their combination, in conjunction with an FMG challenge overlay after peak production on the blood characteristics of commercial layers. In each trial, 160 mycoplasma-free Hy-Line W-36 layers were housed in negative-pressure biological isolation units (4 units per treatment, 10 birds per unit) from 9 through 52 wk of age (woa). The following vaccination treatments were administered at 10 woa: 1) Control (no vaccinations); 2) MGBac; 3) ts11MG; and 4) ts11MG and MGBac combination (ts11MG + MGBac). At 45 woa, half of the birds were challenged with a laboratory stock of high-passage FMG. Parameters measured in both trials were whole-blood hematocrit and serum concentrations of cholesterol (SCHOL), triglycerides, calcium, and total protein (STP). An age x treatment interaction (P = 0.04) was observed for STP between 23 and 43 woa. The STP concentration in the ts11MG and ts11MG + MGBac groups was higher at 33 woa, but was lower at 43 woa, in comparison to the Control group. Also, at 38 woa, the STP of the ts11MG + MGBac group was higher than that of the MGBac group. Although use of the ts11MG vaccine alone or in combination with MGBac may influence circulating STP concentrations when administered before lay, it remains effective in protecting layers against the adverse effect of a post-peak challenge of FMG on egg production, as was observed in a previous companion study.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000360191900016	26217033

The status of 119 previously identified (2009) abandoned residential housing developments was reinvestigated in 2013 using the most current available high-resolution aerial photography with a randomly selected number of sites (40) in Greenville, Pickens and Spartanburg Counties in South Carolina. The original land cover before any housing developments was determined based on historical infrared aerial imagery (1999). Development sites were categorized based on the development status: no change, active development or completed development. Site locations were used to determine network distance to major cities and schools to determine if location is related to current development status. Historical aerial photos showed that the majority of land originally developed was forest land. Site visits indicated that 24 out of 40 sites previously identified as abandoned are in various stages of recent construction (three out of five in Pickens County, three out of 15 in Spartanburg County and 18 out of 20 in Greenville County). Of the 19 sites that were labeled as active through a field visit 15 were positively identified as active by using the aerial imagery. Sites with recent construction were closest to schools, but distance to urban centers was not a factor. This study suggests that proximity to schools may be a driving factor in restarting previously abandoned developments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1083-8155	1573-1642		WOS:000360017700003

Cryptic biodiversity in the cytogenome of bird-biting blackflies in North Africa								MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY				29	3			276	289		10.1111/mve.12115			SEP 2015	2015	Bird-biting blackflies in the Simulium (Eusimulium) aureum group (Diptera: Simuliidae) are widespread vectors of Leucocytozoon and Trypanosoma parasites. The polytene chromosomes of 619 larvae of the three nominal members of the S.aureum group in North Africa were evaluated cytogenetically for cryptic biodiversity. Seven chromosomal segregates were discovered among 29 populations in Algeria and Morocco. This diversity was based primarily on two chromosomal inversions, which have assumed unique roles in different lineages, including sex linkage, fixation, loss and autosomal polymorphism. Reproductive isolation was demonstrated for six of the seven segregates, doubling the number of species known in the area.

Exploring a lake's bathymetry with electromagnetic techniques is one way to identify the magnitude of sediment accumulation in these reservoirs. In this study, the bathymetry and sediment accumulation of Walker Lake, Pennsylvaia were explored with ground penetrating radar (GPR) using either a 400 or 100 MHz antenna, depending on the depth of the lake. The assembled apparatus herein included two GPR antennas placed in an inflatable boat towed by another boat powered by an electrical trolling motor. A total of eighteen crossings were performed along the entire length of the lake and a new integrated method using multiple processing software was applied to generate three-dimensional and contoured surfaces of bathymetry, sediment accumulation, and the original 1971 basin topography prior to the construction of Walker Lake Dam. The bathymetry, volume of sediment, and its accumulation rate were estimated. The lake depth was found to vary between a few centimeters near the inlet to 9 m nearer the dam. Deposition of sediment takes place mainly near the inlet to the lake and along the old channel of Middle Creek. The sedimentation gradually decreases toward the dam, ranging between 0 and 1.85 m in terms of bulk sediment volume.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1083-1363			WOS:000360778100004

Following Doctors' Orders: Organizational Change as a Response to Human Capital Bargaining Power								ORGANIZATION SCIENCE				26	5			1284	1300		10.1287/orsc.2015.0986			SEP-OCT 2015	2015	Organizational change is facilitated by both internal and external factors, yet little is known about how they might be linked. Through a case study of one hospital's change from a nonprofit to a nonprofit/for-profit organizational structure, we find that human capital bargaining power is a key mechanism that integrates internal and external drivers of change. However, a paradox surfaces whereby the strength of the bargaining power can force structural changes that may be counterproductive. Our results show that human capital bargaining power is a "double-edged sword," shifting the governance structure to benefit those with power by providing additional rents, but creating challenges for the ongoing management and retention of such valuable human capital. Our findings have implications for the long-term survival of talent-intensive organizations where human capital bargaining power is strong.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1047-7039			WOS:000360908600002

So far, however, experimental functional studies of miR528 are lacking. Here, we report that overexpression of a rice (Oryza sativa) miR528 (Osa-miR528) in transgenic creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) alters plant development and improves plant salt stress and nitrogen (N) deficiency tolerance. Morphologically, miR528-overexpressing transgenic plants display shortened internodes, increased tiller number, and upright growth. Improved salt stress resistance is associated with increased water retention, cell membrane integrity, chlorophyll content, capacity for maintaining potassium homeostasis, CATALASE activity, and reduced ASCORBIC ACID OXIDASE (AAO) activity; while enhanced tolerance to N deficiency is associated with increased biomass, total N accumulation and chlorophyll synthesis, nitrite reductase activity, and reduced AAO activity. In addition, AsAAO and COPPER ION BINDING PROTEIN1 are identified as two putative targets of miR528 in creeping bentgrass. Both of them respond to salinity and N starvation and are significantly down-regulated in miR528-overexpressing transgenics. Our data establish a key role that miR528 plays in modulating plant growth and development and in the plant response to salinity and N deficiency and indicate the potential of manipulating miR528 in improving plant abiotic stress resistance.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000360930600045	26224802

We examine factors that explain economic freedom. First, we use the fifty US states as our unit of analysis to evaluate how economic freedom is determined in a competitive political system, where resources are mobile across borders. Second, we employ a multiequation model that includes the effects of economic freedom on income, employment, and income distribution. This model yields many interesting results, including support for the hypothesis that stakeholders, with wealth put at risk by government policies, are crucial players in the political process that determines economic freedom.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0890-913X			WOS:000361026400001

J	Holden, Richard J.; Brown, Roger L.; Scanlon, Matthew C.; Rivera, A. Joy; Karsh, Ben-Tzion								Micro- and macroergonomic changes in mental workload and medication safety following the implementation of new health IT								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS				49				131	143		10.1016/j.ergon.2014.04.003			SEP 2015	2015	Health information technology (IT) is a promising way to achieve safer medication management in the delivery of healthcare. However, human factors/ergonomics dictates that in order to make the complex, cognitive work of healthcare delivery safer, health IT must properly support human cognition. This means, for example, that new health IT must reduce, not increase, workload during safety-critical tasks. The present study was the first to quantitatively assess the short- and long-term impact of bar coded medication administration (BCMA) IT on nurses' mental workload as well as on perceived medication safety. One-hundred seventy registered nurses across 3 dissimilar clinical units at an academic, freestanding pediatric hospital in the Midwest US participated in surveys administered before, 3 months after, and 12 months after the hospital implemented BCMA. Nurses rated their external mental worldoad (interruptions, divided attention, being rushed) and internal mental workload (concentration, mental effort) during medication administration tasks as well as the likelihood of each of three medication safety events: medication administration errors, medication errors on the clinical unit, and clinical unit-level adverse drug events. Clinical unit differences were assessed. Findings generally confirmed the hypothesis that external but not internal mental workload was associated with the perceived likelihood of a medication safety event. Comparisons of mental workload from pre- to post-BCMA revealed statistically significant changes in the critical care unit only. Medication safety appeared to improve over the long term in the hematology/oncology unit only. In the critical care and medical/surgical units, medication safety exhibited short-term improvements that were eliminated over time. Changes in mental workload and medication safety, two classically microergonomic constructs, were deeply embedded in macroergonomic phenomena. These included the fit between the BCMA system and the nature of nursing work, the process of BCMA implementation, and BCMA interactions with concurrent changes occurring in the hospital. Findings raise questions about achieving sustainable performance improvement with health IT as well as the balance between micro- and macroergonomic approaches to studying technology change.Relevance to industry: Designers must consider how technology changes cognitive work, including mental workload. Hospitals and other implementers of technology must ensure that new technology fits its users, their tasks, and the context of use, which may entail tailoring implementation, for example, to specific clinical units. Evaluators must look over time to assess both changes in cognitive work and implementation issues. Healthcare practitioners must also recognize that new technology means a complex transformation to an already complex sociotechnical system, which calls for a macroergonomic approach to design and analysis.

In a yearlong study of a sixth-grade classroom in a Title I school, students engaged in integrated literacy-social studies instruction. Researchers studied the degree of task openness and the degree to which students of various ability levels engaged affectively, behaviorally, and cognitively. In highlighting the elements of the 10 most and least engaging of the 66 tasks observed, implications for designing highly engaged instruction are presented, as are lessons learned from student disengagement.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0034-0561	1936-2714		WOS:000360769000014

Polymeric nanoparticle drug delivery technologies for oral delivery applications								EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY				12	9			1459	1473		10.1517/17425247.2015.1018175			SEP 2015	2015	Introduction: Many therapeutics are limited to parenteral administration. Oral administration is a desirable alternative because of the convenience and increased compliance by patients, especially for chronic diseases that require frequent administration. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) are one technology being developed to enable clinically feasible oral delivery.Areas covered: This review discusses the challenges associated with oral delivery. Strategies used to overcome gastrointestinal (GI) barriers using polymeric NPs will be considered, including mucoadhesive biomaterials and targeting of NPs to transcytosis pathways associated with M cells and enterocytes. Applications of oral delivery technologies will also be discussed, such as oral chemotherapies, oral insulin, treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, and mucosa! vaccinations.Expert opinion: There have been many approaches used to overcome the transport barriers presented by the GI tract, but most have been limited by low bioavailability. Recent strategies targeting NPs to transcytosis pathways present in the intestines have demonstrated that it is feasible to efficiently transport both therapeutics and NPs across the intestines and into systemic circulation after oral administration. Further understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the intestines could lead to additional improvements in oral polymeric NP technologies and enable the translation of these technologies to clinical practice.									14	0	0	7	0	14			1742-5247	1744-7593		WOS:000360184400006	25813361

The mixture of E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium strains was inoculated into the finished composts with moisture contents of 20, 30, and 40%, separately. The finished compost samples were then sieved into 3 different particle sizes (>1000, 500-1000, and <500 mu m) and stored under greenhouse conditions. For compost samples with moisture contents of 20 and 30%, the average Salmonella reductions in compost samples with particle sizes of >1000, 500-1000, and <500 mu m were 2.15, 2.27, and 2.47 log colony-forming units (CFU) g(-1) within 5 days of storage in summer, respectively, as compared with 1.60, 2.03, and 2.26 log CFU g(-1) in late fall, respectively, and 2.61, 3.33, and 3.67 log CFU g(-1) in winter, respectively. The average E. coli O157:H7 reductions in compost samples with particle sizes of >1000, 500-1000, and <500 mu m were 1.98, 2.30, and 2.54 log CFU g(-1) within 5 days of storage in summer, respectively, as compared with 1.70, 2.56, and 2.90 log CFU g(-1) in winter, respectively. Our results revealed that both Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 in compost samples with larger particle size survived better than those with smaller particle sizes, and the initial rapid moisture loss in compost may contribute to the fast inactivation of pathogens in the finished compost. For the same season, the pathogens in the compost samples with the same particle size survived much better at the initial moisture content of 20% compared to 40%.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1535-3141	1556-7125		WOS:000360214100003	26153914

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined, and the online databases PubMed and Web of Knowledge were searched using the search phrases: (1) YouTube* AND Health* and (2) YouTube* AND Healthcare*. In all, 18 articles were reviewed, with the results suggesting that (1) YouTube is increasingly being used as a platform for disseminating health information; (2) content and frame analysis were the primary techniques employed by researchers to analyze the characteristics of this information; (3) YouTube contains misleading information, primarily anecdotal, that contradicts the reference standards and the probability of a lay user finding such content is relatively high; (4) the retrieval of relevant videos is dependent on the search term used; and (5) videos from government organizations and professional associations contained trustworthy and high-quality information. YouTube is used as a medium for promoting unscientific therapies and drugs that are yet to be approved by the appropriate agencies and has the potential to change the beliefs of patients concerning controversial topics such as vaccinations. This review recognizes the need to design interventions to enable consumers to critically assimilate the information posted on YouTube with more authoritative information sources to make effective healthcare decisions.									15	0	0	2	0	15			1460-4582	1741-2811		WOS:000360409700001	24670899

Specifically, we consider a discrete-time switched nonlinear system with relative degree zero that switches between two modes. At the instants when the communication link transmits the packet successfully, the system evolves in closed-loop and the increase in storage function is bounded below the energy supplied by the control input. At the instants when a packet drop occurs, the system evolves in open loop according to the free dynamics of the closed-loop mode and the increase in storage function is not necessarily bounded by the supplied energy. The literature on passivity of switched systems seems to consider only the case when all the modes are passive, which is not the case here. We prove that if the ratio of time steps for which the system evolves in closed-loop versus in open loop is lower bounded by a critical number, the system is locally feedback passive in a suitably defined sense. This generalized definition of feedback passivity is useful since it preserves two important properties of classical passivity-that feedback passivity implies asymptotic stabilizability for zero state detectable systems and that feedback passivity is preserved in parallel and negative feedback interconnections.									1	1	0	0	0	2			0018-9286	1558-2523		WOS:000360501800013

Reverse propagation of McCormick relaxations								JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION				63	1			1	36		10.1007/s10898-015-0303-6			SEP 2015	2015	Constraint propagation techniques have heavily utilized interval arithmetic while the application of convex and concave relaxations has been mostly restricted to the domain of global optimization. Here, reverse McCormick propagation, a method to construct and improve McCormick relaxations using a directed acyclic graph representation of the constraints, is proposed. In particular, this allows the interpretation of constraints as implicitly defining set-valued mappings between variables, and allows the construction and improvement of relaxations of these mappings. Reverse McCormick propagation yields potentially tighter enclosures of the solutions of constraint satisfaction problems than reverse interval propagation. Ultimately, the relaxations of the objective of a non-convex program can be improved by incorporating information about the constraints.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-5001	1573-2916		WOS:000360193000001		
J	Freeman, Paul; Neyens, David M.; Wagner, John; Switzer, Fred; Alexander, Kim; Pidgeon, Philip								A video based run-off-road training program with practice and evaluation in a simulator								ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION				82				1	9		10.1016/j.aap.2015.05.008			SEP 2015	2015	A run-off-road (ROR) event occurs when one or more of a vehicle's wheels leaves the roadway and begins to travel on the surface or shoulder adjacent to the road. Despite various countermeasures, ROR crashes continue to yield a large number of fatalities and injuries. Infrastructure-based solutions do not directly address the critical factor of driver performance preceding and during an ROR event. In this study, a total of 75 individuals participated in a pre-post experiment to examine the effect of a training video on improving driver performance during a set of simulated ROR scenarios (e.g., on a high speed highway, a horizontal curve, and a residential rural road). In each scenario, the vehicle was unexpectedly forced into an ROR scenario for which the drivers were instructed to recover as safely as possible. The treatment group then watched a custom ROR training video while the control group viewed a placebo video. The participants then drove the same simulated ROR scenarios. The results suggest that the training video had a significant positive effect on drivers' steering response on all three roadway conditions as well as improvements in vehicle stability, subjectively rated demand on the driver, and self-evaluated performance in the highway scenario. Under the highway conditions, the treatment group reduced the frequency of spinouts from 70% in the pre-training events to 16% in the post-training events (chi(2)(1) = 23.32, p < 0.001) with no significant improvement found for the control group. In the horizontal curve, spinouts were reduced for the treatment group from 50% in the pre-training events to 30% in the post-training events (chi(2)(1)= 8.45, p = 0.004) with the control group also not showing any significant improvement. The results of this study suggest that even a short video about recovering from ROR events can significantly influence a driver's ability to recover. It is possible that additional training may have further benefits in recovering from ROR events. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore performed a post hoc analysis of one of our previously published studies on placebo responses (PRs). In the analysis, fourteen potential predictors for the PR on experimentally induced motion sickness in 32 healthy volunteers were explored using moderated multiple regression. Generalized self-efficacy, generalized self, internal locus of control and cognitive flexibility were significantly associated with symptom improvement in the placebo group, as compared to the untreated control group. Notably, the directions of the associations were such that the "unfavorable" side of the constructs (e.g. low self-efficacy) predicted a higher PR. Instead, the "favorable" side predicted symptom improvement in the control group. Results fit well with prior research into psychological influences on motion sickness. Although PRs in motion sickness are not well established, it is suggested to include the identified constructs in future research involving motion sickness-related symptoms such as nausea and vertigo. Concerning PRs in general, the results may have implications for clinical as well as experimental research on other symptoms and disorders, such as pain or depression.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1090-0586	1573-3270		WOS:000359426900003	25912825

An analytical framework for the design and comparative analysis of galloping energy harvesters under quasi-steady aerodynamics								SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES				24	9					094006	10.1088/0964-1726/24/9/094006			SEP 2015	2015	This paper presents a generalized formulation, analysis, and optimization of energy harvesters subjected to galloping and base excitations. The harvester consists of a cantilever beam with a bluff body attached at the free end. A nondimensional lumped-parameter model which accounts for the combined loading and different electro-mechanical transduction mechanisms is presented. The aerodynamic loading is modeled using the quasi-steady assumption with polynomial approximation. A nonlinear analysis is carried out and an approximate analytical solution is obtained. A dimensional analysis is performed to identify the important parameters that affect the system's response. The analysis of the response is divided into two parts. The first treats a harvester subjected to only galloping excitations. It is shown that, for a given shape of the bluff body and under quasi-steady flow conditions, the harvester's dimensionless response can be described by a single universal curve irrespective to the geometric, mechanical, and electrical design parameters of the harvester. In the second part, a harvester under concurrent galloping and base excitations is analyzed. It is shown that, the total output power depends on three dimensionless loading parameters; wind speed, base excitation amplitude, and excitation frequency. The response curves of the harvester are generated in terms of the loading parameters. These curves can serve as a complete design guide for scaling and optimizing the performance of galloping-based harvesters.					7th Annual ASME Conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS)7th Annual ASME Conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS)	SEP 08-10, 2014SEP 08-10, 2014	ASME, Aerospace DivASME, Aerospace Div	Newport, RINewport, RI	0	0	0	0	0	0			0964-1726	1361-665X		WOS:000360098500007

Articles dating back to 2000 were included because of specificity of the topic.Results: Research related to this particular situation supports the relationship between preoperative anxiety and negative postoperative outcomes for patients and their caregivers. However, limitations were identified during the course of the review, and further research on this particular relationship is warranted.Discussion: The review of literature identified that preoperative anxiety increased the risk of poor postoperative outcomes including atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, increased risk of readmission, increased morbidity and mortality, increased health care utilization, and increased anxiety in caregivers resulting in role strain and frustration.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0730-4625	1538-8646		WOS:000359739700007	26244244

This paper proposes and compares three different diagnostic schemes that address the issue of fault detection and isolation for the drivetrain and generator-converter subsystems of a wind turbine. The first diagnostic scheme is based on a cascade of two Kalman filters intended to alleviate the effect of the nonlinear aerodynamic torque generation in the drivetrain dynamics. The second scheme uses a bank of dedicated observers, each of which exploits Thau's argument for systems featuring nonlinear static feedback. The third scheme is a secondary H-infinity filtering mechanism constructed from parity equations by treating the nonlinearity as bounded uncertainty. The performance of each scheme is demonstrated using simulations of the wind turbine system. Robustness of the schemes has been analyzed in terms of parametric uncertainties and different operating conditions. A detailed comparison is also presented pointing to the positive and negative aspects of each scheme.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1063-6536	1558-0865		WOS:000359541200014

Electrochemical models provide arguably the most accurate and detailed information about the SOC of lithium-ion cells. In this brief, two nonlinear observer designs are presented based on a reduced order electrochemical model. Both observers consist of a Luenberger term acting on nominal errors and a variable structure term for handling model uncertainty. Using Lyapunov's direct method, the design of the Luenberger term in each observer is formulated as a linear matrix inequality problem, whereas the variable structure term is designed assuming uncertainty bounds. Simulation and experimental studies are included to demonstrate the performance of the proposed observers.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1063-6536	1558-0865		WOS:000359541200020

Effect of strain on duck breast meat quality								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POULTRY RESEARCH				24	3			401	407		10.3382/japr/pfv031			SEP 2015	2015	Duck meat consumption is low but steady in the United States (US), while rapidly expanding in other countries. The duck industry is moving from a traditional whole carcass product towards deboned breast fillets and other portions, which has prompted strain selection for breast weight and yield. The effect of bird strain was therefore evaluated for fillet weight, yield, and breast meat quality characteristics. Eighty butterflied paired fillets were obtained from each of 4 Pekin duck strains after carcasses were sized by weight at the processing plant (n = 640). All fillets were weighed and then half of the fillets were evaluated for color. One fillet from each carcass-pair was either frozen or kept fresh for cooking, reweighing, and subsequent color analysis (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) lightness L*, redness a*, and yellowness b*). Both fillets in each carcass-pair were evaluated using Allo-Kramer (AK) and Warner-Bratzler (WB) shear. Strain affected (P < 0.05) raw and cooked fillet weight. Strain C, with the largest BW and selected for both breast yield and growth rate, had higher raw and cooked breast weight. Cooked yield was not affected by strain and averaged 64.4%. Neither AK nor WB shear values were affected by strain, and averaged 4.8 kg/g and 4.2 kg, respectively. Strain had a slight but significant effect on color, affecting lightness (L*) values of all categories, and redness (a*) values of raw and cooked meat. Freezing and thawing produced large and significant thaw losses ranging from 10.4 to 13.6%; differing losses depended on the strain of duck. Duck strain affected breast fillet weights and lightness to a slight extent, but not cook yield or shear values.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1056-6171	1537-0437		WOS:000359729500013		
J	Whitehead, Andrew L.; Perry, Samuel L.								A More Perfect Union? Christian Nationalism and Support for Same-sex Unions								SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES				58	3			422	440		10.1177/0731121415577724			FAL 2015	2015	How do overlapping social identities shape Americans' views toward contemporary social and moral issues? Drawing upon national-level data and employing the theoretical construct of social identity complexity, we examine the link between Christian nationalism-representing a convergence of national and religious identities-and Americans' views toward same-sex marriage and civil unions. Multivariate analyses reveal that greater adherence to Christian nationalism is strongly and negatively related to support for both same-sex marriage and civil unions, even after controlling for political ideology, religious controls, attribution of homosexuality, and other relevant correlates. We argue that Christian nationalists, who by definition internalize a high degree of overlap between political and religious identities, are more likely to see gays and lesbians as out-groups and same-sex unions as a threat to their sense of self and community. We conclude by discussing the implications of this study for future research on political and religious identities and intolerance toward socially marginalized populations.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0731-1214	1533-8673		WOS:000359426700005

IRA was compared between seizure and PD identifications, as well as among rater groups that have passed an ICU EEG Certification Test, developed by the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium (CCEMRC).Results: Both kappa and event-based IRA statistics showed higher mean values in identification of seizures compared to PDs (k = 0.58 vs. 0.38; p < 0.001). The group of rater pairs who had both passed the ICU EEG Certification Test had a significantly higher mean IRA in comparison to rater pairs in which neither had passed the test.Conclusions: IRA among experts is significantly higher for identification of electrographic seizures compared to PDs. Additional instruction, such as the training module and certification test developed by the CCEMRC, could enhance this IRA.Significance: This study demonstrates more disagreement in the labeling of PDs in comparison to seizures. This may be improved by education about standard EEG nomenclature.

The site served as a stage for the negotiation of social capital; events held at the site were attempts to consolidate and reinforce a loyalist community on Bermuda. Archaeological evidence-in the form of ceramics, drinking vessels, and faunal remains-materialize the elite commensal practices that took place in the civic space. Architectural and archival lines of evidence illustrate the social and political contexts that made these events a necessity for the maintenance of Empire in the early modern Atlantic world.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1092-7697	1573-7748		WOS:000358743700005

In our models, at a given time period, network nodes (e.g., users or computing resources) are associated with probabilities of being infected, and each network edge is associated with some probability of propagating the infection. A decision maker would like to maximize the network's utility; keeping as many nodes open as possible, while satisfying given bounds on the probabilities of nodes being infected in the next time period. The model's relation to previous deterministic optimization models and to both probabilistic and deterministic asymptotic models is explored. Initially, maintaining the stochastic independence assumption of previous work, we formulate a nonlinear integer program with high-order multilinear terms. We then propose a quadratic formulation that provides a lower bound and feasible solution to the original problem. Further motivation for the quadratic model is given by showing that it alleviates the assumption of stochastic independence. The quadratic formulation is then linearized in order to be solved by standard integer programming solvers. We develop valid inequalities for the resulting formulations.

Our content analysis examines the ways in which Black hair is theorized and represented to children (from diverse backgrounds) very early on in their reading trajectory. We present a discussion of the theoretical perspectives informing our analysis, followed by a review of related African American children's literary scholarship. We then provide a description of the methodology that includes data sources, analytic procedures, and trustworthiness. Next, we present the findings, in which we delineate the three main themes identified within the six picturebooks. We conclude with reasons as to why this research is significant.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0045-6713	1573-1693		WOS:000358582500006

Efficacy of fungicides against powdery mildew on watermelon caused by Podosphaera xanthii								CROP PROTECTION				75				70	76		10.1016/j.cropro.2015.05.013			SEP 2015	2015	Powdery mildew caused by Podosphaera xanthii has affected watermelon in the southeastern United States since the late 1990's. Because this fungus has become resistant to fungicides in FRAC Groups 1 and 11, fungicides in FRAC Groups 3, 7, 9, 12, 13, and U6 were tested on seedless watermelon for their ability to reduce powdery mildew on foliage and prevent yield loss. Nine powdery mildew-specific fungicides were applied three times in alternation with chlorothalonil, which was applied three times in 2013 and four times in 2014. Control treatments included water and chlorothalonil applied every other week. In both years, four fungicide treatments, chlorothalonil alternated with triflumizole, fluopyram + tebuconazole, quinoxyfen, or both cyflufenamid and quinoxyfen reduced leaf area covered with powdery mildew compared to both control treatments. Chlorothalonil alternated with cyflufenamid and quinoxyfen was significantly more effective on lower leaf surfaces than all other treatments. Chlorothalonil alternated with tebuconazole did not differ from chlorothalonil applied every other week. All 10 fungicide treatments increased the number and weight of marketable-sized fruit in both years compared to the water control treatment. Fungicide active ingredients in FRAC Groups 3, 7, 13, and U6 consistently reduced the severity of powdery mildew on seedless watermelon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This device, which is essentially a wet scrubber enhanced by ultrasound, was shown to significantly improve the scavenging of micron-scale particles compared to the use of a water spray alone. Herein a simulation of trajectories of the particles and spray drops in the ultrasonic scrubber are presented. These simulations and an associated model of the process are used to provide a mechanistic understanding of the enhanced scavenging observed in the ultrasonic scrubber. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Like other retailers, gasoline stations in the United States disproportionately sell at prices ending in odd digits. I show that station prices are higher and change less frequently in locations using more odd prices (particularly those ending in 5 or 9), even after controlling for other market characteristics. The evidence suggests that the use of pricing points can be an effective mechanism for tacitly coordinating prices, providing an alternative explanation for the widespread use of odd prices in retail markets.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1058-6407	1530-9134		WOS:000358694500010

Molecular data were acquired from partial DNA sequences of the mitochondria-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes, and the nuclear-encoded 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA genes. No single gene, nor the concatenated gene set, resolved all species or all relationships. However, all morphologically established species were supported by at least one gene.

Numerical experiments are provided that verify the theoretical convergence rates, and also that test the model/scheme on a benchmark double-gyre wind forcing experiment. For the latter test, we find the proposed model/scheme gives a good coarse mesh approximation to the highly resolved direct numerical simulation of the BV model, and compares favorably to related regularization model results.

This approach enabled preparation of several fluorinated poly(arylene ether)s containing isomeric fragments, with or without allyl or acetyl side groups, which were prepared by interaction of the synthesized tetrafluorobenzene-based monomer with various types of hydroxyl-substituted diphenyl ethers. The structure of the synthesized compounds was determined using Fourier transform infrared, H-1 NMR and (19) F NMR spectroscopy techniques. Most of the resulting polyethers were soluble in chlorinated, ether-type or polar amide solvents. The molecular weight, mechanical and thermal properties of the synthesized fluorinated poly(arylene ether)s were studied depending on the inherent isomery of macromolecular chains and the nature of functional groups. Some ways of functionalization of the prepared fluorinated polyethers with epoxy and triethoxysilyl groups were proposed.

Luminescence and scintillation enhancement of Y2O3:Tm transparent ceramic through post-fabrication thermal processing								JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE				165				56	61		10.1016/j.jlumin.2015.03.041			SEP 2015	2015	The effects of post-fabrication thermal processing in O-2 flux on the luminescence and scintillation of a Y2O3:Tm transparent ceramic were investigated. The results showed that the strategy of post-fabrication processing can be beneficial to the performance of the ceramics, depending on the cumulative processing time. After the first hour of processing, about 40% enhancement in the luminescence output together with about 20% enhancement in the scintillation light yield were obtained. The enhancements were tentatively assigned to the incorporation of oxygen into vacancy sites. Longer cumulative processing times lead to the incorporation of oxygen as interstitials that is detrimental to scintillation light yield but not to luminescence output. This work also revealed that thermoluminescence measurements are a useful tool to predict scintillation light yield of Y2O3:Tm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The porous microsphere was placed inside a thin wall silica capillary tube that was fusion-spliced to an optical fiber. The whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of the microsphere were excited by the evanescent field of the light propagating inside the capillary thin wall. Adsorption of chemical vapor molecules into the pores led to a refractive index change of the PGM and thus the resonance wavelength shift of the WGMs. To facilitate the in-taking of chemical vapor molecules into the PGM, a micro window was opened at the backend of the capillary tube using femtosecond laser micromachining. Ethanol vapor was used to demonstrate the probe for chemical vapor sensing. With a miniaturized size, integrated structure and reflection mode of operation, the proposed probe may find useful in many practical applications such as environmental monitoring and biomedical sensing.

Preceramic polymers (polycarbosilane and poly(vinyl)silazane) are combined with sacrificial porogens (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene microbeads) to yield porous ceramic materials in the Si-C or Si-C-N systems, exhibiting well-defined pore structures after thermal conversion.The planar-disc-type specimens were found to exhibit biaxial flexural strengths of up to 60 MPa. In combination with their observed permeability characteristics, the prepared structures were found to be suitable for potential applications in filtration, catalysis, or membrane science.

Our scenario makes use of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory, in which the Born probability rule has a dynamical origin. The large-scale power deficit could arise from incomplete relaxation for the amplitudes of the primordial perturbations. We show, by numerical simulations for a spectator scalar field, that if the preinflationary era is radiation dominated then the deficit in the emerging power spectrum will have a characteristic shape (an inverse-tangent dependence on wave number k, with oscillations). It is found that our scenario is able to produce a power deficit in the observed region and of the observed (approximate) magnitude for an appropriate choice of cosmological parameters. We also discuss the large-scale anisotropy, which might arise from incomplete relaxation for the phases of the primordial perturbations. We present numerical simulations for phase relaxation, and we show how to define characteristic scales for amplitude and phase nonequilibrium. The extent to which the data might support our scenario is left as a question for future work. Our results suggest that we have a potentially viable model that might explain two apparently independent cosmic anomalies by means of a single mechanism.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1550-7998	1550-2368		WOS:000360065000005
