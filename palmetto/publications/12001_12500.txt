'L-93' Creeping Bentgrass Putting Green Responses to Various Winter Light Intensities in the Southern Transition Zone								HORTSCIENCE				44	6			1751	1756					OCT 2009	2009	Seasonal variations in temperature and solar radiation in the warm climatic region of the transition zone increase difficulty of creeping bentgrass [Agrostis stolonifera var. palustris (Huds.)] management throughout the year. The impact of winter shade on bentgrass quality and subsequent residual effects of winter shade in spring and summer months has not been investigated. Therefore, a 2-year field study investigated trinexapacethyl (TE) [4-(cyclopropyl-alpha-hydroxy-methylene)-3,5-dioxy-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester] as a winter management strategy to alleviate winter shade stress and determined the winter shade tolerance of 'L-93' creeping bentgrass under various reduced light environments. Treatments included a full-sunlight control; 58% and 96% morning, afternoon, and full-day shade artificial; and TE (0.02 kg a.i./ha) applied every 2 weeks from December to July. Data collection included daily light measurements (photosynthetic photon flux density), monthly canopy and soil temperatures, visual turfgrass quality (TQ), chlorophyll concentration, clipping yield, total root biomass, and total root nonstructural carbohydrates. Under 96% shade, canopy temperatures were reduced approximate to 57% from December to February, whereas soil temperatures were reduced 39% in February compared with full sunlight. Afternoon shade (58%) maintained acceptable TQ throughout winter for both years. Applying TE every 2 weeks in the winter negatively impacted bentgrass quality; however, TE enhanced spring and summer quality. Morning or afternoon shade minimally impacted parameters measured. Overall, moderate winter shade may not limit 'L-93' creeping bentgrass performance as a putting green in the transition zone. Results suggest winter shade does not contribute to creeping bentgrass summer decline because all shade-treated plots fully recovered from shade damage in spring months.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-5345			WOS:000270776300044		
J	Stiglbauer, John B.; Liu, Haibo; McCarty, Lambert B.; Park, Dara M.; Toler, Joe E.; Kirk, Kendal								'Diamond' Zoysiagrass Putting Green Establishment Affected by Sprigging Rates, Nitrogen Sources, and Rates in the Southern Transition Zone								HORTSCIENCE				44	6			1757	1761					OCT 2009	2009	'Diamond' zoysiagrass [Zoysia matrella (L.) Merr.] has a potential to become a new alternative warm-season putting green turfgrass. The main objective of the study was to determine factors affecting establishment speed for 'Diamond' zoysiagrass as a putting green in the southern transition zone of the United States. Two sprigging rates, three nitrogen (N) sources, two N rates, and two mowing heights (2.5 and 3.2 mm) were compared at Clemson University, Clemson, SC. Sprigs of 'Diamond' zoysiagrass were planted at rates of 91 or 182 m(3).ha(-1) in 2007 and repeated in 2008. Urea, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate were applied at 1.7 or 3.4 g N/m(2)/week from weeks after sprigging (WAS) 3 to 10. Rates were halved from was 11 to 16. The N fertilizers were applied as solutions weekly for 16 weeks. Weekly percent cover, turf color ratings, root and clipping sample, and ball rolling were collected for both years. A significant difference occurred in turf cover between high and low sprig rates. Turf color and cover results show that high rates of fertility associated with high rates of sprigs produced 100% turf cover at was 11 and 13 in both years. At the 2.5-mm mowing height, ball rolling reached 258 cm in August and was significantly faster than the 3.2-mm mowing height. Results show 'Diamond' zoysiagrass can be established within the same growing season to meet a playable putting green quality, but the establishment speed may vary depending on summer monthly temperature fluctuations.									7	0	0	7	0	7			0018-5345			WOS:000270776300045		
J	Muth, Eric R.								The Challenge of Uncoupled Motion: Duration of Cognitive and Physiological Aftereffects								HUMAN FACTORS				51	5			752	761		10.1177/0018720809353320			OCT 2009	2009	Objective: This study aimed to document the cognitive aftereffects of exposure to uncoupled motion and the time course of recovery from these aftereffects. Background: Uncoupled motion refers to a situation in which an individual is simultaneously exposed to two asynchronous motions, either real or virtual. These environments are a challenge for designers because technology that is supposed to increase the user's task performance may actually lead to decreased task performance. Method: In the study, 11 male participants, (median age = 32 years) with prior flight experience (median = 600 hr) were exposed to an uncoupled motion environment consisting of a flight simulator on a vertically oscillating platform. Participants completed a cognitive test battery, a balance test, and a dynamic visual acuity test preexposure, immediately postexposure, and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hr postexposure. Results: The uncoupled motion scenario led to significant cognitive aftereffects that cannot be solely attributed to motion sickness. These aftereffects lasted between 2 and 4 hr postexposure. The scenario generated some physiological aftereffects that lasted between 1 and 2 hr postexposure. However, it is likely that these aftereffects can be attributed to motion sickness. Conclusion: Uncoupled motion can cause unappreciated effects, such as degraded cognitive performance. Application: System designs that create uncoupled motion need to be evaluated for the potential to generate operator impairment, and designs should be modified to minimize this potential wherever possible. When redesign is not possible, system-use guidelines should be developed to minimize impairment. The current results suggest operators avoid performing cognitively demanding tasks for at least 2 hr postexposure.									7	0	0	4	0	7			0018-7208			WOS:000273965900011	20196299	
J	Hutchenson, Dwight K.; Noneaker, Daniel L.								New Closed-Form Bounds on the Performance of Coding in Correlated Rayleigh Fading								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS				57	10			2923	2931		10.1109/TCOMM.2009.10.080217			OCT 2009	2009	New, simple bounds are presented for the probability of error in a binary hypothesis test for communications using diversity signaling in correlated Rayleigh fading. The bounds are developed in the context of pairwise error-event probabilities in decoding an error-correction code. A long-standing conjecture regarding the form of worst-case error events in exponentially correlated Rayleigh fading is also proven. The utility of the results is illustrated by their application to transfer-function bounds on the probability of bit error for a system using a convolutional code. The closed-form transfer-function bounds are shown to be tighter than previously developed transfer-function bounds for communications in exponentially correlated Rayleigh fading.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0090-6778			WOS:000270908700019

Worker Pay Protection: Implications for Labor's Political Spending and Voice								INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS				48	4			557	577					OCT 2009	2009	Labor's participation in politics requires money. Within legal restrictions, unions use compulsory dues to pay for much of their involvement. Such usage has continually raised controversy, leading to a host of U.S. Supreme Court decisions to give nonmember dues-payers the right to object to union political spending. We examine the current legal framework and are the first to report comprehensive data on union political spending financed from dues. We estimate the potential impact of a national "worker paycheck protection" law on labor's political spending. With the potential to reduce money available to finance union involvement in politics, such a law may lessen the ability of labor to have its voice heard by lawmakers, especially in the face of shrinking density in the workforce. The importance of this is demonstrated by the large role unions played in the 2008 congressional and presidential elections. Despite Democratic victories in that historic year, "paycheck protection" is likely to loom large, fueled by efforts to enact the Employee Free Choice Act.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0019-8676			WOS:000269264700001		
J	Rong, Guang; Grover, Varun								Keeping up-to-date with information technology: Testing a model of technological knowledge renewal effectiveness for IT professionals								INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT				46	7			376	387		10.1016/j.im.2009.07.002			OCT 2009	2009	In a rapidly changing IT environment, IT professionals need to keep abreast of technological knowledge. We examined how well this is achieved by developing a motivational model of "technological knowledge renewal effectiveness." We hypothesized that (1) renewal effectiveness was influenced by the IT professional's career orientation, perceived IT dynamism, tolerance of ambiguity, delegation; and (2) that this positively affected both intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction. Survey data from 126 IT professionals was used to test the hypotheses. The results generally supported the research model. We discussed the implications of these results in both research and practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0378-7206			WOS:000271334500002		
J	Cho, Byung Rae; Shin, Sangmun; Choi, Yongsun; Kovach, Jami								Development of a multidisciplinary optimization process for designing optimal pharmaceutical formulations with constrained experimental regions								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY				44	9-10			841	853		10.1007/s00170-008-1895-5			OCT 2009	2009	Pharmaceutical formulation design with the development of analytical technologies and methodologies is an integral part of a drug's research and development. Conventional pharmaceutical formulation design problems are typically studied under the assumption of an unconstrained experimental region with a single quality characteristic. In real world pharmaceutical formulation design problems, however, we are often faced with multiple quality characteristics with a constrained experimental region due to physical limitations. In order to address these needs, we propose a multidisciplinary optimization process for the optimal design of pharmaceutical formulations by developing a response surface simplex design (RSSD) and a response surface D-optimal design (REDD) for experimental modeling and by developing a partitioned composite desirability function (PCDF) for multidisciplinary optimization. Two actual case studies are also presented here for model verification purposes.									6	0	0	1	1	6			0268-3768			WOS:000269881500001		
J	Holle, Lori; Song, Wen; Holle, Eric; Wei, Yangzhang; Li, Jinhua; Wagner, Thomas E.; Yu, Xianzhong								In vitro- and in vivo-targeted tumor lysis by an MMP2 cleavable melittin-LAP fusion protein								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY				35	4			829	835		10.3892/ijo_00000396			OCT 2009	2009	Chemotherapy is one of the main treatment options for cancer, but the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs is severely limited due to their systemic toxicity. Therefore, the need for a more targeted approach in tumor treatment is obvious. A tumor-activated agent would decrease systemic toxicity as well as increase the efficacy of the treatment. It has previously been shown that the latency of pro-TGF-beta is conferred by dimerization of two latency-associated peptides (LAP) that form a protective shield, which is cleaved off upon activation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It has also been shown that the fusion of this LAP peptide with other cytokines can confer their latency. In the present study, a recombinant adenovirus with a fusion gene encoding a tumor-activated pro-cytolytic peptide was made in which the LAP domain of TGF-beta was fused with melittin, a potent cytolytic toxin, with an MMP2 cleavage site in between the two. In vitro studies show that the melittin-MMP2-LAP recombinant adenovirus can be activated by MMP2 which leads to the release of free melittin to lyse the target cells. In vivo studies show approximately a 70% decrease in B16 tumor volume in melittin-MMP2-LAP recombinant adenovirus-treated mice as compared to control mice. No significant systemic toxicity was observed in the treated mice.									14	0	1	13	0	15			1019-6439			WOS:000269780600019	19724919

Ziaur								New Records of Invasive Insects (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha) in Southeast Asia and West Africa								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN ENTOMOLOGY				26	4			167	174					OCT 2009	2009	Several sap-sucking insects (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha) of neotropical origin have been accidentally introduced to Southeast Asia and West Africa in recent years, including the mealybugs Paracoccus marginatus Williams & Granara de Willink, Phenacoccus madeirensis Green, Phenacoccus manihoti Matile-Ferrero, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley, Pseudococcus jackbeardsleyi Gimpel & Miller, and the whitefly Aleurodicus dugesii Cockerell (Aleyrodidae).

J	Marko, P. B.; Moran, A. L.				Moran, Amy/F-7072-2011				Out of sight, out of mind: high cryptic diversity obscures the identities and histories of geminate species in the marine bivalve subgenus Acar								JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY				36	10			1861	1880		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02114.x			OCT 2009	2009	AimThe rise of the Isthmus of Panama and the formation of 'geminate' species pairs serves as an important model of allopatric speciation. However, to function as a model system, hypothesized geminates must first be shown to be each other's closest living relatives. If the presence of cryptic taxa obscures true relationships, the biogeographical histories of transisthmian taxa are likely to be misinterpreted. We have therefore completed a phylogeographic survey of the transisthmian bivalve subgenus Acar in the genus Barbatia to characterize patterns of tropical American diversity and to place transisthmian taxa in a regional phylogeographic context.LocationTropical America.MethodsMitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were obtained from 233 specimens of Acar. Sequences were analysed using cladistic and Bayesian methods. Divergence times between species were inferred from net nucleotide divergences and a coalescence-based method.ResultsThe survey revealed 22 COI clades that were also monophyletic at ITS, indicating that the taxonomy of Acar is potentially greater than a fivefold diversity underestimate. The lone previously recognized geminate [Barbatia (Acar) gradata and Barbatia (Acar) domingensis] is composed of 15 clades. Among the four transisthmian lineages identified, two diverged more than 14 Ma; the two other geminates split just prior to the time of final seaway closure. In addition to a fourfold increase in the number of known geminates, our data show that within-basin diversification has been more impressive, with one geminate splitting into five monophyletic clades in the Western Atlantic alone since seaway closure. Electron microscopy of the larval shells of specimens indicates that the transisthmian lineage with the greatest rate of post-Isthmian diversification possesses non-planktonic larvae, a life-history feature linked to high speciation rates.Main conclusionsOur analyses revealed that the identities of geminate pairs split by the Isthmus of Panama were obscured by extremely high tropical American cryptic diversity. Although we have identified four geminates, only two appear to have been split by the Isthmus. Our uncovering of extensive post-Isthmian diversification is consistent with the palaeontological perspective that the final closure of the Central American Seaway was followed by high rates of subgeneric diversification, particularly in the tropical Western Atlantic.									31	0	0	30	0	31			0305-0270	1365-2699		WOS:000270070900005

Evaluation of catfish oil as a feedstuff for lactating Holstein cows								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				92	10			5178	5188		10.3168/jds.2009-2283			OCT 2009	2009	The objective of this study was to evaluate catfish oil (CFO) as a dietary ingredient for lactating Holstein cows. Twelve multiparous Holstein cows (6 fitted with a rumen cannula and 6 noncannulated cows), arranged in a 3 x 3 Latin square design replicated 4 times, were used to evaluate CFO as a dietary ingredient for lactating Holstein cows. Each period lasted 27 d with the last 13 d used for data collection. Dietary treatments were 0, 1.5, and 3% CFO (dry matter basis). Orally dosing with chromium oxide powder was used as an external inert marker for calculation of apparent dry matter and nutrient digestion coefficients. Ruminal fluid was collected hourly for 8 h after feeding to measure pH and volatile fatty acids. Intake of dry matter increased as intake of CFO increased (23.0, 24.4, and 25.4 kg/d). Production of milk was unchanged by the feeding of CFO (29.0, 29.0, and 29.4 kg/d). Concentrations of milk fat (3.57, 3.60, and 3.48%) and protein (3.21, 3.18, and 3.23%) were unchanged by feeding CFO. Concentrations of plasma glucose (57.8, 55.1, and 56.0 mg/100 mL), urea nitrogen (11.6, 11.0, and 12.0 mg/100 mL), and insulin (0.55, 0.53, and 0.57 ng/mL) were not affected by dietary treatments. Average ruminal fluid pH decreased (6.40, 6.20, and 6.15), as did the molar proportions of acetate (64.5, 64.2, and 63.4%), as dietary concentration of CFO increased. The molar proportions of propionate increased (19.4, 20.0, and 20.4%) as did that of butyrate (12.0, 12.4, and 12.5%) as intake of CFO increased. Ruminal protozoa numbers were unchanged by treatments. Apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber were increased by addition of CFO. In situ lag, rate, and extent of corn silage dry matter digestion were not affected by the inclusion of CFO. However, in situ digestion rate of neutral detergent fiber was increased (0.023, 0.024, and 0.029 h(-1)) with increasing intake of CFO. In a second study involving 190 Holstein cows, those fed CFO at 1.8% of dietary dry matter produced 1.2 kg more milk/d than those not fed CFO, along with an increase in milk protein concentration. Catfish oil can be a viable lipid source for dairy cows when fed at up to 3% of the dietary dry matter.									8	0	0	7	1	8			0022-0302			WOS:000269927500050	19762836

(Malvales: Malvaceae), coffee (Coffea arabica L.) (Gentianales: Rubiaceae), and green and black tea (Camellia sinensis L.) (Ericales: Theaceae) provided excellent UV radiation protection for the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), nucleopolyhedrovirus under laboratory conditions. Aqueous extracts of coffee, green tea, and black tea at 0.5% provided 85-100% UV protection, whereas cocoa provided 50% UV protection. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a component of green tea, and caffeine, a component of tea and coffee, also were tested as UV protectants. Both compounds were ineffective when tested alone. When EGCG and caffeine were combined, UV protection increased in a synergistic manner, but <35% of the original virus activity was maintained. This study demonstrated that coffee was comparable to green tea and black tea as a UV protectant. Further studies should be conducted to optimize their use in biopesticide formulations.									7	0	0	7	0	8			0022-0493			WOS:000270605700006	19886440

This article contributes to this literature by utilizing the 2000 wave of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to examine variation in husbands' and wives' relative income by race/ethnicity, human capital, labor supply, and life stage. The author finds that Black women's disproportionate concentration among high relative earning wives can be attributed more to their greater attachment to paid labor than to their husbands' labor supply. Nonetheless, Black women's odds of earning as much as or more than their husbands are greater than those of White women. In addition, unlike research on the mother hood wage gap more generally, the author finds that the impact of motherhood on women's earnings relative to their husbands can be largely explained by mothers' lower labor supply relative to their childless counterparts.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0192-513X			WOS:000269672600005

Family Variables that Mediate the Relation Between Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and Child Adjustment								JOURNAL OF FAMILY VIOLENCE				24	7			433	445		10.1007/s10896-009-9239-2			OCT 2009	2009	This study examined the mediating roles of several family variables in the relation between IPV witnessing and children's emotional and behavioral problems among 129 low-income, African American children ages 8 to 12. According to the mediational model tested, experiencing or witnessing IPV negatively impacted the following family variables: maternal psychopathology, family cohesion, and relatedness quality, which were subsequently associated with diminished child adjustment. These findings were stronger when child reports were considered and when the outcome variable was internalizing problems. Findings from this study support the value of targeting these variables in the development of culturally appropriate child witness interventions for low-income African American families. Recommendations for future interventions based on study conclusions are offered.									20	0	0	1	0	20			0885-7482	1573-2851		WOS:000267824900002

Considering this, methods and techniques by which to accomplish this feedback have been the focus of numerous studies in recent years. Moreover, with the rapid advances in computing technology, the complexity and computational overhead that can be feasibly incorporated in any developed technique have dramatically improved. Thus, techniques that would have been impractical for implementation just a few years ago can now be realistically applied. This rapid growth has resulted in a wealth of new capabilities for improving part and process quality and reliability. In this paper, overviews of recent advances that apply to machining are presented. More specifically, research publications pertaining to the use of coordinate measurement machines to improve the machining process are discussed.

The objective of this study is to numerically investigate the bubble expansion-induced cell mechanical loading profile in laser-assisted cell direct writing. Some conclusions have been drawn as follows. The cell velocity increases initially and then smoothes out gradually with a constant ejection velocity. Both the cell acceleration and pressure can be very high at the beginning period of bubble expansion and then quickly approach zero in an oscillation manner. A high viscosity can lead to an observable velocity increment at the initial stage, but the ejection velocity decreases. The pressure magnitude decreases when the cell-bubble distance is large, and a larger initial pressure induces a larger cell pressure as expected.

J	Grujicic, M.; Sellappan, V.; Arakere, G.; Seyr, Norbert; Obieglo, Andreas; Erdmann, Marc; Holzleitner, Jochen								The Potential of a Clinch-Lock Polymer Metal Hybrid Technology for Use in Load-Bearing Automotive Components								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				18	7			893	902		10.1007/s11665-008-9325-2			OCT 2009	2009	In order to help meet the needs of automotive original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers for a cost-effective, robust, reliable polymer-metal-hybrid (PMH) technology which can be used for the manufacturing of load-bearing body-in-white (BIW) components and which is compatible with the current BIW manufacturing process chain, a new approach, the so-called direct-adhesion PMH technology, was recently proposed (Grujicic et al., J. Mater. Process. Technol., 2008, 195, p 282-298). Within this approach, the necessary level of polymer-to-metal mechanical interconnectivity is attained through direct adhesion and mechanical interlocking. In the present work, a new concept for mechanical interlocking between the metal and plastics is proposed and analyzed computationally. The approach utilizes some of the ideas used in the spot-clinching joining process and is appropriately named clinch-lock PMH technology. To assess the potential of the clinch-lock approach for providing the required level of metal/polymer mechanical interlocking, a set of finite-element based sheet-metal forming, injection molding and structural mechanics analyses was carried out. The results obtained show that stiffness and buckling resistance levels can be attained which are comparable with those observed in the competing injection overmolding PMH process but with an similar to 3% lower weight (of the polymer subcomponent) and without the need for holes and for overmolding of the free edges of the metal stamping.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1059-9495			WOS:000269897600007

However, usability issues may prevent older adults from easily accessing such information. Prior research has shown that aging is associated with a unique pattern of cognitive changes, and knowledge of these changes may be used in the design of health websites for older adults.Objective: The goal of the current study was to examine whether older adults use of a health information website was affected by an alternative information architecture and access interface (hierarchical versus tag-based).Methods: Fifty younger adults (aged 18-23) and 50 older adults (aged 60-80) navigated a health information website, which was organized hierarchically or used tags/keywords, to find answers to health-related questions while their performance was tracked. We hypothesized that older adults would perform better in the tag-based health information website because it placed greater demands oil abilities that remain intact with aging (verbal ability and vocabulary).Results: The pattern of age-related differences in computer use was consistent with prior research with older adults. We found that older adults had been using computers for less time (F(1,98)=10.6, P=.002) and used them less often (F(1,98)=11.3, P=.001) than younger adults. Also consistent with the cognitive aging literature, younger adults had greater spatial visualization and orientation abilities (F(1,98)=34.6, P<.001 and F(1,98)=6.8, P=.01) and a larger memory span (F(1,98)=5.7, P=.02) than older adults, but older adults had greater vocabulary (F(1.98)=11.4, P=-.001). Older adults also took significantly more medications than younger adults (F(1,98)=57.7, P<.001). in the information search task, older adults performed worse than younger adults (F(1.96)=18.0, P<.001). However, there was a significant age x condition interaction indicating that while younger adults outperformed older adults in the hierarchical condition (F(1,96)=25.2, P<.001), there were no significant age-related differences in the tag-based condition, indicating that older adults performed as well as younger adults in this condition.Conclusions: Access to online health information is increasing in popularity and can lead to a more informed health consumer. However, usability barriers may differentially affect older adults. The results of the current study suggest that the design of health information websites that take into account age-related changes in cognition can enhance older adults' access to such information.									17	0	0	4	0	17			1438-8871			WOS:000274633000006	19917549

This fabrication utilizes the micromachining procedures including photo-lithography, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and dry and wet etching processes. The device size of the silicon membrane filled with Nafion (R) was 1 cm x 1 cm. The pores were smaller than 500 nm. ne cross-sectional shape of the silicon membrane was an inverse pyramid structure to improve its mechanical strength and to enhance its surface treatment process. This technique combines the advantages of Nafion (R) with a good proton conductivity and silicon membrane, such as easy serial and parallel integration, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1480-2422			WOS:000273444000001

While this conjecture is known for powers of primes e that are not exceptional for the power under consideration, it is an open problem for exceptional primes. We settle this conjecture in many cases for small powers of the partition function by generalizing results of Ono and Ahlgren. It should be noted our method requires a case by case examination of each power and does not yield a general method for dealing with different powers simultaneously.

EFFECTS OF OVARIECTOMY IN PREPUBERTAL GOATS								JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY				60				127	133				3	OCT 2009	2009	The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of ovariectomy on mammary gland development in prepubertal goats and to validate this model to study mammogenesis in young dairy ruminants. In this experiment, 3 months of aged goats were ovariectomized (ovx) while shammed goats played as surgery controls (sham). Thereafter, sham and ovx goats were slaughtered at 7 months of age to provide tissue for the assays. Results demonstrated that proliferation of mammary of mammary epithelial cells was significantly lower in ovariectomized goats compared to control goats. In ovx animal, epithelium structures were completely overstretched and epithelial ducts were undeveloped with limited branching whereas control animals had classical complex arborescent units with multiple round ductules and limited stroma. Concerning ER alpha (estrogen receptor alpha), PR (progesterone receptor) and P450 (aromatase) expression, results showed number of ER alpha, PR and P450 positive cells was higher in shammed goats compared to ovariectomized goats. All this results suggested that goat mammogenesis and ovarian control are similar to prepubertal heifers and that young goats are a good model to study mammary gland development in ruminants. In conclusion, we demonstrated that ovariectomy of prepubertal goats decreased proliferation of mammary epithelial cells with a profound alteration of cell adhesion molecules.					6th International Symposium for Young Scientists - Human and Animal Development: Regulatory Mechanisms6th International Symposium for Young Scientists - Human and Animal Development: Regulatory Mechanisms	SEP 09-10, 2008SEP 09-10, 2008	Polish Physiol SocPolish Physiol Soc	Lublin, POLANDLublin, POLAND	8	0	0	8	0	8			0867-5910			WOS:000271599500017	19996493

Meanwhile, construction engineering faculty seeks research projects and funding for graduate students who, in turn, seek additional practical experience. In response, symbiotic relationships, between an academic department with construction engineering proficiency and the administrative office that oversees campus construction, have formed at both The University of Alabama (UA) and The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). At each institution, the intracampus collaboration provides funded opportunities and access to projects, which enable graduate students to successfully complete thesis research (M.S. and Ph.D.). Further, campus construction offices at both institutions are also realizing benefits from the collaboration, including a connection to academia, and have committed to continuing the relationship indefinitely. Aimed at helping other institutions establish and benefit from similar collaboration, this paper describes a model for research partnerships made possible by campus construction. The development of a model for intracampus construction collaboration is explained using separate experiences from UA and Penn State. Both positive results and lessons learned are shared.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1052-3928			WOS:000269848700002

Optical characterization of the oxysulfide glasses has shown that the UV cut-off wavelength decreases with increasing oxygen content. Using Raman spectroscopy, correlations have been made between the formation of new Ge- and Sb-based oxysulfide structural units, the Sb content and the O/S ratio. We demonstrate the successful processing of active rare earth doped oxysulfide glasses by melting the chalcogenide glass with Er2O3 and Sb2O3 and also by melting the Er3+ doped chalcogenide glass with Sb2O3. Modification of the emission spectra at 1500 nm of Er3+ doped samples with the introduction of oxygen revealed that Er3+ most likely exists in dual O- and S-neighbor environments. Finally, the photo-response of these new glasses upon near-IR femtosecond laser irradiation has been investigated as a function of Sb content and O/S ratio and shows that the glasses are photo-sensitive to NIR fs laser light with the magnitude of the photo-sensitivity dependent on the glass' Sb content and O/S ratio.

Measurements were made with picosecond pulses emitted by a 10 Hz Q-switched mode-locked Nd-YAG laser at 1064 nm under conditions suitable to characterize ultrafast nonlinearities. The nonlinear index increases up to 500 times the n2 of fused silica with an increase in the Ge/Se ratio and a decrease with an increase of the Ge/Sb ratio. We confirmed, using Raman spectroscopy, that the nonlinear refractive index depends oil the number of Ge-S(Se) and Sb-S(Se) bonds in the glass network.

As structure influences properties and, subsequently, performance the purpose of this work is to compare the morphological and chemical nature of the nanoparticles synthesized using two common methods: solution precipitation and combustion synthesis. A thorough characterization of as-prepared and calcined powders was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, conventional and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller methods. Solution precipitation was found to lead to two different precursor compositions (yttrium carbonate or yttrium hydroxide) depending on the precipitating reagent whereas combustion synthesis yielded only phase-pure, cubic Er: Y2O3. The hydroxide precipitation and combustion synthesis methods exhibited agglomerated particles with low surface area after calcining the precursors at 900 degrees C. The addition of a small amount of ammonium sulfate during combustion synthesis was found to reduce the level of agglomeration, resultant particle size, and degree of crystallinity of the calcined Er: Y2O3 nanoparticles. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) on the surface of the Er: Y2O3 powders is dependent on the powder surface area, however, increasing levels of gas absorption on the particle surfaces do not have a detrimental effect on the sinterability. The sintered density increases with increasing surface area and decreasing agglomeration.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0002-7820			WOS:000270188300014

Defatted soy flakes dispersed into water (16%, w/w) were sonicated for 30, 60 and 120 s at ultrasonic amplitudes of 21 and 84 A mu m(pp) (peak to peak amplitude in A mu m), representing low and high power, respectively. The power densities were 0.30 and 2.56 W mL(-1), respectively. The SPI yield increased by 13 and 34%, after sonication for 120 s at low and high power, respectively. The sonication of defatted soy flakes for 120 s at the higher power level improved the SPI solubility by 34% at pH 7.0, while decreasing emulsification and foaming capacities by 12 and 26%, respectively, when compared to control SPI. Rheological behavior of the SPI was also modified with significant loss in consistency coefficient due to sonication. Some of these results could be explained by the loss of the protein native state with increased sonication time and power.									24	3	0	13	0	26			0003-021X			WOS:000269880500013

On the Synthesis and Anticancer Testing of alpha,beta-Unsaturated Ketones as Analogs of Combretastatin-A4								LETTERS IN DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY				6	7			531	537		10.2174/157018009789108277			OCT 2009	2009	Twenty- one alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone analogs of combretastatin-A4 (CA-4) that were designed for good solubility in aqueous media were synthesized. Compounds defined as Type A were derived from phenylacetone, in which subclass I contained ortho-, meta- or no substituents, sub-class II contained para-substituents, and sub-class III consisted of two substituents. Type B compounds were derived from cyclopropyl 2-fluorobenzyl ketone. The cis-configuration of the target compounds was ascertained through a single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis of the fluorine-containing compound 8f. Five of the analogs, 8c, 8j and 8l of Type A and 9d and 9i of Type B, were shown to display modest cytotoxic potency (IC(50) in the 3.8 - 21 mu M range) against the growth of murine melanoma (B16) and leukemia (L1210) cells in culture. Compounds 8j, 8l and 9i were further tested against MDA-MB-435 human melanoma cells. The cyclopropane-containing compound 9i was the most potent; with an IC(50) value of 2.4 mu M. Even though no appreciable effects on interphase microtubules were observed when A-10 cells were treated with 30 mu M 8j or 8l, compound 9i caused extensive microtubule depolymerization at this concentration. These results suggest that compound 9i of Type B has a similar mechanism of action as CA-4 whilst compounds 8j and 8l of Type B are likely to have a different mechanism of action.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1570-1808			WOS:000271393000009

A meso-scale unit-cell based material model for the single-ply flexible-fabric armor								MATERIALS & DESIGN				30	9			3690	3704		10.1016/j.matdes.2009.02.008			OCT 2009	2009	A meso-scale unit-cell based material model for a prototypical plain-woven single-ply flexible armor is developed and implemented in a material user subroutine for use in commercial explicit finite element programs. The main intent of the model is to attain computational efficiency when calculating the mechanical response of the multi-ply fabric-based flexible armor material during its impact with various projectiles without significantly sacrificing the key physical aspects of the fabric microstructure, architecture and behavior. To validate the new model, a comparative finite element method (FEM) analysis is carried out in which: (a) the plain-woven single-ply fabric is modeled using conventional shell elements and weaving is done in an explicit manner by snaking the yarns through the fabric and (b) the fabric is treated as a planar continuum surface composed of conventional shell elements to which the new meso-scale unit-cell based material model is assigned. The results obtained show that the material model provides a reasonably good description for the fabric deformation and fracture behavior under different combinations of fixed and free boundary conditions.

Optimal control of non-isothermal viscous fluid flow								MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING				50	7-8			1142	1153		10.1016/j.mcm.2009.06.006			OCT 2009	2009	For flow inside a four-to-one contraction domain, we minimize the vortex that occurs in the corner region by controlling the heat flux along the corner boundary. The problem of matching a desired temperature along the outflow boundary is also considered. The energy equation is coupled with the mass, momentum, and constitutive equations through the assumption that viscosity depends on temperature. The latter three equations are a non-isothermal version of the three-field Stokes-Oldroyd model, formulated to have the same dependent variable set as the equations governing viscoelastic flow. The state and adjoint equations are solved using the finite element method. Previous efforts in optimal control of fluid flows assume a temperature-dependent Newtonian viscosity when describing the model equations, but make the simplifying assumption of a constant Newtonian viscosity when carrying out computations. This assumption is not made in the current work. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0895-7177			WOS:000269475200019		
J	Kim, Jinkyung; Shepherd, Marion W., Jr.; Jiang, Xiuping								Evaluating the Effect of Environmental Factors on Pathogen Regrowth in Compost Extract								MICROBIAL ECOLOGY				58	3			498	508		10.1007/s00248-009-9524-x			OCT 2009	2009	Pathogenic microorganisms may survive the composting process in low numbers and subsequently regrow to high levels under favorable conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate the regrowth potential of Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Listeria monocytogenes in dairy-based composts under different environmental conditions. Water extract of commercially available dairy compost was used as a model system. Cocktails of five rifampin-resistant strains of each pathogen previously grown in reduced nutrient media (1/2 or 1/10 strength of tryptic soy broth, TSB) were inoculated into water extract of compost of different ratios (1:2,1:5, and 1:10, w/v), and then stored at 35A degrees C or 22A degrees C for 7 days. The strains exhibiting greatest survival or regrowth were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). At 22A degrees C, both E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes multiplied in all compost extracts, whereas Salmonella spp. regrew in both 1:2 and 1:5 compost extracts but not in 1:10. For all three pathogens, incubation at 22A degrees C provides better conditions for regrowth than at 35A degrees C. Both Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 previously adapted to nutrient-limited broth (1/10 strength of TSB) regrew in compost extracts to higher populations than the control cultures grown previously in full strength of TSB. In the absence of indigenous microorganisms, all three pathogens regrew even in the most diluted sterile compost extract (1:10) with growth potentials ranging from 2.30 to 3.59 log CFU/ml. In nonsterile compost extract with ca. 5 log CFU/ml of background microorganisms, all three pathogens regrew only in the most concentrated compost extract (1:2) with much less population increases ranging from 0.70 to 1.43 log CFU/ml. Compost extract samples of all ages supported the regrowth of both Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 with population increases ranging from 0.95 to 2.32 log CFU/ml. The PFGE patterns for E. coli O157:H7 isolates from sterile compost extracts matched with either the spinach outbreak strain or an avirulent B6914 strain. These results demonstrated that compost extract of dairy-based compost contained sufficient nutrients for pathogen regrowth. Cultures previously adapted to low nutrient media regrew to higher populations than control cultures; however, indigenous microflora suppressed the pathogen regrowth in compost extract, especially at 35A degrees C.									14	0	0	12	1	14			0095-3628			WOS:000269928300006	19468701	
J	Chahar, Kiran; Taaffe, Kevin								Risk averse demand selection with all-or-nothing orders								OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				37	5			996	1006		10.1016/j.omega.2008.11.004			OCT 2009	2009	Consider a firm that operates in consecutive single selling seasons, delivering its products across several markets with unique revenue and uncertain demands in each market. Using a profit maximization approach based on a newsvendor-type model, the firm may still incur several losses across consecutive periods in the short run. Risk analysis with demand selection has been modeled where customer/market demands follow a normal distribution. Often a firm faces a set of potential unconfirmed orders, where each order will either come in at a predefined level or it will not come in at all. In this paper, we consider these all-or-nothing (AON) demands and provide insights into their effect on expected profit and the frequency of extremely costly procurement policies. Instead of solely identifying the market/demand set and procurement quantity that maximizes expected profit, we use a conditional value-at-risk approach that allows a decision maker to control the number of profitable but risky demands to consider in the overall procurement policy. This approach is compared against an expected profit objective, and several managerial insights are provided. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitivity to azoxystrobin in Didymella bryoniae isolates collected before and after field use of strobilurin fungicides								PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				65	10			1090	1096		10.1002/ps.1797			OCT 2009	2009	BACKGROUND: Isolates of Didymella bryoniae (Auersw.) Rehm, causal agent of gummy stem blight on cucurbits, developed insensitivity to azoxystrobin in the eastern United States 2 years after first commercial use in 1998. Baseline sensitivity of this fungus to azoxystrobin has never been reported. The objectives were to compare baseline sensitivities of D. bryoniae from South Carolina and other locations to sensitivities of isolates exposed to azoxystrobin for one or more seasons, and to compare sensitivity in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates of D. bryoniae collected before 1998 were sensitive. Median EC(50) was 0.055 mg L(-1) azoxystrobin (range 0.005 to 0.81). Forty isolates collected after exposure during 1998 also were sensitive. Fifty-three of 64 isolates collected in South and North Carolina between 2000 and 2006 were insensitive to 10 mg L(-1) azoxystrobin. Sensitive and insensitive isolates were distinguished by disease severity on Cucumis melo L. seedlings treated with azoxystrobin (20 or 200 mg L(-1)).CONCLUSIONS: An azoxystrobin baseline sensitivity distribution was established in vitro for isolates of D. bryoniae never exposed to strobilurins. Baseline values were comparable with those of other ascomycetes. Insensitive isolates were found in fields with a history of strobilurin applications.

Excitations within the thin film of a metal-oxide-semiconductor device are measured revealing that ions whose velocities fall below the classical threshold given by the free-electron model of a metal still excite hot carriers. Excellent agreement between these results and a nonadiabatic model that accounts for the time-varying ion-surface interaction indicates that the measured excitations are due to semilocalized electrons near the metal surface.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1098-0121			WOS:000271352100029		
J	Amiri, Achour; Holb, Imre J.; Schnabel, Guido								A New Selective Medium for the Recovery and Enumeration of Monilinia fructicola, M-fructigena, and M-laxa from Stone Fruits								PHYTOPATHOLOGY				99	10			1199	1208		10.1094/PHYTO-99-10-1199			OCT 2009	2009	Isolation of Monilinia spp. from stone and pome fruit surfaces is difficult due to the presence of several fast-growing fungal species such as Rhizopus, Alternaria, and Penicillium spp. Therefore, a new selective medium (acidified potato dextrose agar [pH 3.6] amended with fosetyl-aluminum [fosetyl-AL] at 500 mu g/ml) (APDA-F500) was developed for the recovery of Monilinia propagules. The antifungal agents fosetyl-Al, dichloran, ammonium molybdate, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-dD-glucose) were tested in potato dextrose agar (PDA) for their selective activity against Monilinia fructicola and seven common fungal contaminants of peach, including Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Colletotrichum acutatum, Gilbertella persicaria, Penicillium expansum, Phomopsis amygdali, and Rhizopus stolonifer. Dichloran, ammonium molybdate, and 2-dD-glucose inhibited spore germination and mycelial growth of all test fungi, including M. fructicola, at comparable levels. Fosetyl-Al added to PDA (PDA-F) at 500 or 1,000 mu g/ml did not inhibit germination of any of the fungi but had a strong effect on mycelial growth of six of eight test fungi at 1,000 mu g/ml, with the exceptions being R. stolonifer and M. fructicola. Germination and mycelial growth of M. fructicola were least affected on APDA-F500 compared with the other test fungi. On APDA-F500 at pH 3.2 and 3.6, germination of M. fructicola was not inhibited but mycelial growth was reduced by 54.2 and 24.2%, respectively. In all, 17 M. fructicola, 6 M. fructigena, and 6 M. laxa isolates collected from different geographic locations and diverse hosts were evaluated for their germination and mycelial growth on APDA-F500 (at pH 3.6). Germination was not inhibited for any isolate and relative mycelial growth was 45.8 to 83.3%. Field-grown peach fruit from South Carolina and Hungary and plum fruit from Hungary were used to test the selectivity of APDA-F500 for the recovery of three Monilinia spp. compared with PDA-F500 and Monilinia selective medium (MSM) previously developed for Monilinia spp. detection. Percent recovery of M. fructicola from South Carolinian peach fruit was highest on APDA-F500 (0, 17, and 69% in June, July, and August, respectively) compared with PDA-F500 (0, 3.5, and 50%, respectively) and MSM (0, 0, and 6.8%, respectively). Moreover, APDA-F500 selectively recovered M. fructigena and M. laxa propagules from the surfaces of Hungarian peach and plum fruit. Our results indicate that APDA-F500 is a useful medium for selective isolation and enumeration of the three most common Monilinia spp. attacking stone fruits worldwide.									5	0	0	4	1	5			0031-949X			WOS:000269688400012	19740034

The mirid's host-plant relationships have remained unknown. From 2002 to 2008, 1 collected 359 adults and 78 nymphs (instars II-V) on Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides Michx.; Ericaceae), a dioecious evergreen shrub endemic to the southeastern United States. Nymphs and all but four adults were on male plants with flower buds or flowers in October, November, or December; the mirid was not found during sampling in January, February, March, April, June, or August. Keltonia balli was found only in the Lake Wales Ridge and other sand scrubs of peninsular Florida from Clay County south to Highlands County. The plant bug is a rosemary specialist whose nymphs develop on reproductive structures of male plants. Aspects of this herbivore-plant system needing elucidation, such as the number of generations of K. balli and factors that might synchronize its seasonality with a transient resource, are discussed.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0013-8797			WOS:000271453600009

Modelling, simulation, and experimental verification of the kinematics and dynamics of a double wishbone suspension configuration								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING				223	D10			1239	1262		10.1243/09544070JAUTO1153			OCT 2009	2009	This paper describes the non-linear modelling of a double wishbone suspension developed to investigate the non-linear kinematics and dynamics in the closed, spatial kinematic chain configuration. Analytical and ADAMS models are generated and kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the models are investigated. The analytical model of the suspension mechanism is an idealized four degree-of-freedom (DOF) model, with suspension members considered as rigid links and bushings taken as linear spring-damper elements. The simulation results of the model subjected to a virtual kinematics and compliance (K&C) test are compared with results generated by an ADAMS model, developed based on parameters obtained from the vehicle manufacturer, subjected to the same virtual test. The experimental K&C testing on the test vehicle presents a method of capturing the kinematic characteristics of the suspension mechanism. The comparison of the simulation and experimental results presented shows that the models are capable of simulating the characteristics of the pre-existing suspension configuration of the test vehicle.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0954-4070			WOS:000271201100002

Service Utilization Patterns of Maltreated and Nonmaltreated Children From Low-Income, African-American Families								PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES				60	10			1386	1389					OCT 2009	2009	Objectives: This study examined health care utilization patterns by maltreatment status among youths from low-income households across multiple service domains. Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 153 African-American maltreated and non-maltreated children (ages eight to 12). The youths were children of women recruited at a large inner-city public hospital for a study examining intimate partner violence and child maltreatment. Use of psychiatric, medical, child care, social support, and crisis health care services was assessed. Results: Psychiatric and child care service utilization was significantly different between maltreated and nonmaltreated children across three categories of child maltreatment (emotional, physical, and sexual abuse). Maltreated youths were six to 13 times more likely than their nonmaltreated counterparts to use psychiatric and child care services. Medical service utilization was higher for emotionally abused youths. Conclusions: Results of this study may serve to facilitate improved screening, identify points of access for intervention, and enhance treatment for maltreated youths.

Adaptive control of redundant robot manipulators with sub-task objectives								ROBOTICA				27				873	881		10.1017/S0263574708005274			OCT 2009	2009	In this paper, adaptive control of kinematically redundant robot manipulators is considered. An end-effector tracking controller is designed and the manipulator's kinematic redundancy is utilized to integrate a general sub-task controller for self-motion control. The control objectives are achieved by designing a feedback linearizing controller that includes a least-squares estimation algorithm to compensate for the parametric uncertainties. Numerical simulation results are presented to show the validity of the proposed controller.									16	1	0	0	0	16			0263-5747			WOS:000270692200007

We think it is worth reviewing this topic owing to the crucial role of massive stars in astrophysics, especially in the evolution of galaxies and the universe. We have performed several test computations with the aim to analyze and discuss many physical uncertainties still encountered in massive-star evolution. In particular, we explore the effects of mass loss, convection, rotation, (12)C(alpha,gamma)(16)O reaction and initial metallicity. We also compare and analyze the similarities and differences among various works and ours. Finally, we present useful comments on the nucleosynthesis from massive stars concerning the s-process and the yields for (26)Al and (60)Fe.									13	1	0	0	0	13			0038-6308			WOS:000271737800001

Polyphenol-Stabilized Tubular Elastin Scaffolds for Tissue Engineered Vascular Grafts								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A				15	10			2837	2851		10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0394			OCT 2009	2009	Tissue-engineered vascular grafts require elastic, acellular porous scaffolds with controlled biodegradability and properties matching those of natural arteries. Elastin would be a desirable component for such applications, but elastin does not easily regenerate experimentally. Our approach is to develop tubular elastin scaffolds using decellularization and removal of collagen from porcine carotid arteries (similar to 5mm diameter) using alkaline extraction. Because elastin is susceptible to rapid degeneration after implantation, scaffolds were further treated with penta-galloyl glucose (PGG), an established polyphenolic elastin-stabilizing agent. Scaffolds were compared in vitro with detergent-decellularized arteries for structure, composition, resistance to degradation, mechanical properties, and cytotoxicity and in vivo for cell infiltration and remodeling potential. Results showed effective decellularization and almost complete collagen removal by alkaline extraction. PGG-treated elastin scaffolds proved to be resistant to elastase digestion in vitro, maintained their cylindrical shapes, showed high resistance to burst pressures, and supported growth of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In vivo results showed that PGG treatment reduced the rate of elastin biodegradation and controlled cell infiltration but did not hamper new collagen and proteoglycan deposition and secretion of matrix-degrading proteases. Alkali-purified, PGG-treated tubular arterial elastin scaffolds exhibit many desirable properties to be recommended for clinical applications as vascular grafts.									27	1	0	18	0	28			1937-3341			WOS:000270553200008	19254115

Dead, wild birds and mammals, as well as captive animals examined during routine veterinary checks constituted the study populations. Ectoparasites were tested for species of Anaplasma, Bartonella, Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, and Trypanosoma. Forty-six species of ectoparasites were collected from 133 free-roaming and captive hosts and their associated nesting and bedding materials. Six vector-borne pathogens were detected molecularly in the ectoparasites, including Anaplasma phagocytophilum in the tick Ixodes dentatus Marx from an eastern cottontail rabbit, Bartonella clarridgeiae in the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche) from a Virginia opossum, Bartonella sp. Oh6 in the squirrel flea Orchopeas howardi (Baker) from an eastern grey squirrel, Bartonella sp. T7498 in the sucking louse Neohaematopinus sciuri Jancke from a squirrel, Rickettsia sp. Rf2125 in C. felis from a zookeeper and a grizzly bear, and Rickettsiales sp. Ib 2006 in Ixodes brunneus Koch from an American crow. While the pathology of some of these pathogens is poorly known, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis) and Bartonella clarridgeiae (causative agent of a disease similar to cat-scratch disease) can infect humans. Ectoparasites and their pathogens, especially those originating from free-roaming animals, present a potential threat to captive animals and humans.									13	0	0	10	0	13			1530-3667	1557-7759		WOS:000270864200004	18973443

Analysis of FGD water samples indicated that aqueous concentrations of Hg, As, and Se remained constant or changed very slightly in a pilot-scale equalization basin during a 24-h hydraulic retention time (HRT). No change in toxicity of FGD water occurred after one HRT. FGD particles were predominantly silt size, and approximately 99% of particles suspended in FGD water settled to the bottom of a 2.5-m-deep equalization basin during the first 4 h of the 24-h HRT. Approximately 90% of the total As, and smaller percentages of Hg and Se, in FGD water and particles were removed by particle settling in the equalization basin. Results of this investigation lend support to the use of equalization basins for treating FGD waters in constructed wetland treatment systems.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0049-6979			WOS:000269919900011		
J	Mo, Xunhua; Gao, Jia; Goodwin, James G., Jr.				Gao, Jia/I-4422-2013				Role of promoters on Rh/SiO2 in CO hydrogenation: A comparison using DRIFTS								CATALYSIS TODAY				147	2			139	149		10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.016			SEP 30 2009	2009	La, V, Zn, Cu, Fe, Li and Ag promoted Rh/SiO2 Catalysts were investigated for the synthesis of ethanol during CO hydrogenation at 230 degrees C and 1.8 atm. As is well known, the activity and selectivity depend heavily on the choice of promoter. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was used to probe the effects of La, V, Zn and Cu on CO adsorption and hydrogenation. From the IR study. it was found that the behavior of CO adsorbed on the differently promoted catalysts was very different. While La enhanced total CO adsorption, the addition of V, Zn and Cu suppressed CO adsorption to different extents. The doubly promoted Rh-La/V/SiO2 showed only moderate CO adsorption. Results from DRIFTS suggest that the higher catalytic activity (compared to the non-promoted catalyst) observed for the La singly promoted Rh/SiO2 catalyst may primarily be caused by an increase in the concentration of the adsorbed CO species in the presence of H-2, possibly due to the formation of new active sites at the LaOx-Rh interface. The higher catalytic activity of the V singly promoted Rh/SiO2 catalyst could be ascribed to an increased desorption rate/reactivity of the adsorbed CO species. The La and V doubly promoted catalyst showed both new adsorbed CO species and increased desorption rate/reactivity of the adsorbed species during CO hydrogenation due to a synergistic promoting effect of La and V. The addition of Zn or Cu promoters significantly reduced the desorption rate/reactivity of the adsorbed CO species on Rh/SiO2, leading apparently to the much reduced activities for CO hydrogenation observed.

A new vertical cell assembly method is described that yields CCFs with thicknesses up to 100 pm. The cell consists of two microscope cover glasses separated by a thin polymeric spacer. The lower edge of the cell is placed in a colloidal dispersion. Particles are transported to the top of the cell by capillary force and self-assemble into a CCF as the solvent evaporates. This novel vertical cell assembly method is well suited for fabrication of large area CCFs with controllable thickness that could be further processed into ICC filters for size-based separations of molecules and particles.

The ability to quantitatively and non-invasively image nanoparticles has important implications for the development of nanoparticles as in vivo cancer diagnostic and therapeutic agents. In this study, the ability of systemically administered poly(ethylene glycol)-coated (PEGylated) gold nanoparticles as a contrast agent for in vivo tumor imaging with PAT has been evaluated. We demonstrate that gold nanoparticles (20 and 50 nm) have high photoacoustic contrast as compared to mouse tissue ex vivo. Gold nanoparticles can be visualized in mice in vivo following subcutaneous administration using PAT. Following intravenous administration of PEGylated gold nanoparticles to tumor-bearing mice, accumulation of gold nanoparticles in tumors can be effectively imaged with PAT. With gold nanoparticles as a contrast agent, PAT has important potential applications in the image guided therapy of superficial tumors such as breast cancer, melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma.									91	2	0	31	0	93			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000269553500002	19726840

Optimizing Influenza Vaccine Distribution								SCIENCE				325	5948			1705	1708		10.1126/science.1175570			SEP 25 2009	2009	The criteria to assess public health policies are fundamental to policy optimization. Using a model parametrized with survey-based contact data and mortality data from influenza pandemics, we determined optimal vaccine allocation for five outcome measures: deaths, infections, years of life lost, contingent valuation, and economic costs. We find that optimal vaccination is achieved by prioritization of schoolchildren and adults aged 30 to 39 years. Schoolchildren are most responsible for transmission, and their parents serve as bridges to the rest of the population. Our results indicate that consideration of age-specific transmission dynamics is paramount to the optimal allocation of influenza vaccines. We also found that previous and new recommendations from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both for the novel swine-origin influenza and, particularly, for seasonal influenza, are suboptimal for all outcome measures.									147	0	0	92	0	147			0036-8075			WOS:000270131800050	19696313

The uniqueness of polyphenylene ionomers lies in their rigid backbone which prevents folding and therefore affects the partition into hydrophilic ionic domains and hydrophobic regions. This segregation dominates the structure of flexible ionic polymers. Small-angle neutron scattering studies of these ionomers have demonstrated that bundles of polymer molecules are formed in dilute organic solutions. This clustered building block persists in bulk dry and hydrated states of the ionomers. Hydration of these ionomers membranes results in segregation to hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, where diffusion into interstitial spaces between the bundles of sulfonated and unsulfonated domains takes place followed by rearrangements of domains to yield locally bicontinuous regions. Only at very high sulfonation levels are fully bicontinues phases formed. With controlling the degree of continuity, the stiffness of the backbone offers a means to tune the transport in ionic polymers.									9	0	0	1	0	9			0024-9297			WOS:000269699400033		
J	Awwal, Abdul A. S.; Rice, Kenneth L.; Taha, Tarek M.								Hardware accelerated optical alignment of lasers using beam-specific matched filters								APPLIED OPTICS				48	27			5190	5196		10.1364/AO.48.005190			SEP 20 2009	2009	Accurate automated alignment of laser beams in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) is essential for achieving extreme temperature and pressure required for inertial confinement fusion. The alignment achieved by the integrated control systems relies on algorithms processing video images to determine the position of the laser beam images in real time. Alignment images that exhibit wide variations in beam quality require a matched-filter algorithm for position detection. One challenge in designing a matched-filter-based algorithm is to construct a filter template that is resilient to variations in imaging conditions while guaranteeing accurate position determination. A second challenge is to process images for thousands of templates in under a second, as may be required in future high-energy laser systems. This paper describes the development of a new analytical template that captures key recurring features present in the beam image to accurately estimate the beam position under good image quality conditions. Depending on the features present in a particular beam, the analytical template allows us to create a highly tailored template containing only those selected features. The second objective is achieved by exploiting the parallelism inherent in the algorithm to accelerate processing using parallel hardware that provides significant performance improvement over conventional processors. In particular, a Xilinx Virtex II Pro field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware implementation processing 32 templates provided a speed increase of about 253 times over an optimized software implementation running on a 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron core.

Thermoelectric properties and electronic structure calculations of low thermal conductivity Zintl phase series M16X11 (M = Ca and Yb; X = Sb and Bi)								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				484	1-2			80	85		10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.04.131			SEP 18 2009	2009	Zintl phases of type M16X11 (M = Ca and Yb; X = Sb and Bi) have been synthesized by both the flux or solid state reaction methods. In order to evaluate the potential of these phases for thermoelectrics, the electrical resistivity (rho), thermopower (alpha) and thermal conductivity (kappa) have been measured on hot pressed samples over a wide temperature range of 10-1000 K. The rho and alpha trends are typical of a degenerate semiconductor. However, alpha remains low (similar to 30 mu V/K or less). Hall measurements indicate a rather low charge carrier mobility similar to 3-7cm(2)/Vs, except for Ca16Sb11. It is notable that low thermal conductivity values ranging from similar to 2.5 to 0.8 W/m K are measured for these phases at higher temperatures up to 1273 K. Particularly for Yb16Sb11, the lattice part of thermal conductivity is found to be between 0.5 and 0.7 W/m K. However, the challenge in this M16X11 system is to achieve high thermopower. In order to understand more fully the measured transport properties, band structure calculations have been performed. Consistent with experimental data, these calculations suggest that all the systems are indeed metallic.

Plants were grown under two levels of total gas pressure (reduced or ambient (25 or 101 kPa, respectively)) at three levels of O(2) partial pressures (low, medium or ambient (6, 12 or 21 kPa, respectively)). Hypoxia effects on nutritional and functional phytochemicals were more pronounced than hypobaria effects. Regardless of the total pressure, hypoxia, in general, enhanced leaf anthocyanin levels, enhanced total phenolic compounds, enhanced carbohydrate concentration and enhanced free radical scavenging capacity of lettuce but reduced leaf mineral concentration. Hypoxia increased the ethylene production of plants but ethylene accumulation was not the sole reason for enhanced anthocyanin production in plants grown under hypoxia. Our results suggest that low oxygen stress induces the production of protective phytochemicals and the free radical scavenging potential in lettuce, which may in turn enhance the functional value. However, further human intervention studies are needed to confirm if enhanced phytochemicals in plants have significant impact in human body.

Use of hummocks and hollows by trees in tidal freshwater forested wetlands along the Savannah River								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				258	7			1613	1618		10.1016/j.foreco.2009.07.018			SEP 15 2009	2009	Tidal freshwater forested wetlands occupy a relatively narrow range, occurring where wind and lunar tides interact with coastal river systems, causing freshwater flooding onto the floodplain. A prominent component of this wetland type is hummock and hollow microtopography. Tidal freshwater forested wetlands along the Savannah River were differentiated into backswamp and streamside areas, and the degree to which trees occupied hummocks and hollows were compared at three scales: landscape (backswamp vs. streamside), tree community, and species (within community). The community-and species-level analyses were extended to determine whether trees were using either hummocks or hollows in a nonrandom manner. Trees in the backswamp setting were found to use hummocks more than trees in the streamside setting. At the community scale, three of the five treatment groups investigated differed based on the degree to which trees on hummocks outnumber trees in hollows. Further examination of microtopography usage confirmed that hummocks are used significantly more than hollows in two communities, both of which are located in the backswamp setting. Though no tree community used hollows significantly more than hummocks, species-level analyses confirmed that, within a specific tree community in the streamside setting, alder (Alnus serrulata [Ait.] Willd.) is found more in hollows than on hummocks. Fourteen different species between the two communities in the backswamp setting are found on hummocks more than in hollows, and only one species, sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L), is found more on hummocks than in hollows in the tree community in the streamside setting.

J	Cho, Eunhee; Kutty, Jaishankar K.; Datar, Kedar; Lee, Jeoung Soo; Vyavahare, Naren R.; Webb, Ken								A novel synthetic route for the preparation of hydrolytically degradable synthetic hydrogels								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				90A	4			1073	1082		10.1002/jbm.a.32172			SEP 15 2009	2009	A variety of approaches have been described for the modification of synthetic, water soluble polymers with hydrolytically degradable bonds and terminal vinyl groups that can be crosslinked in situ by photo- or redox-initiated free radical polymerization. However, changes in macromer concentration, functionality, and molecular weight commonly used to achieve variable degradation rates simultaneously alter hydrogel mechanical properties. Herein, we describe a novel, two-step synthetic route for the preparation of hydrolytically degradable, crosslinkable PEG-based macromers based on chemical intermediaries that form ester linkages with variable alkyl chain length. Changes in the concentration of a single macromer were shown to provide effective variation of degradation, but with corresponding significant changes in tensile properties. Through variation in the alkyl chain length of the chemical intermediary, variable degradation times ranging from weeks to months are achieved, without significantly affecting initial gelation efficiency, swelling, or tensile properties. When modified with adhesive ligands hydrogels supported viability of encapsulated and adherent cells. Controlled release of a model protein (Immunoglobulin G) was attained as a function of hydrogel degradation rate. Independent control of hydrogel degradation and mechanical properties will offer improved flexibility for studying the effect of these material characteristics on cellular function and may be useful in the design of matrices for tissue engineering and controlled release of bioactive molecules.

Relating the pore size distribution of ultrafiltration membranes to dextran rejection								JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE				340	1-2			1	8		10.1016/j.memsci.2009.04.056			SEP 15 2009	2009	The rejection of various molecular weight dextrans for two commercially available regenerated cellulose and one polyethersulfone membrane has been investigated. Experimentally determined rejection curves were compared to calculated rejection curves based on field-emission scanning electron microscopy imaging assuming that the membrane pore size distribution may be described by the log-normal distribution function. Results show relatively good agreement between calculated and experimental curves; however, the calculated curves generally predict a broader rejection curve. At lower rejection values, the actual rejection is less than calculated. Results also indicate that field-emission scanning electron microscopy, a routinely used imaging technique, may be used to estimate the rejection curve for a membrane, thus enabling more informed selection of an appropriate membrane for a given separation.The results of this work are relevant to ultrafiltration, which is used in the biotechnology industry for protein concentration and buffer exchange. The success of a given UF operation depends on efficient passage or rejection of the desired solute species in solution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This framework deals not only with the effect of liquefaction (in terms of settlement) but also with probabilistic characterization of all possible ground motions at a given site (in terms of a joint distribution of a(max) and M(w)). Additionally, a new concept, referred to herein as liquefaction-induced settlement hazard curve, is introduced for assessing the annual rate of settlement exceedance at a given site. This settlement hazard curve concept has the potential to be a very useful tool in the field of geotechnical earthquake engineering. Satisfactory results are obtained in the demonstration examples analyzed with the proposed framework. Whereas the proposed framework is simple and effective, further refinements to this framework, especially on the treatment of epistemic uncertainty, are warranted. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Four different SWNT materials (produced by arc discharge, HiPco, laser ablation, and CoMoCat methods) contain nanotubes with diameters ranging from 0.7 to 2.8 nm. The diameter distribution and the composition of metallic and semiconducting tubes of the SWNT materials are strongly affected by the synthesis method. Similar sp(2) hybridization of carbon in the oxygenated SWNT structure can be found, but different surface functionalities are introduced while the tubes are processed. All the SWNTs demonstrate stronger plasmon resonance excitations and lower electron binding energy than graphite and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. These SWNT materials also exhibit different valence-band X-ray photoemission features, which are considerably affected by the nanotube diameter distribution and metallic/semiconducting composition.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1439-4235			WOS:000269979600021	19569089

Bifurcation of the positive and negative brush wear rates was observed at a current density of 200 A/cm(2). Energy dispersive spectroscopy showed transfer of copper from the rotor to the lower wear negative brush. Scanning electron microscopy of worn brush surface cross-sections created by focused ion beam milling revealed a fine-grained metallic layer below the graphite transfer layer on the negative brush surface; no such layer was found on the positive brush surface. At 40 A/cm(2), steady-state brush wear rates were very low (<10(-11) m/m). Friction coefficient at steady state was measured to be 0.15 +/- 0.02 and was independent of current direction. Using a scanning white light interferometer, the thickness of the graphite transfer layer on the rotor surface was estimated to be similar to 5 mu m. Ultimately, the goal is to model lubricant buildup and removal as a competitive rates problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.									12	1	0	0	0	12			0043-1648			WOS:000274584500015

The X-ray single-crptal structure analysis shows that Na3GdMn3O3(ASO(4))(3) crystallizes in a hexagonal space group with a = 11.091 (2) angstrom, c = 5.954(1) angstrom, and V= 634.2(2) angstrom(3); P6(3)/m (No. 176); Z= 2. The structure has been refined by full-matrix, least-squares methods to a final solution with R1 = 0.0466, wR2 = 0.1318 and GOF = 1.101. This new three-dimensional framework consists of ferromagnetic one-dimensional [MnO4](infinity) chains, composed of edge-shared MnO6 units propagating along c. The GdO9 polyhedra connect three neighboring [MnO4](infinity) chains via oxygen atoms. Na3LaMn3O3(ASO(4))(3) (1), and Na3SmMn3O3(ASO(4))(3) (2), the isostructural derivatives of Na3GdMn3O3(ASO(4))(3) (3), were synthesized to acquire additional insight into the 3d-4f magnetic couplings. The Na(3)LnMn(3)O(3)(ASO(4))(3) series reveals an increase in chi T at low temperatures upon substitution of smaller Ln(3+) ions ranging from La3+ to Gd3+. The increase in chi T is likely due to the magnetic nature and size of the lanthanide ions present. It was expected that the Mn-O-Mn ferromagnetic interactions would dominate as 3d-4f magnetic interactions are generally weak. The magnetic data shows that the paramagnetic Ln(3+) ions in 2 (Sm) and 3 (Gd) do significantly enhance the bulk ferromagnetism compared to that of 1 (La), suggesting sizable contributions from the 4f magnetic ions.									13	2	0	0	0	13			0020-1669			WOS:000269313500052	19639985

Microstructure of Carbon Nanofiber/Thermotropic Liquid Crystalline Polymer Composites								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				113	5			2872	2880		10.1002/app.30268			SEP 5 2009	2009	The properties and microstructure of a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer (TLCP, Vectran V400P) were investigated in the presence of carbon nanofibers (CNF). The electrical conductivity of TLCP increased with an addition of CNFs. The thermal analysis of pure TLCP and its composites revealed that a glass transition at similar to 110 degrees C did not change significantly. However, a decrease of tensile modulus and strength was observed with the addition of CNFs. WAXD studies showed a decrease of Herman's orientation parameter, indicating reduction of anisotropy of TLCP. Further, the disruption of molecular orientation of TLCPs was inferred by SEM and TEM analysis. SEM micrographs revealed a fibrillar structure for pure TLCPs at a macro-scale (2-5 mu m). However, this structure was not observed in composites at the same scale even though micro-size fibrils (0.05 mu m) were found with the addition of CNFs. TEM micrographs displayed banded structures of pure TLCPs, but these structures were not significant in the vicinity of CNFs. These observations confirmed that a decrease of molecular alignment and disruption of fibrillar structure of TLCP, in the presence of nanofibers, are attributed to a significant decrease in tensile modulus and strength.

An addition of CNFs into LLDPE led to a decrease of electrical resistivity, and the large amounts of CNFs were required to reach the electrical percolation threshold for the longer mixing time. For the research of these phenomena, we examined the effects of mixing time on the size (length) and spatial distributions of CNFs in the composites. SEM micrographs revealed the size reduction of CNFs in a series of mixing times, although the spatial dispersion of CNFs became more uniform at longer mixing time. To describe the reduction of CNFs theoretically, we hypothesize the size distribution of CNFs obeys a governing population balance kinetics based on an irreversible dissolution process. For the process, we proposed a size dependent breakage rate coefficient proportional to the size of CNFs. The model prediction for the time evolution of size distribution of CNFs has been validated with the experimental measurement showing good agreement. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Reynolds, Robert F.; Bauerle, William L.; Wang, Ying								Simulating carbon dioxide exchange rates of deciduous tree species: evidence for a general pattern in biochemical changes and water stress response								ANNALS OF BOTANY				104	4			775	784		10.1093/aob/mcp156			SEP 2009	2009	Deciduous trees have a seasonal carbon dioxide exchange pattern that is attributed to changes in leaf biochemical properties. However, it is not known if the pattern in leaf biochemical properties - maximum Rubisco carboxylation (V(cmax)) and electron transport (J(max)) - differ between species. This study explored whether a general pattern of changes in V(cmax), J(max), and a standardized soil moisture response accounted for carbon dioxide exchange of deciduous trees throughout the growing season.The model MAESTRA was used to examine V(cmax) and J(max) of leaves of five deciduous trees, Acer rubrum 'Summer Red', Betula nigra, Quercus nuttallii, Quercus phellos and Paulownia elongata, and their response to soil moisture. MAESTRA was parameterized using data from in situ measurements on organs. Linking the changes in biochemical properties of leaves to the whole tree, MAESTRA integrated the general pattern in V(cmax) and J(max) from gas exchange parameters of leaves with a standardized soil moisture response to describe carbon dioxide exchange throughout the growing season. The model estimates were tested against measurements made on the five species under both irrigated and water-stressed conditions.Measurements and modelling demonstrate that the seasonal pattern of biochemical activity in leaves and soil moisture response can be parameterized with straightforward general relationships. Over the course of the season, differences in carbon exchange between measured and modelled values were within 6-12 % under well-watered conditions and 2-25 % under water stress conditions. Hence, a generalized seasonal pattern in the leaf-level physiological change of V(cmax) and J(max), and a standardized response to soil moisture was sufficient to parameterize carbon dioxide exchange for large-scale evaluations.Simplification in parameterization of the seasonal pattern of leaf biochemical activity and soil moisture response of deciduous forest species is demonstrated. This allows reliable modelling of carbon exchange for deciduous trees, thus circumventing the need for extensive gas exchange experiments on different species.									10	0	0	8	0	10			0305-7364			WOS:000269195900017	19567419

We study the massive stars in OB associations and their surrounding interstellar medium environment, using a population synthesis code.Methods. We developed a new population synthesis code for groups of massive stars, where we model the emission of different forms of energy and matter from the stars of the association. In particular, the ejection of the two radioactive isotopes (26)Al and (60)Fe is followed, as well as the emission of hydrogen ionizing photons, and the kinetic energy of the stellar winds and supernova explosions. We investigate various alternative astrophysical inputs and the resulting output sensitivities, especially effects due to the inclusion of rotation in stellar models. As the aim of the code is the application to relatively small populations of massive stars, special care is taken to address their statistical properties. Our code incorporates both analytical statistical methods applicable to small populations, as well as extensive Monte Carlo simulations.Results. We find that the inclusion of rotation in the stellar models has a large impact on the interactions between OB associations and their surrounding interstellar medium. The emission of (26)Al in the stellar winds is strongly enhanced, compared to non-rotating models with the same mass-loss prescription. This compensates the recent reductions in the estimates of mass-loss rates of massive stars due to the effects of clumping. Despite the lower mass-loss rates, the power of the winds is actually enhanced for rotating stellar models. The supernova power (kinetic energy of their ejecta) is decreased due to longer lifetimes of rotating stars, and therefore the wind power dominates over supernova power for the first 6 Myr after a burst of star-formation. For populations typical of nearby star-forming regions, the statistical uncertainties are large and clearly non-Gaussian.									29	0	0	0	0	29			0004-6361			WOS:000269986100020

HD 100546 has been the subject of intense scrutiny because it is a young nearby star with a transitional disk. We observe the Delta(v) = 1 rovibrational CO transitions in order to clarify the distribution of warm gas in the inner disk. Modeling of the CO spectrum indicates that the gas is vibrationally excited by collisions and UV fluorescence. The observed emission extends from 13 to 100 AU. The inner edge of the molecular gas emission is consistent with the inner edge of the optically thick dust disk indicating that the inner hole is not simply a hole in the dust opacity but is likely cleared of gas as well. The rotational temperature of the CO is similar to 1000 K-much hotter than the similar to 200 K CO in the otherwise similar transitional disk surrounding HD 141569. The origin of this discrepancy is likely linked to the brighter polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission observed toward HD 100546. We use the excitation of the CO to constrain the geometry of the inner disk and comment on the evolutionary state of the system.									58	1	0	1	0	58			0004-637X			WOS:000269244500008

With the use of modified inkjet printers, contractile cardiac hybrids that exhibit the forms of the 3D rectangular sheet and even the 'half heart' (with two connected ventricles) have been fabricated by arranging alternate layers of biocompatible alginate hydrogels and mammalian cardiac cells according to pre-designed 3D patterns. In this study, primary feline adult and H1 cardiomyocytes were used as model cardiac cells. Alginate hydrogels with controlled micro-shell structures were built by spraying cross-linkers in micro-drops onto un-gelled alginic acid. The cells remained viable in constructs as thick as 1 cm due to the programmed porosity. Microscopic and macroscopic contractile functions of these cardiomyocyte constructs were observed in vitro. These results suggest that the inkjet bio-prototyping method could be used for hierarchical design of functional cardiac pseudo tissues, balanced with porosity for mass transport and structural support.									21	0	0	17	0	21			1758-5082			WOS:000278118200002	20811105

Hydrogels were synthesized from tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate (TEGDA), hydroxyethymethacrylate (HEMA), polyethyleneglycol monomethacrylate (PEGMA), N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-acrylamide (HMMA), and 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (SPMA) to produce p(HEMA-co-PEGMA-co-HMMA-co-SPMA) hydrogels. The conductive polymer was synthesized from pyrrole and 4-(3'-pyrrolyl)butyric acid by electropolymerization within the electrode-supported hydrogel. ECH films produced with different electropolymerization charge densities were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, electrical impedance spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Polymer morphology was studied by SEM. The ECH demonstrated the desired characteristics of high electrical conductivity (low impedance), as well as high thermal stability compared to pure hydrogel. Signal enhancement was achieved by modifying the surface of an MDEA biotransducer with the ECH, with a 10-fold increase in the voltammetric current response associated with the ferrocene monocarboxylic acid (FeCO(2)H) redox reaction.									30	0	0	8	0	30			1525-7797			WOS:000269671200019	19705837

Electrophysiological characterization of embryonic hippocampal neurons cultured in a 3D collagen hydrogel								BIOMATERIALS				30	26			4377	4383		10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.04.047			SEP 2009	2009	Rat embryonic hippocampal neurons were cultured in (1) 3D collagen hydrogels as 'entrapped' evenly distributed cells, (2) at the interface of two collagen layers (sandwich model), and (3) on the surface of collagen coated coverslips (2D model). In the 'entrapment' model the neuronal processes grew out of the plane of the cell body and extended into the collagen matrix, in contrast to the sandwich model where the cells and their processes rarely left the plane in which they were seeded. Hippocampal neurons 'entrapped' in the 3D collagen gel grew the same number, but shorter, processes and exhibited improved survival compared to neurons cultured in the 2D model. There was no difference in the electrophysiological properties of the neurons cultured in the 3D compared to the 2D model except in the resting membrane potential and in the duration of the after-hyperpolarization. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents were recorded in 14- and 21-day-old 3D cultures evidencing functional synapse formation. Our results indicate that the physiological characteristics of 3D neuronal cultures are similar to traditional 2D cultures. However, functional 3D networks of hippocampal neurons will be necessary for multi-level circuit formation, which could be essential for understanding the basis of physiological learning and memory.

Antioxidant Activity of Sulfur and Selenium: A Review of Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging, Glutathione Peroxidase, and Metal-Binding Antioxidant Mechanisms								CELL BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS				55	1			1	23		10.1007/s12013-009-9054-7			SEP 2009	2009	It is well known that oxidation caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a major cause of cellular damage and death and has been implicated in cancer, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. Small-molecule antioxidants containing sulfur and selenium can ameliorate oxidative damage, and cells employ multiple antioxidant mechanisms to prevent this cellular damage. However, current research has focused mainly on clinical, epidemiological, and in vivo studies with little emphasis on the antioxidant mechanisms responsible for observed sulfur and selenium antioxidant activities. In addition, the antioxidant properties of sulfur compounds are commonly compared to selenium antioxidant properties; however, sulfur and selenium antioxidant activities can be quite distinct, with each utilizing different antioxidant mechanisms to prevent oxidative cellular damage. In the present review, we discuss the antioxidant activities of sulfur and selenium compounds, focusing on several antioxidant mechanisms, including ROS scavenging, glutathione peroxidase, and metal-binding antioxidant mechanisms. Findings of several recent clinical, epidemiological, and in vivo studies highlight the need for future studies that specifically focus on the chemical mechanisms of sulfur and selenium antioxidant behavior.									134	7	0	83	1	141			1085-9195			WOS:000268003000001	19548119

The material model is formulated in such a way that it can be readily implemented into commercial finite-element programs like ANSYS/Autodyn [ANSYS/Autodyn version 11.0, User Documentation, Century Dynamics Inc. a subsidiary of ANSYS Inc. (2007)] and ABAQUS/Explicit [ABAQUS version 6.7, User Documentation, Dessault Systems, 20071 as a User Material Subroutine. Model validation included a series of transient non-linear dynamics simulations of the transverse impact of armor-grade composite laminates with two types of projectiles, which are next compared with their experimental counterparts. This comparison revealed that a reasonably good agreement is obtained between the experimental and the computational analyses with respect to: (a) the composite laminates' capability, at different area] densities, to defeat the bullets with different impact velocities; (b) post-mortem spatial distribution of damage within the laminates; (c) the temporal evolution of composite armor laminate back-face bulging and delamination; and (d) the existence of three distinct penetration stages (i.e. an initial filament shearing/cutting dominated stage, an intermediate stage characterized by pronounced filament/matrix de-bonding/decohesion and the final stage associated with the extensive back-face delamination and bulging of the armor panel).

Pathogen Inactivation In Cow Manure Compost								COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION				17	4			229	236					FAL 2009	2009	During aerobic composting of animal manure, microbial activity within the mixture generates heat and metabolic by-products that inactivate zoonotic pathogens. Although it is recognized that the type and level of microbial activity will vary with the nutrient availability of different compost ingredients, the degree to which these changes could impact pathogen inactivation is of interest. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study was to determine inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes in compost laboratory-scale bioreactor systems formulated to different initial carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios with cow manure, straw, and cottonseed meal. The ON ratio did not significantly affect the time to inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes. In contrast, Escherichia coli O157:H7 survived for significantly (P < 0.05) longer periods of time in 40:1 ON systems than in 30:1 or 20:1 systems even though the cumulative heat exposures were statistically similar in the systems. An increase of pH values to 8 to 9 occurred initially for 40:1 ON systems, whereas the pH of the 20:1 and 30:1 systems initially declined to 5.5 to 6 before increasing to 8 to 9 after 2 days of composting.									8	0	0	7	0	8			1065-657X			WOS:000272055600004

Modeling viscosity behavior of crumb rubber modified binders								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				23	9			3053	3062		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2009.04.005			SEP 2009	2009	Accurately predicting the viscous properties of crumb rubber modified (CRM) binders has proven difficult, especially as these properties tend to vary with changing crumb rubber concentrations and temperatures. This study explores the utilization of the statistical regression and neural network (NN) approaches in predicting the viscosity values of CRM binder at various temperatures (135 degrees C and greater). A total of 53 CRM binder combinations were prepared from two different rubber types (ambient and cryogenic), three different binder sources, four rubber concentrations (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%), and five crumb rubber gradations (ADOT, SCDOT, 0.18 mm, 0.425 mm, and 0.85 mm). The results indicated that the regression model is easy to use and can be used for viscosity prediction, similarly NN-based models also provided accurate for predictions for the viscosity values of CRM binders regardless of rubber type and can easily be implemented in a spreadsheet. In addition, the developed NN model can be used to predict viscosity values of other types of CRM binders efficiently. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of input variables indicated that the changes of viscosity are significant as the changes of asphalt binder grade, test temperature, and rubber content. The results also show that these three independent variables are the most important factors in the developed NN models in comparison with other variables. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Laboratory evaluation of the effects of short-term oven aging on asphalt binders in asphalt mixtures using HP-GPC								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				23	9			3087	3093		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2009.03.012			SEP 2009	2009	Both the RTFO (rolling-thin film oven) aging of asphalt binders and the STOA (short-term oven aging) of asphalt mixtures are designed to simulate aging during the construction of hot mix asphalt (HMA) pavements. Many studies have been conducted evaluating the aging effects on asphalt binders since their properties can be easily measured using many conventional tests, such as rotational viscometer, DSR (dynamic shear rheometer), and BBR (bending beam rheometer). However. studies on asphalt mixture aging have been limited to mechanical properties such as strength and fatigue characteristics because considerable effort is required to identify the aging of the asphalt binder in a mixture. This study evaluated the effects of short-term oven aging on asphalt mixtures using the GPC (gel-permeation chromatography) procedure. Nine asphalt mixtures, using three different binder sources, were prepared and five short-term aging methods were used to evaluate these mixes. For comparison, the RTFO aging was also conducted for nine asphalt binders. The aging of a binder within asphalt mixtures. including polymer-modified mixtures, could be identified under various short-term aging conditions. Statistical analysis of the GPC test results indicated that two commonly used short-term aging methods in the laboratory, a 154 degrees C oven aging for 2 h and a 135 degrees C oven aging for 4 h, are not significantly different, based on the increase in the large molecular size (LMS) ratios. The RTFO aging method was found to have less effect on binder aging than the short-term oven aging methods of asphalt mixtures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently the size of clusters used as building blocks is shrinking down to a few nanometers. In such cases, the particle nature of matter plays an important role in the manipulator/cluster/substrate interactions. Having a deeper insight to the aforementioned nano-scale interactions is crucial for prediction and understanding of the behavior of nanoclusters during the positioning process. In the present research, 2D molecular dynamics Simulations have been used to investigate Such behaviors. Performing planar simulations can provide a fairly acceptable qualitative tool for our purpose while the computation time is greatly reduced in comparison to 3D Simulations. The system consists of a tip, Cluster and substrate. The focus of the present research is on ultra-fine metallic nanoclusters. To perform this research, Nose-Hoover dynamics and Sutton-Chen interatomic potential will be used to investigate the behavior of the above system which is made from different transition metals. The effects of material type, tip form and manipulation strategy on the Success of the process have been investigated by planar molecular dynamics. Such qualitative simulation studies can evaluate the chance of success of a certain nanopositioning scenario regarding different working conditions before consuming large-scale computation time or high experimental expenses.

The Review concludes that mitigation today is economically superior to adaptation tomorrow. The review was widely criticized for the assumption of a pure rate of time preference of almost zero, on which its conclusions seemed to depend. In this paper we argue first, that this assumption discriminates against current in favour of future generations. Second, we perform a sensitivity analysis to test for the extent to which the conclusions of the Review are indeed based on the assumption of a rate of time preference of almost zero. We demonstrate that the conclusions of the Review are no longer valid as soon as parameter values are used which are standard in economic analysis. Combined, these results raise a bigger question: how wise is it to base crucial policy choices on a model so dependent on a single, deeply subjective, judgement call?									1	0	0	0	0	1			0958-305X			WOS:000207907400006

Three sources were interpreted for specific particle types identified in samples analyzed: FGD wet scrubbing processes, coal combustion by products, and uncombusted material from coal. Gypsum (CaSO(4) center dot 2H(2)O) from the FGD scrubbing process comprises similar to 95% of the particulates. Iron oxide particles and cenospheres in the particulate samples are interpreted as coal combustion products. Particles interpreted as originating from unburned coal contain carbon and metals including Zn and Fe. The most abundant elements in the particulates analyzed are 0, C.

A possible role for the Angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AGTR2) in brain function, affecting learning, memory, and behavior, has been suggested in humans and rodents. Mice lacking the Agtr2 gene (Agtr2(-/y)) showed significant impairment in their spatial memory and exhibited abnormal dendritic spine morphology. To identify Agtr2 influenced genes and pathways, we performed whole genome microarray analysis on RNA isolated from brains of Agtr2(-/y) and control male mice at embryonic day 15 (E15) and postnatal day one (P1). The gene expression profiles of the Agtr2(-/y) brain samples were significantly different when compared to profiles of the age-matched control brains. We identified 62 differently expressed genes (p <= 0.005) at E15 and in P1 brains of the Agtr2(-/y) mice. We verified the differential expression of several of these genes in brain samples using quantitative RT-PCR. Differentially expressed genes encode molecules involved in multiple cellular processes including microtubule functions associated with dendritic spine morphology. This study provides insight into Agtr2 influenced candidate genes and suggests that expression dysregulation of these genes may modulate Agtr2 actions in the brain that influences learning and memory.

J	Huss, Gary R.; Meyer, Bradley S.; Srinivasan, Gopalan; Goswami, Jitendra N.; Sahijpal, Sandeep								Stellar sources of the short-lived radionuclides in the early solar system								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				73	17			4922	4945		10.1016/j.gca.2009.01.039			SEP 1 2009	2009	We discuss the possible stellar sources of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) known to have been present in the early solar system (Al-26, Cl-36, Ca-41, Mn-13, Fe-60, Pd-107, I-129, Hf-182, Pu-244). SLRs produced primarily by irradiation (Be-7, Be-10) are not discussed in this paper. We evaluate the role of the galactic background in explaining the inventory of SLRs in the early solar system. We review the nucleosynthetic processes that produce the different SLRs and place the processes in the context of stellar evolution of stars from I to 120 M-circle dot. The ejection of newly synthesized SLRs from these stars is also discussed. We then examine the extent to which each stellar source can, by itself, explain the relative abundances of the different SLRs in the early solar system, and the probability that each source would have been in the right place at the right time to provide the SLRs. We conclude that intermediate-mass AGB stars and massive stars in the range from similar to 20 to similar to 60 M-circle dot are the most plausible sources. Low-mass AGB stars fail to produce enough Fe-60. Core-collapse Type 11 supernovae from stars with initial masses of <20 M-circle dot produce too much Fe-60 and Mn-53. Sources such as novae, Type la supernovae, and core-collapse supernovae of O-Ne-Mg white dwarfs do not appear to provide the SLRs in the correct proportions. However, intermediate-mass AGB stars cannot provide Mn-53 or the r-process elements, so if an AGB star provided the Ca-41, Cl-36, Al-26, Fe-60, and Pd-107, and if a late stellar source is required for Mn-53 and the r-process elements, then two types of sources would be required. A separate discussion of the production of r-process elements highlights the difficulties in modeling their production. There appear to be two sources of r-process elements, one that produces the heavy r-process elements, including the actinides, and one that produces the elements from N to Ge and the elements similar to 110 < A < similar to 130. These can be assigned to SNII explosions of stars of <= 11 M-circle dot and stars of 12-25 M-circle dot, respectively. More-massive stars, which leave black holes as supernova remnants, apparently do not produce r-process elements. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the meteoritic evidence supporting the model is discussed. Based on the presence of (60)Fe it is argued that a supernova must have been in close proximity to the nascent Solar System. Then, two models of supernova injection, the supernova trigger model and the aerogel model, are described in detail. Both these injection model provide a mechanism for incorporating SLRs into the early solar system. Following this, the mechanisms present in the disk to homogenize the freshly injected radionuclides, and the timescales associated with these mechanisms, are described, It is shown that the SLRs can be homogenized on very short timescales, from a thousand years up to similar to 1 million years. Finally, the SLR ratios expected from a supernova injection are compared to the ratios measured in meteorites. A single supernova can inject enough radionuclides to explain the radionuclide abundances present in the early solar system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The estimation strategy uses standard signals available through the vehicle control area network. The first stage of this approach utilizes an adaptive least-squares estimation strategy to determine the vehicle's mass and an estimate for a constant road grade. Due to the time-varying nature of the road grade, a nonlinear estimator that provides a more-accurate estimate of the road grade is then developed. Simulation and experimental results show, under a set of qualifying conditions, that both mass and road grade can be estimated with good accuracy.									15	5	0	0	0	19			0018-9545	1939-9359		WOS:000269155100009

Tissue proximate, fatty acid, vitamin, and cholesterol content								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				87	9			2961	2970		10.2527/jas.2009-1850			SEP 2009	2009	Angus-cross steers (n = 198; 270 kg of BW; 8 mo) were used in a 3-yr study to assess the effects of winter stocker growth rate and finishing system on LM proximate, fatty acid, cholesterol, vitamin, and mineral composition. During the winter months (December to April), steers were randomly allotted to 3 stocker growth rates: low (0.23 kg/d), medium (0.45 kg/d), or high (0.68 kg/d). At the completion of the stockering phase, steers were allotted randomly within each stocker growth rate to a high concentrate (CONC) or pasture (PAST) finishing system and finished to an equal time endpoint. Winter stocker growth rate did not alter (P > 0.05) proximate, cholesterol, or vitamin content of the LM. All interactions among winter stocker growth rate and finishing system were nonsignificant, indicating that supplementation systems during winter stocker period did not influence beef composition after finishing on PAST or CONC. Finishing steers on CONC decreased (P < 0.001) moisture content of the LM and increased (P < 0.001) lipid content of the LM. Protein, ash, and cholesterol content of the LM did not differ (P > 0.05) between finishing systems. a-Tocopherol and beta-carotene content of the LM were 288 and 54% greater, respectively, for PAST-finished cattle than CONC. B-vitamins, thiamine and riboflavin, were also present in greater (P = 0.001) concentrations for PAST than CONC. Calcium, Mg, and K contents of the LM were greater (P < 0.05) for PAST than CONC. Total fatty acid content of the LM was 49% less for PAST than CONC. Myristoleic, palmitoleic, and oleic acid concentrations were all less (P = 0.001) for PAST than CONC. Trans-10 octadecenoic acid percentage in LM was 97% greater (P = 0.001) for CONC than PAST; conversely, trans-11 vaccenic acid percentage in the LM was 90% greater (P = 0.001) for PAST than CONC. Conjugated linoleic acid, cis-9, trans-11 isomer, percentage was greater (P = 0.001) by 117% for PAST than CONC. Linoleic acid (C18:2) concentration did not differ (P > 0.05) among PAST and CONC. Concentrations of all n-3 fatty acids (linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic) were greater (P = 0.01) for PAST than CONC. Total n-6 PUFA percentages were unchanged (P > 0.05) among finishing systems. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids was 4.84 for CONC and 1.65 for PAST. Beef from CONC finished has a greater total, saturated, and monounsaturated fat content; in contrast, beef from PAST finished has less total, saturated, and monounsaturated fat content with greater contents of n-3 fatty acids and a decreased n-6 to n-3 ratio. Beef from PAST finished also has greater contents of B-vitamins and antioxidants (vitamin E and beta-carotene).									29	1	0	24	2	31			0021-8812			WOS:000269933300026	19502506

To characterize the skeletal effects of M-CSF, we administered soluble M-CSF to mice. It was hypothesized that M-CSF would stimulate bone formation through coupled activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Twenty-four male C57BL/6 J mice (n = 12/group, aged 7 weeks) received subcutaneous injections of human M-CSF [5 mg/(kg day)] or inert vehicle (VEH) for 21 days. M-CSF increased serum bone turnover markers (+57% TRAP-5b and +44% osteocalcin). Microcomputed tomography revealed an anabolic effect on tibial trabecular bone, with higher bone volume fraction (+35%), connectivity density (+79%), and number (+18%), as well as lower trabecular separation (-18%). M-CSF had no significant effect on cortical bone mineral content, geometry, or strength. There was no change in quantitative histomorphometry parameters of femoral cortical bone. These results reveal the complex, site-specific effects of M-CSF. In particular, we have demonstrated an anabolic effect of M-CSF on trabecular bone achieved through coupled activation of osteoblasts. However, in contrast to previous studies, M-CSF was found to have no effect on cortical bone. M-CSF was demonstrated to significantly influence both bone modeling and remodeling in relatively young animals.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0914-8779			WOS:000268951300004	19326045

However, broader use of enzyme drugs in clinical practice is limited due to their poor stability, immunogenicity and potential systemic toxicity. Targeted delivery of therapeutic enzymes can in many cases provide solutions to these problems. Here we review recently developed strategies for targeted delivery of several most important classes of enzyme drugs and discuss their advantages and potential limitations. While a variety of approaches have been proposed and studied in vitro an in animal models, further investigations and clinical trials are needed to make these delivery systems suitable for clinical applications.									6	0	0	3	0	6			1773-2247			WOS:000270965000002

Exploring the importance of within-canopy spatial temperature variation on transpiration predictions								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY				60	13			3665	3676		10.1093/jxb/erp206			SEP 2009	2009	Models seldom consider the effect of leaf-level biochemical acclimation to temperature when scaling forest water use. Therefore, the dependence of transpiration on temperature acclimation was investigated at the within-crown scale in climatically contrasting genotypes of Acer rubrum L., cv. October Glory (OG) and Summer Red (SR). The effects of temperature acclimation on intracanopy gradients in transpiration over a range of realistic forest growth temperatures were also assessed by simulation. Physiological parameters were applied, with or without adjustment for temperature acclimation, to account for transpiration responses to growth temperature. Both types of parameterization were scaled up to stand transpiration (expressed per unit leaf area) with an individual tree model (MAESTRA) to assess how transpiration might be affected by spatial and temporal distributions of foliage properties. The MAESTRA model performed well, but its reproducibility was dependent on physiological parameters acclimated to daytime temperature. Concordance correlation coefficients between measured and predicted transpiration were higher (0.95 and 0.98 versus 0.87 and 0.96) when model parameters reflected acclimated growth temperature. In response to temperature increases, the southern genotype (SR) transpiration responded more than the northern (OG). Conditions of elevated long-term temperature acclimation further separate their transpiration differences. Results demonstrate the importance of accounting for leaf-level physiological adjustments that are sensitive to microclimate changes and the use of provenance-, ecotype-, and/or genotype-specific parameter sets, two components likely to improve the accuracy of site-level and ecosystem-level estimates of transpiration flux.									11	0	0	9	0	11			0022-0957			WOS:000269609800006	19561047

This study characterized flavor and flavor stability of domestic WMP. Freshly produced (<1 mo) WMP was collected from 4 U. S. production facilities 5 times over a 1 y period. Each sample was analyzed initially and every 2 mo for sensory profile, volatiles, color, water activity, and moisture through 12 mo storage. Selected volatiles were quantified using solid phase microextraction (SPME) with gas chromatography/mass-spectrometry: dimethyl sulfide, 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, hexanal, 2-heptanone, heptanal, 1-octen-3-ol, octanal, 3-octen-2-one, and nonanal. Multiple linear regression with backwards elimination was applied to generate equations to predict grassy and painty flavors based on selected volatiles. All WMP were between 2% and 3% moisture and 0.11 and 0.25 water activity initially. WMP varied in initial flavor profiles with varying levels of cooked, milk fat, and sweet aromatic flavors. During storage, grassy and painty flavors developed while sweet aromatic flavor intensities decreased (P < 0.05). Painty and grassy flavors were confirmed by increased levels (P < 0.05) of lipid oxidation products such as hexanal, heptanal, and octanal. Hexanal, 2-heptanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and nonanal concentrations were best predictors of grassy flavor (R(2) = 0.38, P < 0.0001) while hexanal, 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, octanal, and 3-octen-2-one concentrations were best predictors of painty flavor (R(2) = 0.61, P < 0.0001). These results provide baseline information to determine specific factors that can be controlled to optimize U.S. WMP flavor and flavor stability.									15	0	0	12	0	15			0022-1147			WOS:000269498300037	19895500

This workshop brought together building researchers with researchers in the areas of distributed renewable energy and multifunctional materials to engage their expertise and identify overlapping research needs and opportunities. An overview of sustainable building design provided the broad context for discussion. This overview was followed by focused presentations in building control systems, advanced building envelopes, and systems and process integration. In addition, presentations on distributed renewable energy and multi-functional materials supported the participants In outlining and generating research needs that connect the topic areas. The primary outcome from this part of the workshop was the identification of key sustainable building research needs in: transformative measurements; passive strategies; regional solutions and living labs; systems integration; storage and cascades; adoption of international advances; and implementation and market transformation. These needs, along with associated technical challenges and potential impacts, are described in this paper to guide sustainable building research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1552-6100			WOS:000274044700009

Determinants of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Risk Perceptions in Youth Populations: A Multivariate Analysis								JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR				50	3			277	292					SEP 2009	2009	Grounded conceptually in social cognitive theory, this research examines how personal, behavioral, and environmental factors are associated with risk perceptions of anabolic-androgenic steroids. Ordinal logistic regression and logit log-linear models applied to data gathered from high-school seniors (N = 2,160) in the 2005 Monitoring the Future study showed significant explanatory effects for sex, race, exposure to drug spots, steroid availability, peer use of steroids, sensation-seeking, depression, and self-esteem. Females, African Americans, and those who had seen drug spots the most frequently estimated higher levels of risk associated with steroid use, while those who indicated ease in obtaining steroids and those with close friends who had used the drugs estimated lower risk. Also estimating lower levels of risk were sensation seekers, those who appeared depressed, and those with low levels of self-esteem. Analyses reveal how steroid risk determinants may differ from those related to methylenedioxymethamphetamine (i.e., MDMA, ecstasy) and marijuana use.					58th Annual Meeting of the International-Communication-Association58th Annual Meeting of the International-Communication-Association	MAY 22-26, 2008MAY 22-26, 2008	Int Commun AssocInt Commun Assoc	Montreal, CANADAMontreal, CANADA	11	0	0	3	0	11			0022-1465			WOS:000268554700003	19711806

Collaborating with School Teachers: Histology as a Science and Technology Teaching Tool								JOURNAL OF HISTOTECHNOLOGY				32	3			107	113					SEP 2009	2009	The intent of this contribution is to encourage the use of collaborative efforts to provide enhanced learning opportunities for K-12 students, specifically, to facilitate the translation of high technology research concepts to the K-12 setting. Histotechnology provides the perfect blend of science and technology that is easily accessed by youth. Hands-on, interactive activities are known to stimulate creative thought and long-term retention of principles, beyond the bounds capable from rote memorization. Activities stemming from research afford an opportunity to relate real-world concepts to science and technology principles; however, the activities must be organized, according to teacher needs, in a user-friendly manner for classroom use. The authors have worked with numerous teachers in three settings to develop histotechnology teaching modules ready for classroom use. This collaborative activity is useful to improving graduate and undergraduate student communication skills, enhancing K-12 classroom content and providing a pipeline of histotechnology enthusiasts. A sample module is provided by way of example for higher education faculty, staff, and students involved in educational outreach programs.

Stream conditions associated with the distribution of the black fly (Simuliidae) midgut symbiote Harpella were investigated in southern Alabama and Mississippi streams. Stream conditions that were most useful in predicting the distribution of Harpella spp. in the study area were dissolved oxygen and water temperature. Presence of Harpella species in streams was associated with higher dissolved oxygen and decreased water temperature compared to streams where Harpella spp. was absent. Stream conditions associated with the distribution of Harpella spp. in other regions of the world vary according to conditions other than those elucidated here, indicating that geography, host species, and stream conditions play important roles in the spatial distribution of Harpella species.

However, understanding, and possibly shaping, a society's materialistic tendencies requires a more complete study of the relationship between a society's institutional patterns and the acceptance of materialism by its members. Consequently, the current study examines five of the institutional antecedents of materialism to understand better how and why it develops as a mode of consumption within a society. More specifically, a model relating materialism and a set of institutionalized patterns of social behavior referred to as the dominant social paradigm was developed and tested in a study of seven industrial, market-based countries. The results suggest that the economic, technological, political, anthropocentric, and competition institutions making up the dominant social paradigm are all positively related to materialism. The implications of the relationship are then discussed.									15	0	0	1	0	15			0276-1467			WOS:000282467100005

Using FAME Analysis to Compare, Differentiate, and Identify Multiple Nematode Species								JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY				41	3			163	173					SEP 2009	2009	We have adapted the Sherlock (R) Microbial Identification system for identification of plant parasitic: nematodes based on their fatty acid profiles. Fatty acid profiles of 12 separate plant parasitic nematode species have been determined using this system. Additionally, separate profiles have been developed for Rotylenchulus reniformis and Meloidogyne incognita based on their host plant, four species and three races within the Meloidogyne genus, and three life stages of Heterodera glycines. Statistically, 85% of these profiles can be delimited from one another; the specific comparisons between the cyst and vermiform stages of H. glycines, M. hapla and M. arenaria, and M. arenaria and M. javanica cannot be segregated using canonical analysis. By incorporating each of these fatty acid profiles into the Sherlock (R) Analysis Software, 20 library entries were created. While there was some similarity among profiles, all entries correctly identified the proper organism to genus, species, race, life stage, and host at greater than 86% accuracy. The remaining 14% were correctly identified to genus, although species and race may not be correct due to the underlying variables of host or life stage. These results are promising and indicate that this library could be used for diagnostics labs to increase response time.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-300X			WOS:000278738600001	22736811

We then discuss two Situations in detail: estimating the signal function in the fractional Brownian motion model and the regression model with correlated errors. In the fractional Brownian motion model, we observe the process which is the sum of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index between (1/2, 1) and a drift function that is determined by the signal function. In the regression model with correlated errors, we assume that the errors have long memory. For both estimation problems, we obtain the asymptotic rate for the minimax affine risks over certain types of parameter spaces. In each case, we also show that the minimax affine risk is bounded by 1.25 times the minimax risk. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0378-3758			WOS:000267956600025

Polymer shells around Ag nanoparticles were formed by two methods: the reduction of Ag(2)O in the presence of the polymer nanoparticles and by mixing the polymer nanoparticles with already-made Ag nanoparticles. The resulting nanoparticles were coated with layers of the two polymers with the hydrophilic polymer on the outside providing their stability in water. The exposure of the polymer-coated Ag nanoparticles to unmodified Ag nanoparticles resulted in spontaneous self-assembly due to the electrostatic attraction. The polymer-coated nanoparticles and the nanoparticle assemblies were characterized by UV-vis, surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.									11	0	0	3	0	11			0743-7463			WOS:000269197500009	19655706

Using biaxial mechanical testing methods, the diabetic bladders exhibited non-linear stress-strain mechanical relationships with increasing stiffness at higher stretches in both circumferential and longitudinal directions.Results: The diabetic bladders showed mechanical anisotropy with a greater compliance in the circumferential direction than in the longitudinal direction. The time-course study suggested that diuresis mainly contributed to the "early'' changes of the mechanical properties with "late'' changes induced by other diabetic effects.Conclusions: The biomechanical study of the urinary bladder has offered a novel understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic cystopathy and we believe the collaboration of urology and engineering will contribute greatly to the treatment of diabetic bladder dysfunction in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1757-5664			WOS:000207916800031

This work included using a formulation of the problem introduced by Hou, Lowengrub, and Shelley for a numerical Study of the same problem. The analytical Study required identification of a term in the evolution equations, which can be viewed as being responsible for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, this term is of lower order than the surface tension term In the present work. the author introduces a simple model for the vortex sheet with surface tension which maintains the same dispersion relation and the same destabilizing force as in the vortex sheet with surface tension For the model problem, it is found that finite-time singularities can form when the. initial data is taken from it certain class. For the vortex sheet with surface tension, the only observed Singularities thus far in numerical work have coincided with self-intersection of the fluid interface There is no analogue of self-intersection in the model problem, and thus the singularities observed in the present work may well be related to a previously unobserved singularity for the full vortex sheet problem.

J	Cutler, Brian L.; Daugherty, Brent; Babu, Sabarish; Hodges, Larry; Van Wallendael, Lori								Creating Blind Photoarrays Using Virtual Human Technology A Feasibility Test								POLICE QUARTERLY				12	3			289	300		10.1177/1098611109339892			SEP 2009	2009	This article examined the feasibility of a computer-based program that alleviates the human resource challenge associated with blind photoarrays (photoarrays in which the investigator is blind to the suspect's identity). Students watched videotaped crimes and attempted to identify the perpetrators from photoarays conducted by a "virtual officer" who responds to simple voice commands or by research assistants playing the role of investigators. The student investigators and virtual officer produced comparable identification performance and student reactions to the photoarray procedures. Results of this evaluation study are encouraging, and the authors recommend further laboratory and field testing of the virtual officer technology for conducting blind lineups.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1098-6111			WOS:000284885100002

Influence of supplemental dietary poultry fat on the yolk characteristics of commercial layers inoculated before or at the onset of lay with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum								POULTRY SCIENCE				88	9			1883	1887		10.3382/ps.2009-00161			SEP 1 2009	2009	Effects of F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (FMG) inoculation and 1.5% supplemental dietary poultry fat (PF) on the egg yolk characteristics of commercial layers at 24, 34, 44, 50, and 58 wk of age were investigated. Sham and FMG inoculations were administered at 12 and 22 wk of age and dietary treatments (basal control and basal control with 1.5% supplemental PF) were initiated at 20 wk of age. Yolk lipid concentration was reduced on wk 24 in birds that had been inoculated at 12 or 22 wk of age with FMG. The use of 1.5% supplemental PF increased percentage of yolk weight and yolk: albumen ratio across age and inoculation treatment. At 58 wk of age, concentrations of yolk palmitic acid increased and those of oleic and linolenic acid decreased when sham inoculations were given at 22 rather than at 12 wk of age. However, FMG inoculations given at 22 rather than at 12 wk increased palmitoleic acid and decreased stearic acid yolk concentrations. At 12 wk of age, FMG inoculations decreased yolk palmitoleic, oleic, and linolenic acid concentrations while causing increased yolk stearic and arachidonic acid levels when compared with sham inoculations. Furthermore, 1.5% supplemental PF decreased concentrations of palmitic and oleic acid and increased those of linoleic acid in the yolk at 58 wk of age. Despite the interaction of 1.5% supplemental PF with the prelay inoculation of FMG on early (18 to 26 wk) layer performance noted in a previous report, the effects of a prelay FMG inoculation and 1.5% supplemental PF on the egg yolk characteristics examined in the current study were independent of each other. This suggests that 1.5% supplemental PF is not effective in modulating the effects of an FMG inoculation at 12 wk of age on hen egg yolk characteristics between 24 and 58 wk of age and that the combined effects of PF supplementation and FMG inoculation on performance do not influence egg yolk characteristics.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0032-5791			WOS:000269043600015	19687273

This growth has created powerful contract manufacturers (CMs) in several industries. Achieving a competitive cost position is often a primary motive for outsourcing. Outsourcing influences both the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) and the CM's production levels, and, therefore, through learning-by-doing renders future costs dependent on past outsourcing decisions. As such, outsourcing should not be viewed as a static decision that, once made, is not revisited. We address these considerations by analyzing a two-period game between an OEM and a powerful CM wherein both firms can reduce their production costs through learning-by-doing. We find that partial outsourcing, wherein the OEM simultaneously outsources and produces in-house, can be an optimal strategy. Also, we find that the OEM's outsourcing strategy may be dynamic-i.e., change from period to period. In addition, we find both that the OEM may engage in production for leverage (i.e., produce internally when at a cost disadvantage) and that the CM may engage in low balling. These and other findings in this paper demonstrate the importance of considering learning, the power of the CM, and future periods when making outsourcing decisions.									37	0	0	0	0	37			1059-1478			WOS:000269589000002

Kou, Jie/I-4234-2012				A method for the temperature calibration of an infrared camera using water as a radiative source								REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS				80	9					095107	10.1063/1.3213075			SEP 2009	2009	Presented here is an effective low-cost method for the temperature calibration of infrared cameras, for applications in the 0-100 degrees C range. The calibration of image gray level intensity to temperature is achieved by imaging an upwelling flow of water, the temperature of which is measured with a thermistor probe. The upwelling flow is created by a diffuser located below the water surface of a constant temperature water bath. The thermistor probe is kept immediately below the surface, and the distance from the diffuser outlet to the surface is adjusted so that the deformation of the water surface on account of the flow is small, yet the difference between the surface temperature seen by the camera and the bulk temperature measured by the thermistor is also small. The benefit of this method compared to typical calibration procedures is that, without sacrificing the quality of the calibration, relatively expensive commercial blackbodies are replaced by water as the radiative source (epsilon approximate to 0.98 for the wavelengths considered here). A heat transfer analysis is provided, which improves the accuracy of the calibration method and also provides the user with guidance to further increases in accuracy of the method.

Unraveling Bias From Student Evaluations of Their High School Science Teachers								SCIENCE EDUCATION				93	5			827	845		10.1002/sce.20332			SEP 2009	2009	In this Study, the evaluation of high school biology, chemistry, and physics teachers by their Students is examined according to the gender of the Student and the gender of the teacher. Female teachers are rated significantly lower than male teachers by male students in all three disciplines, whereas female students underrate female teachers only in physics. Interestingly, physics is also the field that suffers the greatest lack of females and has been criticized most for its androcentric culture. The gender bias in teacher ratings persists even when accounting for academic performance, classroom experiences, and family support. Furthermore, male and female teachers in each discipline appear equally effective at preparing their Students for future science study in college, Suggesting that students have a discipline-specific gender bias. Such a bias may negatively impact female Students and Contribute to the loss of females in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this Study, the numerical approach is used to understand the dynamics of partially saturated soils. The mathematical equations governing the dynamics of partially saturated soils are derived based oil the theory of mixtures and implemented within a finite element framework. The stress-strain behavior of the soil is represented by an elasto-plastic constitutive model for unsaturated soil based on bounding surface concept and the moisture-suction behavior is modeled using van Genuchten model. Fully coupled finite element simulations are performed to study the response of partially saturated soil embankment under earthquake loading and validated with centrifuge test results available in the literature. The predicted displacement responses are in good agreement with the measured responses. The pore water pressure, pore air pressure, matric suction, the degree of saturation in various elements and the response of the embankment under different initial moisture content are also discussed.

Vocal fold injury results in alterations in tissue structure and corresponding changes in tissue biomechanics that reduce vocal quality. Recent work has begun to elucidate the biochemical changes underlying injury-induced pathology and to apply tissue engineering principles to the prevention and reversal of vocal fold scarring. Based on the extensive history of injectable biomaterials in laryngeal surgery, a major focus of regenerative therapies has been the development of novel scaffolds with controlled in vivo residence time and viscoelastic properties approximating the native tissue. Additional strategies have included cell transplantation and delivery of the antifibrotic cytokine hepatocyte growth factor, as well as investigation of the effects of the unique vocal fold vibratory microenvironment using in vitro dynamic culture systems. Recent achievements of significant reductions in fibrosis and improved recovery of native tissue viscoelasticity and vibratory/functional performance in animal models are rapidly moving vocal fold tissue engineering toward clinical application.									38	2	0	23	0	39			1937-3368			WOS:000269621100004	19338432

The estrogenic activity of the effluent was quantified by the calculation of an estradiol (E2) equivalency (EEQ) factor and was determined to be equivalent to 1.724 +/- 2.103 ng/L E2. Individuals from the 50% and 100% wastewater treatments took significantly longer to reach metamorphosis than individuals in the 0% and 10% treatments. An increased incidence of male testicular oocytes was observed in the 50% and 100% treatments when compared to the control treatment. Morphological changes in the thyroid glands of 100% wastewater-treated individuals were also noted. No effects of wastewater exposure on growth, sex ratio, swim speed, startle response, or female gonadal development were observed. These results suggest that municipal wastewater effluent can alter the timing of the metamorphic process and impact male sexual development in R. pipiens. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Song, P. Wang, A radio frequency device for measurement of minute dielectric property changes in microfluidic channels, Appl. Phys. Lett. 94 (2009) 023901] is determined by the level of parasitic signal cancellation and the coupling between microwave field and the material under test (MUT). In this work, we demonstrate that the cancellation level can be greatly improved through adjusting the thickness of the lambda/4 section of the hybrid. As a result, the sensor sensitivity can be significantly improved. We also show that the sensor sensitivity can be further improved by using transmission lines that have stronger couplings. Furthermore, the fabrication and testing processes of the on-chip sensor are described. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0924-4247			WOS:000269771200002

Upon heating from 22 to 50 degrees C in water, a minimum in the differential deflection between 31.9 +/- 1.7 degrees C (PNIPAM) and 47.7 +/- 1.9 degrees C (ppDEA) was measured. The minimum in differential deflection can be associated with the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the films. Below the LCST the NCS deflection corresponds to a bending toward the thermally responsive polymer film side, associated to dehydration. At higher temperature, the deflection was reversed, i.e., away from the polymer coating. This response is mainly attributed to a bimaterial effect between the collapsed polymer and the NCS material. The LCST of the PNIPAM brush layer and the ppDEA film were close to that reported for the bulk polymers.									15	0	0	1	0	15			1022-1352			WOS:000269473400009

Here we report the first study using carbon dots for optical imaging in live mice. The results suggest that the carbon dots remain strongly fluorescent in vivo, which, coupled with their biocompatibility and nontoxic characteristics, might offer great potential for imaging and related biomedical applications.									547	48	0	78	0	584			0002-7863			WOS:000269379200019	19722643

Purification has been achieved by chromatographic methods and the product has been characterized by mass spectrometry, UV/vis absorption spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Although a number of endohedral fullerenes have been found to utilize the D-3h(5)-C-78 cage, comparison of the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of the previously characterized Sc3N@D-3h(5)-C-78 with those of Gd3N@C-78 reveals significant differences that indicate that these two endohedrals do not possess the same cage structure. A single crystal X-ray diffraction study indicates that the fullerene cage does not follow the isolated pentagon rule (IPR) but has two equivalent sites where two pentagons abut. The endohedral has been identified as Gd3N@C-2(22010)-C-78. Two of the gadolinium atoms of the planar Gd3N unit are located within the pentalene folds formed by the adjacent pentagons. The third gadolinium atom resides at the center of a hexagonal face of the fullerene.									68	4	0	9	0	71			0002-7863			WOS:000269379200057	19601601

Circular dichroism (CD) is a powerful method for observing the secondary structure of proteins; however, it provides little information regarding the tertiary structure of a protein or its adsorbed orientation. In this Study, we developed methods using side-chain-specific chemical modification of solvent-exposed tryptophan residues to complement CD spectroscopy and bioactivity assays to provide greater detail regarding whether changes in enzyme bioactivity following adsorption are due to adsorbed orientation and/or adsorption-induced changes in the overall structure. These methods were then applied to investigate how adsorption influences the bioactivity of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and glucose oxidase (GOx) on alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers, over a range of surface chemistries. The results from these studies indicate that Surface chemistry significantly influences the bioactive state of each of these enzymes but in distinctly different ways. Changes in the bioactive state of HEWL are largely governed by its adsorbed orientation, while the bioactive state of adsorbed GOx is influenced by it combination of both adsorbed orientation and adsorption-induced changes in confirmation.									39	0	0	10	0	39			0743-7463			WOS:000268719900069	19610641

The monomer has been used to prepare a poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) derivative (P1) incorporating oxacyclophane units as canopies that shield one side of the pi-system from inter-chain interactions. The photophysical properties of P1 in dilute solution compare well to those of a poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) derivative (P2) that lacks the canopy. The presence of the steric canopy leads to a diminished inter-chain interaction in the solid state and enhances the kinetic response of PI to vapors of nitro-organics such as TNT, presumably by increasing the permeability of Pi to these analytes over that of P2.									12	0	0	1	0	12			1022-1336			WOS:000269406700005	21638397

Strong Metal Ion Size Based Selectivity of the Highly Preorganized Ligand PDA (1,10-Phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxylic Acid) with Trivalent Metal Ions. A Crystallographic, Fluorometric, and Thermodynamic Study								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				48	16			7853	7863		10.1021/ic900737q			AUG 17 2009	2009	The selectivity of the rigid ligand PDA (1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxylic acid) for some M(III) (M=metal) ions is presented. The structure of [Fe(PDA(H)(1/2))(H(2)O)(3)] (ClO(4))(2)center dot 3H(2)O center dot 1/2H(5)O(2) (1) is reported: triclinic, P (1) over bar, a=7.9022(16) angstrom, b=12.389(3) angstrom, c=13.031(3), angstrom, alpha=82.55(3)degrees, beta=88.41(3)degrees, gamma=78.27(3)degrees, V=1238.6(4) angstrom(3), Z=2, R=0.0489. The coordination geometry around the Fe(III) is close to a regular pentagonal bipyramid, with Fe-N lengths averaging 2.20 angstrom, which is normal for a 1,10-phenanthroline type of ligand coordinated to seven-coordinate Fe(III). The Fe-O bonds to the carboxylate oxygens average 2.157 angstrom, which is rather long compared to the average Fe-O length of 2.035 angstrom to carboxylates in seven-coordinate Fe(III) complexes. The structure of 1 supports the idea that the Fe(III) is too small for ideal coordination in the cleft of PDA, and the structure shows that the Fe(III) adapts to this by inducing numerous small distortions in the structure of the PDA ligand. The log K(1) values for PDA at 25 degrees C in 0.1 M NaClO(4) were determined by UV spectroscopy with Al(III) (log K(1)=6.9), Ga(III) (log K(1)=9.7), In(III) (log K(1) = 19.7), Fe(III) (log K(1) = 20.0), and Bi(III) (log K(1)=26.2). The low values of log K(1) for PDA with Al(III) and Ga(III) are because these ions are too small for the cleft in PDA, which requires a large metal ion with an ionic radius (r(+)) of 1.0 angstrom. In(III) and Fe(III) (r(+)=0.86 and 0.72 angstrom for a coordination number (CN) of 7) are somewhat too small for the cleft in PDA but may adapt by increasing the coordination number, which increases the metal ion size, and have high log K(1) values. Very large log K(1) values are found, as expected, for Bi(III) (r(+)=1.17 angstrom, CN=8), which fits the cleft quite well. Fluorescence studies show that Y(III) produces the largest CHEF (chelation enhanced fluorescence) effects, followed by La(III) and Lu(III), in the PDA complexes. Metal ions with nonfilled d or f subshells produce very large quenching of the fluorescence, as do heavy-metal ions such as In(III) and Bi(III), which have large spin-orbit coupling effects. The Al(III)/PDA complex produced an intense broad band at longer wavelength than the pi*-pi emissions of the PDA ligand, which is at a maximum at pH 6, and the possibility that this might reflect an exciplex, where one PDA ligand in the Al(III) complex pi-stacks with the excited state of a second PDA ligand, is discussed.									40	0	0	2	0	40			0020-1669			WOS:000268661500045	19603801

We develop the equation of motion for the oscillation of a cantilever which is electrostatically driven into resonance and compared to experiment. The resonance signal is measured both by a photodetector (mechanical signal) and a charge amplifier (electrical signal) and is found to be in good agreement with the derived equation of motion: Finally; a few nonlinear phenomena observed in our HDR experiments will be examined analytically.

The post-transfer cell viability in MAPLE DW depends on various operation conditions such as the applied laser fluence; unfortunately, the effect of laser fluence on the post-transfer cell viability has not been well elucidated. This work aims to study the effect of laser fluence on the post-transfer cell viability and the cell recovery ability in MAPLE DW of yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). It has been observed that (1) yeast. cell viability decreases as the laser fluence increases from 85 to around 1500 mJ/cm(2) and (2) some of the MAPLE DW process-induced cell damage is reversible. The post-transfer yeast cell recovery is a function of laser fluence; however, this dependence relationship is not monotonic. Future work is needed to better understand the physical and chemical mechanisms of the above observations. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

Using an ambipolar d-density-wave model for the pseudogap, we predict a peak in the Nernst coefficient with decreasing temperature below the pseudogap temperature. The existence of the peak and its sign, which we predict to be the same as that due to mobile vortices in a superconductor, result from the dominance of the electron pocket at low temperatures, as has been observed in recent Hall experiments.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0031-9007			WOS:000269063300056	19792675	
J	Henderson, James K.; Falta, Ronald W.; Freedman, David L.								Simulation of the effect of remediation on EDB and 1,2-DCA plumes at sites contaminated by leaded gasoline								JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY				108	1-2			29	45		10.1016/j.jconhyd.2009.05.004			AUG 11 2009	2009	An analytical model is used to simulate the effects of partial source removal and plume remediation on ethylene dibromide (EDB) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) plumes at contaminated underground storage tank (UST) sites. The risk posed by EDB, 1,2-DCA, and commingled gasoline hydrocarbons varies throughout the plume over time. Dissolution from the light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) determines the concentration of each contaminant near the source, but biological decay in the plume has a greater influence as distance downgradient from the source increases. For this reason, compounds that exceed regulatory standards near the source may not in downgradient plume zones. At UST sites, partial removal of a residual LNAPL source mass may serve as a stand alone remedial technique if dissolved concentrations in the source zone are within several orders of magnitude of the applicable government or remedial standards. This may be the case with 1,2-DCA; however, EDB is likely to be found at concentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than its low Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 0.05 mu g/L (micrograms per liter). For sites with significant EDB contamination, even when plume remediation is combined with source depletion, significant timeframes may be required to mitigate the impact of this compound. Benzene and MTBE are commonly the focus of remedial efforts at LIST sites, but simulations presented here suggest that EDB, and to a lesser extent 1,2-DCA, could be the critical contaminants to consider in the remediation design process at many sites.

Understanding the role interfacial effects have on transport across ionic membranes is critical to the design of new responsive thin layers for a variety of applications from fuel cell membranes to protective cloths and water purification. At steady state, a nonuniform distribution of water molecules was observed with a high concentration at the air-polymer interface. An excess of water was also found at the polymer-silicon interface. The mass uptake is initially linear with t(0.5) but crosses over to an anomalous process with extended exposure periods. A delay time for the onset of diffusion is observed and is interpreted in terms of interfacial barrier to diffusion.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0024-9297			WOS:000268523400048

The abundances have been derived in a self-consistent fashion, and for each group (MS or RGB), the CNO abundances are found to be in excellent star-to-star agreement. Using the dwarfs to infer the initial composition of the giants, the combined abundance patterns confirm that the giants have undergone the first dredge-up and that material processed by the CN cycle has been mixed to the surface layers. The observed abundances are compared to predictions of a standard stellar model based on the Clemson-American University of Beirut (CAUB) stellar evolution code. The model reproduces the observed evolution of the N and O abundances, as well as the previously derived (12)C/(13)C ratio, but it fails to predict by a factor of 1.5 the observed level of (12)C depletion. A similar discord appears to exist in previously reported observed and modeled C abundances of giants in the Galactic disk. Random uncertainties in the mean abundances and uncertainties related to possible systematic errors in the Hyades dwarf and giant parameter scales cannot account for the discrepancy in the observed and modeled abundances. Li abundances are derived to determine if noncanonical extra mixing, like that seen in low-mass metal-poor giants, has occurred in the Hyades giants. The Li abundance of the giant gamma Tau is in good accord with the predicted level of surface Li dilution, but a similar to 0.35 dex spread in the giant Li abundances is found and cannot be explained by the stellar model. Possible sources of the spread are discussed; however, it is apparent that the differential mechanism responsible for the Li dispersion must be unrelated to the uniformly low (12)C abundances of the giants. Na, Mg, and Al abundances are derived as an additional test of our stellar model. All three elements are found to be overabundant by 0.2-0.5 dex in the giants relative to the dwarfs. Such large enhancements of these elements are not predicted by the stellar model, and non-LTE effects significantly larger (and, in some cases, of opposite sign) than those implied by extant literature calculations are the most likely cause.									18	0	0	0	0	18			0004-637X			WOS:000268341800070

These donor-acceptor arrays have been assembled through metal coordination of linear fullerene mono- and bispyridyl ligands to ruthenium(II) phthalocyanines. The hybrid [Ru(CO)(C60PY)Pc] (3) and the triad [Ru-2(CO)(2)(C60Py2)PC2] (5) were prepared by treatment of the phthalocyanine 6 with the mono- and hexakis-substituted C-60-pyridyl ligands 1 and 2, respectively. The triad [Ru(C60Py)(2)Pc] (4) was prepared in a similar manner from the monosubstituted C-60-pyridyl ligand 1 and the phthalocyanine precursor 7. The simplicity of this versatile synthetic approach allows to determine the influence of the donor and acceptor ratio in the radical ion pair state lifetime. The chemical, electrochemical, and photophysical characterization of the phthalocyanine-fullerene hybrids 3-5 was conducted using I H and C-13 NMR, UV/vis, and IR spectroscopies, as well as mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry, femtosecond transient absorption studies, and nanosecond laser flash photolysis experiments. Arrays 3-5 exhibit electronic coupling between the two electroactive components in the ground state, which is modulated by the axial CO and 4-pyridylfulleropyrrolidine ligands. With respect to the excited state, we have demonstrated that RuPc/C-60 electron donor-acceptor hybrids are a versatile platform to fine-tune the outcome and dynamics of charge transfer processes. The use of ruthenium(II) phthalocyanines instead of the corresponding zinc(II) complexes allows the suppression of energy wasting and unwanted charge recombination, affording radical ion pair state lifetimes on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds for the C-60-monoadduct-based complexes 3 and 4. For the hexakis-substituted C-60 unit 2, the reduction potential is shifted cathodically, thus raising the radical ion pair state energy. However, the location of the RuPc triplet excited state is not high enough, and still offers a rapid deactivation of the radical ion pair state.									69	4	0	6	0	70			0002-7863			WOS:000268644400043	19722625	
J	Mahmoodi, S. Nima; Daqaq, Mohammed F.; Jalili, Nader								On the nonlinear-flexural response of piezoelectrically driven microcantilever sensors								SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL				153	2			171	179		10.1016/j.sna.2009.05.003			AUG 3 2009	2009	This paper undertakes a comprehensive analysis and detailed comparative study of two types of microcantilever sensors (MCS). The first configuration is actuated using a piezoelectric stack embedded under the sensor base yielding a base-type actuation while the second is actuated via a piezoelectric ZnO layer deposited on the surface of the sensor. Along these lines, a comprehensive distributed-parameters nonlinear model that includes both geometric and material nonlinearities is developed. The method of multiple scales is then implemented to study the asymptotic behavior of the sensors' response. Results demonstrate that each of the aforedescribed sensors exhibits a completely different nonlinear behavior. More specifically, similar to a base-excited macrocantilever, the first mode of a base-excited MCS has a hardening-type behavior. On the other hand, the first vibration mode of the piezoelectrically actuated MCS has a softening-type response. This softening behavior can be attributed to the presence of quadratic material nonlinearities in the piezoelectric layer (ZnO here). Such nonlinearities, which describe the nonlinear relation between the stress and strain in some piezoelectric materials are usually neglected in the modeling of piezoelectrically actuated macrocantilever beams. Here, we demonstrate by extensive theoretical development and experimental results that material nonlinearities associated with ZnO materials are large and have a considerable effect altering the response from the commonly expected hardening to the softening type. As such, it becomes evident that such detailed and comprehensive-nonlinear modeling effort is a key step towards the design and development of practical MCS. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The crystal structures of RbBe2BO3F2 (RBBF; rubidium fluoroberyllium borate) and CsBe2BO3F2 (CBBF; caesium fluoroberyllium borate), previously determined in the space group C2, were reinvestigated for higher symmetry and found to have more suitable solutions in the space group R32. TlBe2BO3F2 (TBBF; thallium fluoroberyllium borate) was synthesized as a novel compound also having this trigonal structure type. Details of the space-group determination and unique structural features are discussed. These crystal structures were compared with that of KBe2BO3F2, revealing interesting structural trends within this family of compounds that are also discussed.

Another study has found correlations between other alterations in the MET gene and autism in two unrelated cohorts. This study screened two cohorts, an Autistic Disorder cohort from South Carolina and a Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) cohort from Italy, for the presence of the C allele variant in rs1858830. A significant increase in the C allele variant frequency was found in the South Carolina Autistic Disorder patients as compared to South Carolina Controls (chi(2) = 5.8, df = 1, P = 0.02). In the South Carolina cohort, a significant association with Autistic Disorder was found when comparing the CC and CG genotypes to the GG genotype (odds ratio (OR) = 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-2.40; chi(2) = 6.5, df = 1, P = 0.01) in cases and controls. In the Italian cohort, no significant association with PDD was found when comparing the CC or CG genotype to the GG genotype (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 0.56-2.56; chi(2) = 0.2, df = 1, P = 0.64). This study is the third independent study to find the rs1858830 C variant in the MET gene promoter to be associated with autism.									39	2	0	32	0	41			1939-3792			WOS:000270022900005	19681062	
J	Baldwin, Robert F.; deMaynadier, Phillip G.								Assessing threats to pool-breeding amphibian habitat in an urbanizing landscape								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				142	8			1628	1638		10.1016/j.biocon.2009.02.039			AUG 2009	2009	Geographically-based threat assessments are important for identifying natural resources at risk, yet have rarely been applied to identify habitat conservation priorities for imperiled organisms at: a local scale. Pool-breeding amphibians have complex life cycles that place them at risk from habitat loss and fragmentation both in wetlands and in adjacent uplands. Because the most rapidly growing cause of habitat degradation in North America has been urbanization, a threat analysis of pool-breeding amphibian habitat should both be dynamic, i.e., sensitive to land-use change, and comprehensive, recognizing traditional protected area networks as well as less formal conservation assets (e.g., land-use regulations). To assess threats to wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) in a rapidly urbanizing, forested region of New England (USA) we examined gaps in the current protection network, as well as changing human settlement patterns. We found that greater than 50% of 542 potential breeding pools delineated using low-level infra-red aerial photography (median area 379.5 m(2)) were not represented on National Wetland Inventory (U.S.FWS) maps, and thus de facto at risk. Most importantly, conservation lands and regulatory protections failed to protect 46% of potential breeding pools and 80% of adjacent non-breeding habitat. While an assessment of human settlement patterns projected that only 5% of the region contained high quality amphibian habitat under acute development pressure, nearly half of the region (44.7%) had attained a moderate threat level, highlighting the importance of conservation planning during early stages of urbanization. We conclude by illustrating the role for multiple conservation strategies when protecting functional landscapes for pool-breeding amphibians. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the absence of FcCOOH, the M% TEGDA in deionized (DI) water (48%; 1 mol% TEGDA to 32%; 12 mol% TEGDA) scales with the cross-link density in accordance with Flory-Huggins-Rehner theory. The release profiles of FcCOOH from hydrogel slabs (43.0 mM) into 0.1 M HEPES/0.1 M KCl buffer are determined from the oxidation peak current of FcCOOH via cyclic voltammetry (100 mV/s) and are decidedly Fickian with overall diffusion coefficients that range from 2.64 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s (1 mol% TEGDA) to 4.87 x 10(-9) cm(2)/s (12 mol% TEGDA) and with n parameters that approximated 0.5 but nonetheless linearly declined from 0.49 (1 mol%) to 0.42 (12 mol%). Diffusion coefficients, like hydration, strongly correlate with the M% TEGDA and hence with the cross-link density or the molecular weight (MW) between cross-links. The temperature dependence of the release profiles measured at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 degrees C reveal thermally activated transport with activation energies that are 30 kJ/mol Q mol%), 36 kJ/mol (5 mol%), 45 kJ/mol (7 mol%), 47 kJ/mol (9 mol%) and 57 kJ/mol (12 mol%). Covalent tethering of the FcCOOH via the UV-polymerizable monomers ferrocene monomethacrylate (Fc-AEMA) and ferrocene polyethylene glycol monomethacrylate (Fc-PEG(3500)-AEMA) to produce pendant redox moieties is shown to eliminate or attenuate release of Fc. While, Fc-AEMA showed no evidence of release (0%) from the hydrogel, its PEG-conjugated equivalent, Fc-PEG(3500)-AEMA, shows release of 16% Fc after 5 days of immersion. These hydrogels will serve as the immobilization matrix for oxidoreductase enzymes of biosensors and the parameters obtained used in the modeling of such systems.									26	1	0	11	0	26			1525-7797			WOS:000268661400014	19601642

Specifically, pitch fractions containing 98% monomer or 97% dimer were isolated by DGE and characterized using MALDI, MALDI-PSD, and FD mass spectrometry (MS); and (1)H NMR, UV-Vis, and FT-IR spectroscopy. Results indicate that the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the 98% monomer pitch fraction is approximately Gaussian, with the dominant species being methylated derivatives of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) benzofluorene (216.4 m/z), chrysene, (228.3 m/z), benzofluoranthene (252.3 m/z), and their isomers. The distribution of methyl substituents per molecule is also approximately Gaussian, with a maximum at 2. The MWD of the 97% dimer pitch fraction is also approximately Gaussian, and the most prevalent species (m/z = 454.6, 468.7, and 482.8) are consistent with condensation reactions of the most common monomer species with an accompanying loss of 4-6 hydrogens. As mesophase pitches that contain up to 25% dimer were previously identified, herein are proposed specific molecular structures that are significant constituents in mesophase pitch.

Data on child injuries were extracted from the linked agency administrative data base maintained by the South Carolina Budget and Control Board. Data on neighborhood distress were derived from census data in the census block group level. An initial pool of ICD-9 codes for children's injuries was provided for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 reporting periods. An expert panel consisting of five physicians was convened to review the ICD-9 codes to assess their relationship to child safety, and to collectively decide on the codes to be used as the measure and proxy for child maltreatment.Results: The findings offer a glance to the utility and potential of using ICD-9 coded injuries as a measure of child safety. The results present a final list of 323 codes of the ICD-9 codes (230 codes of child physical safety, 57 codes of child sexual abuse, and 36 codes of child safety not otherwise classified). Moderate to strong correlations were found between the suggestive codes and the Neighborhood Distress Index. Further. these data served well to establish a baseline to monitor the prevalence of child safety and injuries.Conclusions: The finding offers preliminary support for the validity of ICD-9 coded child injuries as a measure of child safety. There is great potential in this approach for monitoring the prevalence of injuries of children as well as children safety in the community level. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Onshore scour characteristics around submerged vertical and semicircular breakwaters								COASTAL ENGINEERING				56	8			868	875		10.1016/j.coastaleng.2009.04.003			AUG 2009	2009	A laboratory study is presented herein investigating the two-dimensional onshore scour along the base of submerged vertical and semicircular breakwaters. Experiments were conducted with normally incident monochromatic waves breaking at the breakwater on both sloping and horizontal sandy bottoms. A principle conclusion of this investigation is that the characteristics of onshore breakwater scour are independent of submerged breakwater shape/type. It is also concluded that the onshore scour patterns can be divided into two distinct regimes that solely rely on the Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC = H(i)n/W(bw); W(bw) - breakwater crest width, H(i) - incident wave height). For KC values larger than pi, the scour forms "detached" from the breakwater while for KC values smaller than or equal to pi, the scour occurs "attached" to the onshore breakwater face. Three important scour characteristics are investigated: maximum scour depth (S(max)), scour length (L(s)), and the distance of S(max) location from the onshore breakwater face (D(s)). S(max) value is observed to be regime independent and rely on both KC and the mobility number (psi = (H(i)pi/Tsinh(kh))(2)/g*d; g* - reduced gravitational acceleration, d - median diameter of the sediment, k - wave number, h - still water depth, T - wave period) while L(s) and D(s) are observed to be regime dependent and rely only on KC. Semi-empirical parameterizations to predict S(max), L(s), and D(s), values for onshore breakwater scour are proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A market power spectrum is considered where one end has infinitely large production capacity but the usual network constraints while the other end has infinitely large network capacity but the usual production constraints. First, we analyze the locational market power function mathematically. Then, we use a real world example of the Portland, Oregon electrical market and determine its position on the market power spectrum. We find the Portland market to be primarily production constrained rather than network constrained. We also identify the local and global threshold generation capacities for each generator beyond which it cannot influence the individual and total locational market power, respectively.

J	Han, Young J.; Khalilian, Ahmad; Owino, Tom O.; Farahani, Hamid J.; Moore, Sam								Development of Clemson variable-rate lateral irrigation system								COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE				68	1			108	113		10.1016/j.compag.2009.05.002			AUG 2009	2009	Crops in the Southern United States are generally produced in fields which are known to have a high degree of variability in soil type, water holding capacity, infiltration rates, and other major factors which affect crop production. In these fields, the ability to turn irrigation water on or off or apply variably to different segments of the field is advantageous over the conventional uniform application. A variable-rate lateral irrigation (VRLI) system was developed for site-specific application of water to match field variability. The system consists of solid-state relays controlled by custom software, air-actuated diaphragm valves, a forward speed control system and a CPS receiver. The Clemson VRLI system applies variable-rate water utilizing the nozzle-pulsing technique and variable speed control system. This system could monitor and apply water based on the actual soil moisture content, pan evaporation data, or the U.S. Climate Reference Network (CRN) data. Uniformity tests show that the system is able to control the irrigation rate from 0 to 2.5 cm of irrigation water and can control the forward speed between 145 and 29 m/h. The pulsing technique to deliver variable amounts of irrigation had little adverse effect on system uniformity and nozzle flow rate with an average application error of less than 2%.

J	Kovach, Jami; Cho, Byung Rae								A D-optimal design approach to constrained multiresponse robust design with prioritized mean and variance considerations								COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING				57	1			237	245		10.1016/j.cie.2008.11.011			AUG 2009	2009	The traditional measures of ensuring quality, derived from viewing quality as simply conforming to specifications, does not adequately address today's global markets and value-driven customers. Consequently, process improvement projects are often performed to improve operational performance in order to increase customer satisfaction. Therefore, process improvement methods, such as robust design, are important to industrial quality improvement initiatives. Yet, little of the work in the area of robust design has specifically addressed problems involving physical processing constraints that create an irregularly shape experimental region and the simultaneous consideration of multiple quality characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a new approach to robust design that utilizes D-optimal experimental designs in the context of multiresponse optimization problems in order to overcome the limitations of standard experimental approaches often used in robust design studies. Specifically, we formulate our optimization models as a preemptive nonlinear goal programming problem that focuses on consideration of the mean and variance. We also investigate the extension of optimization models traditionally used in robust design investigations to address multiple responses and compare the outcomes of our proposed approaches using a numerical example.

J	Roberts, Nicholas; Thatcher, Jason Bennett								Conceptualizing and Testing Formative Constructs: Tutorial and Annotated Example								DATA BASE FOR ADVANCES IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS				40	3			9	39					AUG 2009	2009	Although abundant advice is available for how to develop and validate multi-item scales based on reflective constructs, scant attention has been directed to how to construct and validate formative constructs. Such advice is important because (1) theory suggests many constructs are formative and (2) recent advances in software render testing models with formative constructs more tractable. In this tutorial, our goal is to enhance understanding of formative constructs at the conceptual, statistical and methodological levels. Specifically, we (1) provide general principles for specifying whether a construct should be conceptually modeled as reflective or formative, (2) discuss the statistical logic behind formative constructs, and (3) illustrate how to model and evaluate formative constructs. In particular, we provide a tutorial in which we test and validate professional reward structure, a formative construct, in two popular structural equation modeling programs: EQS and PLS. We conclude with a summary of guidelines for how to conduct and evaluate research using formative constructs.									63	0	0	0	1	64			0095-0033			WOS:000277409100002		
J	Pang, WeiChiang; Rosowsky, David V.								Direct Displacement Procedure for Performance-Based Seismic Design of Mid-Rise Wood-Framed Structures								EARTHQUAKE SPECTRA				25	3			583	605		10.1193/1.3158932			AUG 2009	2009	This paper presents a direct displacement design (DDD) procedure that can be used for seismic design of multistory wood-framed structures. The proposed procedure is applicable to any pure shear deforming system. The design procedure is a promising design tool for performance-based seismic design since it allows consideration of multiple performance objectives (e.g., damage limitation, safety requirements) without requiring the engineer to perform a complex finite element or nonlinear time-history analysis of the complete structure. A simple procedure based on normalized modal analysis is used to convert the code-specified acceleration response spectrum into a set of interstory drift spectra. These spectra can be used to determine the minimum stiffness required for each floor based on the drift limit requirements. Specific shear walls can then be directly selected from a database of backbone curves. The procedure is illustrated on the design of two three-story ATC-63 archetype buildings, and the results are validated using nonlinear time-history analysis.									11	1	0	0	0	12			8755-2930			WOS:000268809600005

Through both experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that such dielectrophoresis-induced particle focusing can be implemented in a much smaller magnitude of DC-biased AC electric fields (10 kV/m in total) as compared to pure DC electric fields (up to 100 kV/m). This is attributed to the increase in the ratio of cross-stream particle dielectrophoretic velocity to streamwise electrokinetic velocity as only the DC field component contributes to the latter. The effects of the 1 kHz frequency AC to DC electric field ratio on particle trajectories and velocity variations through the microchannel constriction are also examined, which are found to agree with the simulation results.									67	0	0	38	0	67			0173-0835			WOS:000269398700010	19621378

Theoretical calculations and nitrogen adsorption analysis results demonstrated that aggregation of CNTs led to a significant reduction in surface area (especially for the SWNTs), but a significant increase of pore volume (especially for the MWNTs) due to interstices trapped in the CNT aggregates. In contrast to the nitrogen gas adsorption, the liquid phase adsorption results indicated that the adsorption of SM by CNTs was controlled by available adsorption surface area rather than pore volume, and aggregation of CNTs was an unfavorable factor for the SOC adsorption. Surface functionalization of CNTs; improved their dispersion in aqueous solutions, but decreased their adsorption capacities for the hydrophobic SOCs, which was attributed to the formation of water clusters around the oxygen-containing functional groups. Molecular configurations of SOCs also played a role in their adsorption. For the planar PNT, the SWNTs showed significantly higher adsorption capacities and site energies than the MWNTs, whereas for the nonplanar SOCs the adsorption capacity and site energy differences between the SWNTs and the MWNTs became smaller with increasing concentration of SOCs.									78	4	0	45	0	78			0013-936X			WOS:000268480600029	19731668

An Extract of Hydrilla verticillata and Associated Epiphytes Induces Avian Vacuolar Myelinopathy in Laboratory Mallards								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY				24	4			362	368		10.1002/tox.20424			AUG 2009	2009	Avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) is a neurological disease affecting bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), American coots (Fulica americana), waterfowl, and other birds in the southeastern United States. The cause of the disease is unknown, but is thought to be a naturally produced toxin. AVM is associated with aquatic macrophytes, most frequently hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata), and researchers have linked the disease to an epiphytic cyanobacterial species associated with the macrophytes. The goal of this study was to develop an extraction protocol for separating the putative toxin from a hydrilla-cyanobacterial matrix. Hydrilla samples were collected from an AVM-affected reservoir (J. Strom Thurmond Lake, SC) and confirmed to contain the etiologic agent by mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) bioassay. These samples were then extracted using a solvent series of increasing polarity: hexanes, acetone, and methanol. Control hydrilla samples from a reference reservoir with no history of AVM (Lake Marion, SC) were extracted in parallel. Resulting extracts were administered to mallards by oral gavage. Our findings indicate that the methanol extracts of hydrilla collected from the AVM-affected site induced the disease in laboratory mallards. This study provides the first data documenting for an "extractable" AVM-inducing agent. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Toxicity tests were conducted according to a four-factor complete factorial design. Nominal factor levels were as follows: pH 6 and 8; DOC, 2.5 and 10 mg/L; hardness, 10, 20, and 40 mg/L as CaCO(3); and two DOM sources (collected from the Black River and Edisto River, SC, USA). The experimental design resulted in 24 different factor level combinations. Results indicated that all factors had significant effects on copper toxicity. Furthermore, a strong interactive effect of DOC concentration and pH was detected. Because the biotic ligand model (BLM) has become a widely used tool for predicting toxicity and interpreting toxicity test results, its performance with these data was evaluated. Seventy percent of BLM predictions were within twofold of the observed median lethal concentrations. However, BLM parameters could be adjusted to improve model performance with this data set. This analysis suggested that in soft waters, the CuOH(+) complex binds more strongly with the biotic ligand and that the competitive effect of hardness cations should be increased. The results of the present study may have implications for application of the BLM to some types of surface waters. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of BLM performance with all available data should be performed, and necessary updates to model parameters should be made to produce the most robust and widely applicable model.									29	3	0	29	0	33			0730-7268			WOS:000268014200012	19265455

The chimpanzee brain shows human-like perisylvian asymmetries in white matter								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE				30	3			431	438		10.1111/j.1460-9568.2009.06830.x			AUG 2009	2009	Modern neuroimaging technologies allow scientists to uncover interspecies differences and similarities in hemispheric asymmetries that may shed light on the origin of brain asymmetry and its functional correlates. We analyzed asymmetries in ratios of white to grey matter in the lateral aspect of the lobes of the brains of chimpanzees. We found marked leftward asymmetries for all lobar regions. This asymmetry was particularly pronounced in the frontal region and was found to be related to handedness for communicative manual gestures as well as for tool use. These results point to a continuity in asymmetry patterns between the human and chimpanzee brain, and support the notion that the anatomical substrates for lateralization of communicative functions and complex manipulative activities may have been present in the common hominid ancestor.									17	0	0	14	0	17			0953-816X			WOS:000268654900008	19614754

Discriminative stimulus properties of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in C57Bl/6J mice								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY				615	1-3			102	107		10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.05.010			AUG 1 2009	2009	Primarily, rats have served as subjects in Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol's (THC) discrimination studies although other species such as monkeys and pigeons have been used. While the introduction of the knockout and transgenic mice has vastly stimulated the study of the discriminative stimulus effects of drugs there is only a single published report of mice trained to discriminate THC. Thus, this study extended those results by providing a systematic replication that THC serves as an effective discriminative stimulus in mice and by further investigating the mechanisms of action involved in the THC discrimination model in the mouse. Male C57BL/6J mice were trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg THC from vehicle in 2-lever drug discrimination. THC fully and dose dependently substituted for itself. Cannabinoid indoles, except one with low cannabinoid CB1 receptor affinity, substituted for THC. Anandamide failed to substitute for THC when administered alone but completely substituted when administered with the non-specific fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. As expected, nicotine failed to substitute for THC. Lastly, the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant blocked THC's discriminative stimulus effects. Taken together these studies demonstrate THC's ability to produce discriminative stimulus effects as well as demonstrate its pharmacological specificity and mechanism of action in a two-lever drug discrimination mouse model.

DeWayne								Perception of Robot Passability With Direct Line of Sight and Teleoperation								HUMAN FACTORS				51	4			557	570		10.1177/0018720809341959			AUG 2009	2009	Objective: To examine participants' abilities to judge the passability of robots through apertures in direct-line-of-sight (DLS) and teleoperation (TO) conditions, two experiments were conducted. Background: Past work has demonstrated that operators find it difficult to perceive aspects of remote environments during TO. For example, urban search-and-rescue operators have experienced difficulty judging whether a robot could pass through openings or over obstacles. Although previous research has discussed perceptual difficulties in TO, the differences between DLS and TO have not been quantified. Method: In the first experiment, participants judged the smallest passable aperture widths for three robot sizes for both DLS and TO conditions. In the second experiment, aperture widths were judged for three camera heights and two robot distances during TO. Results: In the DLS condition, participants produced similar judgments for the three robot sizes using dimensionless measurements. In the TO condition, participants' judgments were more variable and they judged smaller apertures as passable. Conclusion: Overall, participants judged apertures that were too small for the robot to pass as passable. This tendency was more pronounced in four instances: as robot size increased, during TO, when the camera was at its lowest height, and as distance between the robot and the aperture increased. Application: Judgments of passability help to quantify differences in perception between DLS and TO. These results will be useful in the design of training regimes for TO tasks. Increasing operator understanding of performance differences under varying conditions will lead them to be more accurate when making critical decisions in remote environments.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0018-7208			WOS:000270351000010	19899364

Prediction of crosstalk that may realistically occur requires statistical methods. Monte Carlo simulation techniques are often used to account for statistical variation, but are time consuming and do not provide intuition toward the cause of, or solution to, problems. Here, we investigate prediction of the statistically "reasonable worst-case" crosstalk by forming probability distributions using inductance and capacitance parameters from a single harness cross section and using lumped-element approximations for crosstalk that account for strong coupling within the harness when the circuit is electrically small. The accuracy of this technique was evaluated through comparison to simulation results using the random displacement spline interpolation method for multiple random instantiations of several harness configurations. Tests were performed while varying the size of the bundle, its height above the return plane, the value of load impedances, and the presence of a return wire. The reasonable worst-case crosstalk was estimated within about 5 dB or less in each case.									20	2	0	0	0	21			0018-9375			WOS:000269154400032

In this paper, an analysis based on a lossy cavity model is performed to determine the maximum possible radiated field corresponding to a given power bus noise voltage. A closed-form expression relating the maximum power bus noise voltage to the radiation peaks is then derived. This expression is solved in reverse to determine the minimum power bus voltage that is necessary to generate a radiated field above a specified limit. When troubleshooting a radiated emissions problem, this expression can be applied to measured values of power bus noise voltage to determine whether radiation directly from the power bus is potentially the emissions source.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0018-9375			WOS:000269154400035

Developing a novel serum-free cell culture model of skeletal muscle differentiation by systematically studying the role of different growth factors in myotube formation								IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-ANIMAL				45	7			378	387		10.1007/s11626-009-9192-7			AUG 2009	2009	This work describes the step-by-step development of a novel, serum-free, in vitro cell culture system resulting in the formation of robust, contracting, multinucleate myotubes from dissociated skeletal muscle cells obtained from the hind limbs of fetal rats. This defined system consisted of a serum-free medium formulation developed by the systematic addition of different growth factors as well as a nonbiological cell growth promoting substrate, N-1[3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl] diethylenetriamine. Each growth factor in the medium was experimentally evaluated for its effect on myotube formation. The resulting myotubes were evaluated immunocytochemically using embryonic skeletal muscle, specifically the myosin heavy chain antibody. Based upon this analysis, we propose a new skeletal muscle differentiation protocol that reflects the roles of the various growth factors which promote robust myotube formation. Further observation noted that the proposed skeletal muscle differentiation technique also supported muscle-nerve coculture. Immunocytochemical evidence of nerve-muscle coculture has also been documented. Applications for this novel culture system include biocompatibility and skeletal muscle differentiation studies, understanding myopathies, neuromuscular disorders, and skeletal muscle tissue engineering.									6	0	0	5	0	6			1071-2690			WOS:000268300500010

In 2006 and 2008 injury rates were observed during a club youth soccer tournament that involved athletes aged 9-18 years playing three to four matches over two consecutive days, to determine if injury risk varied over the course of the event. The injury rate for day 1 was 7.91/1000 hours with a mean severity of 3.5 days missed versus a day 2 rate of 6.75 and severity of 2.3. The rate and severity for the first game in a day were 7.13 and 3.5 respectively compared to 7.9 and 2.5 for game 2. Further research is needed to determine if a high density match schedule increases injury risk for youth soccer players.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1353-8047			WOS:000268598900012	19652001

Results of PPR were extracted from herd records, Statistical comparison of results was performed by use of a mixed linear model and kappa analysis.Results-Of 571 cattle classified as pregnant by the PSPB ELISA in phase 1, 30 (5%) were nonpregnant by PPR. Mean +/- SE adjusted optical density (OD) of cattle classified pregnant by both tests was significantly higher (0.31 +/- 0.01), compared with the adjusted OD of cattle classified pregnant by the PSPB ELISA and nonpregnant by PPR (0.22 +/- 0.02). Of 255 cows classified pregnant by the PSPB ELISA in phase 2, 31 (12%) were nonpregnant by PPR. Mean +/- SE adjusted OD of cattle classified pregnant by both tests was significantly higher (0.26 +/- 0.01), compared with the adjusted OD of cattle classified pregnant by the PSPB ELISA and nonpregnant by PPR (0.21 +/- 0.01).

To prevent the occurrence of thrombosis, much effort has been focused on developing an anti-thrombogenic coating of synthetic vascular prostheses or artificial conduits with improved anti-thrombogenic properties. Because surface coatings may be unstable for long-term applications, a bulk material with anti-thrombogenic property is desirable for the fabrication of vascular grafts or conduits. To this end, we have chemically modified chitosan by phthalization to derive an antithrombogenic material for the fabrication of vascular grafts. The chemical structure of phthalized chitosan was characterized with infrared spectroscopy. The hydrophilicity was examined with contact angle measurement, and the molecular weight distribution was measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Protein adsorption, hemolysis, and platelet adhesion assays were used to confirm the enhanced anti-thrombogenic properties of this phthalized chitosan. Cytotoxicity and proliferation assays were performed to test its high biocompatibility. With its improved solubility and processibility, this phthalized chitosan was fabricated into selective permeable tubular constructs of varying sizes and morphology through a wet phase-inversion process. With improved anti-thrombogenic property, biocompatibility, and great processibility, phthalized chitosan has great potential as the material for the fabrication of small diameter vascular grafts.

Batsch] identified six tandem-arrayed DAM (dormancy-associated MADS-box) genes as candidates for regulating growth cessation and terminal bud formation. To narrow the list of candidate genes, an attempt was made to associate bud phenology with the seasonal and environmental patterns of expression of the candidates in wild-type trees. The expression of the six peach DAM genes at the EVG locus of peach was characterized throughout an annual growing cycle in the field, and under controlled conditions in response to a long day-short day photoperiod transition. DAM1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 were responsive to a reduction in photoperiod in controlled conditions and the direction of response correlated with the seasonal timing of expression in field-grown trees. DAM3 did not respond to photoperiod and may be regulated by chilling temperatures. The DAM genes in peach appear to have at least four distinct patterns of expression. DAM1, 2, and 4 are temporally associated with seasonal elongation cessation and bud formation and are the most likely candidates for control of the evg phenotype.									76	7	0	73	0	85			0022-0957			WOS:000269014600020	19553369

Characterization of Recycled Aged RAP Binders Containing Crumb Rubber Modifier Using Gel Permeation Chromatography								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				21	8			382	391		10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2009)21:8(382)			AUG 2009	2009	The recycling of hot-mix asphalt pavements containing a crumb rubber modifier (CRM) has been an area of interest since CRM was first used in asphalt paving materials over 40 years ago. Studies on the recycling of rubberized asphalt concrete materials have focused mainly on the mixture properties at the location of in-field paving. However, for the long-term performance characterizations, there is a need to investigate the aging properties of rubberized binders and the subsequent recycling properties of these aged rubberized binders. To address this issue, the previous research was conducted to identify performance properties of recycled aged CRM binders using Superpave binder test methods. The research results indicated that the recycled aged CRM binders can result in satisfactory binder performance meeting current Superpave binder requirements. This paper presents a limited study that uses gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to characterize the aging process of recycled aged CRM binders as a function of binder source and RAP binder percentage. In addition, performance properties of the binders at three aging states (i.e., original, RTFO residual, and RTFO+PAV residual) were correlated with the large molecular size (LMS) values from the GPC results. The results indicated that the compositional changes of recycled aged CRM binders are well reflected by the GPC parameter (i.e., LMS), and the performance properties from Superpave binder tests have good correlations with the corresponding LMS values. In addition, the empirical prediction models for long-term performance properties were developed using the GPC parameter and physical properties of the binders. The predicted values showed a high correlation with the performance properties of G(*)sin delta and stiffness of binders.									6	1	0	0	0	7			0899-1561			WOS:000268066200006

Effects of Compaction Temperature on Volumetric Properties of Rubberized Mixes Containing Warm-Mix Additives								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				21	8			409	415		10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2009)21:8(409)			AUG 2009	2009	The warm-mix asphalt (WMA) refers to technologies that allow a significant reduction of mixing and compaction temperatures of asphalt mixes through lowering the viscosity of asphalt binders. Several studies have been carried out evaluating the properties of WMA, and it is found that warm mix additives work in different ways either in reducing the viscosity of the binder or allowing better workability of the mix at lower temperatures. In terms of rubberized asphalt mixtures, they are generally produced and compacted at higher temperatures than conventional mixtures, based on the field experience. If the technologies of warm-mix asphalt are incorporated, it is expected to reduce the mixing and compaction temperatures of rubberized asphalt mixtures to those of conventional mixtures. This study was initiated to investigate the effects of compaction temperature on rubberized mixes containing the warm mix additives. For this, four Superpave mix designs for two asphalt binders and two aggregate sources were conducted to determine optimum asphalt contents. Warm rubberized mixes were produced using two of the available processes. A total of 192 specimens (4 mix types: control mix, rubberized mix, warm rubberized mix 1, and warm rubberized mix 2x2 aggregate sources x4 compaction temperatures: 97, 116, 135, and 154 degrees Cx6 repetitions) were fabricated using Superpave gyratory compactor. Volumetric properties of the specimens were evaluated. The results showed that the warm mix processes were effective to improve the volumetric properties of rubberized mixes at a certain range of compaction temperatures.									15	1	0	0	1	16			0899-1561			WOS:000268066200009		
J	Maie, Takashi; Schoenfuss, Heiko L.; Blob, Richard W.								Jaw Lever Analysis of Hawaiian Gobioid Stream Fishes: A Simulation Study of Morphological Diversity and Functional Performance								JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY				270	8			976	983		10.1002/jmor.10737			AUG 2009	2009	Differences in feeding behavior and performance among the five native Hawaiian gobioid stream fishes (Sicyopterus stimpsoni, Lentipes concolor, Awaous guamensis, Stenogobius hawaiiensis, and Eleotris sandwicensis) have been proposed based on the skeletal anatomy of their jaws and dietary specialization. However, performance of the feeding apparatus likely depends on the proportions and configurations of the jaw muscles and the arrangement of the jaw skeleton. We used a published mathematical model of muscle function to evaluate potential differences in jaw closing performance and their correlations with morphology among these species. For example, high output force calculated for the adductor mandibulae muscles (A2 and A3) of both A. guamensis and E. sandwicensis matched expectations based on the morphology of these species because these muscles are larger than in the other species. In contrast, Stenogobius hawaiiensis exhibited an alternative morphological strategy for achieving high relative output forces of both A2 and A3, in which the placement and configuration of the muscles conveyed high mechanical advantage despite only moderate cross-sectional areas. These differing anatomical pathways to similar functional performance suggest a pattern of many-to-one mapping of morphology to performance. In addition, a functional differentiation between A2 and A3 was evident for all species, in which A2 was better suited for producing forceful jaw closing and A3 for rapid jaw closing. Thus, the diversity of feeding performance of Hawaiian stream gobies seems to reflect a maintenance of functional breadth through the retention of some primitive traits in combination with novel functional capacities in several species.

In the stage of decryption, the ciphered image can be decrypted by wavefront reconstruction, inverse Fresnel diffraction, and real amplitude normalization. This approach can successfully solve the problem of key management and dispatch, resulting in increased security strength. The feasibility of the proposed cryptosystem and its robustness against some types of attack are verified and analyzed by computer simulations.									15	2	0	0	0	16			1464-4258			WOS:000268692400019

The productivity and yield parameters at three temperatures, 14, 21, and 28A degrees C, demonstrated growth-coupled synthesis for lipid-free biomass growth and lipid accumulation. For this system, the maximum specific growth rate and theoretical maximum biomass yield based on logistic growth kinetics were used to determine an activation energy of the growth process, E (g), of 36.5 kJ mol(-1). At 14, 21, and 28A degrees C, peak lipid yield occurred after culturing for 7, 4, and 3 days, respectively, with peak lipid yields of 8.14, 12.8, and 6.69 g lipid 100 g(-1) glucose. At these peak yields, the maximum lipid-free biomass productivity was achieved at the colder 14A degrees C temperature as well as an increased concentration of EPA-10.9 wt%. Despite these enhancements, the maximum relative lipid production (P (R(FA/B))) was achieved at 21A degrees C-19.1%.									6	1	0	5	0	7			0003-021X			WOS:000268250400010

Using data mining and simulation techniques, we develop sequencing schemes for patients, in order to optimize a combination of performance measures used at the clinic. We utilize association rule mining (ARM) to build a model for predicting patient no-shows; and then use a set covering optimization method to derive three manageable sets of rules for patient sequencing. Simulation is used to determine the optimal number of patients and to evaluate the models. The ARM technique presented here results in significant improvements over models that do not employ rules, supporting the conjecture that, when dealing with noisy data such as in an outpatient clinic, extracting partial patterns, as is done by ARM, can be of significant value for simulation modelling.

Artificial Neural Network Approach to Estimating Stiffness Behavior of Rubberized Asphalt Concrete Containing Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement								JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE				135	8			580	589		10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000014			AUG 2009	2009	Accurately predicting the stiffness of asphalt pavements is difficult due to the complex behavior of materials under various loading, pavement structure, and environmental conditions. This study explores the utilization of the artificial neural network (ANN) in predicting the stiffness behavior of rubberized asphalt concrete mixtures with reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). A total of 296 asphalt mixture beams were constructed from two different rubber types (ambient and cryogenic), two different RAP sources, and four rubber contents (0, 5, 10, and 15%). All samples were tested at two different testing temperatures of 5 and 20 degrees C. The regression statistical method was used to predict the stiffness behavior of these mixtures via the 7 input variables covering the material engineering properties of the asphalt beams. In addition, the data were organized into 5 independent variables and one dependent variable (the stiffness values of the modified mixture beams) in ANN models. Results showed the ANN techniques to be more effective in predicting the fatigue life of the modified mixture than traditional regression-based prediction models.									15	1	0	1	2	16			0733-947X			WOS:000268067100010

Currently, the modeling schemes are based on continuum mechanics approaches. A main consideration in the nanomanipulation process is the fact that surface attraction forces are greater than gravitational forces at the nanoscale. In other words, surface area properties dominate volume properties. Especially at the nanoscale (i.e. the manipulation of fine nanoparticles with size of about 5 nm) the physical phenomena have not been completely understood. Along this line of reasoning, the aim of this paper is to conduct an atomistic investigation of physical interaction analysis of particle substrate system for manipulation and positioning purposes. In the present paper, 2D molecular dynamics have been conducted to simulate metallic nanoparticle behavior during the pushing process. Dependency of the aforementioned behavior on size, matter, temperature, etc. is investigated.									10	0	0	1	0	10			0217-9849			WOS:000269592800011

Topological character of hydrodynamic screening in suspensions of hard spheres: An example of universal phenomenon								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				388	15-16			3024	3062		10.1016/j.physa.2009.04.010			AUG 1 2009	2009	Although in the case of polymer solutions the existence of hydrodynamic screening was theoretically established some time ago, use of the same methods for suspensions of hard spheres thus far have failed to produce similar results. In this work we reconsider this problem. Using superposition of topological and London-style qualitative arguments we prove the existence of screening in hard sphere suspensions. Even though some of these arguments were employed initially for treatments of superconductivity and superfluidity, we find analogs of these phenomena in non-traditional settings such as in colloidal suspensions, turbulence, magnetohydrodynamics, etc. In particular, in suspensions, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic screening is an exact analog of Meissner effect in superconductors. The extent of screening depends on the volume fraction of hard spheres. The zero volume fraction limit corresponds to the normal state. The case of finite volume fractions-to the mixed state typical for superconductors of the second kind with such a state becoming fully "superconducting" at the critical volume fraction phi* for which the (zero frequency) relative viscosity eta(relative) diverges. Brady and, independently, Bicerano et al using scaling-type arguments predicted that for phi close to phi* the viscosity eta(relative) behaves as C(1 - phi/phi*)(-2) with C being some constant. Their prediction is well supported by experimental data. In this work we explain such a behavior of viscosity in terms of a topological-type transition which, mathematically can be made isomorphic to the more familiar Bose-Einstein condensation transition. Because of this, the results and methods of this work are not limited to suspensions. In the concluding section we describe other applications ranging from turbulence and magnetohydrodynamics to high temperature superconductors and QCD, etc. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Rev. B 40, 546 (1989)], we develop the perturbation theory for the Bose-Hubbard model and apply it to calculate the effects of a degenerate gas of spin-polarized fermions interacting by contact interactions with the constituent bosons. For the single-band Bose-Hubbard model, we find that the net effect of the screening of the boson on-site interaction by the fermions is to suppress the Mott-insulating lobes in the Bose-Hubbard phase diagram. For the more general multiband model, we find that, in addition to the fermion screening effects, the virtual excitations of the bosons to the higher Bloch bands, coupled with the contact interactions with the fermions, result in an effective increase (decrease) of the boson on-site repulsion (hopping parameter). If the higher-band renormalization of the boson parameters is dominant over the fermion screening of the interaction, the Mott-insulating lobes in the Bose-Hubbard phase diagram are enhanced for either sign of the Bose-Fermi interactions, consistent with the recent experiments.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1098-0121			WOS:000269638500068

Previous research has shown that head motions can provide effective information about depth (Bingham, & Pagano, 1998; Pagano & Bingham, 1998). In three experiments, a method for improving depth perception was investigated, where participants viewed remote targets with a moving camera. The camera was mounted on a teleoperated robotic arm that oscillated toward and away from white squares against black space, producing expansion and contraction of targets on a video monitor. Participants viewed this expansion and contraction and then reported the distance between the remote camera and the targets. Under different experimental conditions, motions of the remote camera arm were coupled with the participants' head movements, were controlled by a joystick, or followed a set of preprogrammed oscillatory motions. Under each of these conditions, participants' distance judgments varied semantically with actual target distances. In addition, the third experiment demonstrated that using familiar objects and providing feedback could be a successful method of training. This was also the case when applied to a condition where distance feedback was not provided and unfamiliar targets were used. The results indicate that the use of radial outflow produced by active or passive front-to-back camera motions and training with familiar objects may be effective strategies for improving depth perception in teleoperation.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1054-7460			WOS:000270982700006

SOX increased directors' workload and risk (reducing the supply), and increased demand by mandating that firms have more outside directors. We find both broad-based changes and cross-sectional changes (by firm size). Board committees meet more often post-SOX and Director and Officer (D&O) insurance premiums have doubled. Directors post-SOX are more likely to be lawyers/consultants, financial experts, and retired executives, and less likely to be current executives. Post-SOX boards are larger and more independent. Finally, we find significant increases in director pay and overall director costs, particularly among smaller firms.									95	0	0	0	1	96			0893-9454			WOS:000268116300011

Soil-Root Interactions Controlling Upward Plutonium Transport in Variably Saturated Soils								VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL				8	3			574	585		10.2136/vzj2008.0159			AUG 2009	2009	Due to its high toxicity and a long half-life, processes that may enhance Pu mobility in the environment and possible transport and exposure pathways need to be better understood and identified. The results of long-term Pu field lysimeter experiments at the Savannah River Site showed anomalous distributions below the source, with significant upward migration above the source. A previously developed reactive transport model with an initial application of a steady downward velocity successfully simulated the below-source distribution of the lysimeter data. Development and coupling of a transient flow model with root water uptake to the reactive transport model yielded a downward distribution fit almost identical to that from the steady-state flow application. The model predicted very little upward migration, however. Additional evaluations done by testing several soil hydraulic-and chemistry-related mechanisms that may enhance upward migration yielded no improvement. We developed an extension of the reactive transport model to include and test a new mechanism: root Pu uptake and xylem transport. The extended model produced simulations that capture the general behavior of the upward migration with no effect on the below-source fit. These results, with the support of the additional finding that elevated Pu concentrations in the lysimeter surface sediment originated from the source used in the experiments, indicated that Pu root uptake and transport is a valid explanation for the observed upward migration and may play an important role in near-surface Pu transport. Further research is needed to identify the uptake mechanisms and Pu behavior within plant systems, with special attention directed to the effect of Pu complexation with different chelating agents in soil and plants (siderophores, phytosiderophores, and others).									7	0	0	4	0	7			1539-1663			WOS:000268871900004		
J	Ilmonen, Jari; Adler, Peter H.; Malmqvist, Bjorn; Cywinska, Alina								The Simulium vernum group (Diptera: Simuliidae) in Europe: multiple character sets for assessing species status								ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				156	4			847	863		10.1111/j.1096-3642.2009.00500.x			AUG 2009	2009	The value of using characters from multiple sources - chromosomes, ecology, gene sequences, and morphology - to evaluate the species status of closely related black flies is demonstrated for three European members of the Simulium vernum group: Simulium crenobium (Knoz, 1961), Simulium juxtacrenobium Bass & Brockhouse, 1990, and Simulium vernum s.s. Macquart, 1826. Simulium juxtacrenobium is a chromosomally, molecularly, and morphologically distinct species that diverged from S. crenobium and S. vernum s.s. about 2 Mya. It is specialized for intermittent streams, is univoltine, and is recorded for the first time from northern Europe, based on collections from Finland and Sweden, representing a range extension of about 1800 km. In contrast, S. crenobium, although confirmed as a distinct species, differs from S. vernum s.s. by only a few larval and chromosomal characters, and by a breeding habitat restricted to mountain spring brooks. Whereas all four character sets independently support the specific distinctness of S. juxtacrenobium and S. vernum s.s., multiple character sets are required to establish the specific validity of S. crenobium.

PPMA was used as a reaction medium to replace PPA due to the higher monomer solubility. High molecular weight polymer was achieved via optimization of the monomer/solvent ratio, polymerization temperature, and polymerization time. The resulting polymer showed good thermal and chemical stability. Several different phosphoric acid doping membrane preparation processes were investigated. Conventional DMAc solvent casting and direct-casting of the PBI/PPMA solution did not produce sufficiently strong membranes to fabricate into MEAs. A modified PPA process was developed that produced improved membranes. The mechanical properties of these membranes were low compared to other PBI membranes; however, they were sufficiently strong to fabricate into membrane electrode assemblies and tested in single cell fuel cells under various conditions. The polymer dissolved in phosphoric acid at temperatures above 140 degrees C, which limited the operation of fuel cells below 140 degrees C. The maximum power densities of fuel cells operated with these membranes were similar to meta-PBI membranes prepared by the conventional casting process and lower than para-PBI membranes prepared by the PPA process.

J	Li, Xianfeng; Latour, Robert A.								A systematic procedure to build a relaxed dense-phase atomistic representation of a complex amorphous polymer using a coarse-grained modeling approach								POLYMER				50	16			4139	4149		10.1016/j.polymer.2009.06.055			JUL 31 2009	2009	A systematic procedure has been developed to construct a relaxed dense-phase atomistic structure of a complex amorphous polymer. The numerical procedure consists of (1) coarse graining the atomistic model of the polymer into a mesoscopic model based on an iterative algorithm for potential inversion from distribution functions of the atomistic model, (2) relaxation of the coarse-grained chain using a molecular dynamics scheme, and (3) recovery of the atomistic structure by reverse mapping based on the superposition of atomistic counterparts on the corresponding coarse-grained coordinates. These methods are demonstrated by their application to construct a relaxed, dense-phase model of poly(DTB succinate), which is an amorphous tyrosine-derived biodegradable polymer that is being developed for biomedical applications. Both static and dynamic properties from the coarse-grained and atomistic simulations are analyzed and compared. The coarse-grained model, which contains the essential features of the DTB succinate structure, successfully described both local and global structural properties of the atomistic chain. The effective speedup compared to the corresponding atomistic simulation is substantially above 10(2), thus enabling simulation times to reach well into the characteristic experimental regime. The computational approach for reversibly bridging between coarse-grained and atomistic models provides an efficient method to produce relaxed dense-phase all-atom molecular models of complex amorphous polymers that can subsequently be used to study and predict the atomistic-level behavior of the polymer under different environmental conditions in order to optimally design polymers for targeted applications.

As developers seek unprotected, amenity-rich lands, conservation planners require methods to recognize risk and prioritize actions. Most development models and processes are incremental, accumulating change over time and space. By contrast, large-scale amenity development can be rapid and extensive, necessitating "rapid assessment" techniques. For undeveloped lakeshores in the Northern Appalachian/Acadian ecoregion (330000kml), we developed a geospatial screening process based on four factors: (1) urban area proximity, (2) attractiveness of amenity (size), (3) regulatory gaps in protection, and (4) likelihood that owners will develop. To assess conversion risk, we added developable zones to the 10783 large lakes and ponds in the ecoregion and assessed risk to these lands based on four factors at two distances from 15 major urban areas in the region. Thirty-eight of 387 landowners were classified most likely to convert their lands through development, and 11 of these accounted for 97.5% of the total high-risk habitat area (625-1118 km(2)). Nearly all of the at-risk land (94.6%) lay outside of currently settled areas and most (69.1%) under the purview of a single regulatory agency, the Land Use Regulatory Commission of Maine (LURC). Without rigorous planning by such agencies large-scale, highly dispersed, and rapid conversion of lightly settled, amenity-rich forestland threatens habitat degradation at multiple spatial scales, i.e., local ecosystems themselves (e.g., lakes), surrounding landscapes, and regions.

[ 2003, 2005] presented satellite and ground-based observations that indicated that the water vapor plume from the space shuttle's main engine rapidly expanded and moved quickly to the summer pole. Once there, the water vapor plume condensed into large noctilucent cloud displays. Here we present a hypothesis for the plume's rapid transport and anomalous horizontal diffusion. We argue that this system is two-dimensionally turbulent, which has the property of inverse cascade. This energy transport to large scales explains the poleward transport, and the well-known system properties explain the anomalous diffusion. Additionally, we apply these results to the aftermath of the 1908 Great Siberian Impact Event, when extremely bright night skies were observed in Great Britain during the days following the impact. The impacting object must have contained considerable ice and thus, was very likely a comet. Citation: Kelley, M. C., C. E. Seyler, and M. F.

Numerical methods and evidence for a vigorous streaming instability								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				397	1			24	43		10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14606.x			JUL 21 2009	2009	In this paper, we have used the riemann code for computational astrophysics to study the interaction of a realistic distribution of dust grains with gas at specific radial locations in a vertically stratified protostellar accretion disc. The disc was modelled to have the density and temperature of a minimum mass solar nebula, and shearing box simulations at radii of 0.3 and 10 au are reported here. The disc was driven to a fully developed turbulence via the magnetorotational instability (MRI). The simulations span three gas scaleheights about the disc's midplane. We find that the inclusion of standard dust-to-gas ratios does not have any significant effect on the MRI even when the dust sediments to the midplane of the accretion disc. The density distribution of the dust of all sizes reached a Gaussian profile within two scaleheights of the disc's midplane. The vertical scaleheights of these Gaussian profiles are shown to be proportional to the reciprocal of the square root of the dust radius when large spherical dust grains are considered. This result is consistent with theoretical expectation.The largest two families of dust in one of our simulations show a strong tendency to settle to the midplane of the accretion disc. The large dust tends to organize itself into elongated clumps of high density. The dynamics of these clumps is shown to be consistent with a streaming instability. The streaming instability is seen to be very vigorous and persistent once it forms. Each stream of high-density dust displays a reduced rms velocity dispersion. The velocity directions within the streams are also aligned relative to the mean shear, providing further evidence that we are witnessing a streaming instability. The densest clumpings of large dust are shown to form where the streams intersect.We have also shown that the mean free path and collision time for dust that participates in the streaming instability are reduced by almost two orders of magnitude relative to the average mean free paths and collision times. The rms velocities between the grains also need to fall below a minimum threshold in order for the grains to stick and we show that a small amount of the large dust in our 10 au simulation should have a propensity for grain coalescence. The results of our simulations are likely to be useful for those who model spectral energy distributions of protostellar discs and also for those who model dust coagulation and growth.									21	0	0	0	0	21			0035-8711			WOS:000268923100026

We report about ultra-high vacuum kinetics experiments on metallic, semiconducting, and mixed CNTs. A weak and probe molecule specific SAR is present for adsorption inside the CNTs but not for the population of external sites.

A ranking is locally minimal if reducing the rank of any single vertex produces a non-ranking. A ranking is globally minimal if reducing the ranks of any set of vertices produces a non-ranking. A ranking is greedy if, for some ordering of the vertices, it is the ranking produced by assigning ranks in that order, always selecting the smallest possible rank. We will show that these three notions are equivalent. If a ranking satisfies one property it satisfies all three. As a consequence of this and known results on arank numbers of paths we improve known upper bounds for on-line ranking of paths and cycles. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Singh, Rajendra								Why silicon is and will remain the dominant photovoltaic material								JOURNAL OF NANOPHOTONICS				3						032503	10.1117/1.3196882			JUL 16 2009	2009	Rising demands of energy in emerging economies, coupled with the green house gas emissions related problems around the globe have provided a unique opportunity of exploiting the advantages offered by photovoltaic (PV) systems for green energy electricity generation. Similar to cell phones, power generated by PV systems can reach over two billion people worldwide who have no access to clean energy. Only silicon based PV devices meet the low-cost manufacturing criterion of clean energy conversion (abundance of raw material and no environmental health and safety issues). The use of larger size glass substrates and manufacturing techniques similar to the ones used by the liquid crystal display industry and the large scale manufacturing of amorphous silicon thin films based modules (similar to GW per year manufacturing at a single location) can lead to installed PV system cost of $3/Wp. This will open a huge market for grid connected PV systems and related markets. With further research and development, this approach can provide $2/Wp installed PV system costs in the next few years. At this cost level, PV electricity generation is competitive with any other technology, and PV power generation can be a dominant electricity generation technology in the 21st century.									26	1	1	2	0	26			1934-2608			WOS:000272414600001

As the next step, we have applied polyaniline electrodes to the monitoring the activity macromolecular ions during DNA hybridization. Single-strand oligonucleotide (ssODN) probes were immobilized using a nucleophilic substitution reaction of the thiolated ssODN molecules with polyaniline. The anionic phosphate groups of the probe molecules also interacted with the cationic-doped polyaniline surface. Three useful findings were observed with the potentiometric experiments. First, the binding of the complimentary target molecules with the immobilized probes revealed a substantial potential change. Further, potential change was observed neither with the non-complimentary targets nor with the samples with a mutation in the sequence. The last two experiments were important for the future evaluation of the impact of medium and potential interfering compounds: anionic groups and hydrogen bonding groups in the non-complimentary samples did not cause any interactions.

After removal of proteins and purification by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column, polysaccharicles of longan fruit pericarp (PLFP) were subjected to structural identification. Gas chromatography analysis indicated PLFP comprised of L-arabinofuranose (32.8%), D-glucopyranose (17.6%), D-galactopyranose (33.7%) and D-galacturonic acid (15.9%). The glycosidic linkages were determined by methylation analysis and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results showed that the backbone consisted of -> 5)-L-Araf-(1 ->, -> 6)-D-GIcp-(1 ->, -> 3)-D-Galp-(1 ->, -> 3)-D-GalpA-(1 -> and -> 6)-D-Galp-(1 -> with a molar proportion of 2:1:1:1:1. The infrared spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra further confirmed that the configuration of L-arabinofuranose was of alpha-form, while D-glucopyranose, D-galactopyranose and D-galacturonic acid were of beta-form. The molecular weight of PLFP was measured to be 420 kDa by gel permeation chromatography. By determination of the anti-glycated activity, PLFP showed a good potential in inhibiting the glycation reaction in vitro. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first step, commercially available regenerated cellulose membranes were functionalized with initiator. In the second step, initiator-functionalized membranes were modified by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). Initiator grafting density and molecular weight of poly(DMAEMA) chains were varied independently to yield surface-modified, macroporous, weak anion-exchange membranes with exceptionally high protein binding capacities (dynamic capacities up to 130 mg/mL for bovine serum albumin) at high linear flow velocities (>350 cm/h) and low transmembrane pressure drop (<3 bar). Initiator grafting density was increased by increasing the concentration of initiator precursor in solution during the membrane initiator-functionalization reaction. Average molecular weight of poly(DMAEMA) chains was increased by increasing polymerization time at constant initiator grafting density. Dynamic protein binding capacities were found to be independent of the linear flow velocity. Dynamic capacities decreased in regular fashion with increasing ionic strength in the loading buffer, but maintained relatively high values (>35 mg/mL) even at 100 mM ionic strength. Separation performance of the newly designed membranes was evaluated by fractionating a mixture of bovine serum albumin and hemoglobin. The purities of recovered proteins were high (>97%), and the recoveries also were high (>98%). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									49	2	0	10	0	49			0376-7388			WOS:000267025500024

INFRAGENERIC TAXONOMY OF ASTROPHYTUM (CACTACEAE), WITH REMARKS ON THE STATUS OF DIGITOSTIGMA								Journal of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas				3	1			251	256					JUL 15 2009	2009	In a monograph of the genus Astrophytum, Megata (1944) proposed tow infrageneric sections-Astrophytum sect. Austrastrophytum and A. sect. Septentriastrophytum. Astrophytum sect. Austrastrophytum which contains the type of the genus is in violation of art 22.2 of the ICBN which requires that a name of a subdivison of a genus that includes the type of that genus repeat as its epithet the generic name unaltered. Backeberg (1950) proposed two subgenera Astrophytum subsg. Euastrophytum and A. subg. Neoastrophytum, which essentially corresponded to Megata's sections. However, Backeberg's A. subsg. Euastrophytum, containing the type species of the genus, violated Art. 22.2 and Art. 21.3 of the international code.In 1961, Backeberg itself Astrophytum subg. Neoastrophytum in his treatment of the genus, but proposed Astrophytum subg. Astrophytum to replace A. subg. Euastrophytum. Therefore, Backeberg's (1961) subgeneric names are valid, and have received wide ciruclation, and should be accepted; Megata's two sections should be suppressed. On the basis of comparative flower and fruit morphology, the species Digitostigma velazeo & Nevarez appears to have evolved within the genus Astrophytum, and shows a closer relationship to A. subg Neoastrophytum than to A. subg. Astrophytum. However, because of its aherrant charcteristics (tuberculate habit, dimorphic areoles, large. fusiform root, and nearly circular seeds with an acute basal cleft and verrucose testa), caput-medusae's placement in Astrophytum subgenus stigmatodactylus D. Hunt appears justified, through provisional, because its status as an ancient generic hybrid remains a possibility. Molecular genetic studies are needed to further clarify the evolutionary relationships of A. caput-medusae.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1934-5259			BCI:BCI200900505989

Also, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate possible uncertainty in the fraction of cells that divide, differentiate, and die at each cell cycle.Conclusion: We demonstrate that uniformly low-level neural progenitor cell death, as concluded in previous models, is incompatible with normal mouse cortical development. Levels of neural progenitor cell death up to and exceeding 50% are compatible with normal cortical development and may operate to prevent forebrain overgrowth as observed following cell death attenuation, as occurs in caspase 3-null mutant mice.									10	1	0	10	0	11			1749-8104			WOS:000269235700003	19602274

In combination with a low accretion rate estimated from Br gamma, it may represent a gapped, but otherwise primordial or "pre-transitional" disk. We test this hypothesis with Hubble Space Telescope coronagraphic imagery, FUV spectroscopy and imagery and archival X-ray data, and spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling constrained by the observed system inclination, disk outer radius, and outer disk radial surface brightness (SB) profile using the Whitney Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer Code. The essentially face-on (i less than or similar to 20 degrees) disk is detected in scattered light from 0 ''.4 to 1 ''.15 (56-160 AU), with a steep (r(-9.6)) radial SB profile from 0.'' 6 to 0.'' 93. Fitting the SB data requires a concave upward or anti-flared outer disk, indicating substantial dust grain growth and settling by 8 +/- 4 Myr. The warm dust component is significantly variable in near to mid-IR excess and in temperature. At its warmest, it appears confined to a narrow belt from 0.08 to 0.2 AU. The steep SED for this dust component is consistent with grains with a <= 2.5 mu m. For cosmic carbon to silicate dust composition, conspicuous 10 mu m silicate emission would be expected and is not observed. This may indicate an elevated carbon to silicate ratio for the warm dust, which is not required to fit the outer disk. At its coolest, the warm dust can be fit with a disk from 0.14 to 0.31 AU, but with a higher inclination than either the outer disk or the gaseous disk, providing confirmation of the high inclination inferred from mid-IR interferometry. In tandem, the compositional and inclination difference between the warm dust and the outer dust disk suggests that the warm dust may be of second-generation origin, rather than a remnant of a primordial disk component. With its near face-on inclination, SAO 206462's disk is a prime location for planet searches.									41	0	0	0	0	41			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000267401500082

Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that is well known for its ability to target various nucleic acid structures. Here it is reported that neomycin is capable of binding tightly to a single-stranded oligonucleotide (A(30)) with a Kd in the micromolar range. CD melting experiments support complex formation and indicate a melting temperature of 47 degrees C. The poly(A) duplex, which melts at 44 degrees C (pH 5.5), was observed to melt at 61 degrees C in the presence of neomycin, suggesting a strong stabilization of the duplex by the neomycin.

J	Chong, Juang-Horng								Comparative Efficacy of Neonicotinoids and Selected Insecticides in Suppressing Tunneling Activity of Mole Crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae) in Turfgrass								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN ENTOMOLOGY				26	3			135	146					JUL 2009	2009	Long-term efficacy of neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam), acephate, bifenthrin, and fipronil in suppressing the tunneling activity of mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae) was investigated in athletic fields in Florence, SC from June to December 2008 and 2009. The proportions of tawny mole cricket (Scapteriscus vicious Scudder) and southern mole cricket (Scapteriscus borellii Giglio-Tos) were 87% and 13% in 2008 and 78% and 22% in 2009, respectively. Plots treated with insecticides had lower ratings of tunneling damage than the untreated plots, which had the most severe damage in October of 2008 and 2009. Fipronil was the most effective insecticide, which reduced tunneling activity from 4.0 +/- 0.9 to 0.8 +/- 0.3 and 5.3 +/- 0.3 to 1.1 +/- 0.1 within two weeks after treatment (WAT) in 2008 and 2009, respectively, and maintained effective residual control until December. Neonicotinoids (all active ingredients and formulations), acephate, and bifenthrin did not perform as well as fipronil, but contributed to lowering the damage in the treated plots. The long-term efficacy was not significantly different among products containing clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam. The combination of clothianidin and bifenthrin (Aloft (TM)) and imidacloprid and bifenthrin (Allectus (R)) improved the suppression of tunneling activity only in the first two WAT when compared to products containing only clothianidin (Arena (TM)) or imidacloprid (Merit (R)). The efficacy of Aloft and Allectus against mole crickets was not different between broadcast and granular formulations on most sampling dates. This study demonstrated that products containing fipronil provided turf managers with long-term suppression of mole cricket tunneling damage, while products containing acephate, bifenthrin, and neonicotinoids would only provide suppression for 20 weeks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1523-5475			WOS:000207881500002

We develop a theory of factor-market rivalry to shed light on atypical rivals and competitive blind spots. Focusing on resource versatility and mobility, the theory introduces dynamic constructs-resource discontinuities, leapfrogging, and captivity-and explains their role in triggering cascading effects. To illustrate the theory's conceptual utility, we apply the concepts of factor-market rivalry to mutual forbearance in multimarket competition.									36	0	0	0	0	36			0363-7425	1930-3807		WOS:000267356000004

The administrator plays a key role in decision making within the park and recreation agency. The purpose of this research is to determine how chief administrative officers of local public recreation agencies perceive their role relating to the administration and delivery of public recreation services. Results indicate two independent yet related administrative roles. As administrative roles are better understood, administrators will be more aware of their behavior and subsequently better equipped to address the demands and expectations of operating a recreation system.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0095-3997			WOS:000267187600004		
J	Wilson, Megan P.; Espinoza, Nora R.; Shah, Sagar R.; Blob, Richard W.								Mechanical Properties of the Hindlimb Bones of Bullfrogs and Cane Toads in Bending and Torsion								ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY				292	7			935	944		10.1002/ar.20929			JUL 2009	2009	When compared with most vertebrates, frogs use a novel style of jumping locomotion powered by the hindlimbs. Hindlimb bones of frogs must withstand the potentially erratic loads associated with such saltatory locomotion. To evaluate the load bearing capacity of anuran limb bones, we used three-point bending, torsion, and hardness tests to measure the mechanical properties of the femur and tibiofibula from adults of two species that use different jumping styles: explosively jumping bullfrogs (Rana (Lithobates) catesbeiana) and cyclically hopping cane toads (Bufo (Chaunus) marinus). Yield stress and strain values for R. catesbeiana and B. marinus hindlimb bones are within the range of values previously reported for other vertebrates. However, anuran hindlimb bones generally stand out as having higher yield stresses in bending than those of closely related, nonsaltatory salamanders, highlighting the importance of considering phylogenetic context in comparisons of bone functional capacity and adaptation. Stiffness values for both frog species tested were also high, which may facilitate efficient transmission of muscular forces while jumping. Elevated stiffness may also contribute to some discrepancies between determinations of bone properties via hardness versus bending tests. In comparisons between species, B. marinus bones showed significantly higher bending yield stresses than R. catesbeiana, whereas R. catesbeiana bones showed significantly higher torsional yield stresses than B. marinus. These differences may correlate with differences in jumping style and limb anatomy between ranid and bufonid frogs, suggesting that evolutionary changes in bone mechanical properties may help to accommodate new functional demands that emerge in lineages.

Impacts of Altered Light Spectral Quality on Warm-Season Turfgrass Growth under Greenhouse Conditions								CROP SCIENCE				49	4			1444	1453		10.2135/cropsci2008.07.0412			JUL-AUG 2009	2009	Warm-season turfgrass quality declines under shade due to reduced photosynthesis, increased disease pressure, reduced carbohydrate production, tree root competition, and reduced lateral stem growth. Another factor limiting turfgrass growth and development under tree shade is variable qualities of light filtered by trees. However, effects of various filtered wavelengths on turfgrass performance are lacking and deserve research. Therefore, a greenhouse project investigated the physiological and morphological responses of 'Diamond' zoysiagrass [Zoysia matrella (L.) Merr.], 'Sea Isle 2000' seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum Swartz.), and 'Tifway' and 'Celebration' bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy] to variable light spectral qualities. Light treatments included a control without any shade cloths and four different color shade cloths filtering wavelengths 560 to 720 nm (blue shade cloth), 360 to 520 nm (yellow shade cloth), 360 to 560 nm (red shade cloth), and 360 to 720 nm (black shade cloth). The percent light reduction for each cloth was about 65% relative to the control. Data collected included visual turfgrass quality (TQ), relative clipping yield, relative chlorophyll concentration, relative shoot width, relative root biomass, relative root length density, relative specific root length, and root and shoot total nonstructural carbohydrates. Diamond was the least affected turfgrass by the color shade cloths, while Celebration and Sea Isle 2000 performed similarly. Tifway was the most sensitive turfgrass with the lowest TQ under color shade cloths. Yellow and red shades were least detrimental, while black shade most negatively inhibited parameters measured, followed by blue shade. This study implies different types of shade significantly impact the TQ of warm-season turfgrasses.									13	0	0	13	0	13			0011-183X			WOS:000268109800036

An affordance-based approach to architectural theory, design, and practice								DESIGN STUDIES				30	4			393	414		10.1016/j.destud.2009.01.002			JUL 2009	2009	The idea of affordance, borrowed from perceptual psychology, is applied to the domain of architecture. As to architectural theory, affordances can be used as a conceptual framework to understand the relationship between environments and occupants, especially with respect to form and function. Regarding architectural design, the concept of affordance allows for a common theoretical basis to improve the design process. Concerning architectural practice, affordances can be used as a tool to explore the connection between the intentions of the design with how the artifact is actually used, leading to archived knowledge, and the potential for avoiding common design failures.

A spatially non-uniform electric field is induced ill the converging-diverging section, which gives rise to a direct current dielectrophoretic (DEP) force in addition to the electrostatic force acting on the charged particle. As a sequence, the symmetry of the particle velocity and trajectory with respect to the throat is broken. We demonstrate that the predicted particle trajectory shifts due to DEP show quantitative agreements with the existing experimental data. Although converging-diverging microchannels can be used for super fast electrophoresis due to the enhancement of the local electric field, it is shown that large particles may be blocked due to the induced DEP force, which thus must be taken into account in the study of electrophoresis in microfluidic devices where non-uniform electric fields are present.									46	1	0	16	0	46			0173-0835			WOS:000269041500012	19639572	
J	Welter, B. H.; Temesvari, L. A.								Overexpression of a Mutant Form of EhRabA, a Unique Rab GTPase of Entamoeba histolytica, Alters Endoplasmic Reticulum Morphology and Localization of the Gal/GalNAc Adherence Lectin								EUKARYOTIC CELL				8	7			1014	1026		10.1128/EC.00030-09			JUL 2009	2009	Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that causes amoebic dysentery and liver abscess. Vesicle trafficking events, such as phagocytosis and delivery of plasma membrane proteins, have been implicated in pathogenicity. Rab GTPases are proteins whose primary function is to regulate vesicle trafficking; therefore, understanding the function of Rabs in this organism may provide insight into virulence. E. histolytica possesses a number of unique Rabs that exhibit limited homology to host Rabs. In this study we examined the function of one such Rab, EhRabA, by characterizing a mutant overexpressing a constitutively GTP-bound version of the protein. Overexpression of mutant EhRabA resulted in decreased adhesion to and phagocytosis of human red blood cells and in the appearance of large tubular organelles that could be stained with endoplasmic reticulum ( ER)-specific but not Golgi complex-specific antibodies. Consistent with the adhesion defect, two subunits of a cell surface adhesin, the galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine lectin, were mislocalized to the novel organelle. A cysteine protease, EhCP2, was also localized to the ER-like compartment in the mutant; however, the localization of two additional cell surface proteins, Igl and SREHP, remained unchanged in the mutant. The phenotype of the mutant could be recapitulated by treatment with brefeldin A, a cellular toxin that disrupts ER-to-Golgi apparatus vesicle traffic. This suggests that EhRabA influences vesicle trafficking pathways that are also sensitive to brefeldin A. Together, the data indicate that EhRabA directly or indirectly influences the morphology of secretory organelles and regulates trafficking of a subset of secretory proteins in E. histolytica.									19	0	0	16	0	19			1535-9778			WOS:000268760600009	19377040

The mono-addition resulted in two penta-adduct isomers (8 and 9) in a 1:1 ratio. A second addition to each compound led to, in the case of 8, two hexa-adduct isomer products (10 and 11), whereas addition to 9 led to 11 and 12. Finally, reaction of 11 and the glycine afforded a third addition, giving rise to hepta-adduct isomers 13 and 14. Preparative TLC and column chromatography were used to separate and purify these compounds. The structures were assigned based on their molecular symmetries as analyzed by (1)H, (13)C, and 2D NMR spectra and MALDI-TOF MS. ((C) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It finds that juries systematically departed from presumptive sentences based on extralegal factors, Such age, sex, nativity and occupation. Older criminals and convicts with higher status preconviction occupations received longer sentences; women and ethnic minorities received shorter sentences. Unlike 20th-century courts, 19th-century courts did not impose longer sentences on black criminals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In-row Distance in Triploid Miniwatermelon Cultivars Affects Yield and Quality in Diverse Environments in the Southeastern United States								HORTTECHNOLOGY				19	3			538	545					JUL-SEP 2009	2009	The goals of these studies were to determine how miniwatermelon (Citrullus lanatus) cultivars differed and responded to plant in-row spacing in terms of percentage of marketable fruit and yields, and if plant spacing impacted internal fruit quality. Three genetically diverse triploid miniwatermelon cultivars (Mohican, Petite Perfection, and Xite) were selected. These cultivars were evaluated in field locations at northern Florida (Quincy), central South Carolina (Blackville), coastal South Carolina (Charleston), and eastern North Carolina (Kinston) at five within-row distances. Within-row distance included 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 inches. All plots were 15 ft long with row middles 9 ft apart. Fruit were categorized as marketable if they weighed between 3.1 and 9.0 lb per fruit. Within this range further categories were divided as follows: <= 3.0 lb (cull), 3.1 to 5.0 lb (small), 5.1 to 7.0 lb (average), 7.1 to 9.0 lb (large), and >= 9.1 lb (cull). There was a cultivar by location interaction, suggesting that the three cultivars responded differently at each of the four locations. 'Petite Perfection' was among the highest yielding at all locations except Quincy, where it was the lowest yielding cultivar. As with total yields, the percentage of marketable fruit was similar for some cultivars across locations. Cultivar Petite Perfection produced the highest percentage of marketable fruit at three of the four locations. The exception was the Quincy site where 'Xite' had the highest percentage of marketable fruit. Within-row plant distances and populations affected total marketable yield, both for fruit weight and number per plant, regardless of cultivar and location. As the plant population increased from eight plants per plot (21-inch in-row spacing) to 12 plants per plot (15-inch in-row spacing), total marketable miniwatermelon fruit yields increased in total fruit number as well as total weight. There was a cultivar by location interaction for the percentage of soluble solids and the rind thickness measurements, suggesting that some cultivars responded differently at each of the four locations.

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL				19	3			237	259		10.1111/j.1748-8583.2009.00097.x			JUL 2009	2009	Psychological contract breach has become a significant problem for many organisations in today's business environment because it fosters a belief within employees that the organisation does not support them. Accordingly, we examine whether organisations can diminish the negative impact of psychological contract breach on perceived organisational support (POS) by providing employees with mentors, supportive supervisors and role models. In Study 1, we found that mentor relationships moderated the relationship between psychological contract breach and POS six months later. In Study 2, we showed that mentor relationships and supervisor support reduced the negative impact of contract breach on POS. Contrary to expectations, employees who maintained relationships with role models reported lower levels of POS in response to psychological contract breach than those employees who reported that they did not have role models in their organisations. Implications for research and practice are discussed.									28	0	0	0	0	28			0954-5395			WOS:000208056500002

It is desirable to analyze the effect of topology unbalance and harmonic distortion acting simultaneously to assess their influence on elevated NEV. A multiphase harmonic load-flow algorithm for radial distribution systems is presented for NEV analysis. A transmission-line model is developed that includes the neutral branch such that the NEV is available directly. Harmonic interaction is introduced by using a model for a single-phase rectifier. A well-documented IEEE radial feeder is used to demonstrate the algorithm. Results from several tests on different combinations of linear and nonlinear loads are presented and discussed. These tests show that triplen harmonies can have more effect on elevated NEV than unbalance acting alone.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0885-8977	1937-4208		WOS:000267765100083

As for other gram-positive bacteria, many proteins secreted by L. monocytogenes are translocated across the bacterial membrane in an unfolded state to the compartment existing between the membrane and the cell wall. This compartment presents a challenging environment for protein folding due to its high density of negative charge, high concentrations of cations, and low pH. We recently identified PrsA2 as a gene product required for L. monocytogenes virulence. PrsA2 was identified based on its increased secretion by strains containing a mutationally activated form of prfA, the key regulator of L. monocytogenes virulence gene expression. The prsA2 gene product is one of at least two predicted peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases encoded by L. monocytogenes; these proteins function as posttranslocation protein chaperones and/or foldases. In this study, we demonstrate that PrsA2 plays a unique and important role in L. monocytogenes pathogenesis by promoting the activity and stability of at least two critical secreted virulence factors: listeriolysin O (LLO) and a broad-specificity phospholipase. Loss of PrsA2 activity severely attenuated virulence in mice and impaired bacterial cell-to-cell spread in host cells. In contrast, mutants lacking prsA1 resembled wild-type bacteria with respect to intracellular growth and cell-to-cell spread as well as virulence in mice. PrsA2 is thus distinct from PrsA1 in its unique requirement for the stability and full activity of L. monocytogenes-secreted factors that contribute to host infection.									35	1	0	34	0	35			0019-9567			WOS:000267227000003	19451247

Technology to support inspection training in the general aviation industry: Specification and design								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS				39	4	SI		608	620		10.1016/j.ergon.2008.09.002			JUL 2009	2009	Training has been identified as a principal intervention strategy to improve the quality and reliability of aircraft inspection and reducing errors. This paper explores the use of advanced technology for inspection training and reducing inspector errors within the general aviation industry. The research extended earlier work on computer-based inspection training, for the commercial aviation system into an inspection training system for the general aviation (GA) industry. In this article we describe the results of the research pursued over three years with the following specific objectives: (I) conduct task analyses of existing inspection operations at geographically dispersed GA locations, (2) develop and organize content to Support inspection training, (3) deliver a prototype training system and (4) disseminate the findings of the research to the GA community and aviation research community.Relevance to industry: Specifically designed for training aircraft maintenance technicians in inspection skills, the computer-based inspection training tool entitled GAITS - General Aviation Inspection Training System uses a multi-media presentational approach with interaction opportunities between the user and the computer. It is anticipated that the use of this tool will systematize and standardize the inspection training process in the general aviation industry. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC POLICY				28	4			265	280		10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2009.06.001			JUL-AUG 2009	2009	Accounting scandals and concerns about the quality of financial statements have led to many calls for improved audit committee effectiveness. Prior research indicates that audit committee independence is positively related to effective oversight of the financial reporting process. Unfortunately, prior research has not provided an answer as to how much independence on the audit committee is enough. This is an important unanswered question because while Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) currently requires all listed companies to maintain an audit committee that is 100% independent there has been much debate regarding easing the SOX requirements for smaller and foreign companies. In this paper we examine whether the regulatory requirements of a completely independent audit committee are necessary to obtain the monitoring benefits related to audit committee independence that have been documented in prior literature. Our results suggest that the benefits of audit committee independence are consistently achieved only when the audit committee is completely independent. These results provide support for the SOX requirement of 100% independent audit committees. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									25	0	0	0	0	25			0278-4254			WOS:000269423400001

The PMS technique is a well-established method to measure multiple elements of the Mueller scattering matrix. However, the inference of the scatterers' properties (e.g., the size distribution function and refractive index) from such measurements involves solving an ill-conditioned inverse problem. In this paper, a new inversion technique was demonstrated to infer particle properties from PMS measurements. The new technique formulated the inverse problem into a minimization problem, which is then solved by the simulated annealing technique. Both numerical and experimental investigation on the new inversion technique was presented in the paper. The results obtained demonstrated the robustness and reliability of the new algorithm, and supported its expanded applications in scientific and technological areas involving particulates/aerosols.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in mechanical, biochemical, and structural properties of demineralized dentin treated with or without chlorhexidine (CHX), a known MMP-inhibitor. After demineralizing dentin beams in EDTA or phosphoric acid (PA), the baseline modulus of elasticity (E) of each beam was measured by three-point flexure. Specimens were pretreated with water (control) or with 2% CHX (experimental) and then incubated in artificial saliva (AS) at 37 degrees C for 4 weeks. The E of each specimen was remeasured weekly and, the media was analyzed for solubilized dentin collagen at first and fourth week of incubation. Some specimens were processed for electron microscopy (TEM) immediately after demineralization and after 4 weeks of incubation. In EDTA and PA-demineralized specimens, the E of the control specimens fell (p < 0.05) after incubation in AS, whereas there were no changes in E of the CHX-pretreated specimens over time. More collagen was solubilized from PA-demineralized controls (p < 0.05) than from EDTA-demineralized matrices after I or 4 weeks. Less collagen (p < 0.05) was solubilized from CHX-pretreated specimens demineralized in EDTA compared with PA. TEM examination of control beams revealed that prolonged demineralization of dentin in 10% PA (12 h) did not denature the collagen fibrils. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Unlike traditional nonparametric efficiency estimators, the new estimator is both robust to data outliers and has a root-n convergence rate. We use this estimator to examine changes in the efficiency and productivity of U.S. banks between 1985 and 2004. We find that larger banks experienced larger efficiency and productivity gains than small banks, consistent with the presumption that recent changes in regulation and information technology have favored larger banks.									20	0	0	0	0	20			0735-0015			WOS:000269610800011

Automotive Thermostat Valve Configurations: Enhanced Warm-Up Performance								JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				131	4					044501	10.1115/1.3117183			JUL 2009	2009	The automotive cooling system has unrealized potential to improve internal combustion engine performance through enhanced coolant temperature control and reduced parasitic losses. Advanced automotive thermal management systems use controllable actuators (e.g., smart thermostat valve, variable speed water pump, and electric radiator fan) that must work in harmony to control engine temperature. One important area of cooling system operation is warm-up, during which fluid flow is regulated between the bypass and radiator loops. A fundamental question arises regarding the usefulness of the common thermostat valve. In this paper, four different thermostat configurations were analyzed, with accompanying linear and nonlinear control algorithms, to investigate warm-up behaviors and thermostat valve operations. The configurations considered include factory, two-way valve, three-way valve, and no valve. Representative expert. mental testing was conducted oil a steam-based thermal bench to examine the effectiveness of each valve configuration in the engine cooling system. The results clearly demonstrate that the three-way valve has the best performance as noted by the excellent lent warm-up time, temperature tracking, and cooling system power consumption.

Litter decomposition recycles nutrients and causes large fluxes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It is typically assumed that climate, litter quality and decomposer communities determine litter decay rates, yet few comparative studies have examined their relative contributions in tropical forests.2. We used a short-term litterbag experiment to quantify the effects of litter quality, placement and mesofaunal exclusion on decomposition in 23 tropical forests in 14 countries. Annual precipitation varied among sites (760-5797 mm). At each site, two standard substrates (Raphia farinifera and Laurus nobilis) were decomposed in fine- and coarse-mesh litterbags both above and below ground for approximately 1 year.3. Decomposition was rapid, with >95% mass loss within a year at most sites. Litter quality, placement and mesofaunal exclusion all independently affected decomposition, but the magnitude depended upon site. Both the average decomposition rate at each site and the ratio of above- to below-ground decay increased linearly with annual precipitation, explaining 60-65% of among-site variation. Excluding mesofauna had the largest impact on decomposition, reducing decomposition rates by half on average, but the magnitude of decrease was largely independent of climate. This suggests that the decomposer community might play an important role in explaining patterns of decomposition among sites. Which litter type decomposed fastest varied by site, but was not related to climate.4. Synthesis. A key goal of ecology is to identify general patterns across ecological communities, as well as relevant site-specific details to understand local dynamics. Our pan-tropical study shows that certain aspects of decomposition, including average decomposition rates and the ratio of above- to below-ground decomposition are highly correlated with a simple climatic index: mean annual precipitation. However, we found no relationship between precipitation and effects of mesofaunal exclusion or litter type, suggesting that site-specific details may also be required to understand how these factors affect decomposition at local scales.									85	1	0	87	4	91			0022-0477			WOS:000267071500021

In this study, Yb0.2In (y) Co4Sb12 (y = 0.0 to 0.2) samples have been prepared by a simple melting method and their thermoelectric properties have been investigated. The power factor is increased dramatically when increasing the In content, while the lattice thermal conductivity is lowered considerably, leading to a large increase of the ZT value.

Rietveld refinements indicate an increasing unit cell volume with increasing Sn content. It has also been found that intercalation of an additional transition-metal atom (Co, Ni) into the cubic void of Re(3)(Ge, As)(7) can significantly alter the Seebeck coefficient.					27th International Conference on Thermoelectrics27th International Conference on Thermoelectrics	AUG 03-07, 2008AUG 03-07, 2008	Int Thermoelect SocInt Thermoelect Soc	Univ Oregon, Corvallis, ORUniv Oregon, Corvallis, OR	3	0	0	0	0	3			0361-5235			WOS:000267662500024

TAGS-85 samples were prepared via a melting-quenching-annealing process, and then ball-milled in different atmospheres and subsequently densified using a spark plasma sintering technique. The Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and Hall coefficient were measured as a function of temperature from 10 K to 310 K. It was found that different ball-milling atmospheres, i.e., air, liquid N-2 (LN2), and Ar, profoundly affected the TE properties. A state-of-the-art figure of merit ZT a parts per thousand 0.30 was attained at 310 K in the Ar-ball milled sample. The results are discussed in terms of the carrier concentration, mobility, crystallinity, and the grain boundary scattering.					27th International Conference on Thermoelectrics27th International Conference on Thermoelectrics	AUG 03-07, 2008AUG 03-07, 2008	Int Thermoelect SocInt Thermoelect Soc	Univ Oregon, Corvallis, ORUniv Oregon, Corvallis, OR	4	1	0	0	0	4			0361-5235			WOS:000267662500045

It is expected the success of ANN application particularly in simulating the operation of tillage practices and dynamic behavior of agricultural soil. One of the reasons in which leads us to use this method is its powerful estimation and the other one is that there is no specific material relation between the dependent and independent variables. In this research, parameters such as travel speed, tillage depth and other soil parameters such as cone index, moisture content, electrical conductivity and percentage of clay and sand are used to develop a prediction model. Experiments were conducted on three different types of coastal plain soils in the south eastern of United States for collection of required data. The model designed in this study was a multilayer network back propagation. Three algorithms of gradient descent with momentum, Lavenberg-Marquardt and scaled conjugated gradient algorithm were used to train the network. The best algorithm, used to train the network was chosen based on the high accuracy of prediction (95.8%) and more accurate simulation (97.6%), was the Lavenberg-Marquardt algorithm which recognized as the best algorithm (with two mean layers which include 12 neurons in the second layer) in comparison with other algorithms. The obtained scatter charts showed a correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.996 in network training and correlation coefficient of 0.987 in network testing between actual data and obtained data from ANN. Also these ANN models were compared with regression models based on data presented by ASAE and Gamer's model to evaluate the model. The comparison of the results of model and regression models to predict the draft force needed in subsoiling showed that ANN data are more close to actual data than the regression models.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1459-0255			WOS:000272054700004		
J	Kim, Jinkyung; Luo, Feng; Jiang, Xiuping								Factors Impacting the Regrowth of Escheri coli O157:H7 in Dairy Manure Compost								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				72	7			1576	1584					JUL 2009	2009	The environmental variables affecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 regrowth in dairy manure compost were investigated. Factors evaluated were moisture content, strain variation, growth medium of inoculum, level of background microflora and inoculum, different days of composting, and acclimation at room temperature. A mathematical model was applied to describe E. coli O157 regrowth potential in compost. Repopulation occurred in autoclaved compost with a moisture content as low as 20% (water activity of 0.986) in the presence of background microflora of 2.3 to 3.9 log CFU/g. The population of all three E. coli O157 strains increased from ca. 1 to 4.85 log CFU/g in autoclaved compost, with the highest increase in the spinach-outbreak strain. However, E. coli 0 157 regrowth was suppressed by background microflora, at ca. 6.5 log CFU/g. By eliminating acclimation at room temperature and increasing the inoculum level to ca. 3 log CFU/g, E. coli O157:H7 could regrow in the presence of high levels of background microflora. E. coli O157:H7 regrowth in the autoclaved compost collected from the field study was evident at all sampling days, with the population increase ranging from 3.49 to 6.54 log CFU/g. The fate of E. coli O157:H7 in compost was well described by a Whiting and Cygnarowicz-Provost model, with R(2) greater than 0.9. The level of background microflora was a significant factor for both growth and death parameters. Our results reveal that a small number of E. coli O157 cells can regrow in compost, and both background microflora. and moisture content were major factors affecting E. coli O157:H7 growth.									12	0	0	9	1	12			0362-028X			WOS:000267812800031	19681288

We build on the premise that psychological contract breach (i.e. the organization's failure to fulfil the obligations employees believe they are owed) signals to employees that they are not cared for and valued by the organization (i.e. reduces POS). In support, a longitudinal study of 310 employees shows that PCB at Time 1 explains significant variance in POS at Time 2 (beyond that explained by POS at Time 1). Building on this result, we advance the argument that employees' perceptions of organizational politics serve as a heuristic for the overall benevolent or malevolent character of the organization and its agents. Accordingly, we expect that when employees perceive PCB and high levels of organizational politics, they will be more likely to hold the organization responsible for PCB and thus report lower levels of POS in response to breach. This line of reasoning received support in a second study of 146 employees which showed that perceptions of organizational politics moderate the PCB-POS relationship. Our results suggest that the social context in which psychological contract breaches occur matters and that managers should consider the organization's perceived political landscape when anticipating how employees will respond to broken promises.									38	0	0	0	0	38			0022-2380			WOS:000266426300004

Several proprietary chemicals are available in the industry that can help reduce the mixing and compaction temperatures. A significant reduction of required heat can be achieved in most cases. Several studies have been conducted evaluating the properties of the warm mix asphalt; however, properties of the binders containing these chemicals have not been studied in great detail. Warm asphalts were produced using two of the available processes utilizing five different asphalt binder sources, and some rheological tests were conducted (dynamic shear rheometer and viscosity). The results indicated that binders containing the inorganic additive Aspha-Min (Eurovia, France) underwent minor or no changes compared to the base binders in terms of flow properties, stiffness, and response to creep. However, the flow of binders with the additive Sasobit (Sasol Wax, Germany), which consists of aliphatic hydrocarbons, changed from Newtonian to shear thinning at 60 degrees C, and the viscosity of the binder at 60 degrees C increased. Sasobit also improved the stiffness and penetration resistance of the base binders, and binders with Sasobit had significantly lower permanent deformations after repeated creep-recovery tests compared to the base binders.									32	1	0	0	2	34			0899-1561			WOS:000267054800003

The hydroxyl concentration and the dielectric properties of barium titanate nano-powder synthesized by water-based ambient condition sol process								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS				20	7			619	627		10.1007/s10854-008-9775-1			JUL 2009	2009	Nanocrystalline barium titanate, BaTiO(3), powders have been successfully synthesized via water-based ambient condition sol (WACS) process, using barium hydroxide and titanium isopropoxide. The properties of the powder were investigated as a function of various processing parameters such as the concentration of Ba(2+) ions ([Ba(2+)]), the concentration of base, and reaction time. The concentration of hydroxyl (OH(-)) groups in the BaTiO(3) powder was greatly affected by changing the values of each processing parameter. The dielectric constant and tetragonality of the powders which contain lattice OH(-) more than 0.35 wt% were little affected with further increase in the lattice OH(-) concentration. The dielectric loss was highly varied with the concentration of the OH(-) groups, and it was increased with increasing OH(-) concentration. Calcination treatment significantly improved the dielectric properties of the powder. With higher calcination temperature, the dielectric constant increased and the dielectric loss decreased.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4522			WOS:000265042700006

Moreover, the computer systems used to solve these problems are becoming significantly more complex than the familiar, well-understood sequential model on their desktops. While it is possible to re-train scientists to use emerging high-performance computing (HPC) models, it is much more effective to provide them with a higher-level programming environment that has been specialized to their particular domain. By fostering interaction between HPC specialists and the domain scientists, problem-solving environments (PSEs) provide a collaborative environment. A PSE environment allows scientists to focus on expressing their computational problem while the PSE and associated tools Support mapping that domain-specific problem to a high-performance computing system.This article describes Arches, an object-oriented framework for building domain-specific PSEs. The framework was designed to Support a wide range of problem domains and to be extensible to support very different high-performance computing targets. To demonstrate this flexibility, two PSEs have been developed from the Arches framework to solve problem in two different domains and target very different computing platforms. The Coven PSE supports parallel applications that require large-scale parallelism found in cost-effective Beowulf clusters. In contrast, RCADE targets FPGA-based reconfigurable computing and was originally designed to aid NASA Earth scientists studying satellite instrument data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this research was to investigate the rheological characteristics of the rubberized asphalt binders after various long-term aging procedures, using the penetration index, the dynamic shear rheometer, the bending beam rheometer, and high pressure-gel permeation chromatographic testing. The experimental design included the use of three binder sources, three binder grades (PG 64-22, PG 64-22+10 %-40 ambient rubber, and PG 76-22) and three aging states, i.e., virgin, rolling thin film oven, and pressurized aged vessel [four test temperatures (65, 80, 100, and 110 degrees C) and five aging durations (15, 20, 40, 80, and 144 h) under the pressure of 2070 kPa]. The test results show that, as expected, the use of crumb rubber can effectively improve the PG grade and aging resistance of the virgin asphalt binder. A series of rheological properties (e.g., penetration, stiffness, in-value, and percentages of large and small molecular sizes) illustrate that the PG 64-22 binder, mixed with 10 %-40 ambient rubber, yields similar or improved theological properties in comparison with PG 76-22 using 3% styrene-butadiene-styrene polymer after various long-term aging procedures.									12	4	0	0	0	15			0090-3973			WOS:000267906800004		
J	Daum, Matthew; Batt, Gregory								Prediction of Cushion Performance Less Than One Inch Thick								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				37	4			379	382					JUL 2009	2009	An important tool packaging engineers use when designing cushions to protect products from shock is the cushion curve. Cushion curves show deceleration values along the vertical axis versus the static loading (weight divided by bearing area) along the horizontal axis for a given thickness of cushion material and given drop height. Commercially available cushion curves display a thickness of one inch and greater. However, many times packaging engineers design packages with cushions less than one inch thick. This leaves the packaging engineer to either guess deceleration levels below one inch thick by trial and error, or to extrapolate from existing cushion curve data. The purpose of this study was to determine if using existing cushion curve information would accurately predict deceleration values below one inch thick. To do this, a procedure was developed comparing information collected from expanded polystyrene cushion samples greater than one inch thick (correlating to existing cushion curves) compared to information collected from samples less than one inch thick. The comparison looked for difference between the datasets. It was found that in fact there was a statistical difference, meaning existing cushion curves should not be used to predict deceleration values for cushion thicknesses below one inch.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-3973			WOS:000267906800011

JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY				82	3			231	249					JUL 2009	2009	This study uses morphological and natural history data, along with molecular data derived from the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2), to investigate the status of species that are morphologically similar to Dasymutilla quadriguttata. Genetic distances, UPGMA cluster analyses, and maximum parsimony analyses were performed. In addition to those species that are morphologically similar to Dasymutilla quadriguttata, for our analysis we chose other species from the A quadriguttata species-group that differ sufficiently in morphology as outgroups, as well as species from the D. bioculata and D. nigripes species-groups. These species include D. californica, D. chattahoochei, D. lepeletierii, D. nigripes, and A wileyae. Conclusions from the analyses are that D. alesia, D. allardi, D. atrifimbriata, D. biguttata, A castor, D. cypris, A electra, D. hersilia, D. hora, D. interrupta, D. mediatoria, D. miamensis, D. mutata, D. nigridia, D. nitidula, D. permista, and D. rubricosa are indistinguishable from and junior synonyms of D. quadriguttatta. With this knowledge and with past sex associations, the D. castor, D. monticola, and D. quadriguttata species-groups are updated and an addendum to Mickel's (1936) Dasymutilla key is provided.									10	0	0	12	1	12			0022-8567	1937-2353		WOS:000273079900003

Using this approach, the anthracenes act as protective groups and help orient the new additions so that poly-adducts with particular geometries are obtained. From the e,e,e anthracene-trisadduct 1 we also obtained the mono[di(ethoxycarbonyl)methano][60] fullerene 6 and bis [di(ethoxycarbonyl)methano][60] fullerene 7. This approach exhibits a total yield of 4,2 % for the e, e, e tris malonate adduct, gives rise to less complex reaction mixtures and makes it easier to separate and characterize the compounds than other methods. The compounds obtained where characterized by UV/VIS, FT-IR, H-1 NMR, and MALDI-TOF.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1870-249X			WOS:000274885500015

In vitro interaction between mouse breast cancer cells and mouse mesenchymal stem cells during adipocyte differentiation								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				3	5			338	347		10.1002/term.158			JUL 2009	2009	Surgical treatment following breast cancer, i.e. lumpectomy and mastectomy, may not efficiently remove all cancerous cells. As such, when mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are incorporated into the breast reconstruction process, it is likely that those MSCs will encounter remnant cancerous cells after transplantation into the defect site. The potential interaction between breast cancer cells and MSCs remains unclear. We hypothesized that paracrine interactions might occur between cells and various proteinases, growth factors and other cytokine molecules in the local microenvironment. Conditioned media (CM) from two mouse mammary cancer cell lines (4T1 and 4T07) and one mouse mammary epithelial cell line (NMuMG) were studied in the experimental model. Post-confluent mouse MSCs (D1 cells) were differentiated with an adipogenic hormonal cocktail. Conditioned media from the three cell types did not have an inhibitory effect on D1 cell viability; however, triglyceride (TG) and Oil red O (ORO) analysis results showed that 4T1-CM significantly inhibited D1 adipocyte differentiation and reduced lipid vesicle accumulation in the differentiating D1 cells. Preliminary analysis of the conditioned media revealed that a higher presence of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) was present in the 4T1-CM as compared to the levels found in 4T07-CM and NMuMG-CM, which were below the detection limit. Additionally, the conditioned medium of differentiated D1 cells on day 12 had a negative effect on 4T1 and 4T07 cell viability but no effect on NMuMG cell viability. The results suggest that mouse breast cancer cells modulate mouse MSC adipogenic differentiation, the level of modulation specific to the metastatic level.

Using the microscopic simulation software PARAMICS, this study evaluated the benefits of FSPs in reducing the duration of roadway blockage, following a crash and the resulting vehicle delay. A customized PARAMICS model was developed for random spatial and temporal crash generation, and the modeling of different number of FSPs and response policies through an application programming interface. Analysis of the simulation results revealed that both response policy and the number of FSPs affected the crash response times and consequently the duration of blockage and vehicle delays. The effects of different response policies diminished as the number of FSPs increased. Benefit-cost analysis indicated that FSP programs can obtain a maximum benefit-cost ratio of 22:1, which decreases as the number of FSPs increases, number of crashes per year decreases, and the discount rate increases.					86th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board86th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	20072007	Transportat Sys BoardTransportat Sys Board	Washington, DCWashington, DC	5	0	0	0	0	5			0733-947X	1943-5436		WOS:000267055200005

To probe the role of particle bombardment in such film excitations, homogeneous, atomically ordered, and relatively defect free thin films must be deposited in the same ultrahigh vacuum system where they will be studied. With these constraints in mind, the authors designed a compact deposition chamber that allows for in situ growth and analysis of metal layers, which are only a few monolayers. This deposition chamber is attached to the commercial variable temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and has an internal volume of 500 cm(3). The target substrates for deposition are compatible with the STM design and are held in place in a specially designed clamping slot that enables low temperature growth. They used the custom built chamber to deposit Ag top layers with thicknesses between 8 and 15 nm on Si(100). Electronic and morphological characteristics of the prototype Ag/n-Si(100) devices are presented.					55th International Symposium of the American-Vacuum-Society55th International Symposium of the American-Vacuum-Society	OCT 19-24, 2008OCT 19-24, 2008	Amer Vacuum SocAmer Vacuum Soc	Boston, MABoston, MA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0734-2101			WOS:000267600000073

Two-to-one internal resonance in microscanners								NONLINEAR DYNAMICS				57	1-2			231	251		10.1007/s11071-008-9435-2			JUL 2009	2009	To realize large scanning angles, torsional microscanners are normally excited at their natural frequencies. Usually, a bias DC voltage is also applied to scan around a desired nonzero tilt angle. As a result, a deep understanding of the mirror's response to a DC-shifted primary resonance excitation is imperative. Along these lines, we use the method of multiple scales to obtain a second-order nonlinear approximate analytical solution of the mirror steady-state response. We show that the response of the mirror exhibits a softening-type behavior that increases as the magnitude of the DC component increases. For a given mirror, we can also identify a DC voltage range wherein the mirror exhibits a two-to-one internal resonance between the first two modes; that is, omega(2) approximate to 2 omega(1). To analyze the mirror behavior within that range, we first treat the case where the excitation frequency is near the first-mode frequency; that is, Omega approximate to omega(1). Then we treat the case where the excitation frequency is near the second-mode frequency; that is, Omega approximate to omega(2). We analyze the stability of the response and compare the analytical results to numerical solutions obtained via long-time integration of the equations of motion. We show that, due to the internal resonance, the mirror exhibits complex dynamic behavior characterized by aperiodic responses to primary resonance excitations. This behavior results in undesirable oscillations that are detrimental to the mirror performance, namely bringing the target point in and out of focus and resulting in distorted images.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0924-090X			WOS:000266927100021

J	Tharayil, Nishanth								To survive or to slay: Resource-foraging role of metabolites implicated in allelopathy.								Plant signaling & behavior				4	7			580	3					2009-Jul	2009	The ecological relevance of allelopathy is highly debated due to the lack of phytotoxic concentrations of allelochemical in natural field conditions. Most of the putative allelochemicals are exuded at low concentrations, and subsequently undergo rapid chemical and biological degradation in soil matrices. At sub-toxic concentrations, due to hormesis effect, these compounds could possibly have a stimulatory effect on plant growth. Many of the suggested allelopathic compounds are chelants and can complex-with and mobilize metal ions in soil. These complexation reactions will detoxify the compound, but will increase the chemical-nutrient-foraging ability of the donor plant. The concentration in which these compounds are exuded matches with other similar secondary metabolites facilitating plant nutrient acquisition. Irrespective of whether the implicated PSMs facilitate donor plant in chemical nutrient-foraging or in poisoning the neighbors, the conferred advantage translates in terms of resource availability-in first case the donor enjoys uncontested nutrient uptake efficiency, where as in the latter the donor gain an uncontested access to resources. This further reaffirms the notion that resource competition and allelopathy are inextricable. Since most of the secondary metabolites could mobilize nutrients from soil, along with its phytotoxic effect, complementary self-facilitation roles of these compounds should be investigated.									10	0	0	9	1	11				1559-2324		MEDLINE:19820349	19820349

Influence of supplemental dietary poultry fat on the performance of commercial layers inoculated before or at the onset of lay with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum								POULTRY SCIENCE				88	7			1365	1372		10.3382/ps.2009-00015			JUL 1 2009	2009	The effects of F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (FMG) inoculation and 1.5% supplemental dietary poultry fat (PF) on the performance of commercial layers between 20 and 58 wk of age were investigated. Sham and FMG inoculations were administered at 12 (before lay) and 22 (early in lay) wk and dietary treatments (basal control diets and basal control diets with 1.5% supplemental PF) were initiated at 20 wk of age. Mortality at wk 47 and 53 was greatest in birds inoculated with FMG at 22 wk. Feed consumption from 20 to 23 and from 52 to 55 wk of age was greater in birds that were inoculated with FMG (12 or 22 wk). However, feed consumption decreased in birds that were inoculated at 12 wk (sham or FMG) when 1.5% supplemental PF was added to the diet. Percentage of total egg production (EP) between 22 and 58 wk of age was highest in hens that were inoculated with FMG at 22 wk. Furthermore, weekly EP increased at wk 27 and 58 and decreased at wk 47 after birds had been inoculated with FMG (12 or 22 wk), and increased at 22 wk and decreased at 54 wk when inoculations (sham or FMG) were given at 22 wk. Egg weight was increased at wk 29, 31, 39, 40, 42, 44, 53, and 58 in birds that were inoculated with FMG (12 or 22 wk); however, there were no coherent treatment effects on eggshell quality. An FMG inoculation at 22 wk may promote total EP through 58 wk, whereas the inoculation of commercial layers with FMG (12 or 22 wk) may increase subsequent feed consumption during the early and late stages of EP and increase egg weight throughout lay. However, the supplementation of hen diets with 1.5% PF beginning at 20 wk of age may reduce subsequent feed consumption throughout lay in birds having experienced a prelay (12 wk) inoculation.									7	0	0	5	0	7			0032-5791			WOS:000267377600005	19531705	
J	Smith, D. P.; Northcutt, J. K.								Pale poultry muscle syndrome								POULTRY SCIENCE				88	7			1493	1496		10.3382/ps.2008-00509			JUL 1 2009	2009	Muscle that exhibits a pale color, soft texture, and exudative nature (PSE) was first described by the swine industry. Some turkey breast muscle has been found to be lighter or paler than what is considered normal. A comparable phenomenon has also been observed in broiler chicken breast muscle. Similar to PSE pork, pale poultry muscles may have reduced water-holding capacity and higher drip loss than normal muscles. However, the lighter color poultry may also have normal water-holding and drip loss. Based on these findings, researchers have adopted the PSE term to describe pale avian muscle. The scientific literature describes porcine PSE as a much more severe meat quality defect than the poultry version. The genetic basis for the PSE syndrome between turkey and pork muscle also appears to differ. Finally, the halothane screening method used to detect PSE-susceptible live swine does not work when used to screen suspect turkeys or chickens. Most of the PSE-like avian muscle is usually chosen by researchers based on the color of the muscle. However, many factors affect muscle color and the literature shows substantial differences in research relative to the definition of pale and normal avian muscles. Therefore, we propose using other terminology than PSE when describing avian breast muscle that exhibits some degree of paleness, reduced water-holding capacity, and increased drip loss. Two recommendations are: pale chicken muscle or pale poultry muscle syndrome. Continued use of PSE to describe pale poultry meat may be misleading because the conditions in swine and avian resulting in the defect are not the same.					97th Annual Meeting of the Poultry-Science-Association97th Annual Meeting of the Poultry-Science-Association	JUL 20-23, 2008JUL 20-23, 2008	Poultry Sci AssocPoultry Sci Assoc	Niagara Falls, CANADANiagara Falls, CANADA	19	2	0	15	2	22			0032-5791			WOS:000267377600022	19531722

Most frequently used in reference to pork, this defective meat is being seen with increasing frequency in turkey and broiler processing plants. It has been estimated that this PSE-type meat represents 5 to 40% of meat that is produced in the poultry industry. With the increased production of further-processed products, this PSE problem has become more apparent in the turkey industry. It has been estimated that due to the high incidence, a single turkey processing plant could be losing $2 to 4 million per year, resulting in a loss in excess of $200 million dollars by the turkey industry alone.					97th Annual Meeting of the Poultry-Science-Association97th Annual Meeting of the Poultry-Science-Association	JUL 20-23, 2008JUL 20-23, 2008	Poultry Sci AssocPoultry Sci Assoc	Niagara Falls, CANADANiagara Falls, CANADA	22	1	0	18	1	23			0032-5791			WOS:000267377600025	19531725

New records of the mirid are given from xeric sand communities of peninsular Florida and southeastern Georgia. A new host plant is scarlet basil, Clinopodium coccineum (Nutt. ex Hook.) Kuntze; Lamiaceae), a woody mint on which the bug develops in Georgia. Conradina canescens is the host in the Lake Wales Ridge of the Florida peninsula. Overwintered eggs hatch as early as late March in Georgia, and nymphs apparently feed on the new shoots. First-generation adults appear about mid-May. Reproduction in this multivoltine bug occurs throughout spring and summer, with late instars sometimes found as late as early November and adults persisting until mid-November.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-8797			WOS:000268838800018

We have demonstrated a loss of bone mass from exposure to types of radiation relevant to space flight at doses of 1 and 2 Gy. The effects of space radiation on skeletal muscle, however, have not been investigated. To evaluate the effect of simulated galactic cosmic radiation on muscle fiber area and bone volume, we examined mice from a study in which brains were exposed to collimated iron-ion radiation. The collimator transmitted a complex mix of charged secondary particles to bone and muscle tissue that represented a low-fidelity simulation of the space radiation environment. Measured radiation doses of uncollimated secondary particles were 0.47 Gy at the proximal humerus, 0.24-0.31 Gy at the midbelly of the triceps brachii, and 0.18 Gy at the proximal tibia. Compared to nonirradiated controls, the proximal humerus of irradiated mice had a lower trabecular bone volume fraction, lower trabecular thickness, greater cortical porosity, and lower polar moment of inertia. The tibia showed no differences in any bone parameter. The triceps brachii of irradiated mice had fewer small-diameter fibers and more fibers containing central nuclei. These results demonstrate a negative effect on the skeletal muscle and bone systems of simulated galactic cosmic rays at a dose and LET range relevant to a Mars exploration mission. The presence of evidence of muscle remodeling highlights the need for further study. (C) 2009 by Radiation Research Society									14	1	0	11	0	14			0033-7587			WOS:000267619200003	19580504

Recently, we have reported successful boron doping into single-walled CNTs (SWNTs) and also revealed its correlation with superconductivity. In the present study, we report results of high-pressure magnetization measurements in films consisting of ropes of boron-doped SWNTs. It reveals that T, and magnitude for Meissner effect are mostly independent of applied pressure, while the magnitude of graphite diamagnetism drastically increases as pressure increases. We also report the observation of resistance drop and correlation of boron doping with multi-walled CNTs, in which we reported superconductivity previously. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Among women aged 20 to 49, 7.2% reported that they were hit by their partners in the past year. Comparison shows that the Chinese prevalence is modestly below the overall median for other societies. Net of other factors, jealousy exacerbates hitting for both men and women in a reactive pattern, with the jealous partner getting hit. This suggests a rethinking of the role of sexual jealousy in spousal violence in some social settings.

Wool-waste as organic nutrient source for container-grown plants								WASTE MANAGEMENT				29	7			2160	2164		10.1016/j.wasman.2009.03.009			JUL 2009	2009	A container experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that uncomposted wool wastes could be used as nutrient source and growth medium constituent for container-grown plants. The treatments were: (1) rate of wool-waste application (0 or unamended control, 20, 40, 80, and 120 g of wool per 8-in. pot), (2) growth medium constituents [(2.1) wool plus perlite, (2.2) wool plus peat, and (2.3) wool plus peat plus perlite], and (3) plant species (basil and Swiss chard). A single addition of 20, 40, 80, or 120 g of wool-waste to Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L.) and basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) in pots with growth medium provided four harvests of Swiss chard and five harvests of basil. Total basil yield from the five harvests was 1.6-5 times greater than the total yield from the unamended control, while total Swiss chard yield from the four harvests was 2-5 times greater relative to the respective unamended control. The addition of wool-waste to the growth medium increased Swiss chard and basil tissue N, and NO(3)-N and NH(4)-N in growth medium relative to the unamended control. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis of wool fibers sampled at the end of the experiments indicated various levels of decomposition, with some fibers retaining their original surface structure. Furthermore, most of the wool fibers' surfaces contained significant concentrations of S and much less N, R or K. SEM/EDX revealed that some plant roots grow directly on wool-waste fibers suggesting either (I) root directional growth towards sites with greater nutrient concentration and/or (2) a possible role for roots or root exudates in wool decomposition. Results from this study suggest that uncomposted wool wastes can be used as soil amendment, growth medium constituent, and nutrient source for container-grown plants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These genes are not expressed in the peach mutant evergrowing, which fails to cease growth and enter dormancy under dormancy-inducing conditions. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationships among and the rates and patterns of molecular evolution within DAM genes in the phylogenetic context of the MADS-box gene family.Results: The peach DAM genes grouped with the SVP/StMADS11 lineage of type II MIKCC MADS-box genes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the peach SVP/StMADS11-like gene family, which contains significantly more members than annual model plants, expanded through serial tandem gene duplication. We found evidence of strong purifying selection acting to constrain functional divergence among the peach DAM genes and only a single codon, located in the C-terminal region, under significant positive selection.Conclusion: Because all DAM genes are expressed in peach and are subjected to strong purifying selection we suggest that the duplicated genes have been maintained by subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization. In addition, this pattern of selection suggests that the DAM genes are important for peach growth and development.									33	4	0	32	0	37			1471-2229			WOS:000268716700001	19558704

In contrast to prior reports, the delta-NiMo phase does not wet Mo GBs in the solid state. In the solid-liquid two-phase region, the Ni-rich liquid apparently wets Mo GBs completely. Furthermore, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that nanometer-thick quasiliquid films persist at GBs into the single-phase region where the bulk liquid phase is no longer stable. This is interpreted as a case of GB prewetting. An analytical thermodynamic model is developed and validated; this model can be applied to other alloys.									31	2	0	2	0	33			0003-6951			WOS:000267431700026

Using a new three-dimensional relativistic particle-in-cell code, we have investigated the particle acceleration and shock structure associated with an unmagnetized relativistic electron-positron jet propagating into an unmagnetized electron-positron plasma. The simulation has been performed using a long simulation system in order to study the nonlinear stages of the Weibel instability, the particle acceleration mechanism, and the shock structure. Cold jet electrons are thermalized and slowed while the ambient electrons are swept up to create a partially developed hydrodynamic-like shock structure. In the leading shock, electron density increases by a factor of less than or similar to 3.5 in the simulation frame. Strong electromagnetic fields are generated in the trailing shock and provide an emission site. We discuss the possible implication of our simulation results within the active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst context.									49	0	0	0	0	49						WOS:000266373600003

Electrochemical and photophysical studies of the novel conjugates were made and compared with those of their C-60 analogues, in order to determine (i) the effect of the linkage position (N-substituted versus 2-substituted pyrrolidine) of the donor system in the formation of photoinduced charge separated states, (ii) the thermal stability toward the retro-cycloaddition reaction, and (iii) the effect of changing C-60 for I-h-Sc3N@C-80 as the electron acceptor. It was found that when the donor is connected to the pyrrolidine nitrogen atom, the resulting dyad produces a significantly longer lived radical pair than the corresponding 2-substituted isomer for both the C-60 and I-h-Sc3N@C-80 dyads. In addition to that, the N-substituted TPA-I-h-Sc3N@C-80 dyad has much better thermal stability than the 2-subtituted one. Finally, the I-h-Sc3N@C-80 dyads have considerably longer lived charge separated states than their C-60 analogues, thus approving the advantage of using I-h-Sc3N@C-80 instead Of C-60 as the acceptor for the construction of fullerene based donor-acceptor conjugates. These findings are important for the design and future application Of I-h-Sc3N@C-80 dyads as materials for the construction of plastic organic solar cells.									67	0	0	10	0	67			0002-7863			WOS:000267177900062	19445462	
J	Kauffman, Jennifer S.; Ellerbrock, Brett M.; Stevens, Kathryn A.; Brown, Philip J.; Pennington, William T.; Hanks, Timothy W.								Preparation, Characterization, and Sensing Behavior of Polydiacetylene Liposomes Embedded in Alginate Fibers								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				1	6			1287	1291		10.1021/am900167r			JUN 2009	2009	Polydiacetylene (PDA)-doped calcium alginate fibers were created by the solution blending of polymerized 10, 12-pentacosadiynoic acid liposomes with sodium alginate in water prior to extrusion. The liposomes maintained their blue color during wet spinning and drying of the fibers but changed to red with exposure to specific external stimuli (heat, solvent, and chemical). In the latter case, the color change only occurred when the fibers were sufficiently permeable for the reacting species to reach the interior. A parameter termed the "Raman response" (RR) has been developed to quantify the amount of PDA liposomes in each of two critical conformations within the fibers. The RR attributes a quantitative measure of PDA response to individual stimuli. This method provides advantages over the commonly used "colorimetric response" in systems where sample limitations and chromophore activity make UV-vis spectroscopic measurements difficult or inaccurate. PDA liposomes are shown to effectively add a versatile sensing component to alginate fibers.									18	1	0	4	0	18			1944-8244			WOS:000267513100023	20355925

Findings show that South Carolina consumers are willing to pay an average premium of 27% for local produce and 23% for local animal products. Premiums for local products are influenced by age, gender, and income as well as by perceived product quality, a desire to support the local economy, patronage of farmers markets, and consumer ties to agriculture.

Classical novae (CNe) have been found to represent the major class of supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) in our neighbour galaxy M 31.Aims. We determine the properties and evolution of the two first SSSs ever discovered in the M 31 globular cluster (GC) system.Methods. We have used XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift observations of the centre region of M 31 to discover both SSSs and to determine their X-ray light curves and spectra. We performed detailed analysis of XMM-Newton EPIC PN spectra of the source in Bol 111 (SS1) using blackbody and NLTE white dwarf (WD) atmosphere models. For the SSS in Bol 194 (SS2) we used optical monitoring data to search for an optical counterpart.Results. Both GC X-ray sources were classified as SSS. We identify SS1 with the CN M31N 2007-06b recently discovered in the M 31 GC Bol 111. For SS2 we did not find evidence for a recent nova outburst and can only provide useful constraints on the time of the outburst of a hypothetical nova.Conclusions. The only known CN in a M 31 GC can be identified with the first SSS found in a M 31 GC. We discuss the impact of our observations on the nova rate for the M 31 GC system.									19	0	0	0	0	19			0004-6361			WOS:000267363100024

Protein molecules were first chemically bound to an ultrathin (1-3 nm) poly(glycidyl methacrylate) reactive polymer layer and later removed by protease treatment. Residual amino acids became grafted to the surface and to a certain extent imitated the surface chemical composition and shape of the template molecule on a nanolevel. The space surrounding the adsorbed biomolecules was modified with grafted poly(ethylene glycol) layer. This led to the formation of islands of spatial nanosized pockets complementary to the protein shape. The adsorbing protein recognized the surfaces imprinted and was anchored to the substrate.									10	0	0	4	0	10			1559-4106			WOS:000266976300003	20408713

BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN				216	3			226	242					JUN 2009	2009	Egg size is one of the most important aspects of the life history of free-spawning marine organisms, and it is correlated with larval developmental mode and many other life-history characters. Egg size is simple to measure and data are available for a wide range of taxa, but we have a limited understanding of how large and small eggs differ in composition; size is not always the best measure of the characters under selection. Large eggs are generally considered to reflect increased maternal investment, but egg size alone can be a poor predictor of energetic content within and among taxa. We review techniques that have been used to measure the energetic content and biochemical makeup of invertebrate eggs and point out the strengths and difficulties associated with each. We also suggest a number of comparative and descriptive approaches to biochemical constituent analysis that would strengthen our understanding of how natural selection shapes oogenic strategies. Finally, we highlight recent empirical research on the intrinsic factors that drive intraspecific variation in egg size. We also highlight the relative paucity of these data in the literature and provide some suggestions for future research directions.									62	0	0	61	0	62			0006-3185	1939-8697		WOS:000267578800004	19556591

Using the dynamic electroanalytical techniques of Multiple Scan Rate Cyclic Voltammetry (MSRCV) experiments with finite element simulations and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy with equivalent circuit modeling, three unique MDEA designs; MDEA 050 (r = 25 mu m, 5,184 discs), MDEA 100 (r = 50 mu m, 1,296 discs) and MDEA 250 (r = 125 mu m, 207 discs) of constant critical dimensions (center-to-center d/r = 4) and area (A = 0.1 cm(2)) were studied in 1.0 mM ferrocene monocarboxylic acid (FcCO(2)H) solution (in 0.1 M Tris/0.1 M KCl buffer, pH = 7.2). The critical disc-to-disc spacing (d/r) required to archive 67% of maximal current response was defined as optimal. Based on the predictive model, new MDEA designs; MDEA 001 (r = 0.5 mu m, 127,324 discs), MDEA 002.5 (r = 1.25 mu m, 20,372 discs), MDEA 005 (r = 2.5 mu m, 5,093 discs), MDEA 010 (r = 5 mu m, 1,273 discs), MDEA 015 (r = 7.5 mu m, 566 discs), MDEA 020 (r = 10 mu m, 318 discs) were simulated at 10 and 100 mV/s. The final disc count of each MDEA was dictated by the need to maintain a comparable electroactive area between the MDEAs, which was chosen to be 0.001 cm(2), which in turn was dictated by the need to generate sufficient electrochemical current to be comfortably measured by common electrochemical detectors.									7	0	0	3	0	7			1387-2176			WOS:000265440300021	19165603	
J	Miller, Richard S.; Beasley, Don				Chang, Yanwei/D-8117-2013				On stairwell and elevator shaft pressurization for smoke control in tall buildings								BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT				44	6			1306	1317		10.1016/j.buildenv.2008.09.015			JUN 2009	2009	Elevator shaft and stairwell shaft-pressurization systems are studied as means of smoke migration prevention through the stack effect in tall buildings using the CONTAM simulation software. A thirty story building model is considered with exterior leakages calibrated to experimental data for both a residential and a commercial building. Stairwell pressurization is found to be completely feasible in the absence of elevator shaft pressurization. In contrast, coupled elevator shaft-pressurization systems are found to produce prohibitively large pressure differences across both the elevator and stairwell doors if (1) minimum pressure differences must be maintained at both open and closed elevator doors and (2) if the system must function properly when the ground floor exterior building doors are closed. Even in these cases situations arise in which smoke may enter the shaft and be actively distributed throughout the building by the fan system. These differences between stairwell and elevator shaft pressurization are directly attributable to the much larger leakage areas associated with elevator doors. Relatively large flow rates through the open elevator doors act to pressurize the ground floor of the building, indirectly causing large pressure differences across upper floor elevator doors. Furthermore, the results show that there is a strong coupling between the fan speed requirements of the stairwell and elevator shaft-pressurization systems. Fan requirements are also found to be sensitive to the ambient temperature. Effects of the fan location, louvers, vents, the building height, and the number of elevator cars and/or shafts are also addressed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Vascular Flora of Sandhill Research and Education Center, Richland County, South Carolina								CASTANEA				74	2			168	180					JUN 2009	2009	Sandhill Research and Education Center is located on 215 ha of greenspace in South Carolina. The Center is now surrounded by suburban development. Although located within the Sandhills region and within the historic range of the Longleaf Pine Forest, agriculture has been the predominant land use during the last century. With development pressure and an interest in transitioning from agriculture to ecological restoration, a baseline inventory of the flora was initiated to provide further guidance to administrators. This survey delineates six plant community types (Swamp Tupelo, Sand Hickory, Blackjack Oak, Turkey Oak, Field, and Utility Right-of-Way) and reports a total of 328 species in 237 genera and 100 families. It adds two state records (Lespedeza virgata and Lotus corniculatus), 38 county records, and several noteworthy species.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0008-7475			WOS:000268957300008

J	Starling, T.; Daqaq, M. F.; Li, G.								A Computational Approach for Pre-Shaping Voltage Commands of Torsional Micromirrors								CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES				45	3			207	225					JUN 2009	2009	Input-shaping is an open-loop control technique for dynamic control of electrostatic MEMS. In MEMS applications, open-loop control is attractive as it computes a priori the required system input to achieve desired dynamic behavior without using feedback. In this work, a 3-D computational electromechanical analysis is performed to preshape the voltage commands applied to electrostatically actuate a torsional micromirror to a desired tilt angle with minimal residual oscillations. The effect of higher vibration modes on the controlled response is also investigated. It is shown that, for some structural design parameters, the first bending mode of the micromirror can have a significant effect on the dynamic response. If not accounted for in the control algorithm, these bending vibrations could have an adverse effect on the controlled response of the mirror. To resolve this issue, a numerical optimization procedure is employed to shape the input voltage from the real time dynamic response of the mirror structure. The optimization scheme yields a periodic nonlinear input voltage design that can effectively suppress the bending mode.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1526-1492			WOS:000269851400001

Representatives from 21 international organizations, regional sections and working groups of the Society for Conservation Biology, and 12 academics, from all continents except Antarctica, compiled 2291 questions of relevance to conservation of biological diversity worldwide. The questions were gathered from 761 individuals through workshops, email requests, and discussions. Voting by email to short-list questions, followed by a 2-day workshop, was used to derive the final list of 100 questions. Most of the final questions were derived through a process of modification and combination as the workshop progressed. The questions are divided into 12 sections: ecosystem functions and services, climate change, technological change, protected areas, ecosystem management and restoration, terrestrial ecosystems, marine ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems, species management, organizational systems and processes, societal context and change, and impacts of conservation interventions. We anticipate that these questions will help identify new directions for researchers and assist funders in directing funds.									215	9	0	169	1	236			0888-8892	1523-1739		WOS:000266071200010	19438873

Characterization of warm mix asphalt binders containing artificially long-term aged binders								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				23	6			2371	2379		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.11.005			JUN 2009	2009	Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) comprises one of the largest recycled materials, and warm mix asphalt (WMA) technologies become more commonly used due to their promising advantages in the United States and Europe. This paper addresses the laboratory investigation of performance properties of WMA binders containing aged binders. The recycled binders with the additives were produced using two (i.e., zeolite Aspha-min(R) and wax Sasobit(R)) of the available warm asphalt processes. The recycled WMA binders were artificially short-term and then long-term aged through the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and pressure aging vessel (PAV) procedures. Superpave binder tests were carried out on the binders through the rotational viscometer, the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and the bending beam rheometer (131311). In general, the results Of this Study indicated that (1) the additives and aged binders played an important role in determination of the binder properties; (2) the use of lower PC grade as a virgin binder (PC 58-28 in this study) was critical on offsetting the increase of binder stiffness caused by the addition of WMA additives and aged binders; and (3) even at the low recycling percentage of 15%, the lower PC grade was needed to get the results meeting current Superpave binder requirements.

Approximately 48,000 high quality sequence tags (246 bp average length) were generated. 53% of the sequence tags aligned to 4,262 P. chrysosporium gene models, and an additional 18.5% of the tags reliably aligned to the P. chrysosporium genome providing evidence for 961 putative novel fragmented gene models. Due to their role in lignocellulose degradation, the secreted proteins were focused upon. Our results show that the four enzymes required for cellulose degradation: endocellulase, exocellulase CBHI, exocellulase CBHII, and beta-glucosidase are all produced. For hemicellulose degradation, not all known enzymes were produced, but endoxylanases, acetyl xylan esterases and mannosidases were detected. For lignin degradation, the role of peroxidases has been questioned; however, our results show that lignin peroxidase is highly expressed along with the H2O2 generating enzyme, alcohol oxidase. The transcriptome snapshot reveals that H2O2 generation and utilization are central in wood degradation. Our results also reveal new transcripts that encode extracellular proteins with no known function.									36	1	0	36	0	37			0172-8083	1432-0983		WOS:000267040700005	19396602	
J	Hernandez, J. P.; Mota, L. C.; Baldwin, W. S.

In turn, they induce phase I-III detoxification enzymes and transporters that help eliminate these chemicals. Because many of the chemicals that activate CAR and PXR are environmentally-relevant (dietary and anthropogenic), studies need to address whether these chemicals or mixtures of these chemicals may increase the susceptibility to adverse drug interactions. In addition, CAR and PXR are involved in hepatic proliferation, intermediary metabolism, and protection from cholestasis. Therefore, activation of CAR and PXR may have a wide variety of implications for personalized medicine through physiological effects on metabolism and cell proliferation; some beneficial and others adverse. Identifying the chemicals that activate these promiscuous nuclear receptors and understanding how these chemicals may act in concert will help us predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs), predict cholestasis and steatosis, and regulate intermediary metabolism. This review summarizes the available data on CAR and PXR, including the environmental chemicals that activate these receptors, the genes they control, and the physiological processes that are perturbed or depend on CAR and PXR action. This knowledge contributes to a foundation that will be necessary to discern interindividual differences in the downstream biological pathways regulated by these key nuclear receptors.									44	2	0	43	0	47			1875-6921	1875-6913		BCI:BCI200900415779	20871735

We do this using the recursive formulas developed by Elkies to describe explicit modular towers. In particular, we give two explicit constructions based on two examples of his formulas and demonstrate that the resulting elements have high order. Between the two constructions, we are able to generate high order elements in every characteristic. Despite the use of the modular recursions of Elkies, our methods are quite elementary and require no knowledge of modular curves. We compare our results to a recent result of Voloch. In order to do this, we state and prove a slightly more refined version of a special case of his result.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0925-1022			WOS:000263891100007

Development of the Black Soldier Fly (Diptera: Stratiomyidae) in Relation to Temperature								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				38	3			930	934					JUN 2009	2009	The black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens L., was reared on a grain-based diet at 27, 30, and 36 degrees C. Survival of 4- to 6-d-old larvae to adults averaged 74-97% at 27 and 30 degrees C but was only 0.1% at 36 degrees C. Flies required a mean of approximate to 4 d (11%) longer to complete larval and pupal development at 27 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. At 27 and 30 degrees C, females weighed an average of 17-19% more than males but required an average of 0.6-0.8 d (3.0-4.3%) longer to complete larval development. At both temperatures, adult females lived an average of approximate to 3.5 d less than adult mates. The duration of larval development was a significant predictor of adult longevity. Temperature differences of even 3 degrees C produce significant fitness tradeoffs for males and females, influencing life history attributes and having practical applications for forensic entomology.									22	5	0	18	0	27			0046-225X			WOS:000266655800047	19508804

RAC was evaluated by investigating the effect of column operational parameters (column capacity factor, k', and solute initial concentration, C (0)) on DOM fractionation and subsequent disinfection by-product formation. Efficacy of RO was dependent on both isolation conditions and source water characteristics. In general, RO more effectively isolated DOM in high specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)) water than low SUVA(254) water, and showed higher DOM recovery at ambient pH (similar to 7) than at low pH (similar to 4). The fractionation of the isolated DOM indicated that the relative amount of the hydrophobic fraction decreased with increasing k', thus affecting the overall distribution of DOM. However, the distribution of DOM fractions was not influenced by varying C (0) up to 150 mg l(-1) at k' of 15. The effect of k' on the formation and speciation of trihalomethanes (THM) and haloacetic acids (HAA) was not significant up to k' of 30.									17	0	0	15	0	17			0167-6369			WOS:000265917200026	18566905

Spreading of liquid droplets on permeable polymeric surfaces								EPL				86	6					64004	10.1209/0295-5075/86/64004			JUN 2009	2009	The spreading of liquid droplets on viscous liquid and glassy polymer films has been studied with molecular dynamics simulations. Unlike spreading on solid surfaces the liquid droplet simultaneously spreads and permeates the film, a process that takes place at a large variety of interfaces from biomembranes to thin coatings. The degree of interpenetration and amount of damping from the film depends on the viscosity of the film and the relative interaction of the droplet and film. For low viscosity liquid films, the interpenetration of the droplet follows a t(1/2) Fickian power law and the droplet spreads without a precursor foot. For very viscous films a precursor foot spreads ahead of the film, and the droplet does not penetrate the film. The kinetic, hydrodynamic, and combined kinetic/hydrodynamic models of droplet spreading have been generalized to include the absorption of the droplet by the film and are used to analyze the droplet spreading.

Differential Effects of Peer Tutoring in Co-Taught and Non-Co-Taught Classes: Results for Content Learning and Student-Teacher Interactions								EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN				75	4			493	510					SUM 2009	2009	Differential effects of a peer-tutoring intervention on the academic achievement of 203 7th-grade science students with and without disabilities in co-teaching and non-co-teaching settings were examined over an 8-week period. Impact of peer tutoring was assessed using a 2 condition by 2 settings by 2 types of students analysis of covariance with pretests as covariates. Results indicate that the peer-tutoring intervention was associated with improvements in student performance, and students in co-teaching settings perform better than those in non-co-teaching settings, but no additional value was added when peer tutoring was implemented in co-taught classrooms. Because co-teaching is increasingly used for teaching students with disabilities in general education classroom settings, implications of these findings for current practice and the need for future research are discussed.									24	0	0	0	1	25			0014-4029			WOS:000272668500006

GROUND-DWELLING ARTHROPOD ASSOCIATION WITH COARSE WOODY DEBRIS FOLLOWING LONG-TERM DORMANT SEASON PRESCRIBED BURNING IN THE LONGLEAF PINE FLATWOODS OF NORTH FLORIDA								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				92	2			229	242					JUN 2009	2009	A 5-year study of long-term (40 years) study plots was conducted on the Osceola National Forest in northern Florida to determine how dormant-season fire frequency (annual, biennial, quadrennial, or unburned) affects ground-dwelling macroarthropod use of coarse woody debris in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests. Pitfall traps were used to sample arthropods near logs or metal drift fences of equal length. Samples were identified to genus or the lowest practical taxonomic level. Overall, significantly more arthropods and more arthropod biomass were captured near drift fences than neat, logs. Similarity of arthropods captured near logs or drift fences ranged from 64.4% in annually burned plots to 69.2% in quadrennially burned plots, with no significant differences noted. Likewise, Shannon diversity, evenness, richness, and number of rare genera were the same for traps regardless of the trap location. Interaction between fires and trap location were observed in 31 of 932 arthropod taxa. Of those, 10 taxa had significantly higher numbers captured in traps near logs in some burn treatments but there was no consistent pattern between log use and fire frequency. In most cases, more were captured in log pitfalls in frequently burned plots but that was not the case for at least 4 taxa. Where interactions between trap location and fire frequency were not significant, arthropods in an additional 101 taxa were captured in higher numbers at 1 trap location or the other. Of those, 73 were captured in higher numbers in pitfalls near drift fences and 28 were captured in higher numbers near logs. Results showed no increase in log usage by general or more mobile ground-dwelling arthropods as more frequent burning reduced the herbaceous and woody under story. However, logs were clearly important to a wide variety of arthropods regardless of burn frequency.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0015-4040			WOS:000266962700006		
J	Moldenhauer, Matthew C.; Bolding, M. Chad								Parcelization of South Carolina's private forestland: Loggers' reactions to a growing threat								FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL				59	6			37	43					JUN 2009	2009	Increasing populations and sprawling metropolitan areas are encouraging the subdivision (parcelization) of privately owned forested tracts. Major landownership changes, led by a realignment of the forest products industry land base, have exacerbated the issue. As a result, harvestable tract size is reduced, equipment moving frequency is increased, and costs related to timber production increase. Through a survey of South Carolina logging firms, this paper explores these and other related issues. Seventy-three percent of respondents have observed a reduction in their average harvested parcel size. In 1998, most were harvesting tracts 80 acres or larger, whereas they currently operate on tracts averaging 20 to 40 acres. In adapting to smaller tract sizes, 32 percent have reduced their number of employees; 26 percent have downsized their system; 15 percent refused to harvest small tracts; and 13 percent have increased their productivity. Thirteen percent of responding firms have made no adjustments to their operation in reaction to parcel size. Despite observing a reduction in parcel size, results indicate that high fixed costs and fuel prices are currently greater threats to firm viability than parcelization. Although expenses were high at the time of this survey, they routinely fluctuate. Logging firms must, therefore, realize the permanence of parcelization and adjust their systems accordingly. The forestry community must work together to improve management practices on smaller tracts and to minimize the continued parcelization of the landscape.									11	1	0	5	0	12			0015-7473			WOS:000269459800005

J	Yan, Jun; Chen, Jingbo; Zhang, Tingting; Liu, Jianxiu; Liu, Haibo								Evaluation of Aluminum Tolerance and Nutrient Uptake of 50 Centipedegrass Accessions and Cultivars								HORTSCIENCE				44	3			857	861					JUN 2009	2009	Centipedegrass [Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro) Hack] is a native grass of China, and information on soil adaptation ranges, including acid soils, among centi-pedegrass cultivars is limited. Therefore, objectives of this study were 1) to conduct a preliminary evaluation of relative aluminum tolerance of 48 centipedegrass accessions plus a cultivar, TifBlair, and a common centipedegrass under aluminum (Al) stress (0 and 1500 mu M Al) by using a solution culture method; and 2) to determine Al effects on nutrient uptake between resistant-group and sensitive-group accessions among the 50 accessions and cultivars. Differences were found among accessions and cultivars, and the CV of relative root weight, relative shoot weight, and relative total weight were 39.9%, 32.9%, and 33.6%, respectively. After growing 28 days in an acid subsoil, the resistant-group accessions showed much better growth than the sensitive-group accessions. The Al concentrations in roots and shoots of the two groups of accessions were increased under Al treatment, but most absorbed Al remained in roots with greater Al absorption among the sensitive group compared with the resistant group. The concentrations of phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and potassium (K) in the two groups were reduced under Al stress with reductions of 59.3%, 54.8%, 47.9%, and 41.3% in shoots and reductions of 8.70%, 52.5%, 43.2%, and 34.4% in roots, respectively. Under Al stress, differences in P, Mg, and Ca concentrations were found between the two groups; however, differences were not found for K. The resistant-group accessions maintained higher concentrations of Mg and Ca than the sensitive group.									2	6	0	2	0	8			0018-5345			WOS:000267154900210

A homography-based visual servo control approach is used to address the six degrees-of-freedom regulation problem. A high-gain robust controller is developed to asymptotically stabilize the rotation error, and an adaptive controller is developed to stabilize the translation error while compensating for the unknown depth information and intrinsic camera calibration parameters. A Lyapunov-based analysis is used to examine the stability of the developed controller.									46	7	0	0	0	51			0018-9286	1558-2523		WOS:000267064000016		
J	Chen, Zhichao; Birchfield, Stanley T.								Qualitative Vision-Based Path Following								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS				25	3	SI		749	754		10.1109/TRO.2009.2017140			JUN 2009	2009	We present a simple approach for vision-based path following for a mobile robot. Based upon a novel concept called the funnel lane, the coordinates of feature points during the replay phase are compared with those obtained during the teaching phase in order to determine the turning direction. Increased robustness is achieved by coupling the feature coordinates with odometry information. The system requires a single off-the-shelf, forward-looking camera with no calibration (either external or internal, including lens distortion). Implicit calibration of the system is needed only in the form of a single controller gain. The algorithm is qualitative in nature, requiring no map of the environment, no image Jacobian, no homography, no fundamental matrix, and no assumption about a flat ground plane. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of real-time autonomous navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments and on flat, slanted, and rough terrain with dynamic occluding objects for distances of hundreds of meters. We also demonstrate that the same approach works with wide-angle and omnidirectional cameras with only slight modification.									34	2	0	0	0	36			1552-3098	1941-0468		WOS:000266878300027

Sensors are modeled using probability of detection. Due to environmental effects, this probability will not be constant over the entire region. We map this problem to a graph-search problem, and even though deterministic graph search is NP-complete, we derive a tractable optimal probabilistic search strategy. We do this by defining the problem as a dynamic game played on a Markov chain. We prove that this strategy is optimal in the sense of Nash. Simulations of an example problem illustrate our approach and verify our claims.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1083-4419	1941-0492		WOS:000266069600004	19174351

Although the framework makes few algorithmic assumptions, it was designed specifically with support for implementation of relaxation-based branch-and-bound algorithms in mind. Achieving efficiency for such algorithms is particularly challenging and involves a careful analysis of the trade-offs inherent in the mechanisms for sharing the large amounts of information that can be generated. We present computational results that illustrate the degree to which various sources of parallel overhead affect scalability and discuss why properties of the problem class itself can have a substantial effect on the efficiency of a particular methodology.

A power law relationship is developed between the Sherwood number for evaporation (Sh) and the Rayleigh number for air-side natural convection (Ra). Evaporation of water was investigated in sixteen different tanks having four depths and four widths. Evaporation rates and the relevant temperatures and relative humidity were measured, from which the air-side Sherwood and Rayleigh numbers were obtained. The resulting power law is Sh similar to Ra(0.321). This power law is compared to those obtained by other researchers. A brief discussion of the possible effect of water-side natural convection on evaporation is also presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Four variables (grade level taught, content area taught, level of support received, and self-efficacy for teaching inquiry) were significantly correlated to two dependent variables, percentage of time that students are engaged in inquiry during a typical lesson and the perceived ideal percentage of instructional time that should be devoted to inquiry. Specifically, elementary school teachers reported using inquiry-based practices more than either middle-school or high-school teachers; similarly, elementary-school teachers believed such practices should be used more often. All groups, however, reported believing in an ideal percentage of time devoted to inquiry instruction that was significantly greater than their reported percentage of time actually spent on inquiry instruction. A disordinal effect was found between grade level taught and content area taught; at the elementary level, science teachers reported both an ideal and actual percentage of time on inquiry higher than those reported by the math teachers, while at the high school level math teachers reported both an ideal and actual percentage of time on inquiry higher than those reported by the science teachers. No correlations were found between typical and ideal percentage of time devoted to inquiry and subject matter content knowledge training, gender, years of teaching experience, or maximum degree earned.									17	0	0	0	0	17			1571-0068			WOS:000207961500007

Etched dentin substrates were assigned to 6 treatment groups: (1) 0.2% CHX + SB1; (2) 2% CHX + SB1; (3) SB1 (control); (4) 0.2% CHX + XPB; (5) 2% CHX + XPB; (6) XPB (control). Composite buildups were made and beams prepared for microtensile bond strength testing. Beams were divided into 3 subgroups and either immediately pulled to failure or stored in artificial saliva for 6 or 12 months prior to testing. Data were evaluated with three-way ANOVA. Additional adhesive interfaces were prepared to investigate nanoleakage expression by TEM.Results: SB1 and XPB showed similar immediate bond strength values with or without CHX pretreatment (p > 0.05). After 12 months, bonds fell from 43.9 +/- 9.5 MPa to 20.1 +/- 5.4 MPa and from 39.6 +/- 9.4 MPa to 14.2 +/- 5.0 MPa in control specimens for SB1 and XPB respectively, while bond fell only from 41.9 +/- 9.6MPa to 33.2 +/- 8.3 MPa and 38.3 +/- 8.9 MPa to 26.5 +/- 10.9 (for SB1 and XPB, respectively) when 0.2% CHX was previously used. CHX concentration did not affect bond strength values (0.2% vs 2%, p > 0.05). Nanoleakage increased during aging in controls, but reduced silver deposits were found in CHX-treated specimens.Conclusion: Chlorhexidine significantly reduced the loss of bond strength seen in control bonds. Since no bacterial growth was present in the aging conditions, the results of this study suggest that endogenous factors thought to degrade the adhesive interface can be inhibited by CHX. Further in vivo trials should confirm the role of CHX in bond durability.									54	1	0	9	3	58			1461-5185			WOS:000267093800003	19603582

The unique structure consists of an amorphous structure, 5-15 nm fine nanocrystalline regions, and coherent interfaces between the resulting nanocrystalline regions. Measurements of the thermopower, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity have been performed over a range of temperature of 300-400 K. We found that MS technique can give us considerable control over the resulting nanostructure with good thermal stability during the temperature range of 300-400 K and this unique structure can effectively adjust the transport of phonons and electrons, in a manner such that it is beneficial to the overall thermoelectric performance of the material, primarily a reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity. Subsequently, this results in a maximum figure of merit ZT value of 1.56 at 300 K for p-type Bi(0.52)Sb(1.48)Te(3) bulk material. This ZT value is over a 50% improvement of that of the state of the art commercial Bi(2)Te(3) materials. We also report results of thermal cycling of this material for over one hundred cycles between 300-400 K. Our work offers an innovative route for developing high performance bismuth telluride based alloys and devices, which have even broader prospects for commercial applications. This technique may also be applicable to other thermoelectric materials. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics. [DOI: 10.1063/1.3143104]									105	7	0	1	0	106			0021-8979			WOS:000267053200079

With stereolithography, they can be fabricated into scaffolds with desired topography for repairing bone defects in irregular shapes. In this study, we developed a series of light curable chitosans, which have photocurability and good solubility in organic solvent. Through adjusting the feeding ratio of the raw components, the content of photocurable groups in the backbone of chitosan can be controlled. The light curable chitosans were characterized through FTIR-ATR and (1)H NMR, which also confirmed their controllable photocurability. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were co-cultured with the photocured samples for 7 days and the results indicated that these photocured chitosans are cyto-compatible. Scaffolds with interconnected pores, fabricated using salt leaching and photocuring and seeded with fetal bovine osteoblasts, were implanted subcutaneously in the backs of athymic rat. Histological study on the implants at 6 weeks showed that the photocured chitosans have good osteoconductivity. The results indicated the light curable chitosans have good biocompatibility and osteoconductivity. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is Better to Receive than to Give: Advice Network Effects on Job and Work-Unit Attachment								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY				24	2			139	152		10.1007/s10869-009-9095-3			JUN 2009	2009	The purpose of this paper was to investigate the relationship between advice-giving, advice-receiving, and employee work attitudes. We argue that (1) both advice-receiving and advice-giving will be positively related to job involvement; (2) advice-receiving will be more strongly associated with work-unit commitment than advice-giving; and (3) job involvement will mediate the relationship between advice-receiving and work-unit commitment.We conducted an empirical study of admissions department employees at a large university in southwest Pennsylvania in the United States. Respondents completed surveys which included questions related to demographics, social network ties, and attitudes.We found that while advice-giving and advice-receiving were positively related to job involvement, only advice-receiving was positively related to work-unit commitment. Job involvement fully mediated the relationship between advice-receiving and work-unit commitment.Our study (1) shows that advice-giving and advice-receiving are related to important work-related attitudes in organizations; (2) highlights the importance of the directionality of advice flow, as employees who received as opposed to provided advice tended to have higher levels of work-unit commitment; and (3) demonstrates that social network ties were related to work-unit attachment through job involvement.We examine job involvement and work-unit commitment using a social network analysis thus providing new insights about the relationships between advice-giving, advice-receiving and these important variables.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0889-3268			WOS:000266496800003

Fidelity of External Boll Feeding Lesions to Internal Damage for Assessing Stink Bug Damage in Cotton								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				102	3			1344	1351					JUN 2009	2009	Previous research showed that the most precise estimates of stink bug damage in developing cotton bolls are obtained by collecting soft quarter-sized bolls and dissecting them for signs of internal feeding damage, such as internal boll wall warts and/or stained lint. However, this method requires considerable time and effort; therefore, scouts and growers are unwilling to invest adequate resources to make sound pest management decisions. Here, the authors evaluated enumeration of external feeding lesions on groups of 10, 15, 20, or 25 bolls per sample as an alternative sampling procedure. Results relate the similarity of external boll feeding lesions to internal damage as a function of boll sample size and external lesion tally. Inverse prediction confidence intervals (CIs) were also calculated to predict internal boll damage on a new sample based only on external feeding lesions. Results show that linear regression model fit increased when examining at least 20 bolls per sample, and only one external lesion per boll provided as good of model fit as using a minimum of two, three, or four lesions per boll. Inverse prediction CIs suggested that more than one sample (20 bolls per sample) will be required to make external lesions an acceptable method for making reasonably accurate management decisions. F-test lack of fit and significant regression models suggest that examination of external lesions is a promising a method for estimating stink bug damage in cotton.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0022-0493			WOS:000266641700062	19610456	
J	Andrus, Ronald D.; Hayati, Hossein; Mohanan, Nisha P.								Correcting Liquefaction Resistance for Aged Sands Using Measured to Estimated Velocity Ratio								JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING				135	6			735	744		10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000025			JUN 2009	2009	Factors for correcting liquefaction resistance for aged sands using ratios of measured to estimated shear-wave velocity (MEVR) are derived in this paper. Estimated values of shear-wave velocity (V(S)) are computed for 91 penetration resistance-V(S) data pairs using previously published relationships. Linear regression is performed on values of MEVR and corresponding average age. Age of the sand layer is taken as the time between V(S) measurements and initial deposition or last critical disturbance. It is found that MEVR increases by a factor of about 0.08 per log cycle of time, and time equals about 6 years on average when MEVR equals 1 for the recommended penetration resistance-V(S) relationships. The resulting regression equation is combined with the strength gain equation reported by Hayati 2008 in "Proc., Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering and Soil Dynamics IV," to produce a MEVR versus deposit resistance correction relationship. This new corrective relationship is applied to create liquefaction resistance curves based on V(S), standard penetration test blow count, and cone tip resistance for sands of various ages (or MEVRs). Because age of natural soil deposits is usually difficult to accurately determine, MEVR appears to be a promising alternative.									18	1	0	0	0	19			1090-0241			WOS:000266206200003		
J	Korn, Nancy; Ellis, Steven								Immunohistochemical Detection of Ki67 in Glycol Methacrylate Sections Using Unfixed Tissues and Alkaline Antigen Retrieval Techniques								JOURNAL OF HISTOTECHNOLOGY				32	2			60	63					JUN 2009	2009	Assessing cell proliferation through immunohistochemical procedures is an important component of many research projects. Unfortunately, published protocols often yield inconsistent results in individual laboratories. We present a method for glycol methacrylate embedding and antigen retrieval with alkaline solutions to detect Ki67 antigen. In brief, fresh tissues are dehydrated through a series of catalyzed resin solutions, and then embedded for standard microtomy at 1.5-2 mu m. Cut sections were mounted on slides and pretreated with a 0.2% NaOH solution for 1.5-2 minutes and then stained to detect Ki67 according to standard immunohistochemical protocols. Secondary detection reagents tested in the development of this protocol included HRP/DAB combinations, Au/Ag staining procedures, and fluorescent secondary antibodies. Antigen sites could not be demonstrated in aldehyde-fixed tissues, but were readily demonstrated in the unfixed tissues after alkaline antigen retrieval. The method described is a simple, inexpensive, and rapid procedure to allow antigen detection. The method may have additional utility in the demonstration of other nuclear antigens.

J	Ellis, Steven; Marsh, Marlee; McNutt-Scott, Tamara; Calcatera, Samantha; Balsone, Nicole								"Design-an-Alien" Exercises in Histologic Instruction: A Means to Promote Conceptualization and Critical Thinking								JOURNAL OF HISTOTECHNOLOGY				32	2			76	79					JUN 2009	2009	General histology classes are ideal venues for teaching students about the inherent complementarity of structure and function in a biological systems context. Unfortunately, many students focus more on rote memorization than on a conceptual understanding of histologic principles. A strategy to promote conceptualization and critical thinking was tested over three course offerings of a senior/graduate-level Animal Histology course at Clemson University. Students were asked to either "reverse engineer" randomly selected but somewhat esoteric animal organs (e.g., spider silk glands, squid ink glands), or to hypothesize on histologic features of alien or fictional anatomy from popular cinematic productions (Star Wars, Spiderman, etc.). In both cases, students were given very limited starting information (e.g., the alien has blue skin and comes from a very dry planet) and asked to speculate on histologic structures. Overall, students were very engaged in the exercises and reported a high degree of satisfaction, appreciation, and learning. When real-world examples were used (e.g., spider glands), students were somewhat frustrated if confirming information was not readily available in the online literature. In the more abstract circumstances, the students seemed to focus more on the conceptual framework and logical premise behind each feature of imagined alien histology because they knew that no real answers would be available to confirm their hypotheses. Implementation in the classroom included active participation, group work, and individual decision making and rationalization. Exercises that promote the development of critical thinking skills may have utility well beyond the next histology exam and could serve as useful models for additional subjects, including anatomy, physiology, and others.

USING HYDROGEN ISOTOPES TO ASSIGN ORIGINS OF BATS IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES								JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY				90	3			743	751		10.1644/08-MAMM-A-211R2.1			JUN 2009	2009	Stable hydrogen isotopes (delta Ds) in metabolically inert tissues such as feathers and hair provide a set of endogenous markers that may be useful for establishing migratory connectivity in animals. We tested the assumption of a clear relationship between delta D values of growing-season-weighted average precipitation (delta D(p)) derived from 2 geographic information system (GIS) models or latitude (LAT) and delta D values in bat hair (delta D(h)), and examined intra- and interspecific variation in delta D(h) of 4 bat species in the eastern United States. We analyzed 251 hair samples from 1 long-distance migrant (eastern red bat [Lasiurus borealis]) and 3 regional migrants (Indiana bat [Myotis sodalis], northern long-eared bat [M. septentrionalis], and little brown bat [M. lucifugus]) captured during the reproductive period (pregnancy and lactation) when bats are resident. LAT explained more of the variation in delta D(h) than delta D(p) derived from either of the GIS-based models, although 1 model of delta D(p) performed better for some species. We found significant intraspecific differences in the relationships between delta D(h) and LAT and between delta D(h) and estimates of delta D(p) derived from Bowen et al. (delta D(pB)) for L. borealis, and significant variation in the regression equations of delta D(h) and LAT and delta D(h) and delta D(p) among species for adult females and adult males. Stable hydrogen isotope analysis may be a valuable tool for studying migratory connectivity in bats, but significant intra- and interspecific variation in delta D(h) values suggests that pooling across sex and age categories and use of surrogate species should be avoided.									22	0	0	21	0	22			0022-2372			WOS:000266952900023

We expand this perspective by conceptualizing innovation as a vertically decoupled, inter-organizational process and by studying the role of research universities as suppliers of discoveries to this market for innovation. We combined logic from agency and real options theories to explain why the outcomes of technology commercialization are a function of licensing strategies, the autonomy of technology licensing offices (TLOs), and the incentives bestowed on scientists, research departments, and TLO officers. We rely on data from licensing surveys, interviews with 128 TLO directors, and - for convergent validity - from web-based searches of the TLOs of American universities and the US Patent and Trademark Office. Results suggest that commercialization outcomes (in this case, revenue and start-up creation) are enhanced when TLOs employ diverse licensing strategies, TLOs enjoy greater autonomy, universities share revenues with scientists' departments, and universities compensate TLOs officers well. Results also show that late entrants - typically underperforming universities - inflate royalty shares to scientists as a means to rectify their commercialization record. We conclude with a discussion of this study's contribution to the literature on innovation and technology commercialization.									21	1	0	0	0	22			0022-2380	1467-6486		WOS:000265509800003

This study explores the utilization of an artificial neural network (ANN) in predicting the fatigue life of rubberized asphalt concrete mixtures containing reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). Over 190 fatigue beams were made with two different rubber types (ambient and cryogenic), two different RAP sources, four rubber contents (0, 5, 10, and 15%), and tested at two different testing temperatures of 5 and 20 degrees C. The data were organized into nine or 10 independent variables covering the material engineering properties of the fatigue beams and one dependent variable, the ultimate fatigue life of the modified mixtures. The traditional statistical method was also used to predict the fatigue life of these mixtures. The results of this study showed that the ANN techniques are more effective in predicting the fatigue life of the modified mixtures tested in this study than the traditional statistical-based prediction models.									29	0	0	0	3	31			0899-1561			WOS:000266206900003

Thus, buffer-free aqueous solutions of GOx were ultrasonicated (23 kHz at 4 degrees C) for different periods of time (10, 30, and 60 min) and studied in terms of their enzymatic activity. The ultrasonicated GOx was also Studied by UV/vis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and by thermogravimetric analysis, and compared with pristine GOx. The CD spectra of ultrasonicated GOx showed a different composition with reduced alpha-helix and beta-sheet fractions upon extended sonication compared with the pristine GOx. Along with the changes of the secondary structure, the enzymatic activity measured via HRP-coupled bioassay of the sonicated GOx showed a small corresponding decrease. Low temperature ultrasonic processing of GOx does not appreciably compromise bioactivity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									13	2	0	4	0	15			1381-1177			WOS:000265584200019

Participants responded to questions regarding 11 attitude objects that assessed the overall evaluation of the object and the strength-related dimensions of importance, certainty, and relevance. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a 4-factor solution underlying the self-report and extremity dimensions across the 11 attitude objects, with importance and relevance and certainty and extremity loading on 2 second-order factors. The need to evaluate, need for affect, sense of coherence, dogmatism, and personal fear of invalidity were all related at the bivariate level to at least one strength-related dimension. The need to evaluate and the need for affect independently predicted variance in certainty/extremity across the attitude objects and sense of coherence and dogmatism predicted unique variance in importance/relevance across objects. Discussion focuses on the possible processes by which personality variables predict strength-related dimensions across objects.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0022-3506			WOS:000265429300009	20078740	
J	Crickenberger, Sam; Sotka, Erik								TEMPORAL SHIFTS OF FOULING COMMUNITIES IN CHARLESTON HARBOR WITH A REPORT OF PERNA VIRIDIS (MYTILIDAE)								Journal of the North Carolina Academy of Science				125	2			78	84					SUM 2009	2009	Since the seminal work on the succession of fouling communities by John Sutherland during the 1970s, little information on fouling communities of the southeastern United States has been published. This lack of information amounts to few opportunities to survey for the presence of non-indigenous species, which can have profound ecological and economic influences. Non-indigenous species are often transported through ship ballast water and other human mediated vectors making large ports ideal locations to monitor for non-indigenous species. In Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, one of the largest ports in the southeastern United States, we monitored settlement onto 10 cm X 10 cm fouling plates every two weeks from February 2006 to February 2007, and compared these settlement patterns with seasonal shifts in fouling communities. Obelia spp. hydroids were the dominant recruits during the summer, while the hydroid Tubularia crocea dominated the rest of the year. T crocea was also abundant in adult communities along with associated corophid amphipod domiciles. Abundance of the nudibranch Cratena pilata and T crocea closely mirrored one another in recruitment and adult communities. The non-indigenous Asian green mussel Perna viridis, previously undocumented in South Carolina, was found indicating the need for extended monitoring efforts.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-6220			BCI:BCI200900449078

The decomposition of sodium bicarbonate involves two reaction products H(2)O and CO(2), which are not evident from either TG or DSC measurements alone.

EDTA enhances high-throughput two-dimensional bioprinting by inhibiting salt scaling and cell aggregation at the nozzle surface								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				3	4			260	268		10.1002/term.162			JUN 2009	2009	Tissue-engineering strategies may be employed in the development of in vitro breast tissue models for use in testing regimens of drug therapies and vaccines. The physical and chemical interactions that occur among cells and extracellular matrix components can also be elucidated with these models to gain an understanding of the progression of transformed epithelial cells into tumours and the ultimate metastases of tumour cells. The modified inkjet printer may be a useful tool for creating three-dimensional (M) in vitro models, because it offers an inexpensive and high-throughput solution to microfabrication, and because the printer can be easily manipulated to produce varying tissue attributes. We hypothesized, however, that when ink is replaced with a biologically based fluid (i.e. a 'bio-ink'), specifically a serum-free cell culture medium, printer nozzle failure can result from salt scale build-up as fluid evaporates on the printhead surface. In this study, ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) was used as a culture medium additive to prevent salt scaling and cell aggregation during the bioprinting process. The results showed that EDTA, at a concentration typically found in commercially available trypsin solutions (0.53 mm), prevented nozzle failure when a serum-free culture medium was printed from a nozzle at 1000 drops/s. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of EDTA appeared to mildly decrease aggregation of 4T07 cells. Cell viability studies were performed to demonstrate that addition of EDTA did not result in significant cell death. in conclusion, it is recommended that EDTA be incorporated into bio-ink solutions containing salts that could lead to nozzle failure.

Elastin is necessary to sustain continual pulsatile flow and to prevent the dilatation of vascular tissues. Unfortunately, elastogenesis in tissue-engineered constructs has been very limited. To overcome this limitation, we have created tubular elastin scaffolds from porcine carotid arteries. Elastin would provide the necessary elasticity to the graft on implanting these scaffolds as vascular grafts. In this study, elastin tubes with agarose gel containing either stromal-derived factor-1 alpha [SDF; for homing of endothelial cells (ECs)] or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; for homing of myofibroblasts) were implanted into adipose tissue, as it is a known source of stem/progenitor cells. We also implanted these tubes into subdermal pouches (as a control location). We observed a difference in the types of cells recruited - ECs were recruited in large numbers by SDF in the adipose tissue, whereas the adipose-FGF group had a vascularized (smooth muscle and EC-positive), collagenous capsule (adventitia) with many smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA)-positive cells in the elastin scaffold layer (media). These results were in contrast to the subdermal group, which only recruited fibroblasts and some SMA-positive cells. Also, more cell infiltration and neo-collagen formation was seen in adipose implants. This study provides novel results by the use of specific cytokines and implant locations to recruit tissue-specific cells to create autologous vascular grafts.

J	Stevens-Smith, Deborah								PROFILES OF DOMINANCE IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION								KINESIOLOGY				41	1			40	51					JUN 2009	2009	The purpose of this study was to determine the dominance preferences of physical educators and the impact the profiles can have on pedagogical knowledge in the teaching/learning environment. Participants completed a self-assessment of dominant preferences survey in the areas of the brain hemisphere, eye, ear, hand and foot preference. Chi-square and cross-tab analysis were used to analyze the data according to age, sex, and teaching experience. A basic dominance profile for physical educators in the study was determined and the results revealed a profile of equal distribution for left and right-brain dominance and predominantly the right eye, ear, hand and foot preferences for the group. The profile for this group of physical educators was different from the profile of educators in previous research. The strengths of the left-brain dominants were in the visual, auditory, and movement preferences, while the weaknesses were in the kinesthetic preferences. The strengths for the right-brain dominants were only in the kinesthetic preferences, while the weaknesses were in the visual, auditory, and movement areas.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1331-1441			WOS:000268648600004

Reconciling conflicting findings in the literature, we demonstrate that whereas psychological safety is an important antecedent of knowledge sharing, the relationship between psychological safety and knowledge sharing is moderated by the level of confidence that employees have in what they know. The greater this confidence, the lesser is the importance of psychological safety in facilitating knowledge sharing. Linking this result to social network theory, we find that psychological safety increases with the frequency of communication among coworkers and that the confidence of employees in their knowledge is related to the codifiability of the knowledge involved. We further investigate direct and indirect antecedents of psychological safety. This research offers insights into actions that managers can take to enhance psychological safety and, consequently, motivate their employees to share knowledge.									40	3	0	0	0	43			1523-4614			WOS:000268136500004		
J	Jayanthi, Shekhar; Roth, Aleda V.; Kristal, Mehmet M.; Venu, Lauren Carter-Roth								Strategic Resource Dynamics of Manufacturing Firms								MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				55	6			1060	1076		10.1287/mnsc.1090.1002			JUN 2009	2009	We conceptualize strategic decision-making processes within a manufacturing firm as streams of resources allocated to short-and long-term changes. The analogous ecological model, referred to as the Lotka-Volterra model, captures this dynamic tension between decisions made by the firm and its manufacturing operations. This representation leads to evolutionarily stable manufacturing strategies (ESMSs), which contribute to a firm's competitive advantage in different ways. Using a random sample of 30 firms from the U. S. semiconductor industry, we estimate parameters of the model and arrive at four ESMSs or strategic manufacturing groups that reflect theoretically and empirically distinctive adaptation patterns through their dynamic resource allocations. We observe that a majority of the firms were classified in one of the four groups, with relatively fewer firms in the other three. Notably, our classification based on ecology models agrees well with taxonomies in manufacturing and business strategy theory. Furthermore, our analysis shows significant differences among manufacturing practices and competitive capabilities of the four strategic groups. Managerially, these insights could provide the foundation to implement strategic changes that enable firms to leapfrog from one ESMS to another. This study also paves the way for development of a meso theory of the dynamics of manufacturing strategy.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0025-1909			WOS:000267197800015		
J	Rieber, Nicole; Betz, Lisa; Enck, Paul; Muth, Eric; Nikendei, Christoph; Schrauth, Markus; Werner, Anne; Kowalski, Axel; Zipfel, Stephan								Effects of medical training scenarios on heart rate variability and motivation in students and simulated patients								MEDICAL EDUCATION				43	6			553	556		10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03374.x			JUN 2009	2009	Research regarding the experience of stress during medical training scenarios using standardised patients (SPs) has been primarily qualitative and has focused on the SPs. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate stress and motivation in both students and SPs during these scenarios by measuring heart rate variability (HRV) and administering the German version of the Questionnaire on Current Motivation (QCM).A total of 44 medical students (23 women, 21 men) participated in two medical history-taking training scenarios. In one scenario the SP role-played a patient with a somatic disease; in the other the SP played a patient with a psychosomatic disease, creating easy and difficult scenarios, respectively, for the student. Each student interviewed one of 11 SPs (five women, six men), using the same SP in both scenarios. Heart rate variability was measured during baseline periods and during the training scenarios in both students and SPs. Motivation was assessed before each training scenario.Heart rate variability was lower in both students and SPs during the scenarios compared with baseline values, but did not differ by scenario type. For students, motivation increased when the first scenario involved psychosomatic illness, but decreased when the first condition was somatic. For SPs motivation was consistent over time for scenarios involving psychosomatic disease, but decreased for somatic disease-related scenarios.The training scenarios induced stress in both students and SPs, as indicated by decreased HRV. Student motivation was high, indicating that SP scenarios represent a valid teaching method. Further studies in the natural setting of SP examinations are needed.									6	1	0	3	0	7			0308-0110			WOS:000266112500009	19493179

While we have solid evidence that highly disturbed estuarine systems have dramatic changes in the resident biota (black and white if you will), we lack tools that distinguish the shades of grey. In part, this lack of ability to distinguish shades of grey stems from the analytical tools that have been applied to studies of estuarine systems, and perhaps more important, is the insensitivity of the biological end points that we have used to assess these impacts. In this study, we will present data on the phenotypic adjustments as measured by transcriptomic signatures of a resilient organism (oysters) to land-use practices in the surrounding watershed using advanced machine-learning algorithms. We will demonstrate that such an approach can reveal subtle and meaningful shifts in oyster gene expression in response to land use. Further, the data show that gill tissues are far more responsive and provide superior discrimination of land-use classes than hepatopancreas and that transcripts encoding proteins involved in energy production, protein synthesis and basic metabolism are more robust indicators of land use than classic biomarkers such as metallothioneins, GST and cytochrome P-450.									23	0	0	21	0	23			0962-1083			WOS:000266268800011	19457208

Financial Incentive Programs' Influence in Promoting Sustainable Forestry in the Northern Region								NORTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY				26	2			61	67					JUN 2009	2009	Selected forestry officials in each of the 20 northern states were surveyed concerning their opinions on the public and private financial incentive programs available to nonindustrial private forest owners in their state. The officials were asked to name and describe the programs and to assess forest owners' awareness of each one, its appeal among the owners aware of it, its effectiveness in encouraging sustainable forestry and enabling owners to meet their objectives, and the percentage of program practices that remain in place and enrolled acres that remain in forest over time. They also were asked to suggest ways to improve the programs. The Forest Stewardship, Forest Land Enhancement, and Forest Legacy Programs were among the top-rated federal programs, scoring well for all measures and attributes. Programs sponsored by states and private organizations tended to be more narrowly targeted than federal programs and scored well for specific attributes. The forestry officials' suggestions for program improvement centered largely on program visibility and availability, increasing and ensuring long-term consistency in program funding, and simplifying the application and approval processes.									13	0	0	6	0	14			0742-6348			WOS:000266849300003

Several low-cost measures identified individuals who met WHO ART initiation criteria to the following degree: WHO stages 3 or 4 had 87.5% (95% CI, 82.8-92.1) sensitivity and, by definition, 100% (CI, 100-100) specificity; WHO recommended advance disease TLC cutoffs: sensitivity = 23.9% (95% CI, 17.3-30.5) specificity = 78.2% (95% CI, 67.3-89.1). Low TLC was a common finding, (50 of 214; 23%); however, it did not improve the sensitivity or specificity of clinical staging in identifying the severely immunosuppressed stage 2 children, Growth failure or use of total lymphocyte counts in isolation were not reliable indicators of severe immunosuppression or need to initiate ART.Conclusion: The use of total lymphocyte count does not improve the ability to identify children in need of ART compared with clinical staging alone. Low absolute lymphocyte count did not correlate with severe immunosuppression based on CD4 cell count in this cohort.									4	0	0	2	1	4			0891-3668			WOS:000266433500008	19436238

In the presence of the gap, nontrivial Berry phase effects can be shown to mediate a transverse thermoelectric voltage in response to an applied temperature gradient even in the absence of a perpendicular magnetic field. This spontaneous anomalous Nernst effect is nonzero for nonuniform chemical potential in the two inequivalent valleys in the graphene band structure. Conversely, the Nernst response can be used to create a valley-index polarization between the two transverse sample edges as in the analogous valley Hall effect.									22	0	0	0	0	22			1098-0121			WOS:000267699700131

Noise and resolution effects on the measured dissipation rate have opposite trends, making their separation and accurate corrections difficult. A major task in dissipation rate correction, therefore, is to isolate each effect. The conditional-sampling method presented in this work uses instantaneous local scalar mean and variance as conditioning variables, and is based in part on Kolmogorov's refined similarity hypotheses. It ensures selection of instantaneous fully resolved local scalar fields, which are analyzed to determine the measurement noise. Noise correction is applied to potentially under-resolved local scalar fields, also selected using the conditional-sampling procedure, effectively separating the effects of noise from those of resolution. The error function is used as a model for the potentially under-resolved local scalar fields to evaluate their dissipation length scales and to make corrections for the dissipation rate. The present method uses local instead of spectral analyses; therefore, can be applied to the mean scalar dissipation rate conditional on the scalar values. An application of the method to temperature dissipation rate in a slightly heated turbulent jet shows excellent results, validating the method. The method can also be applied to other challenge situations, such as turbulent flames.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1070-6631			WOS:000267600100027

Single-stranded DNA hybridization capture probes targeting DNA of Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli, causal agent of bacterial fruit blotch, and Didymella bryoniae, causal agent of gummy stem blight, were covalently attached to magnetic particles and used to selectively concentrate template DNA from cucurbit seed samples. Sequestered template DNAs were subsequently amplified by multiplex real-time PCR using pathogen-specific TaqMan PCR assays. The MCH multiplex real-time PCR assay displayed a detection threshold of A. avenae subsp. citrulli at 10 CFU/ml and D. bryoniae at 10(5) conidia/ml in mixtures of pure cultures of the two pathogens, which was 10-fold more sensitive than the direct real-time PCR assays for the two pathogens separately. Although the direct real-time PCR assay displayed a detection threshold for A. avenae subsp. citrulli DNA of 100 fg/mu l in 25% (1/4 samples) of the samples assayed, MCH real-time PCR demonstrated 100% detection frequency (4/4 samples) at the same DNA concentration. MCH did not improve detection sensitivity for D. bryoniae relative to direct real-time PCR using conidial suspensions or seed washes from D. bryoniae-infested cucurbit seed. However, MCH real-time PCR facilitated detection of both target pathogens in watermelon and melon seed samples (n = 5,000 seeds/sample) in which 0.02% of the seed were infested with A. avenae subsp. citrulli and 0.02% were infested with D. bryoniae.									37	5	0	36	0	44			0031-949X			WOS:000266213100005	19453225

Construction of a BAC Library for a Defoliating Insect-Resistant Soybean and Identification of Candidate Clones Using a Novel Approach								PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER				27	2			229	235		10.1007/s11105-008-0077-9			JUN 2009	2009	Positional cloning of an insect-resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) requires the construction of a large-insert genomic DNA library from insect-resistant genotypes. To facilitate cloning of a major defoliating insect-resistance QTL on linkage group M of the soybean genetic map, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library for PI 229358 was constructed and characterized. The HindIII BAC library contains 55,296 clones with an average insert size 131 kb. This library represents a 6-fold soybean haploid genome equivalents, allowing a 99.8% probability of recovering any specific sequence of interest in soybean. BAC filters were screened with a genomic DNA probe Sat_258sc2 obtained through genome walking from flanking sequences of a simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker, Sat_258, which links to the insect-resistance QTL. Thirteen BAC clones were identified positive for Sat_258sc2, and two of them were confirmed to carry Sat_258. The results suggest that this library is useful in positional cloning of the major insect-resistance QTL, and the approach presented here can be used to screen a BAC library for a SSR marker without requiring the creation of BAC pools.									3	3	0	3	0	6			0735-9640			WOS:000266090300003

Methods of analysis for georeferenced sample counts of tarnished plant bugs in cotton								PRECISION AGRICULTURE				10	3			189	212		10.1007/s11119-008-9085-x			JUN 2009	2009	The problem of analyzing georeferenced cotton pest insect samples when a large percentage of the counts are zero is examined. The use of appropriate statistical methods for their analysis is required. To demonstrate this, georeferenced samples (n = 63) of tarnished plant bugs (TPBs; Lygus lineolaris [Palisot de Beauvois] (Heteroptera: Miridae)) were analyzed by three statistical methods and the results were compared. Correlation analysis of the sample counts with 25 classes of cotton growth derived from an unsupervized classification of multispectral imagery was followed by a complete enumeration analysis comprising three scenarios. The first scenario assumed the insect samples were unstratified. A distribution of sample averages was created by complete enumeration of all combinations of samples taken four at a time. The second scenario used imagery of the cotton fields to allocate the samples among three cotton growth categories (marginal, good or best) derived by a supervized classification of the 25 unsupervized classes. The insect samples associated with these categorical habitats were completely enumerated using allocations of 4, 6, 8 or 10 samples at a time from various sample sizes to determine how different allocations affected the results. The mean was not affected, but the standard deviation decreased with increased allocation sizes in all habitats. The third scenario used the two observers and three habitat categories to create six additional complete enumeration distributions by allocating four samples at a time from groups of varying sample sizes. These enumeration distributions are non-parametric estimators of the sampling distribution of: (1) the sample averages of a given sample size when samples are taken from the entire field, (2) the sample averages of a given size when samples are taken from each cotton habitat or (3) the sample averages of a given sample size from samples taken from each habitat by each observer. To support the enumeration analyses, these insect samples were analyzed further by Poisson regression models. These models showed significant differences between TPB counts by the two observers and among the habitats, whereas the observer by habitat interaction was not significant. For every combination of observer and cotton growth category, a Poisson regression model estimated the mean rate of TPB numbers. These means were similar to the corresponding modes of the complete enumeration distributions. The two non-standard methods showed that TPB numbers differed by habitat categories even though there were samples with a zero count, whereas a correlation analysis failed to identify a relationship between TPB sample counts and unsupervized habitat classes.									8	0	0	7	1	9			1385-2256	1573-1618		WOS:000264496400001

The polymer-nanoparticles/nanocomposites have been the exponentially growing field of research for developing the materials in last few decades and have been mainly focusing on the structure-property relationships and their development. Since the polymer-nanocomposites have been the staple of modern polymer industry, their durability under various environmental conditions and degradability after their service life are also essential fields of research. Thus, this article is intended to review the status of worldwide research in this aspect. Among various nanoparticulates, clay minerals and carbon nanotubes are more often used in enhancing physical, mechanical and thermal properties of polymers. In very few systems, the nano particulates have been incorporated into polymer as 'nano-additives' for both purposes: degradation and stabilization of polymers. The degradation and durability of polymers is reviewed in the presence of nanoparticles/nanocomposites under different environmental conditions. Nanoparticle-induced biodegradation of polymers is also discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									264	11	0	19	2	270			0079-6700			WOS:000266529600001

This study examined the effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in white leghorn hatchlings on various developmental, immunological, and clinical health parameters. In addition, serum PFOS concentrations were determined by LC/MS/MS. Embryonic day (ED) 0 eggs were injected with either safflower oil/10% DMSO (control, 0 mg/kg egg wt) or PFOS in safflower oil/10% DMSO at 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg egg wt, and the chicks were grown to post-hatch day (PHD) 14. Treatment with PFOS did not affect hatch rate. Following in ovo exposure chicks exhibited increases in spleen mass at all treatment levels, in liver mass at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg egg wt, and in body length (crown-rump length) at the 5 mg/kg treatment. Right wings were shorter in all treatments compared to control. Increases in the frequency of brain asymmetry were evident in all treatment groups. SRBC-specific immunoglobulin (IgM and IgY combined) titers were decreased significantly at all treatment levels, while plasma lysozyme activity was increased at all treatment levels. The PHA skin test response decreased in relation to increasing PFOS dose. Serum concentrations where significant immunological, morphological, and neurological effects were observed at the lowest dose (I mg/kg egg wt) averaged 154ng PFOS/g serum. These concentrations fall within environmental ranges reported in blood samples from wild caught avian species; thereby, verifying that the environmental egg concentrations used for the injections do indeed relate to serum levels in hatchlings that are also environmentally relevant. These data indicate that immune alterations and brain asymmetry can occur in birds following in ovo exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOS and demonstrates the need for further research on the developmental effects of perfluorinated compounds in various species.

Heritability and transmission analysis of necrotizing meningoencephalitis in the Pug								RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE				86	3			438	442		10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.10.002			JUN 2009	2009	Necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME) in the Pug is an invariably fatal disease with an early age of onset whose cause remains unknown. Breed predilection strongly suggests genetic component(s), and viral etiology proves negative in studied cases. The current study was undertaken as the first analysis of the heritable component(s) involved in NME in the Pug. Complete medical records, individual characteristics, and pedigree information were collected for 58 affected dogs with data pertaining to 4698 dogs analyzed. A high inbreeding coefficient with differences across gender and significant differences across coat color classes and variable expression was evident. Median onset age was 19 months and median survival time 23 days. Screening for herpes-, adeno-, and parvoviruses was negative. The data demonstrate a strong familial inheritance of NME in the Pug. This investigation provides parameters of disease from the largest Pug NME cohort analyzed to date and offers evidence of previously unrecognized familial inheritance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Stabilized Collagen Scaffolds for Heart Valve Tissue Engineering								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A				15	6			1257	1268		10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0263			JUN 2009	2009	Scaffolds for heart valve tissue engineering must function immediately after implantation but also need to tolerate cell infiltration and gradual remodeling. We hypothesized that moderately cross-linked collagen scaffolds would fulfill these requirements. To test our hypothesis, scaffolds prepared from decellularized porcine pericardium were treated with penta-galloyl glucose (PGG), a collagen-binding polyphenol, and tested for biodegradation, biaxial mechanical properties, and in vivo biocompatibility. For controls, we used un-cross-linked scaffolds and glutaraldehyde-treated scaffolds. Results confirmed complete pericardium decellularization and the ability of scaffolds to encourage fibroblast chemotaxis and to aid in creation of anatomically correct valve-shaped constructs. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking fully stabilized collagen but did not allow for tissue remodeling and calcified when implanted subdermally in rats. PGG-treated collagen was initially resistant to collagenase and then degraded gradually, indicating partial stabilization. Moreover, PGG-treated pericardium exhibited excellent biaxial mechanical properties, did not calcify in vivo, and supported infiltration by host fibroblasts and subsequent matrix remodeling. In conclusion, PGG-treated acellular pericardium is a promising scaffold for heart valve tissue engineering.									56	4	0	35	0	59			1937-3341			WOS:000266344600006	18928400

Relationship between urbanization and bat community structure in national parks of the southeastern US								Urban Ecosystems				12	2			197	214		10.1007/s11252-008-0075-6			JUN 2009	2009	Urbanization and development are predicted to increase considerably in the United States over the next several decades, and this is expected to result in large-scale habitat loss, fragmentation and loss of wildlife species. Thus, natural parks and preserves are becomingly increasingly important in the conservation of regional biodiversity. We used mist-nets and AnabatII acoustic detectors to survey bats in 10 national parks in the southeastern U.S. and examined the relationship between bat community structure and development in the surrounding 5 km. We predicted that species richness would increase with park size and that species richness and evenness would decrease with development. Species richness was not related to development or any other landscape characteristics including park size. In contrast, species evenness declined with increasing development. Percent Developed land in the surrounding 5 km area was the only variable that entered into the stepwise regression model. The decrease in species evenness in the urban parks was due to the dominance of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in these parks. The percentage of big brown bats in our captures was positively related to percent Developed land in the surrounding area. Our data suggest that urban parks may be important for conserving regional bat biodiversity. However, the low species evenness in these parks suggests that some bat species may be susceptible to the effects of urbanization and may be extirpated over time. Thus, management of urban as well as rural parks should strive to conserve as much bat roosting and foraging habitat as possible.									11	0	0	11	0	12			1083-8155	1573-1642		BCI:BCI200900286146

Wetlands varied in size, age, vegetation, hydrologic residence time (0.9-20 days) and water management (continuous flow vs. flood pulse). The effects of wetland treatment were determined by analyzing input and outflow waters for dissolved organic carbon concentration and quality, bromide concentration, and formation potentials for nine disinfection byproduct species, including trihalomethanes, haloacetronitriles, chloral hydrate, and haloketones. We hypothesized that hydraulic residence time was a key factor governing differences in disinfection byproduct precursors. Small wetlands (< 3 ha) with short hydraulic residence times (< 2 days) did not produce significant changes in disinfection byproduct precursor concentrations with respect to the agricultural return flows input to the wetlands. In these wetlands hydraulic residence times were not long enough to promote processes that adversely affect dissolved organic carbon and bromide quantity, such as evapoconcentration and leaching from vegetation. Thus, less negative effects were associated with disinfection byproduct formation. In contrast, larger wetlands (> 100 ha) with long hydraulic residence times (> 10 days) resulted in higher dissolved organic carbon and bromide levels, increasing disinfection byproduct formation by factors ranging between 1.7 and 10.2 compared to agricultural return flows. Results from this study provide important information for optimizing the design and management of constructed wetlands to effectively combine control of disinfection byproduct precursors with other water quality parameters.

Behavior of Parent and Nestling Brown Pelicans During Early Brood Rearing								WATERBIRDS				32	2			276	281		10.1675/063.032.0207			JUN 2009	2009	Since their recovery from population declines in the 1960s and 1970s, Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) have become a common breeder on the Atlantic coast of the southeastern U.S.A. Despite their relative abundance, few studies of their breeding biology have been conducted in this region. Parent and nestling behavior during early chick rearing were examined at a colony in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. Rates of parental and chick feeding decreased linearly with chick age. Rates of parental attendance, chick begging and chick aggression all peaked when chicks were approximately 21 d post-hatching and then declined. Direct feeding events were never observed when chicks were < 11 d of age and indirect feeding events were rarely observed after chicks were > 15 d of age. The transition from indirect to direct feeding was not accompanied by a change in begging rates. Shifts in the frequencies of both parent and chick behaviors occurred at approximately three weeks post hatching, when chicks achieve thermoregulatory independence and become more mobile. These data suggest that any spatial or temporal comparisons of parent or chick behavior should be assessed in relation to the age category of the parent and the age of the chicks.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1524-4695			WOS:000268266400007

SITE CONDITION, STRUCTURE, AND GROWTH OF BALDCYPRESS ALONG TIDAL/NON-TIDAL SALINITY GRADIENTS								WETLANDS				29	2			505	519					JUN 2009	2009	This report documents changes in forest structure and growth potential of dominant trees in salt-impacted tidal and non-tidal baldcypress wetlands of the southeastern United States. We inventoried basal area and tree height, and monitored incremental growth (in basal area) of codominant baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) trees monthly, for over four years, to examine the inter-relationships among growth, site fertility, and soil physico-chemical characteristics. We found that salinity, soil total nitrogen (TN), flood duration, and flood frequency affected forest structure and growth the greatest. While mean annual site salinity ranged from 0.1 to 3.4 ppt, sites with salinity concentrations of 1.3 ppt or greater supported a basal area of less than 40 m(2)/ha. Where salinity was < 0.7 ppt, basal area was as high as 87 m(2)/ha. Stand height was also negatively affected by higher salinity. However, salinity related only to soil TN concentrations or to the relative balance between soil TN and total phosphorus (TP), which reached a maximum concentration between 1.2 and 2.0 ppt salinity. As estuarine influence shifts inland with sea-level rise, forest growth may become more strongly linked to salinity, not only due to salt effects but also as a consequence of site nitrogen imbalance.									41	0	0	37	0	41			0277-5212			WOS:000268987300009

In aqueous solution buffered at pH 7.4, the polymeric complexes of Zn(2+) are useful receptors for polymeric indicator displacement assays for phosphate and pyrophosphate employing commercial complexometric indicators. Under the same conditions, the Co(3+) effectively hydrolyze p-nitrophenylphosphate with approximately five orders of magnitude rate enhancement versus uncatalyzed hydrolysis. These systems offer promising results as mixed-metal dual detect-decontaminate materials for organophosphorus toxins under mild, neutral aqueous conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

White-rot (Phanerochaete chrysosporium), brown-rot (Gloeophyllum trabeum), and soft-rot (Trichoderma reesei) fungi were used for in situ enzyme production to hydrolyze cellulosic and hemicellulosic components of corn fiber into fermentable sugars. Solid-substrate fermentation of corn fiber by either white- or brown-rot fungi followed by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) with coculture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown a possibility of enhancing wood rot saccharification of corn fiber for ethanol fermentation. The laboratory-scale fungal saccharification and fermentation process incorporated in situ cellulolytic enzyme induction, which enhanced overall enzymatic hydrolysis of hemi/cellulose components of corn fiber into simple sugars (mono-, di-, and trisaccharides). The yeast fermentation of the hydrolyzate yielded 7.8, 8.6, and 4.9 g ethanol per 100 g corn fiber when saccharified with the white-, brown-, and soft-rot fungi, respectively. The highest ethanol yield (8.6 g ethanol per 100 g initial corn fiber) is equivalent to 35% of the theoretical ethanol yield from starch and cellulose in corn fiber. This research has significant commercial potential to increase net ethanol production per bushel of corn through the utilization of corn fiber. There is also a great research opportunity to evaluate the remaining biomass residue (enriched with fungal protein) as animal feed.									17	0	0	13	0	17			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000266237800024	21314197

In order to utilize PFM for low dimensional materials characterization, a comprehensive analytical modeling based on the Coupled motion of PFM in all three directions is proposed. In this respect, the mechanical properties of sample are divided into viscoelastic and piezoelectric parts. The viscoelastic part is modeled as a spring and damper in the longitudinal, transversal and lateral directions, while the piezoelectric part is replaced with resistive forces acting at the end of microcantilever. It is shown that there is it geometrical coupling between flexural-longitudinal and lateral-torsional vibrations of microcantilever used in PFM. Moreover, assuming a general friction between tip and sample, additional coupling effect is also taken into account. Through,in energy-based approach. it is seen that the PFM system can be governed by a set of coupled partial differential equations along with nonhomogeneous and coupled boundary conditions. A general formulation is then derived for the mode shape, frequency response, and state-space representation of system. Numerical simulations indicate that mode shapes, natural frequencies and time responses of microcantilever beam are heavily dependent on the viscoelastic and piezoelectric properties of the samples. Moreover, the results demonstrate that utilizing only transversal vibration is not a valid strategy for quantifying mechanical properties of materials with arbitrary crystallographic orientation. Hence, the proposed model with the built-in coupling effects can be a key development for acquiring precise measurements. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For T < T-min, a magnetic field applied parallel to the conducting chain induces a large negative magnetoresistance and, ultimately, the recovery of a metallic state. We show evidence that this insulator-metal crossover is a consequence of field-induced suppression of a density-wave gap in a highly one-dimensional conductor. At the highest fields studied, there is evidence for the possible emergence of a novel superconducting state with an onset temperature T-c > 10 K.									33	1	0	2	0	33			0031-9007			WOS:000266309000049	19519057

The PA signal intensity was also significantly higher for nanowires. The Raman spectrum revealed increased exciton-longitudinal-optical-phonon coupling. The appearance of a narrow photoluminescence peak at 491 nm (FWHM similar to 9 nm) and the absence of emission above 500 nm demonstrate the high quality of nanowires.

Previous analysis of the SED suggests that the system is a young Herbig Ae star with a gas-rich, flared disk. We reexamine the evolutionary state of the HD 100453 system by refining its age (based on a candidate low-mass companion) and by examining limits on the disk extent, mass accretion rate, and gas content of the disk environment. We confirm that HD 100453B is a common proper motion companion to HD 100453A, with a spectral type of M4.0V-M4.5V, and derive an age of 10 +/- 2 Myr. We find no evidence of mass accretion onto the star. Chandra ACIS-S imagery shows that the Herbig Ae star has L(x)/L(bol) and an X-ray spectrum similar to nonaccreting beta Pic Moving Group early F stars. Moreover, the disk lacks the conspicuous Fe II emission and excess FUV continuum seen in spectra of actively accreting Herbig Ae stars, and from the FUV continuum, we find the accretion rate is < 1.4 x 10(-9) M(circle dot) yr(-1). A sensitive upper limit to the CO J = 3-2 intensity indicates that the gas in the outer disk is likely optically thin. Assuming a [CO]/[H(2)] abundance of 1 x 10(-4) and a depletion factor of 10(3), we find that the mass of cold molecular gas is less than similar to 0.33 M(J) and that the gas-to-dust ratio is no more than similar to 4:1 in the outer disk. The combination of a high fractional IR excess luminosity, a relatively old age, an absence of accretion signatures, and an absence of detectable circumstellar molecular gas suggests that the HD 100453 system is in an unusual state of evolution between a gas-rich protoplanetary disk and a gas-poor debris disk.									18	0	0	0	0	18			0004-637X			WOS:000265764000046

In this study, the feasibility of a continuous reaction system using a solid acid for the hydrolysis of TGs at atmospheric pressure has been investigated. This research was to explore the viability of heterogeneous catalyzed hydrolysis of oils and fats for the synthesis of FFAs, a platform reaction of the oleochemical industry and a possible reaction in a novel two-step (hydrolysis-esterification) biodiesel synthesis process using low-cost feedstocks containing >5-15% FFAs. Tricaprylin (TCp) was used as a model compound representing TGs in order to obtain reliable intrinsic kinetics. Using tungstated zirconia (WZ) and the solid acid composite SAC-13 (Nafion resin nanoparticles supported on mesoporous silica) as catalysts, the hydrolysis of TCp was carried out at 110-150 degrees C in a semibatch reactor with continuous addition of water at low flow rates capable of achieving 100% selectivity of the carboxylic acid side chains on the triglyceride to HCp. The characteristics of the catalysts played an important role in reaction selectivity, apparent activation energy, and deactivation. Catalyst recycling experiments showed continuous activity loss for both catalysts. Characterization of the used catalysts indicated that deactivation was likely caused by the strong adsorption of bulky reaction intermediates on the catalytic acid sites, blocking reactant accessibility. For WZ, recalcination in air was an effective regeneration method resulting in the recovery of 100% of its original activity. Regeneration by calcination was not possible for SAC-13 due to its temperature									39	1	0	8	1	40			0888-5885			WOS:000266081300013

We give a different explanation of this effect related to (i) resolution of the Bernoulli pressure, and (ii) the scaling of the coupling between velocity and pressure error with respect to the Reynolds number. We show analytically that (i) the difference between the two nonlinearities is governed by the difference in the resolution of the Bernoulli and kinematic pressures, and (ii) a simple, linear grad-div stabilization ameliorates much of the bad scaling of the velocity error with respect to Re. The rotation form does have superior conservation properties to the alternatives and it appears to be amenable to more efficient preconditioners. Thus, the rotational form with grad-div stabilization is a promising method. We also give experiments that show bad velocity approximation is tied to poor pressure resolution in either form.

J	Wei, Yang; Latour, Robert A.								Benchmark Experimental Data Set and Assessment of Adsorption Free Energy for Peptide-Surface Interactions								LANGMUIR				25	10			5637	5646		10.1021/la8042186			MAY 19 2009	2009	With the increasing interest in protein adsorption in fields ranging from bionanotechnology to biomedical engineering, there is a growing need to understand protein-surface interactions at a fundamental level, Such as the interaction between individual amino acid residues ON protein and functional groups presented by a surface. However, relatively little data are available that experimentally provide a quantitative, comparative measure of these types of interactions. To address this deficiency, the objective Of this Study was to generate a database of experimentally measured standard state adsorption free energy (Delta G(ads)(o)) values for a wide variety of amino acid residue-surface interactions using a host-guest peptide and alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with polymer-like functionality as the model system. The host-guest amino acid sequence was synthesized in the form of TGTG-X-GTGT, where G and Tare glycine and threonine amino acid residues and X represents a variable residue. In this paper, we report Delta G(ads)(o) values for the adsorption of 12 different types of the host-guest peptides on a set of nine different SAM surfaces, for a total of 108 peptide-surface systems. The Delta G(ads)(o) values for these 108 peptide-surface combinations show clear trends in adsorption behavior that are dependent on both peptide composition and surface chemistry. These data provide a benchmark experimental data set from which fundamental interactions that govern peptide and protein adsorption behavior can be better understood and compared.									42	1	0	16	0	42			0743-7463			WOS:000266081000034	19432493

Dynamic relationships between field temperatures and romaine lettuce yield and head quality								SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE				120	4			452	459		10.1016/j.scienta.2009.01.002			MAY 19 2009	2009	Romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia Lam.) has great potential as a winter alternative crop ill Coastal South Carolina. Apache (A), Darkland (D), Green Tower (GT), Green Forest(GF), Ideal Cos (IC), and Tall Guzmaine (TG) romaine lettuce cultivar transplants were planted on 9 different planting dates in Charleston, South Carolina (SC) on monthly intervals from September to April from 1998 to 2001. The objective was to determine romaine's yield and quality responses to different growing season climates. Growing season mean (GSM) minimum or maximum temperatures (temps) were determined by averaging daily min and max temps from planting date to harvest date. The growing season for the September planting date (PD) was the warmest, followed by the April PD. The coldest growing season was the December PD, followed by January and November PDs. Collectively, GSM max temps ranged from 17 to 27 degrees C and GSM min temps ranged from 5 to 15 degrees C with these planting dates. The total accumulated heat units (Base 4.5 degrees C) were similar for all 8 PD growing seasons. The harvest Maturities were similar between: September versus April PDs: October versus March PDs: and November versus February PDs. The December PD growing season required the greatest number of days to reach harvest from transplanting followed by the January PD growing season, with every I C decrease in GSM min or max temps, days to harvest increased by 5 days. GSM min temperature affected number of marketable heads produced per plot more than GSM max temps for A, D, GT and TG but not GF and IC. Individual marketable head weight, however, was unaffected by GSM min and max temps. When all cultivar data were pooled and regressed, we found that from about 3 to 6 degrees C GSM min temps, the number of culls produced dropped Steeply, but then plateaued from about 6 to 11 degrees C. and then decreased rapidly from 11 to 14 C. The major cull defect was loss due to field rots. Generally, the pooled cultivar mean indicated that with an increase in GSM min temps from 3 to 6.5 degrees C, the rate of field rot production accelerated, but from 6.5 to 14 C, field rot production was much slower in contrast.

The best result achieved so far was 110 Omega/sq at 88% transmittance using purified single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) coated on a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate. The secondary goal was to simplify the overall coating procedure; we successfully reduced the process from. five (prior art method) to three steps utilizing a sonication method. We also found that the use of metallic SWNTs significantly improved the conductivity and transmittance compared with the use of mixed SWNTs, i.e., unseparated SWNTs. Furthermore, a possible adhesion mechanism between SWNTs and the surface of PEN was studied; we concluded that a pi-pi stacking effect and a hydrophobic interaction are the major contributing factors for SWNTs to adhere to the surface of the substrate.

Light emitted from OD4MI CL reaction occurring in the micro-dimensional pentagonal detection window (length of each line segment: 900.0 mu m, depth: 50.0 mu m) of the microfluidic device with two inlets and one outlet was so bright that it was possible to take an image every 1/30 s at the optimal focusing distance (60 cm) using a commercial digital camera. Peaks obtained using a flow injection analysis (FIA) system with the micro-scale detection window and OD4MI CL detection show excellent resolution and reproducibility without any band-broadening observed in analytical devices having additional reaction channel(s) to measure light generated from slow CL reaction. Maximum height (H(max)) and area (A) of peak, reproducibility and sensitivity observed in the FIA system with the microfluidic device and OD4MI CL detection depends on (1) the mole ratio between bis(2,4.6-trichlorophenyl) oxalate and 4-methyl imidazole yielding OD4MI, (2) the flow rate to mix OD4MI, H(2)O(2) and 1-AP in the detection window of the microfludic device, and (3) H(2)O(2) concentration. We obtained linear calibration Curves with wide dynamic ranges using H(max) and A. The detection limit of 1-AP determined with H(max) and A was as low as 0.05 fmole/injection (signal/background = 3.0). (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Glass-clad single-crystal germanium optical fiber								OPTICS EXPRESS				17	10			8029	8035		10.1364/OE.17.008029			MAY 11 2009	2009	Long lengths (250 meters) of a flexible 150 mu m diameter glass-clad optical fiber containing a 15 mu m diameter crystalline and phase-pure germanium core was fabricated using conventional optical fiber draw techniques. X-ray diffraction and spontaneous Raman scattering measurements showed the core to be very highly crystalline germanium with no observed secondary phases. Elemental analysis confirmed a very well-defined core-clad interface with a step-profile in composition and nominally 4 weight-percent oxygen having diffused into the germanium core from the glass cladding. For this proof-of-concept fiber, polycrystalline n-type germanium of unknown dopant concentration was used. The measured infrared transparency of the starting material was poor and, as a likely outcome, the attenuation of the resultant fiber was too high to be measured. However, the larger Raman cross-section, infrared and terahertz transparency of germanium over silicon should make these fibers of significant value for fiber-based mid-to long-wave infrared and terahertz waveguides and Raman-shifted infrared light sources once high-purity, high-resistivity germanium is employed.

The hyperspectral information enables several key advantages when compared to traditional tomography techniques based on limited spectral information. These advantages include a significant reduction in the number of required projection measurements, and an enhanced insensitivity to measurements/inversion uncertainties. These advantages greatly facilitate the practical implementation and application of the tomography technique. This paper reports the development of the technique, and the experimental demonstration of a prototype sensor in a near-adiabatic, atmospheric-pressure laboratory Hencken burner. The spatial and temporal resolution enabled by this new sensing technique is expected to resolve several key issues in practical combustion devices.

In this study we propose and employ a new a posteriori test to study SGS model performance. We compare the conditional means of the LES-generated SGS stress and stress production rate conditional on the resolvable-scale velocity with measurements. These statistics must be reproduced by the SGS model for LES to correctly predict the one-point resolvable-scale velocity joint probability density function. Our tests using data obtained in convective atmospheric boundary layers show that the a posteriori results are consistent with Our a priori tests based on the same conditional statistics. The strengths and deficiencies of the models observed here were also identified in our a priori tests. The remarkable consistency between the two types of tests suggests that statistical model tests based on the conditional SGS stress and its production rate are a highly capable approach for identifying specific model deficiencies and for evaluating SGS model performance in simulations.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0022-1120			WOS:000266641200006

While the in vivo evaluation of various three-dimensional (3D), porous, biodegradable polymeric scaffolds has been reported, most studies are <= 3 months in duration, which is typically prior to bulk polymer degradation, a critical event that may initiate an inflammatory response and inhibit tissue formation. Here, a 6 month in vitro degradation and corresponding in vivo studies that characterized scaffold changes during complete degradation of an amorphous, 3D poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (3D-PLAGA) scaffold and near-complete degradation of a semi-crystalline 3D-PLAGA scaffold are reported. Using sintered microsphere matrix technology, constructs were fabricated in a tubular shape, with the longitudinal axis void and a median pore size that mimicked the architecture of native bone. Long-term quantitative measurements of molecular weight, mechanical properties, and porosity provided a basis for theorization of the scaffold degradation process. Following implantation in a critical size ulnar defect model, histological analysis and quantitative microCT indicated early solubilization of the semi-crystalline polymer created an acidic microenvironment that inhibited mineralized tissue formation. Thus, the use of amorphous over semi-crystalline PLAGA materials is advocated for applications in regenerative medicine.									15	1	0	5	0	15			1616-301X			WOS:000266285400004

This new method overcomes the limitation of its previous version, called TIGER, which requires the assumption of constant heat capacity during quenching of replicas from elevated temperatures to the baseline temperature. The robustness of the TIGER2 method is examined by comparing it against a Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation for sampling the conformational distribution of a single butane molecule in vacuum, a REMD simulation for sampling the behavior of alanine dipeptide in explicit solvent, and REMD simulations for sampling the folding behavior of two peptides, (AAQAA)(3) and chignolin, in implicit solvent. The agreement between the results from these conventional sampling methods and the TIGER2 simulations indicates that the TIGER2 algorithm is able to closely approximate a Boltzmann-weighted ensemble of states for these systems but without the limiting assumptions that were required for the original TIGER algorithm. TIGER2 is an efficient replica-exchange sampling method that enables the number of replicas that are used for a replica-exchange simulation to be substantially reduced compared to the conventional REMD method.									25	0	0	11	0	25			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000266263100008	19425768

The hydration and dehydration of samples prepared as thin films and freestanding membrane were probed by applying transmission infrared spectroscopy. Spectral bands were assigned and effects of water incorporation into membrane pores and channels were understood by drawing upon results from related measurements performed on the structurally similar, perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer, Nafion. Both PFSI and Nation membrane materials display a prominent infrared absorbance band near 1060 cm(-1) that arises from a vibrational mode of the ionizable group present on the side chains that extend from the poly(tetrafluoroethylene) backbone on the polymers. The mode can be traced to symmetric stretching of the -SO(3)(-) (sulfonate) group in Nafion and to antisymmetric S-N-S stretching within the sulfonyl imide end group (-SO(2)(N(-))SO(2)CF(3)) in the PFSI materials. For Nafion samples, the position and width of the band near 1060 cm(-1) are strongly sensitive to membrane hydration, whereas the band position and shape change only slightly during hydration and dehydration of PFSI materials. The possibility for greater charge delocalization over the sulfonyl imide moiety and shielding of hydrophilic species by the terminal -CF(3) group are suggested to explain the differences. These effects also likely influence the stretching modes of the side chain C-O-C groups. A pair of bands, sensitive to hydration and traceable to different C-O-C groups in a side chain, is present in the 970-990 cm(-1) region of Nafion. However, the two features are not well resolved and are less sensitive to hydration in spectra of PFSI samples. The most intense ionomer spectral bands arise from modes involving C-F stretching motion and appear between 1150 and 1250 cm(-1). Toward the high energy side of the envelope, there is substantial overlap with features of sulfonate group antisymmetric S=O stretching modes in Nafion, but S=O stretching modes of the sulfonyl imide moiety are higher in energy and better resolved in spectra of the PFSIs. During water uptake from a dry state into PFSI materials, a progression of features characteristic of solvated H(3)O(+) species appears across the water O-H stretching (2800-3800 cm(-1)) and H-O-H bending (1500-2000 cm(-1)) regions, similar to responses observed for water inside proton-exchanged Nafion.									15	0	0	0	0	15			1520-6106			WOS:000265687500015	19402725

The viscosity was found to shift to higher temperatures with increasing sodium borate content. The kinetic fragility parameter, m, estimated from the viscosity curve, decreases from 52 to 33 when x increases from 0.05 to 0.20 indicating that the glass network transforms from fragile to strong with the addition of Na(2)B(4)O(7). The decrease in fragility with increasing x is due to the progressive depolymerization of the phosphate network by the preferred four-coordinated boron atoms present in the low alkali borate glasses. As confirmed by Raman spectroscopy increasing alkali borate leads to enhanced B-O-P linkages realized with the accompanying transition from solely four-coordinated boron (in BO(4) units) to mixed BO(4)/BO(3) structures. The glass viscosity characteristics of the investigated glasses were compared to those of P-SF67 and N-FK5 commercial glasses from SCHOTT. We showed that the dependence of the viscosity of P-SF67 was similar to the investigated glasses due to similar phosphate network organization confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, whereas N-FK5 exhibited a very different viscosity curve and fragility parameter due to its highly coordinated silicate network.

These studies have elucidated numerous characteristics of the classical stringent response beyond the simple cellular response to an amino acid shortage, including phospholipid synthesis and protease upregulation. In this study, the effects of a serine hydroxamate addition on high-cell-density recombinant E. coli were examined and compared to the effects of recombinant protein production to determine overlaps, as recombinant protein production stress has often been attributed to amino acid shortages. Both the transcriptome and growth characteristics were evaluated and compared. The serine hydroxamate addition profoundly decreased the culture growth rate, whereas recombinant protein production did not. Conversely, the transcriptome profile of the recombinant E. coli cultures were relatively unaffected by the serine hydroxamate addition, yet recombinant protein production dramatically changed the transcriptome profile. A subset of the classical stringent response genes were effected by the serine hydroxamate addition, whereas recombinant protein production regulated numerous classical stringent response genes but not all. The genes that were regulated by the serine hydroxamate addition include numerous fatty acid synthesis genes, in agreement with altered phospholipids synthesis reports. These results indicate that recombinant protein production and the stringent response have many overlapping responses but are far from identical.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0273-2289			WOS:000266071900002	18612598

We tested whether extraneous points of light affected the ability of 12 younger and 12 older drivers to see pedestrians as they drove on a closed road at night. Pedestrians wore black clothing alone or with retroreflective markings in four different configurations. One pedestrian walked in place and was Surrounded by clutter on half of the trials. Another was always surrounded by visual clutter but either walked in place or stood still. Clothing configuration, pedestrian motion. and driver age influenced conspicuity but clutter did not. The results confirm that even in the presence of visual clutter pedestrians wearing biological motion configurations are recognized more often and at greater distances than when they wear a reflective vest.

Neomycin binding preserves extracellular matrix in bioprosthetic heart valves during in vitro cyclic fatigue and storage								ACTA BIOMATERIALIA				5	4			983	992		10.1016/j.actbio.2008.11.004			MAY 2009	2009	Bioprosthetic heart valve (BHV) cusps have a complex architecture consisting of an anisotropic arrangement of collagen, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and elastin. Glutaraldehyde (GLUT) is used as a fixative for all clinical BHV implants; however, it only stabilizes the collagen component of the tissue, and other components such as GAGs and elastin are lost from the tissue during processing, storage or after implantation. We have shown previously that the effectiveness of the chemical crosslinking can be increased by incorporating neomycin trisulfate, a hyaluronidase inhibitor, to prevent the enzyme-mediated GAG degradation. In the present study, we optimized carbodiimide-based GAG-targeted chemistry to incorporate neomycin into BHV cusps prior to conventional GLUT crosslinking. This crosslinking leads to enhanced preservation of GAGs during in vitro cyclic fatigue and storage. The neomycin group showed greater GAG retention after both 10 and 50 million accelerated fatigue cycles and after 1 year of storage in GLUT solution. Thus, additional binding of neomycin to the cusps prior to standard GLUT crosslinking could enhance tissue stability and thus heart valve durability. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.

X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy observation show that single-phased half-Heusler compounds without compositional segregations have been obtained by levitation melting in a time-efficient manner. A small amount of Sb doping can improve the electrical power factor but undesirably increases the thermal conductivity due to the increased carrier thermal conductivity. The isoelectronic substitution of Zr for Hf substantially decreased the lattice thermal conductivity. A state-of-the-art ZT value of 1.0 has been attained at 1000 K for the levitation-melted and spark-plasma-sintered Hf0.6Zr0.4NiSn0.98Sb0.02, which is one of the highest achieved ZT values for half-Heusler thermoelectric alloys.

J	Farahani, Hamid J.; Izzi, Gabriella; Oweis, Theib Y.								Parameterization and Evaluation of the AquaCrop Model for Full and Deficit Irrigated Cotton								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				101	3			469	476		10.2134/agronj2008.0182s			MAY-JUN 2009	2009	Predicting yield is increasingly important to optimize irrigation under limited available water for enhanced sustainability and profitable production. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations addresses this need by providing a yield response to water simulation model (AquaCrop) with limited sophistication. In this study, AquaCrop was parameterized and tested for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) under full (100%) and deficit (40, 60, and 80% of full) irrigation regimes in the hot, dry, and windy Mediterranean environment of northern Syria. Model parameterization used the 2006 data and was straightforward within the designed user-interface, owing to the limited number of key parameters. Accurate simulation of canopy cover was central to sound prediction of evapotranspiration and biomass accumulation. Key user-input parameters for this purpose were identified as the coefficients defining canopy development and the threshold soil water depletion levels for the water stress indices. The parameterized model was tested using data from the 2004 and 2005 seasons, resulting in accurate prediction of evapotranspiration (<13% error). The predicted yield values were within 10% of measurements, except in the 60 and 80% irrigation regimes in 2004, with errors up to 32%. The model closely predicted the trend in total soil water, but deviation existed for individual soil layers. This study provides first estimate values for cotton parameters useful for future model testing and use. Model parameterization is site-specific, and thus the applicability of key calibrated parameters must to be tested under different climate, soil, variety, irrigation methods, and field management.

The sugars tested included glucose, xylose, and arabinose. All five strains were able to utilize the three sugars for astaxanthin production. Among them, ATCC 74219 was the best astaxanthin producer. Kinetics of sugar utilization of this strain was studied, both with the individual sugars and with their mixtures. Arabinose was found to give the highest astaxanthin yield. It also was observed that glucose at high concentrations suppressed utilization of the other two sugars. Corn fiber hydrolysate obtained by dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment and subsequent enzyme hydrolysis was tested for astaxanthin production by strain ATCC 74219. Dilution of the hydrolysate was necessary to allow growth and astaxanthin production. All the sugars in the hydrolysate diluted with two volumes of water were completely consumed. Astaxanthin yield of 0.82 mg/g total sugars consumed was observed.									12	1	0	11	0	13			0273-2289			WOS:000268308900006	18958409

Short supersoft X-ray source (SSS) states (durations <= 100 days) of classical novae (CNe) indicate massive white dwarfs that are candidate progenitors of supernovae type Ia.Aims. We carry out a dedicated optical and X-ray monitoring program of CNe in the bulge of M 31.Methods. We discovered M31N 2007-11a and determined its optical and X-ray light curve. We used the robotic Super-LOTIS telescope to obtain the optical data and XMM-Newton and Chandra observations to discover an X-ray counterpart to that nova.Results. Nova M31N 2007-11a is a very fast CN, exhibiting a very short SSS state with an appearance time of 6-16 days after outburst and a turn-off time of 45-58 days after outburst.Conclusions. The optical and X-ray light curves of M31N 2007-11a suggest a binary containing a white dwarf with M(WD) > 1.0 M(circle dot).									7	0	0	0	0	7			0004-6361			WOS:000265868600002

A multiple-baseline across-participants design was employed to examine the teachers' use of specific praise statements before and after the training and the potential influence these statements had on the target children's compliance and engagement. In addition, generalization probes were conducted to investigate the teachers' use of specific praise statements and the children's behavioral responses in an untrained setting. The results indicate that teachers' use of specific praise statements increased following the training. In addition, all 4 children demonstrated positive changes with an increase in their appropriate behaviors and decreases in problem behaviors.									26	0	0	0	0	26			0198-7429			WOS:000281309300001

The simulations were compared with a series of small-scale laboratory experiments and existing theoretical models. The aim of the work was to benchmark CFD models for time-dependent buoyancy-driven natural ventilation against previously published experimental results and theoretical models. The simulations agree well with experimental results during the initial development of the room stratification. The CFD results accurately predict the maximum depth of the hot buoyant layer at the top of the room as well as the steady-state interface height which separates the warm upper buoyant layer from the cooler air below. The simulations also predict well the time taken for the buoyant upper layer to reach its maximum depth. However, at longer times the results diverge. This may be due to thermal diffusion and mixing at the interface between the upper and lower layers due to the inflow from the floor level vents. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Dorman, Lane; Castle, James W.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								Performance of a pilot-scale constructed wetland system for treating simulated ash basin water								CHEMOSPHERE				75	7			939	947		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.01.012			MAY 2009	2009	A pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment system (CWTS) was designed and built to decrease the concentration and toxicity of constituents of concern in ash basin water from coal-burning power plants. The CWTS was designed to promote the following treatment processes for metals and metalloids: precipitation as non-bioavailable sulfides, co-precipitation with iron oxyhydroxides, and adsorption onto iron oxides. Concentrations of Zn, Cr, Hg, As, and Se in simulated ash basin water were reduced by the CWTS to less than USEPA-recommended water quality criteria. The removal efficiency (defined as the percent concentration decrease from influent to effluent) was dependent on the influent concentration of the constituent, while the extent of removal (defined as the concentration of a constituent of concern in the CWTS effluent) was independent of the influent concentration. Results from toxicity experiments illustrated that the CWTS eliminated influent toxicity with regard to survival and reduced influent toxicity with regard to reproduction. Reduction in potential for scale formation and biofouling was achieved through treatment of the simulated ash basin water by the pilot-scale CWTS. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Thodesen, Carl; Shatanawi, Khaldoun; Amirkhanian, Serji; Bridges, William								Development of an empirical model for determining G*/sin delta in crumb rubber modified binders								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				23	5			1922	1927		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.09.002			MAY 2009	2009	This paper describes the development of an empirical model which may be used for predicting the G*/sin delta for neat and crumb rubber modified (CRM) binders. The model was developed using 36 unique CRM binder combinations, crumb rubber concentrations were varied at 5% intervals between 5% and 20%. The effects of crumb rubber particle size on model accuracy were also studied, ultimately a model was produced with the capability of predicting G*/sin delta values over a range of temperatures and crumb rubber concentrations. By definition, the upper limit of the performance grade is dependent on the G*/sin delta value; therefore, the relationship was also considered in terms of high end failure temperature.The rubber coefficient for G*/sin delta (R(cg)) was identified as an important parameter in the estimation of G*/sin delta in addition to the CRM. This term is a quantitative representation of the increase typically witnessed in G*/sin delta values with the addition of CRM. Ambient ground CRM exhibited higher R(cg) values than cryogenically ground particles. Additionally. 95% confidence intervals were generated for the predictive model, thus providing a range of accuracy for the model. The resulting confidence intervals were approximately +/- 1300 Pa, these confidence intervals were seen to capture 92.6% of the 462 data points used. Findings from this research suggest that the differences between cryogenic and ambient CRM binder are accurately described using the R(cg) furthermore binder properties may be predicted using an empirical equation.

J	Anurag, Kalia; Xiao, Feipeng; Amirkhanian, Serji N.								Laboratory investigation of indirect tensile strength using roofing polyester waste fibers in hot mix asphalt								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				23	5			2035	2040		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.08.018			MAY 2009	2009	The vast quantity of waste materials (such as roofing polyester waste fibers) accumulating throughout the world is creating costly disposal problem. The use of these materials was proved to be economical, environmentally sound and effective in increasing the performance properties of the asphalt mixture in recent years. The primary objective of this research was to determine whether homogeneously dispersed roofing waste polyester fibers improve the indirect tensile strength (ITS) and moisture susceptibility properties of asphalt concrete mixtures containing various lengths and percentages of the fiber in various aggregate sources. The experimental design included the use of three aggregate sources, two lengths (0.635 cm (1/4 in.) and 1.270 cm (1/2 in.)) of this fiber, and two fiber contents (0.35% and 0.50% by weight of total mixture). The results of the experiments found that, in general, the addition of the polyester fiber was beneficial in improving the wet tensile strength and tensile strength ratio (TSR) of the modified mixture, increasing the toughness value in both dry and wet conditions, and increasing the void content, the asphalt content, the unit weight, and the Marshall stability.

J	Biro, Szabolcs; Gandhi, Tejash; Amirkhanian, Serji								Determination of zero shear viscosity of warm asphalt binders								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				23	5			2080	2086		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.08.015			MAY 2009	2009	With the increasing awareness of the warm asphalt technology, it is imperative to study the properties of the binders containing the warm asphalt additives thoroughly, especially since not much research has been conducted on warm asphalt binder properties to date. Also, in the recent years, researchers have observed that the SHRP rutting parameter G*/sin delta is not very effective in predicting the rutting performance of binders, especially in case of modified binders. Zero shear viscosity (ZSV) has been evaluated to determine its effectiveness in predicting the rutting behavior of asphalt binders. Thus, in this paper, the ZSV of five asphalt binders with and without the warm asphalt additives, Asphamin (R) and Sasobit (R), were calculated using the different models and test methods available in literature. From the test results, it was observed that the addition of the warm asphalt additives increased the ZSV of all the five binders used in this study. It was also observed that the different test methods gave different ZSV values, and that the selection of the test methods and the testing parameters are crucial parameters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The integration of hydraulic actuators in the engine cooling circuit offers greater power density in a smaller package space when compared with electric actuators. In this paper, a comprehensive nonlinear backstepping robust control technique is developed to regulate the engine coolant temperature by controlling a hydraulic coolant pump and radiator fan. An experimental test bench has been assembled to investigate the hydraulic automotive thermal system performance. Representative numerical and experimental results are presented and discussed. Overall, the proposed controller was successful in tracking prescribed engine temperature profiles while harmoniously regulating the power consumption of the coolant pump and radiator fan.

Performance data were gathered using an in-depth case study and it was determined that the swift and even flow constructs did affect flow speed and variance, but did not account for all the effects observed. To understand the need for departments to coordinate their efforts with each other and how this affected flow, further analysis was conducted using insights from Pagell's (2004) theory of internal integration and Gittell's (2002) research about coordinating mechanisms. The findings suggest the need to incorporate a variable measuring supply chain coordination into the theory of swift and even flow.									18	0	0	1	0	18			0011-7315	1540-5915		WOS:000266335800006

Computer simulations have been developed for the analysis of the subsequent fault and presented in the authors' earlier work for level spans and inclined spans that are both of uniform power line construction. However, in practice, a power line topology may require a transition from one power line structure to another. Such a required transition can be realized by a transition span. In this paper, we present a dynamic analysis of swing movement of power line conductors in a transition span subsequent to an initial fault, to track the smallest distance between the conductors, which is an important factor useful for predicting the probability of the subsequent fault. The analysis is Much more complex than that for level spans and inclined spans. To address the complexity, we employ coordinate system transformations and establish a common coordinate system, then make use of it in the dynamic analysis. Sample numerical results are presented, analyzed, and checked with the energy conservation law requirement. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
