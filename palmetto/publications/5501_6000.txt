J	Wu, Tonggui; Gu, Shenhua; Zhou, Hefeng; Wang, G. Geoff; Cheng, Xiangrong; Yu, Mukui								Photosynthetic and physiological responses of native and exotic tidal woody seedlings to simulated tidal immersion								ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE				135				280	284		10.1016/j.ecss.2013.10.028			DEC 20 2013	2013	Hibiscus hamabo, a native tidal woody species, and Myrica cerzfera, an exotic tidal woody species, have been widely planted on coastal beaches in subtropical China. However, whether there are differences in physiological response and tolerance to immersion between the two tidal species is still unknown. Our objectives were to evaluate differences in the photosynthetic and physiological responses to tidal immersion for the two species in the context of sea level rise. With increasing immersion, net photosynthesis, stomata' conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, and light saturation point declined progressively for both species, whereas dark respiration and light compensation point showed the reverse trend. Lower variation was observed in H. hamabo than in M. cerifera for each index in the same treatment. Photosynthetic ability and utilization of light, especially under high light intensity, decreased for both species. Leaf soluble sugar and protein contents, and glycolate oxidase activity first increased and then decreased with increasing of immersion degree, with the higher values observed in the W4 (4 h duration, 15 cm depth) and W6 (6 h duration, 25 cm depth) treatments for H. hamabo, and W2 (2 h duration, 5 cm depth) and W4 treatments for M. cerifera. These findings indicate that H. hamabo has a better ability to keep the reduction of photosynthesis at a minimum through soluble substance regulated osmotic potential and avoiding excess light damage to the photosynthetic system through increased photorespiration, heat dissipation, chlorophyll fluorescence. Our results suggest that H. hamabo is more tolerant to tidal immersion than M. cerifera, and therefore it is better adapted to the anticipated sea level rise in future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The conductivity depends on the material swelling in humid atmosphere and aqueous solutions: the greater the swelling, the smaller is the electrical conductivity. The covalently crosslinked fibers reversibly deform during the swelling/shrinking. In the swollen state, the fibers are less conductive, while they return to the same level of conductivity after shrinking. This unique reversible change of electroconductivity of the SWCNT-alginate fibers is due to the elastic deformation of the alginate network in the area of electrical contacts between SWCNT bundles arrested in the alginate matrix. Fibers of this kind can be used as a simple, robust, disposable, and biocompatible platform for electrotextiles, biosensors, and flexible electronics in biomedical and biotechnological applications.									8	0	0	1	0	8			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000328457000011

Nano LIFE				3	4			1343003	1343003					2013-Dec-17	2013	Current chemotherapy treatments are limited by poor drug solubility, rapid drug clearance and systemic side effects. Additionally, drug penetration into solid tumors is limited by physical diffusion barriers [e.g., extracellular matrix (ECM)]. Nanoparticle (NP) blood circulation half-life, biodistribution and ability to cross extracellular and cellular barriers will be dictated by NP composition, size, shape and surface functionality. Here, we investigated the effect of surface charge of poly(lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol) NPs on mediating cellular interaction. Polymeric NPs of equal sizes were used that had two different surface functionalities: negatively charged carboxyl (COOH) and neutral charged methoxy (OCH3). Cellular uptake studies showed significantly higher uptake in human brain cancer cells compared to noncancerous human brain cells, and negatively charged COOH NPs were uptaken more than neutral OCH3 NPs in 2D culture. NPs were also able to load and control the release of paclitaxel (PTX) over 19 days. Toxicity studies in U-87 glioblastoma cells showed that PTX-loaded NPs were effective drug delivery vehicles. Effect of surface charge on NP interaction with the ECM was investigated using collagen in a 3D cellular uptake model, as collagen content varies with the type of cancer and the stage of the disease compared to normal tissues. Results demonstrated that NPs can effectively diffuse across an ECM barrier and into cells, but NP mobility is dictated by surface charge. In vivo biodistribution of OCH3 NPs in intracranial tumor xenografts showed that NPs more easily accumulated in tumors with less collagen. These results indicate that a robust understanding of NP interaction with various tumor environments can lead to more effective patient-tailored therapies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-9844			MEDLINE:25110523	25110523

At the end of the session, participants drank water until they felt full, in order to detect EGG-signal changes after ingestion of a true gastric load. During both conditions participants reported their subjective well-being, hunger and disgust at several time points.Results: Imagining eating food induced subjective feelings of hunger and disgust as well as changes in the EGG similar to, but more pronounced than those seen with a real gastric water load during both hypnosis and relaxation conditions. These effects were more pronounced when imagining an appetizing meal than with an unappetizing meal. There was no significant difference between the hypnosis and relaxation conditions.Conclusion: Imagination with and without hypnosis exhibits similar changes in subjective and objective measures in response to imagining an appetizing and an unappetizing food, indicating high sensitivity but low specificity.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000328735700126	24358287	
J	Mikhailova, Elena; Cherney, Debbie; Snyder, Lori Unruh; Post, Christopher; Sharp, Julia; Cox, Silas; Kelly, Shawn								Effects of Drought on Nutritive Value of Kudzu								COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS				44	22			3412	3422		10.1080/00103624.2013.847455			DEC 16 2013	2013	Kudzu (Pueraria montana), a vigorous, perennial warm-season invasive legume is widely spread in the southeastern United States and has the potential to be used as feed by ruminants during its growing season from May until first frost (usually in October). The purpose of this study was to determine the nutritive value of kudzu during a drought-prone growing season. Five samples of apical leaves and stems were harvested once a week from random locations within a 43-year-old kudzu infestation grown on a Cecil clay loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) at the Clemson University Experimental Forest (Clemson, S.C.). We report the effects of plant part, sampling date, mean air temperature (MAT), and precipitation on dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulfur (S), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) of the kudzu. Dry matter and CP were significantly greater in the apical leaf than in the stem; CP had a significant mean air temperature by plant part interaction. A significant temperature by plant part interaction also existed for Mg. Magnesium was greater in leaf than in the stem at the beginning of the growing season until the end of October, when small differences in Mg concentrations between stem and leaf were observed. Stem and leaf Ca concentrations were not significantly different. Calcium concentrations did vary across the dates (P=0.002). A significant temperature by plant part interaction existed for Mg concentrations (P=0.003), Ca to P ratio (P < 0.0001), P concentrations (P=0.0007), S (P < 0.0001), Zn (P=0.0053), Mn (P=0.0014), and Cu (P=0.006). Overall, kudzu's nutritive value as feed for ruminants during the growing season is highly variable; however, chemical composition was very comparable to other common forages. More frequent and intensive droughts predicted as a result of climate change may limit forage choices; however, kudzu maintains its forage potential for feeding both domestic and wild animals during drought-prone growing season.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-3624	1532-2416		WOS:000327584100018

We show that the robustness to TR-breaking results from a hidden chiral symmetry, which places the system in the BDI class in the presence of the generic TR-breaking perturbations (the TR-invariant system is both DIII and BDI). Our work has important implications for the quasi-1D organic superconductors (TMTSF)(2)X (X = PF6, CIO4) (Bechgaard salts) and Li0.9Mo6O17, which have been proposed as triplet superconductors with equal spin pairing (Delta(up arrow up arrow), Delta(down arrow down arrow) not equal 0, Delta(up arrow down arrow) = 0) in the presence of magnetic fields.									17	1	0	3	0	17			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000328684000001

We have developed an assay for the screening of compounds with high affinity for human telomeric G-quadruplexes (HTG). The assay uses a thiazole orange fluorescent reporter molecule conjugated to the aminoglycoside, neomycin, as a probe in a fluorescence displacement assay. The conjugation of the planar base stacking thiazole orange with the groove binding neomycin results in high affinity probe that can determine the relative binding affinity of high affinity HTG binding drugs in a high throughput format. The robust assay is applicable for the determination of the binding affinity of HTG in the presence of K+ or Na+. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of fuel reduction treatments on movement and habitat use of American toads in a southern Appalachian hardwood forest								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				310				289	299		10.1016/j.foreco.2013.08.032			DEC 15 2013	2013	Prescribed fire is a commonly used management technique for maintaining fire-adapted ecosystems, yet empirical data regarding its effects on amphibians are limited and contradictory. Anurans (frogs and toads) may be the amphibian taxa most negatively affected by fire due to their extensive use of the forest floor; however, short-term abundance studies suggest that terrestrial toads (e.g., Anaxyrus [Bufo] americanus) may benefit from fire-based ecosystem management. We used radio-telemetry to examine the effects of prescribed fire on movements, home range characteristics, mortality, and habitat selection of A. americanus in a southern Appalachian upland hardwood forest. We tracked 26 adult A. americanus between 27 January and 30 May 2012. Toads exhibited high non-breeding site fidelity and traveled 993.5 m (+/- 265.9 m) mean (+/- SD) route distance between the breeding ponds and the last recorded location within their summer habitat. We found no evidence of direct mortality of A. americanus from a prescribed fire that occurred on 13 February 2012. Forward stepwise discriminant analysis (DA) revealed that the availability of coarse woody debris (CWD) was a significant discriminator between microhabitats used (i.e., location plots) and random plots (Wilk's lambda = 0.9852, F-1,F- 661 = 9.9414, p = 0.002). Forward stepwise DA revealed that burned and unburned location plots were significantly different (Wilk's lambda = 0.2713, F-1,F- 221 = 593.6863, p < 0.001) based on the percent of plot ground cover comprised of charred material (%char). When %char was excluded from the analysis due to its short-term nature, the percent of plot ground cover comprised of deciduous leaves, a cover item commonly used by toads in unburned locations, was the variable with the most discriminatory power (Wilk's lambda = 0.4243, F-1,F- 221 = 299.8741, p < 0.001). Toads maintained greater distances from CWD in the unburned (mean +/- SD = 119.50 +/- 109.64 cm) than in the burned locations (mean +/- SD = 86.05 +/- 104.81 cm; chi(2)(1)= 9.7055, p = 0.002). Our results indicate that prescribed fire as implemented in this study did not cause direct mortality, nor did it appear to inhibit migratory movements of adult A. americanus. However, fire reduced the diversity and availability of refugia, especially deciduous leaves, though the availability of alternative cover objects (e.g., CWD) in burned treatments allowed toads to inhabit those areas, suggesting the importance of noncombustible or semi-permanent refugia for A. americanus in fire-managed forests.

The focus of our interest has been highly charged ion (HCI) produced nanofeatures, which we are able to produce in situ due to a direct vacuum connection to the NIST electron beam ion trap (EBIT). Using these sensors, we make systematic studies of the role of the charge state on the size of features created by HCIs and connect those measurements to the stopping power. Recently we have begun to study reduced velocities at a fixed charge state for which little previous theoretical or experimental work has been done. Due to many technical improvements that have been made to our methods, we offer a contemporary summary of the TJS fabrication and HCI irradiation method. Further, we present early experimental results showing increased surface damage when Xe41+ is extracted at approximate to 4.6 kV in comparison with approximate to 8.1 kV.

Particularly, effect of extraction on and subsequent stability of the phenolic compounds from the end of fermentation to bottling were investigated. The results showed that the total anthocyanin content was higher in the young wines produced in the Ganimede fermenter. The anthocyanin contents in these wines subsequently decreased significantly after two years of ageing. By contrast, the traditional vinification was slightly better than the Ganimede to yield the non-anthocyanin phenolics. This indicates that the Ganimede fermenter might be suitable for the production of brightly coloured red wines for early consumption, which could save time and labour cost for industrial production of highquality wines.

The role of simultaneous substitution of Cr and Ru on the thermoelectric properties of defect manganese silicides MnSi delta (1.73 < delta < 1.75)								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				580				598	603		10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.07.136			DEC 15 2013	2013	Defect manganese silicides have been substituted with Cr and Ru, in order to study the role of these substitutions on the resulting resistivity (rho), Seebeck (alpha) and Hall coefficients and thermal conductivity. The resistivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements suggest that these compounds are degenerate semiconductors. The Hall measurements indicate that the carrier concentration increases in Cr and Ru substituted compounds. The majority carriers are holes and the change of hole concentration is only marginal. While the hole concentration (p) of MnSi1.74 is similar to 2.1 x 10(21) cm(-3), in heavily substituted Mn0.65Cr0.2Ru0.15Si1.74, p increases only to similar to 4.5 x 10(21) cm(-3). The increase in p is presumably due to Si precipitation. One interesting feature is the low lattice thermal conductivity (kappa(L)) which is similar to 2-2.5 W/m K at 300 K depending upon the composition. In addition, kappa(L) shows a weak temperature dependence. Because of the combination of high power factor (alpha(2)/rho) similar to 2 mW/m K-2 and low thermal conductivity similar to 2.5-2.7 W/m K, Mn0.95Cr0.5Si1.74 and Mn0.97Cr0.3Si1.74 exhibit highest ZT of 0.6 at 850 K. For other compounds, a moderate ZT value of 0.3-0.5 is realized at 850 K. In Ru substituted compounds, the ZT is not improved beyond 0.5, due to the decrease of charge carrier mobility.

Two highly graphitic carbon nanoparticles (heat-treated Pyrograf (R) III PR-19 carbon nanofibers and CheapTubes (R) multi-walled carbon nanotubes) were dispersed in a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) matrix to produce a nominally random in-plane particle orientation. For a concentration of 10 vol% nanoparticles and a sample thickness of 2.5 mm, EM SE values of 24 dB and 22 dB were obtained for MWNT HT and PR-19 HT nanocomposites, respectively. At a high concentration of 40 vol%, EM SE values as high as 68 dB and 55 dB were obtained for the PR-19 HT and MWNT HT nanocomposites, respectively. Because such nanocomposites possess only moderate electrical conductivity, the composite permittivity was also used to predict the plane wave EM SE and its components. Based on the material properties of the nanocomposites, the predicted values of EM SE were found to be consistent with the experimental values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates the concept of generalized nonlinear/linear modeling approach of re from micrometeorological and plant variables for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] canopy at different climatic zones in Nebraska, USA (Clay Center, Geneva, Holdrege and North Platte). Eight models estimating r(c) as a function of different combination of micrometeorological and plant variables are presented. The models integrated the linear and non-linear effects of regulating variables (net radiation, Rn; relative humidity, RH; wind speed, U-3; air temperature, Ta; vapor pressure deficit, VPD; leaf area index, LAI; aerodynamic resistance, r(a); and solar zenith angle, Z(a)) to predict hourly r(c). The most complex r(c) model has all regulating variables and the simplest model has only Rn, To and RH. The r(c) models were developed at Clay Center in the growing season of 2007 and applied to other independent sites and years. The predicted r(c) for the growing seasons at four locations were then used to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc) as a one-step process using the Penman-Monteith model and compared to the measured data at all locations. The models were able to account for 66-93% of the variability in measured hourly ETc across locations. Models without LAI generally underperformed and underestimated due to overestimation of r(c), especially during full canopy cover stage. Using vapor pressure deficit or relative humidity in the models had similar effect on estimating r(c). The root squared error (RSE) between measured and estimated ETc was about 0.07 mm h(-1) for most of the models at Clay Center, Geneva and Holdrege. At North Platte, RSE was above 0.10 mm h(-1). The results at different sites and different growing seasons demonstrate the robustness and consistency of the models in estimating soybean r(c), which is encouraging towards the general application of one-step estimation of soybean canopy ETc in practice using the Penman-Monteith model and could aid in enhancing the utilization of the approach by irrigation and water management community.

J	Song, Xuebo; Li, Lin; Srimani, Pradip K; Yu, Philip S; Wang, James Z								Measure the Semantic Similarity of GO terms Using Aggregate Information Content.								IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics														2013-Dec-11	2013	The rapid development of Gene Ontology (GO) and huge amount of biomedical data annotated by GO terms necessitate computation of semantic similarity of GO terms and, in turn, measurement of functional similarity of genes based on their annotations. In this paper we propose a novel and efficient method to measure the semantic similarity of GO terms. The proposed method addresses the limitations in existing GO term similarity measurement techniques; it computes the semantic content of a GO term by considering the information content of all of its ancestor terms in the graph. The aggregate information content (AIC) of all ancestor terms of a GO term implicitly reflects the GO term's location in the GO graph and also represents how human beings use this GO term and all its ancestor terms to annotate genes. We show that semantic similarity of GO terms obtained by our method closely matches the human perception. Extensive experimental studies show that this novel method also outperforms all existing methods in terms of the correlation with gene expression data. We have developed Web services for measuring semantic similarity of GO terms and functional similarity of genes using the proposed AIC method and other popular methods. These Web services are available at http://bioinformatics.clemson.edu/G-SESAME.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1557-9964		MEDLINE:24344093	24344093

Response of duffing-type harvesters to band-limited noise								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				332	25			6755	6767		10.1016/j.jsv.2013.07.022			DEC 9 2013	2013	This paper aims to experimentally investigate the influence of stiffness-type nonlinearities on the transduction of vibratory energy harvesters (VEHs) under band-limited noise. For the purpose of the study, an energy harvester consisting of a clamped-clamped piezoelectric beam bi-morph is considered. The shape of the harvester's potential function is altered by applying a static compressive axial load at one end of the beam. The axial load permits the harvester to operate with different potential energy characteristics, namely, the mono-stable (pre-buckling) and bi-stable (post-buckling) configurations. The performance of the harvester in both the configurations is investigated and compared by tuning the harvester's oscillation frequencies around the static equilibria such that they have equal values in both scenarios. The harvester is then subjected to random base excitations of different levels, bandwidths, and center frequencies. The variance of the output voltage is measured across an arbitrary, purely resistive load and used for the purpose of performance comparison. Critical conclusions pertinent to the influence of the nonlinearity and relative performance in both configurations are presented and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Root Tissue under Water-Deficit Stress								PLOS ONE				8	12					e82634	10.1371/journal.pone.0082634			DEC 6 2013	2013	An RNA-Seq experiment was performed using field grown well-watered and naturally rain fed cotton plants to identify differentially expressed transcripts under water-deficit stress. Our work constitutes the first application of the newly published diploid D-5 Gossypium raimondii sequence in the study of tetraploid AD(1) upland cotton RNA-seq transcriptome analysis. A total of 1,530 transcripts were differentially expressed between well-watered and water-deficit stressed root tissues, in patterns that confirm the accuracy of this technique for future studies in cotton genomics. Additionally, putative sequence based genome localization of differentially expressed transcripts detected A(2) genome specific gene expression under water-deficit stress. These data will facilitate efforts to understand the complex responses governing transcriptomic regulatory mechanisms and to identify candidate genes that may benefit applied plant breeding programs.									11	3	0	8	1	14			1932-6203			WOS:000328566700095	24324815	
J	Goswami, Pallab; Tewari, Sumanta								Axionic field theory of (3+1)-dimensional Weyl semimetals								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				88	24					245107	10.1103/PhysRevB.88.245107			DEC 5 2013	2013	From a direct calculation of the anomalous Hall conductivity and an effective electromagnetic action obtained via Fujikawa's chiral rotation technique, we conclude that an axionic field theory with a nonquantized coefficient describes the electromagnetic response of the (3 + 1)-dimensional Weyl semimetal. The coefficient is proportional to the momentum space separation of the Weyl nodes. Akin to the Chern-Simons field theory of quantum Hall effect, the axion field theory violates gauge invariance in the presence of the boundary, which is cured by the chiral anomaly of the surface states via the Callan-Harvey mechanism. This provides a unique solution for the radiatively induced CPT-odd term in the electromagnetic polarization tensor of the Lorentz violating spinor electrodynamics, where the source of the Lorentz violation is a constant axial 4-vector term for the Dirac fermion. A direct linear response calculation also establishes anomalous thermal Hall effect and a Wiedemann-Franz law, but thermal Hall conductivity does not directly follow from the well known formula for the gravitational chiral anomaly.									91	0	0	0	0	91			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000328577700003

Exciton dynamics of conjugated polymer nanoparticles doped with dyes were investigated by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Highly efficient energy transfer from the polymer PFBT to the dye perylene red was evident in the fluorescence spectra and excited state kinetics. Exciton transport parameters were obtained by fitting to a model that included the effects of nanoparticle size, exciton diffusion, energy transfer, and quenching by defects. The results indicate substantial quenching by defects, owing primarily to exciton diffusion, which can greatly increase the effective quenching volume of defects. We estimated the amount of quenching by defects, and included quenching by defects in our model, yielding an estimated exciton diffusion length of 12 nm and diffusion constant of 8.0 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1) for nanoparticles of PFBT. The results indicate that quenching by defects can lead to substantial error in determined exciton transport parameters, unless such quenching is properly accounted for in the model.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447			WOS:000328101200062

We solve the zero-temperature (T = 0) Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations for the quasi-1D Fermi gas with the dispersion modified by tunneling between the tubes and show that the T = 0 phase diagram hosts the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase with nonzero center-of-mass momentum Cooper pairs for small values of the SOC while for larger values of the SOC and high Zeeman fields the uniform superfluid phase with zero center-of-mass momentum Cooper pairs has an instability towards the topological uniform superfluid phase with Majorana fermions at the tube ends. Also, we show that tuning the two-dimensional optical lattice strength in this model allows one to explore the crossover behaviors of the phases during the transition between the three-dimensional and 1D systems and in general the FFLO (for small SOC) and the topological uniform superfluid phase (for large SOC) are favored as the system becomes more one dimensional. We also find evidence of the existence of a Zeeman-tuned topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) within the FFLO phase itself and, for large values of the Zeeman field and small SOC, the TQPT gives rise to a topologically distinct FFLO phase.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1050-2947	1094-1622		WOS:000328568500005

An investigation of graph traversal algorithms in folded sheet metal parts design								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY				69	9-12			2237	2246		10.1007/s00170-013-5181-9			DEC 2013	2013	Decomposing 3-D geometries into flat layouts is a two-step process; specifically, its generation and analysis. The generation phase employs graph traversal procedures to extract the topological information from the parent-folded (or 3-D geometry) structure. This manuscript investigates the role of the graph traversal approaches in generating such layouts with application to folded sheet metals. The study executes several graph traversing routines and then examines the generated layouts for manufacturability considerations and product cost. The specific search routines included in this study are the depth-first search, the breadth-first search, the Prim's algorithm, the A* search, in addition to routines based on enumerating the minimum spanning trees only, and enumeration algorithms that work on all spanning trees. The study exposes the role of such routines in controlling the proposed flat layout(s) manufacturability and cost. Additionally, the study examines the compatibility of some folded sheet metal designs (i.e., its geometry type: manifold and non-manifold) for each of the aforementioned algorithms.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0268-3768	1433-3015		WOS:000327095900028

Due to their high variability, these markers can be applied in analyses of genetic diversity and structure, and in mating system and gene flow studies.Methods and Results: Thirty-six individuals from across the species range were included in a genetic diversity analysis and yielded three to 20 alleles per locus. Observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.214 to 0.944 and from 0.400 to 0.934, respectively, with minimal occurrence of null alleles. Regular segregation of maternal alleles was observed at seven loci and moderate segregation distortion at four of 11 loci that were heterozygous in the seed parent.Conclusions: Honey locust is an important agroforestry tree capable of very fast growth and tolerance of poor site conditions. This is the first report of genomic microsatellites for this species.									4	0	0	4	1	4			2168-0450			WOS:000342558500003		
J	Hisz, David B.; Murdoch, Lawrence C.; Germanovich, Leonid N.								A portable borehole extensometer and tiltmeter for characterizing aquifers								WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH				49	12			7900	7910		10.1002/wrcr.20500			DEC 2013	2013	The solid skeleton of an aquifer moves in response to changes in water pressure, barometric pressure, Earth tides and other factors, and measuring these movements can help characterize aquifers. A device for measuring the vertical displacement and horizontal shear, or tilt, at the same time and place has been developed by combining a tiltmeter and extensometer on a frame that can be temporarily anchored to borehole walls. The device can resolve displacements on the order of 10(-8) m and tilts on the order of 10(-8) rad. During a 4 h long pumping test in fractured gneiss, the rock contracted by 3 mu m in response to 2 m of drawdown, a compliance of roughly 1.5 mu m of displacement/meter of head change (1.5 x 10(-10) m/Pa). Tilt of 10 s of mu rad to the southwest occurred during pumping and both the displacement and the tilt returned during recovery. The tilt signal is repeatable during sequential tests and it changes in magnitude with depth. It can be explained by a fracture zone that strikes roughly EW and dips to the south. Semidiurnal tilts of roughly 0.1 mu rad occur during ambient conditions at periods of the O1 and M2 Earth tides. Diurnal displacements of several tens of nanometers are associated with ambient fluctuations in water level when barometric pressure changed by several 100 Pa. Increasing barometric pressure causes water level to fall, but elevates the total pressure in the well. This correlates with dilational displacement, while falling total pressure correlates with contraction during ambient conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0043-1397	1944-7973		WOS:000329929100006		
J	Beard, T. Randolph; Ekelund, Robert B., Jr.; Ford, George S.; Gaskins, Ben; Tollison, Robert D.								Secularism, Religion, and Political Choice in the United States								POLITICS AND RELIGION				6	4			753	777		10.1017/S1755048313000047			DEC 2013	2013	The effect of religion on political behavior and attachment has been a topic of intense interest in the United States and elsewhere. Less attention has been paid to the issue of secularism. Some analysts have viewed secularism as an absence of religious attachment, and a number of studies have utilized indices of secularization to analyze such topics as economic development or modernization. In this article, we show that secularism, like religion, is in fact a multifaceted category, and should not be viewed as the antithesis of religiosity. Utilizing a very large sample of United States adults, we apply factor analysis to demonstrate that secularism is composed of two logically separate components, and we use these results to examine the role of secularism in political attachments. We suggest that Religious Secularism and Social Secularism are different motivations and have different effects on political behavior and that, politically, the marginal effects of Social Secularism are larger than Religious Secularism in all cases.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1755-0483	1755-0491		WOS:000332962800004

The importance of spatial nested data in understanding the relationship between visitor use and landscape impacts								APPLIED GEOGRAPHY				45				147	157		10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.09.001			DEC 2013	2013	As managers and researchers of protected natural areas continue to seek balance in promoting visitor use but limiting negative experiential and natural resource impacts, the integration of social and physical spatial data may play a critical role in understanding how visitors and the community interface with the landscape within these protected areas. These spatial considerations are important for inventorying, monitoring, and managing the conditions of natural resources within parks. Specifically related to the visitor impacts of natural resources in parks are the use and condition of multiple-use trails. Technology such as GPS and GIS may allow for a unique assessment of the relationship between factors that influence this resource. This paper focuses on how visitor use distribution (measured through GPS tracking), activity type, and trail design influence the impacts to trail conditions. This paper also addresses statistical concerns related to spatial dependency. Results suggest that failure to account for spatial dependency can lead to erroneous Type I findings. Additionally, activity type (specifically horseback riders) and trail design were found to best predict trail impacts when controlling for spatial dependency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Two-Stage Hierarchical Group Testing for Multiple Infections with Application to the Infertility Prevention Project								BIOMETRICS				69	4			1064	1073		10.1111/biom.12080			DEC 2013	2013	Screening for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has benefited greatly from the use of group testing (pooled testing) to lower costs. With the development of assays that detect multiple infections, screening practices now involve testing pools of individuals for multiple infections simultaneously. Building on the research for single infection group testing procedures, we examine the performance of group testing for multiple infections. Our work is motivated by chlamydia and gonorrhea testing for the infertility prevention project (IPP), a national program in the United States. We consider a two-stage pooling algorithm currently used to perform testing for the IPP. We first derive the operating characteristics of this algorithm for classification purposes (e.g., expected number of tests, misclassification probabilities, etc.) and identify pool sizes that minimize the expected number of tests. We then develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate probabilities of infection using both group and individual retest responses. Our research shows that group testing can offer large cost savings when classifying individuals for multiple infections and can provide prevalence estimates that are actually more efficient than those from individual testing.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0006-341X	1541-0420		WOS:000328423000026	24117173

Journal of safety research				47				25	30		10.1016/j.jsr.2013.08.007			2013-Dec	2013	INTRODUCTION: At night pedestrians tend to overestimate their conspicuity to oncoming drivers, but little is known about factors affecting pedestrians' conspicuity estimates. This study examines how headlamp intensity and pedestrians' clothing influence judgments of their own conspicuity.METHOD: Forty-eight undergraduate students estimated their own conspicuity on an unilluminated closed road by walking in front of a stationary vehicle to the point at which they judged that they were just recognizable to the driver. Unknown to the participants, high beam intensity was manipulated between subjects by placing neutral density filters on the headlamps.RESULTS: Estimated conspicuity distances did not significantly vary with changes in headlamp intensity even when only 3% of the illumination from the headlamps was present.PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: These findings underscore the need to educate pedestrians about the visual challenges that drivers face at night and the need to minimize pedestrians' exposure to traffic flow at night.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1879-1247		MEDLINE:24237867	24237867	
J	Lovingood, Derek D.; Owens, Jeffrey R.; Seeber, Michael; Kornev, Konstantin G.; Luzinov, Igor								Preparation of Silica Nanoparticles Through Microwave-assisted Acid-catalysis								JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS					82					UNSP e51022	10.3791/51022			DEC 2013	2013	Microwave-assisted synthetic techniques were used to quickly and reproducibly produce silica nanoparticle sols using an acid catalyst with nanoparticle diameters ranging from 30-250 nm by varying the reaction conditions. Through the selection of a microwave compatible solvent, silicic acid precursor, catalyst, and microwave irradiation time, these microwave-assisted methods were capable of overcoming the previously reported shortcomings associated with synthesis of silica nanoparticles using microwave reactors. The siloxane precursor was hydrolyzed using the acid catalyst, HCl. Acetone, a low-tan delta solvent, mediates the condensation reactions and has minimal interaction with the electromagnetic field. Condensation reactions begin when the silicic acid precursor couples with the microwave radiation, leading to silica nanoparticle sol formation. The silica nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering data and scanning electron microscopy, which show the materials' morphology and size to be dependent on the reaction conditions. Microwave-assisted reactions produce silica nanoparticles with roughened textured surfaces that are atypical for silica sols produced by Stober's methods, which have smooth surfaces.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1940-087X			WOS:000209229000060	24379052

Hsein								An optimization based approach for structural design considering safety, robustness, and cost								ENGINEERING STRUCTURES				57				356	363		10.1016/j.engstruct.2013.09.040			DEC 2013	2013	Structural systems are subject to uncertainties due to variability in many hard-to-control noise factors, which include external loads, material properties, and construction workmanship. Traditional structural design methodologies, although clearly recognizing the presence of uncertainty, omit robustness against the effects of uncertainty in the design process. First, if the actual uncertainties in the design process are underestimated, the design may fail to satisfy safety requirements. Second, to guarantee safety in the presence of high variability of the system response, the structural designer may be forced to choose an overly conservative, thus inefficient and costly design. When robustness against uncertainty is not treated as one of the design objectives, the trade-off between over-design for safety and under-design for cost-savings is exacerbated. This manuscript demonstrates that safe and cost-effective structural engineering designs maybe achieved by implementing Robust Design concepts originally developed in manufacturing engineering to consider robustness against uncertainty. This manuscript presents an optimization-based methodology for the application of Robust Design principles to structural design and demonstrates its application on an academic problem involving design of a reinforced-concrete frame.

The release of potassium ion and calcium ion via the control of cross-linking density of a poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA)-based hydrogel containing 1 mol % 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and 5 mol % oligo(ethylene glycol) (400) monomethacrylate [OEG(400)MA] was investigated. Tetra(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (TEGDA), the cross-linker, was varied over the range of 1-12 mol %. Hydrogel discs (phi = 4.5 mm and h = 2.0 mm) were formed by UV polymerization within silicone isolators to contain 1.0 M CaCl2 and 0.1 M KCl, respectively. Isothermal release profiles, were measured at 37 degrees C in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid sodium salt (HEPES) buffer using either calcium ion or potassium ion selective electrodes (ISE). The resulting release profiles were found to be independent of cross-linking density. Average (n = 3) release profiles were fit to five different release models with the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation, a porous media transport model, exhibiting the greatest correlation (R-2 > 0.95). The diffusion exponent, n was calculated to be 0.24 +/- 0.02 and 0.36 +/- 0.04 for calcium ion and potassium ion respectively indicating non-Fickian diffusion. The resulting diffusion coefficients were calculated to be 2.6 x 10(-6) and 11.2 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s, which compare well to literature values of 2.25 x 10(-6) and 19.2 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s for calcium ion and potassium ion, respectively.									8	1	0	2	0	8			2073-4360			WOS:000330522500005

Determinants and Effects of Corporate Lobbying								FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT				42	4			931	957		10.1111/fima.12032			DEC 2013	2013	We examine the determinants and value effects of corporate lobbying, controlling for corporate political action committee (PAC) campaign contributions. We find evidence that firms with greater potential payoffs from favorable policy and regulations lobby most actively, and that managers often utilize both lobbying and campaign contribution channels to influence the political climate affecting the firm. We also find that shareholders value the lobbying activities pursued by management on their behalf, particularly if the firm does not have a PAC that contributed to an election campaign. The results are robust to a number of tests designed to mitigate potential omitted-variable and self-selection bias.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0046-3892	1755-053X		WOS:000330123900008

Little to no published information is available on the efficacy of insecticides labeled for professional use and exterior applications on homes and other structures against this insect. In a series of three experiments, we evaluated the residual efficacy of nine insecticides incorporating pyrethroid, neonicotinoid, and oxadiazine active ingredients on surfaces composed of five exterior building materials (vinyl soffit, brick, painted and unfinished plywood, and metal) at rates labeled for use in structural perimeter applications. Pyrethroids and pyrethroid-neonicotinoid mixes were broadly effective, resulting in 100% mortality or knockdown within 24 h in most cases. The neonicotinoid dinotefuran performed similarly on metal and vinyl surfaces, but its residual efficacy was reduced on more porous brick and wood surfaces. The oxadiazine indoxacarb acted more slowly than the other materials, but its performance was maintained on porous surfaces. Overwintering adults of M. cribraria were generally susceptible to the broad-spectrum insecticides most commonly used for exterior applications to homes and other structures.									3	0	0	3	0	4			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000329991200028	24498747

Migration of exsolved CO2 following depressurization of saturated brines								GREENHOUSE GASES-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				3	6	SI		503	515		10.1002/ghg.1379			DEC 2013	2013	Geologic disposal of supercritical CO2 in saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas fields will cause large volumes of brine to become saturated with dissolved CO2 at concentrations of 40 g/l or more. As CO2 dissolves in brine, the brine density increases slightly. This property favors the long-term storage security of the CO2 because the denser brine is less likely to move upwards toward shallower depths. However, there are plausible mechanisms by which the CO2-laden brine could be transported to a shallower depth, where the CO2 would come out of solution (exsolve), forming a mobile CO2 gas phase. Recent laboratory experiments of the exsolution process show that the CO2 phase relative permeability measured during exsolution is on the order of 1000 times lower than the relative permeability measured during a conventional CO2 core flood. Numerical simulations of upward brine migration through an open fault were performed using TOUGH2-ECO2N with the two types of relative permeability functions. When traditional core flood relative permeabilities are used, upward flow of a CO2 saturated brine leads to exsolution and the development of a highly mobile CO2 gas phase. When relative permeabilities measured during exsolution are used, the tendency for the exsolved CO2 to migrate as a separate phase is greatly reduced, and the exsolved CO2 can partially block brine flow through the open fault. For the conditions considered, use of the exsolution relative permeability functions reduced the upward CO2 flux by about a factor of four compared to the case with core flood relative permeability functions.

Within-Field Spatial Distribution of Megacopta cribraria (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) in Soybean (Fabales: Fabaceae)								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				42	6			1363	1374		10.1603/EN13199			DEC 2013	2013	The recently introduced plataspid Megacopta cribraria (F.) can infest fields of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) in the southeastern United States. Grid sampling in four soybean fields was conducted in 2011 and 2012 to study the spatial distribution of M. cribraria adults, nymphs, and egg masses. Peak oviposition typically occurred in early August, while peak levels of adults occurred in mid-late September. The overall sex ratio was slightly biased at 53.1 +/- 0.2% (SEM) male. Sweep samples of nymphs were biased toward late instars. All three life stages exhibited a generally aggregated spatial distribution based on Taylor's power law, Iwao's patchiness regression, and spatial analysis by distance indices (SADIE). Interpolation maps of local SADIE aggregation indices showed clusters of adults and nymphs located at field edges, and mean densities of adults were higher in samples taken from field edges than in those taken from field interiors. Adults and nymphs were often spatially associated based on SADIE, indicating spatial stability across life stages.									15	0	0	14	0	16			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000329990000027	24280636

Fluorescence ratio imaging for oxygen measurement in a tissue engineered construct								JOURNAL OF HISTOTECHNOLOGY				36	4			119	127		10.1179/2046023613Y.0000000033			DEC 2013	2013	Tissue engineering is limited by oxygen delivery to cells in cellular constructs. Oxygen-sensitive fluorescent particles, i.e. sensors, and fluorescence microscopy can facilitate the measurement of oxygen in tissue engineered constructs in a non-invasive, semi-quantitative, and spatial manner. This work examined two microscopy artifacts that limit fluorescence ratio imaging. These artifacts are (i) non-uniform fluorescence lamp illumination (ii) non-uniform sample fluorescence caused by either uneven sensor distribution or background fluorescence. Artifact correction and fluorescence ratio imaging were used to measure oxygen in a small-scale hypoxia hydrogel scaffold with fluorescent oxygen-sensitive nanoparticles. High cell density samples were oxygen deprived due to cellular oxygen consumption whereas hypoxia was not observed in low cell density samples. Next, cells were cultured in a hydrogel inside a bioreactor to demonstrate application of oxygen measurement methods to a more complex culture system. Widefield fluorescence microscopy imaging of nanoparticle sensors was used to measure oxygen. With fluorescence ratio imaging, an oxygen gradient was demonstrated, from high oxygen at the oxygen-supplied hydrogel periphery of the cellular hydrogel to low oxygen at the center.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0147-8885	2046-0236		WOS:000330131600004

Explicit and implicit decoupling methods often either fail or require relaxation when densities of the two materials are close. In this paper, a fluid-structure interaction problem is formulated as a least squares problem, where the jump in velocities of the two substructures is minimized by a Neumann control enforcing the continuity of stress on the interface. A decoupling optimization algorithm is discussed, which requires few nonlinear solves at each time step, and numerical results are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sun, Heshan								A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF HERD BEHAVIOR IN THE ADOPTION AND CONTINUED USE OF TECHNOLOGY								MIS QUARTERLY				37	4			1013	+					DEC 2013	2013	Herd literature suggests that people tend to discount their own beliefs and imitate others when making adoption decisions and that the resulting adoption decisions are fragile and can be easily reversed during the post-adoptive stage. This helps explain why the adoption of a number of new technologies. from Amazon's Kindle, to Apple's iPod, iPhone, and iPad, to various types of Web 2. 0 technologies. appears to have adoption patterns similar to those of new fashion trends (i. e., an initial en masse acquisition followed by subsequent abandonment). It is important to understand these phenomena because they are strongly related to the staying power of technology. From a herd behavior perspective, this study proposes two new concepts, namely discounting one's own information and imitating others, to describe herd behavior in technology adoption. A research model is developed to describe the conditions under which herd behavior in technology adoption occurs, how it impacts technology adoption decision making, and how it influences post-adoptive system use. A longitudinal study is conducted to examine the research model. Findings from this research suggest that the discounting of one's own beliefs and the imitating of others when adopting a new technology are provoked primarily by the observation of prior adoptions and perceptions of uncertainty regarding the adoption of new technology. Herd behavior has a significant influence on user technology adoption; however, it does not necessarily lead to the collapse of the user base, as predicted in the herd literature. Instead, imitation can help reduce post-adoption regret and thus serve as a legitimate strategy for choosing a good enough technology, which may or may not be the best option to enhance job performance. People tend to adjust their beliefs when herding and also to revive their discounted initial beliefs to modify their beliefs about the technology at the post-adoptive stage. Findings from this study have significant research and practical implications.									24	0	0	0	0	24			0276-7783			WOS:000329756800003

Laboratory evaluation of stabilizing methods for porous asphalt mixtures								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				49				772	780		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.08.076			DEC 2013	2013	The objective of this study was to compare the performance of different stabilizing additives (cellulose fibers, styrene-butadiene-styrene [SBS], and crumb rubber modifier [CRM]) in a porous asphalt mixture. The mix evaluation was based on draindown, permeability, abrasion resistance, moisture susceptibility, and rutting. The results emphasized the importance of stabilizing additives in porous asphalt mixtures. Further, the results indicated that the addition of fibers or CRM were the most effective at minimizing draindown; CRM or the combination of fibers and SBS were the most effective at increasing the abrasion resistance; and the fibers had no effect on the mix strength.

The effect of micro-fiber addition on the peak stress, peak strain, modulus of elasticity and energy absorption were then studied. Test results suggested that heat-treated UHSMs showed significantly higher strengths than non-heat-treated UHSMs. The micro-fiber addition significantly improved all the characteristics of UHSM. Both linear and non-linear correlations existed between the reinforcement indices of fibers and sigma-epsilon characteristics of UHSM. The analytical modeling of the sigma-epsilon curve showed good correlation with the experimental data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper assesses the economic impact of an electronic trade platform (i.e., MarketMaker) on agricultural producers. Contingent valuation techniques are employed to estimate the monetary value that producers placed on MarketMaker services. Results indicate that producers are willing to pay $47.02 annually for the services they receive. Registration type, amount of time registered, amount of time devoted to MarketMaker, type of user, number of marketing contacts received, and firm total annual sales have a significant effect on producers' willingness to pay.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1068-5502			WOS:000329334400005

Both materials are isostructural with LiUF5 (I4(1)/a, Z= 16). The chains of edge-sharing M4+F9 tricapped trigonal prisms (M4+: Ce4+, Th4+, and U4+) along the c axis are connected with others by corners in a three-dimensional framework, at which the cavities are filled out by lithium atoms. The lithium atoms are octahedrally coordinated by fluorines and the deformed LiF6 ocahedra share their edges. The lithium atoms form a distorted tetrahedral cluster unit.Both materials have been studied to about 10 GPa using single-crystal X-ray diffraction in diamond anvil cells. Upon compression, the structure of LiCeF5 is stable in the entire pressure range investigated here and its compressibility is isotropic. The compressibility of LiThF5 is anisotropic, with the a lattice parameter, perpendicular to the ThF9 chains, being more sensitive to pressures. LiThF5 undergoes a reversible phase transition to an as yet undetermined polymorph above 5 GPa. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Pedestrians' estimates of their own nighttime conspicuity are unaffected by severe reductions in headlight illumination								JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH				47				25	30		10.1016/j.jsr.2013.08.007			DEC 2013	2013	Introduction: At night pedestrians tend to overestimate their conspicuity to oncoming drivers, but little is known about factors affecting pedestrians' conspicuity estimates. This study examines how headlamp intensity and pedestrians' clothing influence judgments of their own conspicuity. Method: Forty-eight undergraduate students estimated their own conspicuity on an unilluminated closed road by walking in front of a stationary vehicle to the point at which they judged that they were just recognizable to the driver. Unknown to the participants, high beam intensity was manipulated between subjects by placing neutral density filters on the headlamps. Results: Estimated conspicuity distances did not significantly vary with changes in headlamp intensity even when only 3% of the illumination from the headlamps was present. Practical applications: These findings underscore the need to educate pedestrians about the visual challenges that drivers face at night and the need to minimize pedestrians' exposure to traffic flow at night.

Dips in the X-ray light curves have revealed that MAXI J1659-152 is the shortest period black hole candidate identified to date. Here we present the results of a large observing campaign at radio, submillimetre, near-infrared (nIR), optical and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. We have combined this very rich data set with the available X-ray observations to compile a broad-band picture of the evolution of this outburst. We have performed broad-band spectral modelling, demonstrating the presence of a spectral break at radio frequencies and a relationship between the radio spectrum and X-ray states. Also, we have determined physical parameters of the accretion disc and put them into context with respect to the other parameters of the binary system. Finally, we have investigated the radio-X-ray and nIR/optical/UV-X-ray correlations up to similar to 3 yr after the outburst onset to examine the link between the jet and the accretion disc, and found that there is no significant jet contribution to the nIR emission when the source is in the soft or intermediate X-ray spectral state, consistent with our detection of the jet break at radio frequencies during these states.									12	1	0	0	0	12			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000327540000053

Adaptive Capacity-Achieving Channel Coding for Fountain-Coded Multicast Transmission in Packet Radio Systems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS				12	12			6514	6526		10.1109/TWC.2013.102813.130746			DEC 2013	2013	For time-varying fading, adaptation of the physical-layer channel code greatly enhances the throughput of a multicast transmission system, even if the system employs an application-layer fountain code for packet erasure correction. Performance evaluations for adaptive channel-coding protocols typically require extensive simulations of the fading channel, the iterative decoding process, and the generation of the control information that is used for the adaptation of the channel code. We present a method for the evaluation of such protocols that avoids a substantial amount of the computation required by traditional simulations, and we demonstrate that some important performance measures can be evaluated entirely by analysis. By the use of capacity-achieving channel codes in our investigation, we also decouple the performance of the adaptive coding protocol from the performance of a particular type of channel code and decoding method, which facilitates comparisons among different protocols. The application of our methods is demonstrated for two adaptive channel-coding protocols that are candidates for fountain-coded multicast transmission in packet radio systems.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1536-1276	1558-2248		WOS:000328966200046

Some of these models explicitly model the mosquito population, while others model the mosquitoes implicitly in the transmission term. We study the impact of modeling assumptions on the dynamics of dengue in Thailand by fitting dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) data to simple vector-host and SIR models using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation. The parameter estimates obtained for both models were consistent with previous studies. Most importantly, model selection found that the SIR model was substantially better than the vector-host model for the DHF data from Thailand. Therefore, explicitly incorporating the mosquito population may not be necessary in modeling dengue transmission for some populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J	Alley, Bethany L.; Willis, Ben; Rodgers, John, Jr.; Castle, James W.								Water depths and treatment performance of pilot-scale free water surface constructed wetland treatment systems for simulated fresh oilfield produced water								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				61				190	199		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.09.021			DEC 2013	2013	Water depth may enhance performance of constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTSs) for renovation of complex mixtures such as fresh oilfield produced waters (FOPWs) that contain constituents such as oil and divalent metals (i.e. Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn). The purpose of this research was to evaluate the influence of water depth on treatment performance of a free water surface pilot-scale CWTS for renovating simulated FOPW. A CWTS was designed with an oil-water separator and wetland cells with fixed hydraulic retention time (HRT), surface area, volume, water depth, hydraulic loading rate (HLR), and mass loading rate (MLR) as treatment variables. Replicated wetland series were constructed with different water depths and four cells for each series. For wetland series with water depths of 15 and 23 cm, rates of removal of oil marker compounds (0.44-1.17 day(-1)) were greater than rates of removal for wetland series with water depths of 46 and 56 cm (no removal-0.12 day(-1)). As water depth decreased (i.e. from 56 to 15 cm) and sediment redox potential increased (i.e. from -250 to 234 mV) in the wetland series, concentrations of oil marker compounds decreased in outflows of the wetland cells. For wetland series with water depths of 46 and 56 cm, rates of removal for Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn (0.31-1.11 day(-1)) were greater than rates of removal for wetland series with water depths of 15 and 23 cm (0.003 and 0.23 day(-1)). As water depth increased (i.e. from 15 to 56 cm) and sediment redox potential decreased in the wetland series, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn concentrations decreased in outflows of the wetland cells. From these results, water depth either enhanced or decreased treatment performance of a CWTS depending on the targeted constituent (i.e. oil, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn) due to changes in the sediment redox potential and dissolved oxygen content in the wetland cells. Data from this study indicated that sequential wetland cells could enhance the treatment of complex mixtures like FOPW by establishing specific conditions in each wetland cell targeting removal of different classes of constituents.

Floating treatment wetland aided remediation of nitrogen and phosphorus from simulated stormwater runoff								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				61				207	215		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.09.020			DEC 2013	2013	Floating treatment wetlands are potential alternatives to traditional constructed wetlands for remediating nutrient-rich water. This study examined the remediation efficacy of floating treatment wetlands planted with Canna flaccida and Juncus effusus in a replicated trough system over two growing seasons at two nutrient loading rates. Plant growth parameters were measured on a biweekly basis, and water quality parameters were monitored weekly. Plant shoots and roots were harvested at the end of the first growing season, and biomass was dried, ground, and analyzed for nutrient content. Juncus plants fixed 28.5 +/- 3.4 gN per m(2) and 1.69 +/- 0.2g P per m(2), while Canna fixed 16.8 +/- 2.8 gN per m(2) and 1.05 +/- 0.2g P per m(2). More N and P were fixed in the below-mat biomass of both species than in the above-mat biomass, thus whole-plant harvest may be a critical management strategy for floating treatment wetlands. During the first season, when nutrient addition rates simulated stormwater loading conditions, effluent nutrient concentrations were very low and averaged 0.14 +/- 0.04 mg L-1 total N and 0.02 +/- 0.01 mg L-1 total P. During the second season, nutrient-loading rate into treatment wetlands was doubled to simulate a more nutrient-rich runoff, and effluent nutrient concentrations averaged 0.79 +/- 0.3 mgL(-1) total N and 0.12 +/- 0.03 mg L-1 total P. Floating treatment wetlands may prove most effective in low nutrient environments where it is necessary to polish water quality to extremely low P concentrations.

However, researchers have not adequately assessed how the high school learning environment differentially affects boys and girls. An important component of the learning environment in US secondary school is the opportunity to learn in an Advanced Placement (AP) curriculum, which allows high school students to do college-level work. Using the US National Education Longitudinal Study 1988-2000, we explain how high school AP curriculum interacts with gender to predict the selectivity of colleges that students attend. The results show that girls and boys who attend high schools with a larger percentage of students in AP curriculum attend more selective colleges (that require higher standardised scores for admissions); yet the positive effect of the opportunity to learn in an AP curriculum is greater for girls than for boys. This research furthers the debate about the effects of school structure on gender stratification.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0954-0253	1360-0516		WOS:000328189200004

One method to reduce these emissions is to connect the heatsink to the PCB using shorting posts. This paper examines the effectiveness of shorting posts for reducing the radiated emissions from tall heatsinks, based on the partial inductance of the posts. A closed-form expression is derived for calculating the reduction in emissions that is obtained by shorting posts mounted symmetrically around the perimeter of the heatsink. The effectiveness of connecting the posts to the board through a resistance to damp resonant peaks is also discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0018-9375	1558-187X		WOS:000328697800033

JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY				115	12			1855	1861		10.1152/japplphysiol.00770.2013			DEC 2013	2013	Acute hypoxia is thought to trigger protective responses that, in tissues like heart and carotid body, include rapid (5-10 s) suppression of Ca2+ and K+ channels. To gain insight into the mechanism for the suppression of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel, we measured O-2-dependent fluorescence in the immediate vicinity of voltage-clamped cardiac cells subjected to rapid exchange of solutions with different O-2 tensions. This was accomplished with an experimental chamber with a glass bottom that was used as a light guide for excitation of a thin ruthenium-based O-2-sensitive ORMOSIL coating. Fluorescence imaging showed that steady-state PO2 was well controlled within the entire stream from an electromagnetically controlled solution "puffer" but that changes were slower at the periphery of the stream (tau(1/2) similar to 500 ms) than immediately around the voltage-clamped myocyte (tau(1/2) similar to 225 ms) where, in turn, firmly attached cells produced an additional local delay of 50-100 ms. Performing simultaneous voltage clamp and O-2 measurements, we found that acute hypoxia gradually and reversibly suppressed the Ca2+ channel (Ca-V 1.2). Using Ba2+ as charge carrier, the suppression was significant after 1.5 s, reached similar to 10% after 2.5 s, and was nearly completely reversible in 5 s. The described fluorescence measurements provide the means to check and fine tune solution puffers and suggest that changes in PO2 can be accomplished within similar to 200 ms. The rapid and reversible suppression of barium current under hypoxia is consistent with the notion that the cardiac Ca2+ channel is directly modulated by O-2.									1	0	0	1	0	1			8750-7587	1522-1601		WOS:000328847900013	24157525

This ultracompact graphene/C-60 based optical diode is versatile with an inherently large bandwidth, chemical and thermal stability, and is poised for cost-effective large-scale integration with existing fabrication technologies.									16	0	0	1	0	16			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000328439200002	24224861

It is hypothesized that a package providing the most physical product exposure will be preferred by consumers over alternative structural designs. To test this, three similar products were placed in four distinct package structures varying the amount of visible product exposure (0%, 40%, 90% and 100%). The packages were positioned on the shelves of the fully immersive simulated shopping environment CUshop. A total of 127 participants were fitted with eye-tracking glasses and presented a shopping list that included one of the three grill ware products (fork, spatula and tongs). Participants were asked to shop as they normally would, and data concerning their visual attention in the store and final purchase selection was collected. Purchase patterns showed that the packaging that revealed the most physical product possible was chosen more than the other three configurations tested. Analysis of eye-tracking data supports expected behaviour, suggesting that consumers prefer to see at least some of the product, with the 0% visible product receiving significantly fewer fixations, a slower time to first fixation and lower total fixation durations.

J	Maderak, Ryan M.; Deliyannis, Constantine P.; King, Jeremy R.; Cummings, Jeffery D.								WIYN OPEN CLUSTER STUDY. LVII. OXYGEN ABUNDANCES OF SOLAR-TYPE DWARFS IN THE HYADES AND NGC 752								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				146	6					143	10.1088/0004-6256/146/6/143			DEC 2013	2013	Oxygen has been proposed to be a superior tracer, compared to iron, for studying galactic chemical evolution. In the context of improving our understanding of the evolution of Galactic oxygen using open clusters, we present a spectroscopic analysis of oxygen and iron abundances in the 650 Myr old Hyades cluster and in the 1.45 Gyr old cluster NGC 752, using high-dispersion 7774 angstrom O I triplet region spectra of dwarfs in these clusters acquired with the Hydra MOS on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. Motivated by recent improvements in analysis of the triplet, we use a strictly differential analysis in solar-type stars to obtain reliable 0 abundances. Using stars whose radial velocities and spectral cross-correlation analyses are consistent with single-star membership, we report Hyades cluster averages of [O/H] = 0.195 +/- 0.010 and [Fe/H] = 0.130 +/- 0.009 based on 22 stars, and NGC 752 cluster averages of [O/H] = -0.077 +/- 0.02 and [Fe/H] = -0.063 +/- 0.013 based on 36 stars (where the errors are sigma(mu); we discuss possible additional systematic errors). These cluster abundance averages are in very good agreement with most previous determinations. Whereas the [O/H] cluster averages utilize only stars found in the "prime" T-eff range straddling the solar T-eff, the [Fe/H] cluster averages come from stars exhibiting a flat [Fe/H]-T-eff relation of over 1000 K for the Hyades and nearly 2000 K for NGC 752. Previous studies of open clusters younger than NGC 752 have reported oxygen triplet over abundances in cool dwarfs, as compared to oxygen abundances of the prime-T-eff range. We report that NGC 752 also shows such overabundances, at a higher level than the Hyades overabundances, and thus contradicts the idea of a decline of such overabundances with increasing age. We discuss evidence for and against correlations of the oxygen overabundances with rotation, X-ray luminosity, chromospheric activity, and metallicity.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0004-6256	1538-3881		WOS:000327747700006

Derived CNs from rainfall/runoff pairs ranged from 46 to 90 for the Upper Debidue Creek (UDC) watershed and from 42 to 89 for the Watershed 80 (WS80). However, runoff generation from storm events was strongly related to water table elevation, where seasonally variable evapotranspirative wet and dry moisture conditions persist. Seasonal water table fluctuation is independent of, but can be compounded by, wet conditions that occur as a result of prior storm events, further complicating flow prediction. Runoff predictions for LCP first-order watersheds do not compare closely to measured flow under the average moisture condition normally associated with the CN method. In this study, however, results show improvement in flow predictions using CNs adjusted for antecedent runoff conditions and based on water table position. These results indicate that adaptations of CN model parameters are required for reliable flow predictions for these LCP catchments with shallow water tables. Low gradient topography and shallow water table characteristics of LCP watersheds allow for unique hydrologic conditions that must be assessed and managed differently than higher gradient watersheds.									7	2	0	1	0	8			1093-474X	1752-1688		WOS:000327608200005

In this paper, we focus on small j and k, and relate the concept of vertical bar j, k vertical bar-sets to a host of other concepts in domination theory, including perfect domination, efficient domination, nearly perfect sets, 2-packings, and k-dependent sets. We also determine bounds on the cardinality of minimum [1, 2]-sets, and investigate extremal graphs achieving these bounds. This study has implications for restrained domination as well. Using a result for [1, 3]-sets, we show that, for any grid graph G, the restrained domination number is equal to the domination number of G. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Lane-changing models are a vital component of various microscopic traffic simulation tools, which are extensively used and playing an increasingly important role in Intelligent Transportation Systems studies. The authors conducted a detailed review and systematic comparison of existing microscopic lane-changing models that are related to roadway traffic simulation to provide a better understanding of respective properties, including strengths and weaknesses of the lane-changing models, and to identify potential for model improvement using existing and emerging data collection technologies. Many models have been developed in the last few decades to capture the uncertainty in lane change modeling; however, lane-changing behavior in the real world is very complex due to driver distraction (e. g., texting and cellphone or smartphone use) and environmental (e. g., pavement and lighting conditions) and geometric (e. g., horizontal and vertical curves) factors of the roadway, which have not been adequately considered in existing models. Therefore, large and detailed microscopic vehicle trajectory data sets are needed to develop new lane changing models that address these issues, and to calibrate and validate lane-changing models for representing the real world reliably. Possible measures to improve the accuracy and reliability of lane-changing models are also discussed in this paper.									16	1	0	1	0	16			1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000328048100035

This paper proposes an integrated dispatch model that offers a generalized means for determining the potential accommodated DG capacity along with appropriate DG sitting for given urban electricity and water system configurations. The AC optimal power flow (ACOPF)-based system model was developed for each phase of a modified electrical distribution test feeder. A corresponding water distribution system was then designed with its mathematical model developed. A mathematical model of the CHP-based DG system was also developed to couple the electricity and water systems. Results indicate the optimal DG capacity and its optimal sitting based on urban electricity and water infrastructures. The present water network cannot support the complete recovery of the exhaust heat. The mutual impacts on operational performances of CHP-based DG units and urban energy infrastructures were also investigated.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1949-3053			WOS:000328064100042

Relationships between nutrients and plant density in liquid media during micropropagation and acclimatization of turmeric								IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT				49	6			724	736		10.1007/s11627-013-9576-y			DEC 2013	2013	To improve micropropagation and acclimatization of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), we evaluated the effects of media volume, plant density, macronutrient ion concentrations, cationic ratios [NH4 (+)]/[K+], and sucrose concentration. Multiplication was highest with low bud density. Yield of new plants was highest with high bud density, the most sucrose, the highest concentration of macronutrients, and the greatest volume of medium. However, maximum plant size required low-density, reduced sucrose and elimination of NH4 (+). The largest plants grew quickest during greenhouse acclimatization when macronutrients were lowered to 20 mM. In a follow-up experiment, media volume was set at 40 mL with 5% sucrose with NH4 (+) reduced to 5 mM, and the effects of varying P, Ca, Mg, KNO3, and bud densities were assessed. The largest plants were produced at low density. More importantly, at high density the optimal concentrations of P, Ca, Mg, and KNO3 predicted plant size that was nearly equal to the maximum value from low-density cultures in the prior experiment. Growth of plants during greenhouse acclimatization was increased by modifications of in vitro medium with plants cultured with 3.32 mM P, 4.5 mM Mg, and 37 mM KNO3 predicted to grow most rapidly. The effect of starter fertilizer in the greenhouse mix was much less than the effects of P, Mg, and KNO3 in vitro. These results showed (1) optimal media formulae for different stages of micropropagation and (2) process-related factors such as plant density and media volume affected the optimal nutrient concentrations.									5	0	0	3	0	5			1054-5476	1475-2689		WOS:000328201700011

This rotavirus Wa strain had the expected genome constellation of G1-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1 and was designated RVA/Human-tc/USA/WaCS/1974/G1P[8]. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a close relationship to four human rotavirus Wa variants (Wag5re, Wag7/8re, ParWa and VirWa) derived from the original 1974 human isolate. There were rearrangements in the Wag5re- and Wag7/8re variants in genome segments 5 (Wag5re) and 7 and 8 (Wag7/8re), which were not present in WaCS. Pairwise comparisons and a combined molecular clock for the Wa rotavirus genome indicated a close relationship between WaCS and ParWa and VirWa. These results suggest that WaCS is most probably an early cell culture adapted variant from the initial gnotobiotic pig passaged Wa isolate. Evolutionary pressure analysis identified a possible negative selected amino acid site in VP1 (genome segment 1) and a likely positive selected site in VP4 (genome segment 4). The WaCS may be more appropriate as a rotavirus Wa reference sequence than the current composite Wa reference genome. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

The current study utilized a survey design where results from the qualitative investigation were quantitized to develop an instrument that allowed participants to identify qualities of facilitators that are necessary to motivate teachers to be engaged in professional development sessions related to mathematics at the elementary level. This paper describes the instrument development process and results when implemented to a sample of teachers in the USA (n = 565). Findings from this research indicate that participants share the same perceptions of what it means to be an influential facilitator as participants from the phenomenological investigation of facilitator characteristics.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1571-0068	1573-1774		WOS:000328204200007

Previous studies have shown that beta-arrestin2 deletion enhances the efficacy of specific cannabinoid agonists. Objective: The present study hypothesized that brain cannabinoid CB1 receptors are regulated by beta-arrestin2. Methods: Beta-arrestin2+/+ and -/- mice were used. Western blotting was used to determine the relative levels of each beta-arrestin subtype in mouse brain. Receptor binding was measured to determine whether deletion of beta-arrestin2 influences agonist binding to brain CB1 receptors, or the subcellular localization of CB1 in brain membranes subjected to differential centrifugation. A variety of cannabinoid agonists from different chemical classes were investigated for their ability to activate G-proteins in the presence and absence of beta-arrestin2 in cerebellum, hippocampus and cortex. Results: No differences were found in the density of beta-arrestin1 or cannabinoid CB1 receptors in several brains of betaarrestin2+/+ versus -/- mice. Differences between genotypes were found in the proportion of high-and low-affinity agonist binding sites in brain areas that naturally express higher levels of beta-arrestin2. Cortex from beta-arrestin2-/- mice contained less CB1 in the P1 fraction and more CB1 in the P2 fraction compared to beta-arrestin2+/+. Of the agonists assayed for activity, only Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exhibited a difference between genotypes, in that it was less efficacious in beta-arrestin2-/- than +/+ mouse membranes. Conclusion: Beta-arrestin2 regulates cannabinoid CB1 receptors in brain.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1079-9893	1532-4281		WOS:000328121600007	24094141

Using this process, electric current level becomes a new degree of freedom for process control. In this work, we present some alternative control architectures allowing for new avenues of control using such a process. The primary findings are architectures to allow for forming at constant force and forming at constant stress levels by modulating electric current to directly control material strength. These are demonstrated in a tensile forming operation, and found to produce the desired results. Combining these control approaches with previous and contemporary efforts in modeling of the process physics will allow for system identification of material response properties and model-based control of difficult-to-observe process parameters such as real time temperature gradients.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1087-1357	1528-8935		WOS:000327871800005

Potential Contribution of Combined Atmospheric Ca2+ and Mg2+ Wet Deposition Within the Continental US to Soil Inorganic Carbon Sequestration								PEDOSPHERE				23	6			808	814					DEC 2013	2013	Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks continuously change from the formation of pedogenic carbonates, a process requiring inputs of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. This study ranked the soil orders in terms of potential inorganic carbon sequestration resulting from wet Ca2+ and Mg2+ deposition from 1994 to 2003 within the continental United States. The analysis revealed that average annual atmospheric wet deposition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ was the highest in the Central Midwest-Great Plains region, likely due to soil particle input from loess-derived soils. The soil orders receiving the highest total average annual atmospheric wet Ca2+ and Mg2+ deposition, expressed as potential inorganic carbon formation (barring losses from erosion and leaching), were: 1) Mollisols (1.1 x 10(8) kg C), 2) Alfisols (8.4 x 10(7) kg C), 3) Entisols (3.8 x 10(7) kg C), and 4) Aridisols (2.8 x 10(7) kg C). In terms of area-normalized result, the soil orders were ranked: 1) Histosols (73 kg C km(-2)), 2) Alfisols and Vertisols (64 kg C km(-2)), 3) Mollisols (62 kg C km(-2)), and 4) Spodosols (52 kg C km(-2)). The results of this study provide an estimate of potential soil inorganic carbon sequestration as a result of atmospheric wet Ca2+ and Mg2+ deposition, and this information may be useful in assessing dynamic nature of soil inorganic carbon pools.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1002-0160	2210-5107		WOS:000327913300011

ASSESSING MOTIVATION TO READ The Motivation to Read Profile-Revised								READING TEACHER				67	4			273	282		10.1002/trtr.1215			DEC 2013	2013	For most classroom teachers, recognizing when students are engaged in literacy activities - and perhaps more glaringly, when they are not - is a process that is key to evaluating the potential success of the instruction being offered. Students who are engaged have their eyes on what they are doing, are ardently attending to the teacher's read aloud or in reflective repose as they read independently. Moreover, students who are motivated to participate in literacy instruction are on task, cognitively and strategically engaged with the material, and perhaps affectively responding to the activity as well. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to report on an updated and more reliable revision of the Motivation to Read Profile (MRP-R) and to engage in a discussion of how periodic, class-wide administration of the MRP-R can inform practices to support motivating classroom contexts.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0034-0561	1936-2714		WOS:000327601800005

The process is fully reversible and can be described with a reaction of the kind A + B <-> C <-> S. The system's behavior is fully controlled by Peclet (Pe) and three Damkohler (Da(j,) j = {1, 2, 3}) numbers, which quantify the relative importance of the four key mechanisms involved in the transport process, i.e. advection, molecular diffusion, homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. We use multiple-scale expansions to upscale the pore-scale system of equations to the macroscale, and establish sufficient conditions under which macroscopic local advection-dispersion-reaction equations (ADREs) provide an accurate representation of the pore-scale processes. These conditions reveal that (i) the heterogeneous reaction leads to more stringent constraints compared to the homogeneous reactions, and (ii) advection can favorably enhance pore-scale mixing in the presence of fast reactions and relatively low molecular diffusion. Such conditions are summarized by a phase diagram in the (Pe,Da(j))-space, and verified through numerical simulations of multicomponent transport in a planar fracture with reacting walls. Our computations suggest that the constraints derived in our analysis are robust in identifying sufficient as well as necessary conditions for homogenizability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Ebselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one, EbSe) was identified in a screen as a potent inhibitor of T. brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1), the first enzyme in the pathway. EbSe has a history of promiscuity as an enzyme inhibitor, inactivating proteins through seleno-sulfide conjugation with Cys residues. Indeed, dilution of TbHK1 and inhibitor following incubation did not temper inhibition suggesting conjugate formation. Using mass spectrometry to analyze EbSe-based modifications revealed that two Cys residues (C327 and C369) were oxidized after treatment. Site-directed mutagenesis of C327 led to enzyme inactivation indicating that C327 was essential for catalysis. C369 was not essential, suggesting that EbSe inhibition of TbHK1 was the consequence of modification of C327 via thiol oxidation. Additionally, neither EbSe treatment nor mutation of the nine TbHK1 Cys residues appreciably altered enzyme quaternary structure. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To maintain and ensure adequate operation of the physical environment, facility management must maintain a state of continuous compliance and constant readiness. This requires the facility management personnel to have a full understanding of the regulatory standards and guidelines that address the performance of a healthcare facility. This paper discusses an analysis of the major healthcare standards and guidelines that the American Society of Healthcare Engineers suggests facility management groups need to be familiar with. A gap analysis is performed to identify gaps between the design and construction guidelines and their ability to support healthcare facility operation and performance standards. Finally, a case example is used to discuss how the standards and regulations can be incorporated into a healthcare facility information framework to support facility operations and performance compliance.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0887-3828	1943-5509		WOS:000327026000008

CAM systems traditionally rely on parametric surface representations of the parts and complex algorithms to produce the tool paths. This paper presents a new path generation framework that is based on parallel algorithms and hardware that utilizes voxel models. The use of new parallel algorithms allows rapid calculations of tool paths automatically from the voxel model. The core components of this framework are a method of generating digital voxel models from tessellated surface models, a method to obtain digital surface information by a parallel ray-casting approach, and a new approach to calculate gouge-free tool paths in parallel from surface information and generalized cutting geometry. The performance of utilizing digital models within this framework is then discussed with respect to timing and actual cutting results.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0268-3768	1433-3015		WOS:000327095900002

Legal Risk in Selection: An Analysis of Processes and Tools								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY				28	4	SI		401	410		10.1007/s10869-013-9299-4			DEC 2013	2013	This paper reviews a decade of employment litigation to illuminate the most legally dangerous selection devices and employment practices.A sample (n = 312) of court cases drawn from 10 years of Bloomberg BNA case briefs was analyzed to determine which selection tools (e.g., biographical information blank, interview, cognitive ability test, and psychomotor test) and which selection processes (e.g., violations of the four-fifths rule, administrative inconsistencies, lack of documentation, failure to provide accommodations) are most at risk for litigation for unfair employment practices.Results demonstrate that while some selection tools do attract legal scrutiny, dangerous hiring practices such as favoritism against protected classes and improper human resource documentation put employers at far greater risk of suit. When considering cases settled outside of court and those that continued to trial, the data reveal that employers lose employment discrimination cases at a rate nearing 90 % and suffer an average payout of over $1.5 million per case.Just as legal challenges once drove the search for selection tools free of adverse impact, the current legal landscape demonstrates the necessity of fair and consistent selection processes. This paper provides evidence of common mistakes in implementing selection systems-mistakes that lead to costly legal battles.This paper reduces cumbersome legal records into useful evidence of trends in recent employment law cases. Selection system designers and organizations who implement them will benefit from avoiding the risky hiring practices presented in this paper.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0889-3268	1573-353X		WOS:000326807300003

This new design methodology, seeking to achieve a certain level of design robustness in addition to meeting safety and cost requirements, is complementary to traditional design methods. Here a design is considered robust if the variation in the system response is insensitive to the variation in noise factors (mainly uncertain soil parameters). To aid in selection of the best design, a Pareto front that describes a tradeoff relationship between cost and robustness at a given safety level can be established using the RGD methodology. The new design methodology is illustrated with an example of drilled-shaft design for axial compression. The significance of the RGD methodology is demonstrated.									4	1	0	0	0	5			1090-0241	1943-5606		WOS:000327025800001

The cohesive energy, elastic constants, lattice parameters and relaxed vacancy formation energy were used to fit the potential. The fitted-potential was validated by a comparison to first-principles and, wherever available, experimental results for the lattice energies of various crystal structures: vacancy cluster, interstitial formation and surface. Using a large cutoff distance of 5 angstrom, which includes interactions to approximately the eighth neighbor shell of beryllium, allows our potential to reproduce these quantities considerably better than previous EAM potentials. The accuracy obtained by our potential is similar to or in some cases even better than available modified EAM potentials, while being computationally less intensive.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0965-0393	1361-651X		WOS:000327063600001

A number of the transgenic lines released more polysaccharides following protease digestion and were more flexible than wild-type plants, but otherwise normal in phenotype. Here, we report that overexpression of the tyrosine-rich peptide encoding sequence in these transgenic poplar plants did not significantly alter total lignin quantity or quality (S/G lignin ratio), five- and six-carbon sugar contents, growth rate, or susceptibility to a major poplar fungal pathogen, Septoria musiva. Whole-genome microarray analysis revealed a total of 411 differentially expressed transcripts in transgenic lines, all with decreased transcript abundance relative to wild-type plants. Their corresponding genes were overrepresented in functional categories such as secondary metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and energy metabolism. Transcript abundance was decreased primarily for five types of genes encoding proteins involved in cell-wall organization and in lignin biosynthesis. The expression of a subset of 19 of the differentially regulated genes by qRT-PCR validated the microarray results. Our study has identified pathways and gene candidates that may be the underlying cause for the enhanced flexibility and digestibility of the stems of poplar plants expressing the TYR transgene.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0721-7714	1432-203X		WOS:000327218700001	24013761

To investigate the mechanisms that allow P. euphratica to maintain growth in arid regions, the responses of the plant to soil water deficit were analyzed at a systems level using physiological and pyrosequencing approaches. We generated 218,601 and 287,120 reads from non-stressed control and drought-stressed P. euphratica leaves respectively, totaling over 200 million base pairs. After assembly, 24,013 transcripts were yielded with an average length of 1,128 bp. We determined 2,279 simple sequence repeats, which may have possible information for understanding drought adaption of woody plants. Stomatal closure was inhibited under moderate drought to maintain a relatively high rate of CO2 assimilation and water transportation, which was supposed to be important for P. euphratica to maintain normal growth and develop vigorous root systems in an adverse environment. This was accompanied by strong transcriptional remodeling of stress-perception, signaling and transcription regulation, photoprotective system, oxidative stress detoxification, and other stress responsive genes. In addition, genes involved in stomatal closure inhibition, ascorbate-glutathione pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome system that may specially modulate the drought stress responses of P. euphratica are highlighted. Our analysis provides a comprehensive picture of how P. euphratica responds to drought stress at physiological and transcriptome levels which may help to understand molecular mechanisms associated with drought response and could be useful for genetic engineering of woody plants.									28	1	0	28	0	29			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000327093600003	23857471

Little is known about these conversations in the natural setting. This study's aim was to describe the processes of prognostic communication in PC goals of care consultations. Using line-by-line qualitative analysis, we examined prognostic conversation in 66 audio-taped PC consultations. We identified five processes by which clinicians link prognoses, values, and goals of care: (1) signposting the crossroads; (2) closing off a goal; (3) clarifying current path; (4) linking paths and patients' values; and (5) choosing among paths. The findings add to our understanding of PC consultation by describing how prognoses link with patients' values and choices in goals of care conversations. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Effects of Feeding versus Providing Food on Perceived Attraction and Intimacy								HUMAN NATURE-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY BIOSOCIAL PERSPECTIVE				24	4			430	443		10.1007/s12110-013-9179-7			DEC 2013	2013	Food sharing may be used for mate attraction, sexual access, or mate retention in humans, as in many other species. Adult humans tend to perceive more intimacy in a couple if feeding is observed, but the increased perceived intimacy may be due to resource provisioning rather than feeding per se. To address this issue, 210 university students (66 male) watched five short videos, each showing a different mixed-sex pair of adults dining together and including feeding or simple provisioning or no food sharing. A survey concerning attraction and intimacy in the dyad was completed after each video. Both provisioning and feeding produced higher ratings of "Involvement," with feeding producing the highest ratings. Similarly, the perceived attraction of each actor to the other was lowest when no food sharing was shown and highest when feeding was displayed. These findings are consistent with a view of feeding as a courtship display in humans.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1045-6767	1936-4776		WOS:000326446300005	24105261	
J	Shen, Haiying; Lin, Yuhua; Li, Ze								Refining Reputation to Truly Select High-QoS Servers in Peer-to-Peer Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				24	12			2439	2450		10.1109/TPDS.2012.338			DEC 2013	2013	Peer-to-peer networks (P2Ps) use reputation systems to provide incentives for nodes to offer high quality of service (QoS) and thwart the intentions of dishonest or selfish nodes. Existing reputation systems have two problems. First, they directly regard node reputation as trust. Rather, reputation represents the opinions formed by others about a node's QoS behavior, while trust represents a node's honesty and willingness to cooperate. In addition to trust, factors such as node capacity and lifetime also influence reputation. Due to these factors' heterogeneity and variance over time, reputation cannot directly reflect a node's trust or current QoS. Second, existing reputation systems guide a node to select the server with the highest reputation, which may not actually select the highest QoS server and would overload the highest reputed nodes. This work aims to accurately reflect node trust and provide guidance for high-QoS server selection. Through experimental study, we find that node trust, available capacity, and lifetime positively affect node reputation. Based on this observation, we first propose a manual trust model and an automatic trust model that remove the influence of additional factors on reputation to truly reflect node trust. We then propose a high-QoS server selection algorithm that separately considers node trust, current available capacity, and lifetime. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the trust models in accurate node trust reflection compared with an existing reputation system. Moreover, the server selection algorithm dramatically increases the success rate of service requests and avoids overloading nodes.									5	1	0	0	0	6			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000326501400013

These data are incorporated into aggregate accounting exercises with the aim of comparing cross-state results to those found in cross-country samples. Our aggregate results agree closely with the cross-country literature: input accumulation accounts for most of output growth, between three-fifths and three-quarters, but variation in the growth of TFP accounts for about three-quarters of the variation in the growth rate of output per worker. In convergence accounting, convergence of log TFP accounts for about seventy percent of the observed convergence in log output per worker.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1381-4338	1573-7020		WOS:000326699100001

Optimal weights for least squares and quantile loss functions can be chosen to provide maximum efficiency and these optimal weights can be estimated from data. The resulting estimators are at least as efficient as those provided by existing procedures, but can be much more efficient for many distributions. The data-based weights adapt to the tails of the error distribution resulting in a procedure which is both robust and resistant. Furthermore, the assumption of homogeneous error variance is not required. To illustrate its practical use, we apply the proposed method to model the motorcycle data.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1048-5252	1029-0311		WOS:000325256100005

A long-term ultraviolet aging procedure on foamed WMA mixtures								MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES				46	12			1987	2001		10.1617/s11527-013-0031-7			DEC 2013	2013	Long-term thermal and ultraviolet (UV) aging procedures of asphalt mixtures are complicated, but can be simulated in the laboratory. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of long-term thermal and UV aging on foamed warm-mix asphalt (WMA) mixtures. Rut resistance, indirect tensile strength (ITS), deformation, dissipated elastic energy, and fracture energy were measured for all mixtures. The experimental design included two aggregate sources; three aging states (unaged, thermal and UV aging); one water-bearing WMA additive and water foaming technology; two PG 64-22 binders, and three air void contents (2, 4, and 7 %). A total of 24 mixtures were evaluated and 144 specimens were made and tested in this study. The test results indicated that thermal and UV aging procedures had limited contribution in improving the rut resistance of a mixture as air void content was low. Unaged samples had the highest ITS values amongst three aging states while UV aged samples had the lowest. In addition, UV aged mixtures generally had greater dissipated energy than thermal aged mixtures regardless of foaming technology, aggregate source, and air void. Moreover, the foaming technology might reduce the stored elastic energy of the mixture due to additional water or released water from water-bearing additive. Furthermore, UV aging generally reduces the fracture resistance of an asphalt mixture than standard thermal aging. In addition, when using WMA foaming technology, aggregate source affects the fracture resistance of the asphalt mixture.									21	0	0	0	0	21			1359-5997	1871-6873		WOS:000326289400002

A total of 136 compounds were identified from five essential oils, constituting 85.5-99.7% of the oils. Essential oils and pure compounds were evaluated for their insecticidal activity against Stephanitis pyrioides and larvicidal and biting deterrent activity against Aedes aegypti.ResultsAll five geranium oils were toxic to S. pyrioides, and four of these five were more potent than malathion and neem. Trans-nerolidol (LD50 = 13.4ppm) was the most toxic compound against one-day-old Ae. aegypti larvae, followed by geraniol (49.3ppm), citronellol (49.9ppm) and geranyl formate (58.5ppm). Essential oil of cultivar Egypt' at 100g cm(-2) [biting deterrent index (BDI)=0.8] showed the highest biting deterrent activity, followed by cultivars Frensham' (BDI = 0.76), China' (BDI = 0.72), Rober's Lemon Rose' (BDI = 0.63) and Bourbon' (BDI = 0.45) essential oils. Among the pure compounds, the biting deterrent activity of geranic acid (BDI = 0.99) was not significantly different from that of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET).ConclusionEssential oils and pure compounds showed insecticidal activity against S. pyrioides and Ae. aegypti. The high biting deterrent activity of geranic acid points to the need for further research.

Successful Leadership in High-Needs Schools: An Examination of Core Leadership Practices Enacted in Challenging Contexts								EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION QUARTERLY				49	5			768	808		10.1177/0013161X13482577			DEC 2013	2013	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the ways principals in three high-needs middle schools enacted core leadership practices in concert with their immediate contexts to institutionalize comprehensive school reforms and support student learning. Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning. Further research is required to understand how principals decide to adapt their leadership practices, and how aspiring leaders can best learn to do so.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0013-161X	1552-3519		WOS:000326155800003

Changes in the primary hydration sphere of the actinide during inner-sphere adsorption could greatly influence the thermodynamics of these reactions. However, few researchers have studied actinide adsorption thermodynamics. Therefore, using Eu(III) as an analog for trivalent actinides, we examined the thermodynamics of Eu(III) adsorption onto hematite, with particular emphasis on changes in the Eu(III) coordination number and the influence of temperature upon sorption. Our working hypothesis was that a decrease in hydration number upon adsorption, as indicated by a decrease in coordination number and an increase in adsorption with increasing temperature, results in energetically favorable sorption reactions, which are driven by a large, positive entropy term. To perform these studies, we applied the diffuse layer model to describe Eu(III) adsorption onto hematite at pH values ranging from similar to 3 to 7 and at 15, 25, 35, and 50 degrees C. Additionally, we characterized the Eu(III)hematite surface complex and changes in the Eu(III) primary hydration sphere using extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and computational modeling. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to identify possible europium surface precipitates or morphological changes in the hematite. The data indicate that the adsorption reaction (1) is endothermic, (2) proceeds with a decrease in the Eu(III) coordination number, and (3) results in the formation of a bidentate mononuclear surface complex, (equivalent to FeO)(2)Eu+. The enthalpy and entropy values for the formation of this surface complex, which were estimated using a van't Hoff plot, were 131 +/- 8 kJ mol(-1) and 439 +/- 26 J K-1 mol(-1), respectively, indicating that adsorption of Eu(III) onto hematite is entropically driven. Additionally, we suggest that the decrease in Eu(III) coordination number and the large entropy term are due to the loss of coordinating water molecules from the Eu(III) hydration sphere.

APPLIED ECONOMICS				45	36			5086	5103		10.1080/00036846.2013.818213			DEC 1 2013	2013	This study analysed forecasts for all US corn, soya bean and wheat categories published within the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE ) reports over the 1987/88 through 2009/10 marketing years in an attempt to identify patterns and better understand when the USDA forecasters make mistakes. Two general sources of errors were investigated: behavioural and macroeconomic factors. The first objective was to examine how these factors affect the size of the forecast error and the second concentrated on the direction of the error due to these effects. Our findings suggest that the largest increase in the size of USDA forecast errors was associated with structural changes in commodity markets that took place in the mid-2000s. Corn, soya bean and wheat forecast errors also grew during the periods of economic growth and with changes in exchange rates, while inflation and changes in oil price had a much smaller impact. With respect to behavioural sources, we identified patterns consistent with leniency and pessimism across different categories. Predictability of forecast errors based on the information available at the time the forecasts are made provides evidence of inefficiency and suggests that these forecasts may be improved using the findings of this study.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0003-6846			WOS:000324671800008

Synergistic interactions of cinnamaldehyde in combination with carvacrol against food-borne bacteria								FOOD CONTROL				34	2			619	623		10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.05.032			DEC 2013	2013	In order to select effective and safe natural antibacterial ingredients, more than 30 kinds of plant extracts were selected for their suitability as antibacterial agents. A standard broth microdilution method was used to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, a cytotoxicity test was used to detect their safety, and a synergy assay was used to determine which combinations have a synergistic effect. Then time-kill curves were used to further verify their bactericidal capacity. As a result of these tests, cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol were identified first, then subsequently verified to be the most effective and safe natural active substances. It was found that all of the tested bacteria strains were sensitive to cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol. The combination of cinnamaldehyde with carvacrol also showed good synergistic antibacterial effect against 7 of the 11 tested bacterial strains. The time-kill assay verified synergism for the cinnamaldehyde/carvacrol combination toward Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. These results indicated that the combination of cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol may serve as a promising naturally sourced food preservative with excellent bactericidal activity against common food spoilage microorganisms.

Natural latex and albumin contain amino acids with reactive groups that make the materials potentially compatible with whey protein. The bioplastics were obtained by compression molding where water was added as plasticizer. Thermal transitions, tensile stress, percent strain at break, and Young's modulus were measured for the materials. It is demonstrated that addition of about 10% of the latex and albumin to the whey based bioplastics improves the toughness characteristics of whey based materials without compromising their strength and stiffness.

Compared to previous works, which generally measured the latency at 10-33-ms intervals or at discrete events separated by hundreds of ms, our new method measures the latency continuously at 1-ms resolution. This allows for the observation of variations in latency over sub 1-s periods, instead of relying upon averages of measurements. We have applied our method to two systems, the first using a camera for sensing and an LCD monitor for actuation, and the second using an orientation sensor for sensing and a motor for actuation. Our results show two interesting findings. First, a cyclical variation in latency can be seen based upon the relative rates of the sensor and actuator clocks and buffer times; for the components we tested, the variation was in the range of 15-50 Hz with a magnitude of 10-20 ms. Second, orientation sensor error can look like a variation in latency; for the sensor we tested, the variation was in the range of 0.5-1.0 Hz with a magnitude of 20-100 ms. Both of these findings have implications for robotics and virtual reality systems. In particular, it is possible that the variation in apparent latency caused by orientation sensor error may have some relation to simulator sickness.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1054-7460			WOS:000318352600002

Faculty Sensemaking and Mission Creep: Interrogating Institutionalized Ways of Knowing and Doing Legitimacy								REVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION				36	2			179	+					WIN 2013	2013	Increasingly, regional and/or teaching colleges and universities are striving to assert themselves as national or international research universities. Although such shifts represent significant implications for faculty members, few works address the faculty perspective or experience with this change. In this qualitative, interpretive paper, I discuss how faculty members made sense of their university's attempt to achieve a more national, more research-focused mission. Using a critical neo-institutional lens, I outline the sources that faculty members relied upon as they defined their university's transition. From this analysis, I offer practical and theoretical implications.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0162-5748			WOS:000312120000002

However, the diversity of this mobile element family in the genome of the western lowland gorilla has previously been uncharacterized. Alu elements are primate-specific short interspersed elements that have been used as phylogenetic and population genetic markers for more than two decades. Alu elements are present at high copy number in the genomes of all primates surveyed thus far. The AluY subfamily and its derivatives have been recognized as the evolutionarily youngest Alu subfamily in the Old World primate lineage.Results: Here we use a combination of computational and wet-bench laboratory methods to assess and catalog AluY subfamily activity level and composition in the western lowland gorilla genome (gorGor3.1). A total of 1,075 independent AluY insertions were identified and computationally divided into 10 subfamilies, with the largest number of gorilla-specific elements assigned to the canonical AluY subfamily.Conclusions: The retrotransposition activity level appears to be significantly lower than that seen in the human and chimpanzee lineages, while higher than that seen in orangutan genomes, indicative of differential Alu amplification in the western lowland gorilla lineage as compared to other Homininae.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1759-8753			WOS:000329729000001	24262036

An unusually long burst detected by Konus-Wind (KW), Swift, and Fermi, GRB 091024A has prompt emission episodes covering similar to 1300 s, accompanied by bright and highly structured optical emission captured by various rapid-response facilities, including the 2 m autonomous robotic Faulkes North and Liverpool Telescopes, KAIT, S-LOTIS, and the Sonoita Research Observatory. We also observed the burst with 8 and 10 m class telescopes and determine the redshift to be z = 1.0924 +/- 0.0004. We find no correlation between the optical and gamma-ray peaks and interpret the optical light curve as being of external origin, caused by the reverse and forward shock of a highly magnetized jet (R-B approximate to 100-200). Low-level emission is detected throughout the near-background quiescent period between the first two emission episodes of the KW data, suggesting continued central-engine activity; we discuss the implications of this ongoing emission and its impact on the afterglow evolution and predictions. We summarize the varied sample of historical GRBs with exceptionally long durations in gamma-rays ( greater than or similar to 1000 s) and discuss the likelihood of these events being from a separate population; we suggest ultra-long GRBs represent the tail of the duration distribution of the long GRB population.									36	0	0	0	0	36			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000327131700054

We present an 0(n) algorithm for constructing a diagonal matrix congruent to B-X = A + xI for any x. An application, using Sylvester's Law of Inertia, can determine how many eigenvalues lie in an interval, allowing efficient approximation. We prove that eigenvalues of threshold graphs, other than 0 or -1, are simple. We give the spectrum for threshold graphs G(k, j), represented by 0(k)1(j). When n >= 3, G(n - [n/3], [n/3]) has the minimum eigenvalue lambda(min,n) among threshold graphs of order n, and a formula for lambda(min,n) is given. There is one more graph if n equivalent to 2 mod 3. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0024-3795	1873-1856		WOS:000326662300004

This algorithm is provided in the Zeo++ software for open use. In this method, ray lengths are depicted as two-dimensional histograms that complement alternate descriptors, such as free and included sphere diameters. We illustrate the specific use of these methods as a tool to narrow the range of zeolites useful for a given catalytic application because of the shape and size of voids. DAC, AFS, AFY, SFO and EON zeolites contain void spaces similar, as suggested by Euclidean distance values between histograms, to those within MOR 8-MR side pockets, which stabilize the transition states that mediate dimethyl ether carbonylation to methyl acetate; these alternate structures offer different connecting void environments, which can enhance or restrict molecular access and influence the effectiveness of the 8-MR protons. NES, EON and USI zeolites exhibit histogram features similar to those of 12-MR MOR channels, where protons selectively catalyze alkylation of biphenyl and naphthalene to 4,4'-diisopropylbiphenyl and 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene, respectively, with propene. SBT, FAU and SBS contain voids similar in topology to the 12-MR channels of LTL zeolites, within which Pt clusters remain active and stable during the dehydrocyclization of light alkanes, but without the one-dimensional nature of LTL channels. The approach and implementation of these methods are applicable to any microporous or mesoporous solids and to adsorption processes driven by van der Waals contacts between hosts and guest molecules.

Wet-spun, photoinitiator-modified polyacrylonitrile precursor fibers: UV-assisted stabilization								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				130	4			2494	2503		10.1002/app.39442			NOV 15 2013	2013	The role of dilute concentrations (approximate to 1 wt %) of a photoinitiator, 4,4-bis(diethylamino)benzophenone, on the processability and properties of the resulting wet-spun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers are reported. Rheology measurements show no adverse effect on the viscosities of solutions by the addition of the photoinitiator. Fibers containing photoinitiator were successfully wet-spun from PAN-DMSO solution. FTIR results prove that 4,4-bis(diethylamino)benzophenone was retained in the fibers after coagulation and post-stretching. SEM micrographs show no deterioration of the post-stretched fiber microstructure due to the presence of photoinitiator. Tensile testing results show a small reduction in the strain-at-break of post-stretched fibers containing photoinitiator when compared with pure (control) PAN fibers. After UV treatment, fibers with 4,4-bis(diethylamino)benzophenone display a higher tensile modulus compared with the other sets. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction results show no significant decrease in interplanar spacing and size of the crystals within the fibers containing photoinitiator, but such fibers retain a higher extent of molecular orientation after being UV treated. Conversion indices were measured from the WAXD spectra and compared with conventional thermal stabilized fibers. This correlation confirms that the addition of 1 wt % photoinitiator to PAN followed by 5 min of UV treatment leads to a conversion index that is observed in control fibers after more than an hour, which could reduce the conventional thermo-oxidative stabilization time significantly. These results indicate the potential of the dual stabilization route in generating precursor fibers with higher molecular orientation, and possibly reducing the thermo-oxidation time during carbon fiber processing.

The interaction between H2O and Au(111) is believed to be particularly weak, and conflicting evidence from several indirect studies has suggested that water either grows as 3D ice crystals or as an amorphous wetting layer. In contrast, our measurements show that between 110 and 130 K, H2O grows as highly commensurate well-ordered islands that only partially wet the gold surface. The islands produce a clear (root 3 x root 3)R30 degrees diffraction pattern and are characterized by a well-defined height of similar to 5 angstrom with respect to the surface gold atoms. These findings provide support for a unique "double bi-layer" model, which has recently been suggested for this surface.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447			WOS:000327110500025

Two types of core-fluorinated aromatic units were used in a molecular design of azo-chromophore monomers with enhanced second order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties: octafluorobiphenyl (OFB) and tetrafluorobenzene (TFB) ones. Polymerization of the monomers was performed to obtain polyurethanes with azo-chromophores in the main chain. Comparison of physical and optical properties of these polymers reveals that the main factor influencing the observed NLO activity of the latter is the inherent isomery of the macromolecular chains rather than a variation of the structure of electron-accepting groups.

While these methods could enhance the thermoelectric performance of p-type Bi2Te3, it was frustrating to researchers that they proved ineffective for n-type Bi2Te3 due to the inevitable deterioration of its thermoelectric properties in the basal plane. Here, we describe a novel chemical-exfoliation spark-plasma-sintering (CE-SPS) nano-structuring process, which transforms the microstructure of n-type Bi2Te3 in an extraordinary manner without compromising its basal plane properties. The CE-SPS processing leads to preferential scattering of electrons at charged grain boundaries, and thereby increases the electrical conductivity despite the presence of numerous grain boundaries, and mitigates the bipolar effect via band occupancy optimization leading to an upshift (by similar to 100 K) and stabilization of the ZT peak over a broad temperature range of similar to 150 K.									21	0	0	3	0	21			2045-2322			WOS:000327020700002	24225424

The particles exhibit red emission and improved quantum efficiency resulting from highly efficient energy transfer from donor PFBT to acceptor MEH-PPV as well as suppression of MEH-PPV aggregation. Photobleaching results indicate better photostability in the blended sample compared to undoped MEH-PPV nanoparticles and photoactivation of donor emission, which could be useful for single-molecule localization-based super-resolution microscopy. Single blended nanoparticles exhibit bright fluorescence as well as saturation behavior at very low excitation intensities. These and other properties of the blended conjugated polymer nanoparticles could provide substantial improvements in resolution when employed in super-resolution microscopy.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0743-7463			WOS:000327044600030	24099661	
J	Colin, Samuel; Valentini, Antony								Mechanism for the suppression of quantum noise at large scales on expanding space								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				88	10					103515	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.103515			NOV 12 2013	2013	We present an exactly solvable model for the suppression of quantum noise at large scales on expanding space. The suppression arises naturally in the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory, according to which the Born probability rule has a dynamical origin. For a scalar field on a radiation-dominated background we construct the exact solution for the time-evolving wave functional and study properties of the associated field trajectories. It is shown that the time evolution of a field mode on expanding space is mathematically equivalent to that of a standard harmonic oscillator with a "retarded time" that depends on the wavelength of the mode. In the far super-Hubble regime the equivalent oscillator evolves over only one Hubble time, yielding a simple mechanism whereby relaxation to the Born rule can be suppressed on very large scales. We present numerical simulations illustrating how the expansion of space can cause a retardation of relaxation in the super-Hubble regime. Given these results it is natural to expect a suppression of quantum noise at super-Hubble wavelengths. Such suppression could have taken place in a preinflationary era, resulting in a large-scale power deficit in the cosmic microwave background.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2470-0010	2470-0029		WOS:000326827200002

Regression analysis for current status data using the EM algorithm								STATISTICS IN MEDICINE				32	25			4452	4466		10.1002/sim.5863			NOV 10 2013	2013	We propose new expectation-maximization algorithms to analyze current status data under two popular semiparametric regression models: the proportional hazards (PH) model and the proportional odds (PO) model. Monotone splines are used to model the baseline cumulative hazard function in the PH model and the baseline odds function in the PO model. The proposed algorithms are derived by exploiting a data augmentation based on Poisson latent variables. Unlike previous regression work with current status data, our PH and PO model fitting methods are fast, flexible, easy to implement, and provide variance estimates in closed form. These techniques are evaluated using simulation and are illustrated using uterine fibroid data from a prospective cohort study on early pregnancy.

Anaerobic Oxidation of Ethene Coupled to Sulfate Reduction in Microcosms and Enrichment Cultures								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				47	21			12374	12381		10.1021/es4029765			NOV 5 2013	2013	Ethene is considered recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions, but biological reduction to ethane and oxidation to CO2 have been reported; however, little is known about these processes or the organisms carrying them out. In this report we describe sulfate dependent ethene consumption in microcosms prepared with sediments from a freshwater canal. A first dose of 0.6 mmol/L ethene was consumed within 77 days, and a second dose was largely consumed twelve days later. Material from this microcosm was transferred into growth medium with ethene as the only electron donor (except for trace amounts of vitamins) and sulfate as the electron acceptor. Four doses of ethene were consumed at increasing rates, and the cultures have been transferred at least eight times in this medium. Conversion of [C-14]ethene primarily to (CO2)-C-14 was demonstrated in fifth and sixth generation cultures, as well as production of sulfide in other cultures, confirming the ethene/sulfate couple. Ovoid cells 1-2 mu m in diameter were found in cultures containing ethene and sulfate, and quantitative PCR showed large increases in bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy number. Over half of a 16S rRNA gene clone library from a sixth-generation culture was a phylotype with a sequence ca. 90% identical with a clade of Deltaproteobacteria that includes Desulfovirga adipica and several Syntrophobacter spp. These studies have solidified the concept that deficits in mass balances for chloroethene fate in sulfate reducing zones of contaminated groundwater sites may be due to ethene oxidation, and suggest a unique phylotype is involved in this process.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000326711300062	24033278

Herein, the production of composite magnetic fibers composed of iron oxide nanoparticles suspended in alginate is described. These materials were produced via wet spinning of a sodium alginate solution into a bath of an aqueous solution of calcium chloride. The magnetic fibers were found to have similar mechanical properties to normal alginate fibers, and exhibited superparamagnetic behavior when subjected to an external DC magnetic field. In addition, the particle loaded fibers demonstrated the potential to produce significant amounts of heat when exposed to an AC magnetic field, suggesting these new materials could be applicable to a variety of applications including magnetic hyperthermia.

The BMA's efficacy is gauged using a comprehensive mixed methodology, including: mandate assessment; plan quality evaluation; external conditions for plan creation and implementation; and post-regulatory conformance-based plan implementation assessment in two barrier island communities, the Towns of Hilton Head Island and Pawleys Island. This unique synthesis of policy analysis approaches reveals that a substantial volume of development has circumvented the BMA's policies, particularly the setback lines based on a forty-year erosion record, and the retreat objective. It exposes a classic challenge of minimal state implementation, prompted by timidity from the specter of Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, and a need for improved institutional coordination.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0892-0753	1521-0421		WOS:000326615900004

Kaye, Nigel/0000-0001-7190-7791			Using image analysis to measure the porosity distribution of a porous pavement								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				48				210	217		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.06.093			NOV 2013	2013	A method for determining the distribution of porosity across a porous pavement sample using image analysis was developed and evaluated. Its measured average porosity compares favorably to other porosity methods including two volumetric based methods and ASTM D7063 which uses a vacuum sealing device. The impact of the representative elemental area (REA), which is the minimum pavement cross sectional area that must be analyzed to have a statistically significant measure of the pavement porosity, was investigated. The REA was experimentally determined to be 83.9 cm(2) (13 in.(2)) for the different gradations of porous pavements evaluated, which were ASTM standard gradations No. 89, No. 78, No. 7, and No. 67. Though this method can be used to measure a one dimensional porosity distribution in different directions (vertically, horizontally, or radially in cylinders), this work focused on its application to vertical porosity distributions. Using the results of the image analysis and the REA, a smoothed profile of the porosity distribution was produced which showed that, for a porous pavement sample compacted in a single lift, the porosity is high at the surface, due to the surface texture, decreases drastically to a minimum at approximately 2-3 cm (similar to 1 in.) in depth and then linearly increases until approximately two centimeters from the bottom of the sample where the porosity increases drastically due to the wall effects. The porosity distribution produced agrees with previously proposed distributions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0950-0618	1879-0526		WOS:000327561200028

Molecular-Level Study of the Effect of Prior Axial Compression/Torsion on the Axial-Tensile Strength of PPTA Fibers								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				22	11			3269	3287		10.1007/s11665-013-0648-2			NOV 2013	2013	A comprehensive all-atom molecular-level computational investigation is carried out in order to identify and quantify: (i) the effect of prior longitudinal-compressive or axial-torsional loading on the longitudinal-tensile behavior of p-phenylene terephthalamide (PPTA) fibrils/fibers; and (ii) the role various microstructural/topological defects play in affecting this behavior. Experimental and computational results available in the relevant open literature were utilized to construct various defects within the molecular-level model and to assign the concentration to these defects consistent with the values generally encountered under "prototypical" PPTA-polymer synthesis and fiber fabrication conditions. When quantifying the effect of the prior longitudinal-compressive/axial-torsional loading on the longitudinal-tensile behavior of PPTA fibrils, the stochastic nature of the size/potency of these defects was taken into account. The results obtained revealed that: (a) due to the stochastic nature of the defect type, concentration/number density and size/potency, the PPTA fibril/fiber longitudinal-tensile strength is a statistical quantity possessing a characteristic probability density function; (b) application of the prior axial compression or axial torsion to the PPTA imperfect single-crystalline fibrils degrades their longitudinal-tensile strength and only slightly modifies the associated probability density function; and (c) introduction of the fibril/fiber interfaces into the computational analyses showed that prior axial torsion can induce major changes in the material microstructure, causing significant reductions in the PPTA-fiber longitudinal-tensile strength and appreciable changes in the associated probability density function.									7	0	0	0	1	7			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000326888500010

Continuous-wave laser damage of uniform and nanolaminate hafnia and titania optical coatings								OPTICS LETTERS				38	21			4292	4295		10.1364/OL.38.004292			NOV 1 2013	2013	The laser-damage thresholds of single material and nanolaminate thin films were compared under continuous-wave (CW) illumination conditions. Nanolaminate films consist of uniform material interrupted by the periodic insertion of one or more atomic layers of an alternative material. Hafnia and titania were used as the base materials, and the films were deposited using atomic-layer deposition. The nanolaminates were less polycrystalline than the uniform films, as quantified using x-ray diffraction. It was found that the nanolaminate films had reduced laser-damage thresholds on smooth and patterned substrates as compared to uniform single-material films. This behavior is unusual as prior art indicates that amorphous (less polycrystalline) materials have higher laser-damage thresholds under short-pulse excitation. It is speculated that this may indicate that local thermal conduction affects breakdown more strongly under CW excitation than the dielectric properties that are important for short-pulse excitation.

International Politics and Import Diversification								JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS				56	4			1091	1121		10.1086/674132			NOV 1 2013	2013	This paper examines how international politics affects trade in the absence of empires or wars. We first show that deterioration of relations between the United States and another country, measured by divergence in their United Nations General Assembly voting patterns, reduced U.S. imports from that country during 1962--2000. Though statistically significant, the magnitude of the effect of political distance on trade is small. Indeed, we show that except for petroleum and some chemical products, U.S. imports are not affected by international politics. American firms, however, diversify their oil imports significantly away from political opponents of the United States. Oil trade is often associated with backward vertical foreign direct investment that is subject to the expropriation risk. In contrast to the usual claim that oil is a strategic commodity, we provide suggestive evidence that trade in products when rents are appropriable is more likely to be affected by international politics.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2186	1537-5285		WOS:000331799400008

Physiological Responses of Creeping Bentgrass to Pigment-Containing Products								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				105	6			1797	1802		10.2134/agronj2013.0298			NOV-DEC 2013	2013	Providing relief from summer stress is a constant goal when maintaining creeping bentgrass [Agrostis stolonifera L. var. palustris (Huds.)] golf putting greens. Colorants and other pigment-containing products are marketed as a means of relieving summer stress but research supporting such claims is limited and was the objective of this study. Pigment-containing products evaluated on bentgrass maintained under supraoptimal (>30 degrees C) temperature stress included: TurfScreen (a combination of zinc oxide [ZnO], a green pigment, and titanium dioxide [TiO2]) and PAR (a commercial copper-based pigment). Carbon dioxide exchange rate (mu mol CO2 cm(-2) s(-1)) was reduced >100% following Turfscreen and PAR applications and evapotranspiration rate (mol H2O cm(-2) s(-1)) was reduced similar to 10% compared to nonstressed control plants. Fluorescence (F-v/F-m) was reduced similar to 16% following Turfscreen and PAR application. Products (including a commercial paint and an additional copper-based pigment, Foursome) were also applied to acrylic sheets to measure the transmission of photosynthetically active radiation. PAR and Foursome reduced the transmission of photosynthetically active radiation similar to 20%, while TurfScreen and paint reduced it by 39 and 46%, respectively. Microscopy images revealed TurfScreen (higher viscosity) remained on the leaf surface, and covered stomata while PAR (lower viscosity) entered the leaf via stomata. Overall, products evaluated provided little consistent physiological benefit to creeping bentgrass in a heat-stressed environment.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0002-1962	1435-0645		WOS:000330458500037

Effects of Nitrogen and Planting Seed Size on Cotton Growth, Development, and Yield								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				105	6			1853	1859		10.2134/agronj2013.0154			NOV-DEC 2013	2013	A standardized experiment was conducted during 2009 and 2010 at 20 location-years across U.S. cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)-producing states to compare the N use requirement of contemporary cotton cultivars based on their planting seed size. Treatments consisted of three cotton varieties with planting seed of different numbers of seed per kg and N rates of 0, 45, 90, and 134 kg ha(-1). Soil at each trial location was sampled and tested for nitrate presence. High levels of soil nitrate (>91 N-NO3 (-)kg ha(-1)) were found in Arizona and western Texas, and soil nitrate in the range of 45 to 73 kg N-NO3 (-)ha(-1) was found at locations in the central United States. Cotton lint yield responded to applied N at 11 of 20 locations. Considering only sites that responded to applied N, highest lint yields were achieved with 112 to 224 kg ha(-1) of applied plus pre-plant residual soil NO3-translating to an optimal N requirement of 23 kg ha(-1) per 218 kg bale of lint produced. Among the varieties tested those with medium-sized seed produced higher yields in response to N than did larger and smaller seeded varieties. Varieties with larger seed had longer and stronger fibers, higher fiber length uniformity than small seeded varieties and decreased micronaire. Seed protein and oil increased and decreased slightly in response to increasing amounts of soil nitrate plus applied N, respectively.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0002-1962	1435-0645		WOS:000330458500044

It could be considered that the oxidation rate of toluene wasn't varied significantly with the change of toluene concentration. The highest yield of benzaldehyde increased with the decrease of toluene concentration and the increase of catalyst dosage. The catalyst proportion had no significant influence on the yield of benzaldehyde and the oxidation of toluene could be inhibited by increasing Co/Mn. There was no significant difference between the activation energies of toluene and benzaldehyde.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0970-7077	0975-427X		WOS:000330234000102

TRANSPORT AND FATE OF ESCHERICHIA COLI IN SEDIMENT LAYER AND WATER COLUMN OF BASINS ON ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION SITES								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				56	6			1333	1341					NOV-DEC 2013	2013	The conventional method of controlling sediment-laden runoff on construction sites is the use of sediment basins. These basins slow the velocity of runoff and allow particles to settle from the water column before discharge to surface waters offsite. However, the sediment layers that accumulate in these best management practices may create a reservoir for potentially pathogenic bacteria. Deposited sediment is known to provide protection for bacteria; therefore, while these basins decrease sediment loadings to water bodies downstream, they may introduce harmful levels of pathogenic bacteria into these surface waters when resuspended during rain events. In addition to causing human health risks, these high bacteria levels alter the natural biological makeup of downstream ecosystems. This article describes the fate and transport of Escherichia coli in construction site sediment basins. Three sediment basins, located in Anderson, South Carolina, were sampled after rain events to explore trends in E. coli densities that exist among various sediment depths as well as inflow and outflow of basins. Results provide evidence to suggest that sediment basins are a reservoir for indicator bacteria. Data show that E. coli was most concentrated in the top layer of sediment, and high densities persisted for five to ten days. In addition, E. coli densities were higher in outflow than inflow. Consequently, high densities of bacteria may be routed to downstream waters. This research provides considerable evidence that the sediment layer in man-made construction basins can cause detrimental effects to surface waters. With this knowledge, better stormwater management practices may be developed with the goal of remediating impaired surface waters.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2151-0032	2151-0040		WOS:000329603000008

This study sought to develop an initial methodology for identifying and classifying flow disruptions in the cardiac operating room (OR).Methods: Two industrial engineers with expertise in human factors workflow disruptions observed 10 cardiac operations from the moment the patient entered the OR to the time they left for the intensive care unit. Each disruption was fully documented on an architectural layout of the OR suite and time-stamped during each phase of surgery (preoperative [before incision], operative [incision to skin closure], and postoperative [skin closure until the patient leaves the OR]) to synchronize flow disruptions between the two observers. These disruptions were then categorized.Results: The two observers made a total of 1,158 observations. After the elimination of duplicate observations, a total of 1,080 observations remained to be analyzed. These disruptions were distributed into six categories such as communication, usability, physical layout, environmental hazards, general interruptions, and equipment failures. They were further organized into 33 subcategories. The most common disruptions were related to OR layout and design (33%).Conclusions: By using the detailed architectural diagrams, the authors were able to clearly demonstrate for the first time the unique role that OR design and equipment layout has on the generation of physical layout flow disruptions. Most importantly, the authors have developed a robust taxonomy to describe the flow disruptions encountered in a cardiac OR, which can be used for future research and patient safety improvements.									12	0	0	4	1	12			0003-3022	1528-1175		WOS:000329797900013	23811697

Equatorial NO volume emission rate measurements from 100 to 180 km made by Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) on TIMED during the solar minimum year 2008 are analyzed on two important nonmigrating tides, the DE2 and DE3 components. DE3 (DE2) amplitudes maximize around 125 km altitude and, depending on season, are on the order of 0.18 (0.16) nW/m(3). This represents a substantial modulation of the mean NO emission that maximizes in the same altitude range with a value of about 0.8nW/m(3). Tropospheric tides are therefore important not only for the dynamics and electrodynamics of the ionosphere-thermosphere system but also for modulating the thermospheric energy budget. Supporting photochemical tidal modeling indicates that the main tidal coupling mechanism is the temperature dependence of the collisional excitation of the NO (=1) vibrational state. However, the response to vertical tidal advection is also important. It is in-phase with the response to temperature and contributes as much as 50% to the NO tides at and above the emission maximum. Neutral density tidal variations contribute about 25% but with a 9 h phase offset resulting in a net damping. These results imply that NO 5.3 m emissions are a suitable proxy for studying tidal dynamics in the thermosphere where no global temperature measurements are available.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000329992900041

This study represents the first known effort to directly analyze tidal wave number structure and propagation direction in winds observed over this altitude range. Prominent diurnal tides include an eastward propagating wave number 3, a zonally symmetric tide, and a westward propagating wave number 2. UARS High Resolution Doppler Imager winds between 60 and 100 km were analyzed identically and show excellent consistency with WINDII tides. Observed tides were compared with tidal fits to Hough Mode Extensions. WINDII tides are generally damped more slowly above 120 km than fitted tides, and the zonally symmetric tide indicates a thermospheric source not captured by Hough Mode Extensions. Our study provides additional confirmation that tides act as direct coupling agents between the troposphere and the thermosphere (and F region), inaddition to their role in the E region dynamo.									8	0	0	0	0	8			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000329992900050

Exogenous Applications of Benzyladenine and Gibberellic Acid Inhibit Lower-leaf Senescence of Geraniums during Propagation								HORTSCIENCE				48	11			1352	1357					NOV 2013	2013	After postharvest shipping, the lower leaves of zonal geranium (Pelargonium x hortorum) cuttings often turn chlorotic and necrotic during rooting in a propagation environment. Our objective was to quantify the efficacy of spray applications of the plant growth regulators (PGRs) benzyladenine (BA) and/or gibberellic acid (GA) at various stages in propagation to reduce lower-leaf senescence and evaluate effects on subsequent rooting. In Expt. 1, cuttings of 'Patriot White' geraniums were harvested and treated with BA (2.5 or 5.0 mg.L-1), BA + GA(4+7) (2.5 or 5.0 mg.L-1 each), or GA(3) (0.5 or 2.0 mg.L-1) either before or after a 2-day storage period simulating commercial shipping. Post-shipment application of all PGRs eliminated leaf yellowing compared with cuttings treated pre-shipment, but rooting was inhibited. In Expt. 2, the promotion of rooting from a rooting hormone preceding treatment with BA (1.25 to 5.0 mg.L-1), BA+GA(4+7) (1.25 to 5.0 mg.L-1 each), or GA(3) (0.25 to 2.0 mg.L-1) was evaluated on 'Patriot White' geranium cuttings after a 2-day simulated shipping. Applying rooting hormones increased the percentage of fully rooted cuttings treated with BA and/or GA from 16.4% to 51.8%. In Expt. 3, cuttings of different geranium cultivars from a commercial producer varied in susceptibility and suppression of leaf yellowing after BA + GA(4+7) applications. We conclude that foliar applications of BA + GA(4+7) can suppress lower-leaf senescence and rooting during propagation of some geranium cultivars, and the inhibition of rooting can be at least partially overcome with an application of rooting hormone.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000327673800003

We estimate a location choice model using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) using these estimates of labor market specific wages for men and women as determinants of their place of residence. We compare estimates of this model to a model using more aggregated measures of wages and locations from CPS. We show that potential wages based on these more refined definitions of labor markets and demographic groups provide more explanatory power in a simple migration model than do those based upon less detailed definitions of labor markets and demographic groups.

Reasons include socio-economic, financial, and technical challenges that are specific to the community. Improved assessment methods are critical if decision makers want to provide sustainable solutions; however, to be useful, such methods require substantial data about the complex interaction between people, water, and infrastructure. Such interaction is affected by, and in turn, affects the behavior of community members regarding water usage, resources for infrastructure maintenance, and choice of assets. Unfortunately, much of these data are not readily available, in a large part because of the site-specific context associated with each rural community. Because of the difficulty and expense in obtaining site-specific data, it is important to identify the most critical needs for field studies versus the data that can be obtained from sources such as non-governmental organizations and the general literature. We examine this issue by first using an extensive data set from Malawi to identify the critical data needs. We then present several examples of field studies in Honduras and Uganda where we collected some of that critical data. Throughout, we discuss best practices for conducting and using focused field studies versus the general literature.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2071-1050			WOS:000328789400018

Joy								SEIPS 2.0: a human factors framework for studying and improving the work of healthcare professionals and patients								ERGONOMICS				56	11			1669	1686		10.1080/00140139.2013.838643			NOV 1 2013	2013	Healthcare practitioners, patient safety leaders, educators and researchers increasingly recognise the value of human factors/ergonomics and make use of the discipline's person-centred models of sociotechnical systems. This paper first reviews one of the most widely used healthcare human factors systems models, the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model, and then introduces an extended model, SEIPS 2.0'. SEIPS 2.0 incorporates three novel concepts into the original model: configuration, engagement and adaptation. The concept of configuration highlights the dynamic, hierarchical and interactive properties of sociotechnical systems, making it possible to depict how health-related performance is shaped at a moment in time'. Engagement conveys that various individuals and teams can perform health-related activities separately and collaboratively. Engaged individuals often include patients, family caregivers and other non-professionals. Adaptation is introduced as a feedback mechanism that explains how dynamic systems evolve in planned and unplanned ways. Key implications and future directions for human factors research in healthcare are discussed. Practitioner Summary: SEIPS 2.0 is a new human factors/ergonomics framework for studying and improving health and healthcare. It describes how sociotechnical systems shape health-related work done by professionals and non-professionals, independently and collaboratively. Work processes, in turn, shape patient, professional and organisational outcomes. Work systems and processes undergo planned and unplanned adaptations.									43	0	0	5	0	43			0014-0139	1366-5847		WOS:000328241800005	24088063

A mixture of four Salmonella serovars was inoculated into the finished compost with 20, 30, 40, and 50% moisture contents for a 24-h desiccation adaptation. Afterwards, the compost with desiccation-adapted cells was inoculated into the aged chicken litter with the same moisture content for heat treatments at 70, 75, 80, 85, and 150 degrees C. Recovery media were used to allow heat-injured cells to resuscitate. A 5-log reduction in the number of the desiccation-adapted cells in aged chicken litter with a 20% moisture content required >6, >6, similar to 4 to 5, and similar to 3 to 4 h of exposure at 70, 75, 80, and 85 degrees C, respectively. As a comparison, a 5-log reduction in the number of nonadapted control cells in the same chicken litter was achieved within similar to 1.5 to 2, similar to 1 to 1.5, similar to 0.5 to 1, and <0.5 h at 70, 75, 80, and 85 degrees C, respectively. The exposure time required to obtain a 5-log reduction in the number of desiccation-adapted cells gradually became shorter as temperature and moisture content were increased. At 150 degrees C, desiccation-adapted Salmonella cells survived for 50 min in chicken litter with a 20% moisture content, whereas control cells were detectable by enrichment for only 10 min. Our results demonstrated that the thermal resistance of Salmonella in aged chicken litter was increased significantly when the cells were adapted to desiccation. This study also validated the effectiveness of thermal processing being used for producing chicken litter free of Salmonella contamination.									9	0	0	7	0	9			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000327504200023	24014540

Assuming random orientation of nanorods at the initial moment of time, the time needed for nanorods to align along the direction of an external magnetic field is estimated. In the solidifying films with exponentially increasing viscosity, the viscous drag significantly resists the nanorod alignment. Therefore, some nanorods might be quenched halfway to the equilibrium orientation even before complete solidification of the film. Different regimes of ordering have been revealed and classified and the criterion for the alignment of nanorods prior to the film solidification has been introduced.									8	1	0	1	0	8			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000327250700010

Nitrogen Abundances and the Distance Moduli of the Pleiades and Hyades								PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC				125	933			1297	1303		10.1086/673922			NOV 1 2013	2013	Recent reanalyses of Hipparcos parallax data confirm a previously noted discrepancy with the Pleiades distance modulus estimated from main-sequence fitting in the color-magnitude diagram. One proposed explanation of this distance modulus discrepancy is a Pleiades He abundance that is significantly larger than the Hyades value. We suggest that, based on our theoretical and observational understanding of Galactic chemical evolution, nitrogen abundances may serve as a proxy for helium abundances of disk stars. Utilizing high-resolution near-UV Keck/HIRES spectroscopy, we determine N abundances in the Pleiades and Hyades dwarfs from NH features in the 3330 region. While our Hyades N abundances show a modest approximate to approximate to 0.2dex trend over a 800K T-eff range, we find the Pleiades N abundance (by number) is 0.13 +/-+/- 0.05dex lower than in the Hyades for stars in a smaller overlapping T-eff range around 6000K; possible systematic errors in the lower Pleiades N abundance result are estimated to be at the 0.10dex level. Our results indicate [N/Fe]approximate to approximate to 0 for both the Pleiades and Hyades, consistent with the ratios exhibited by local Galactic disk field stars in other studies. If N production is a reliable tracer of He production in the disk, then our results suggest the Pleiades He abundance is smaller than that in the Hyades. This finding is supported by the relative Pleiades--Hyades C, O, and Fe abundances interpreted in the current context of Galactic chemical evolution and is resistant to the effects on our derived N abundances of a He abundance difference like that needed to explain the Pleiades distance modulus discrepancy. A physical explanation of the Pleiades distance modulus discrepancy does not appear to be related to He abundance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-6280	1538-3873		WOS:000327713700002

Beginning with the development of daily nest survival models, and proceeding through subsequent extensions, the capacity for modeling the effects of hypothesized factors on nest survival has expanded greatly. We extend nest survival models further by introducing an approach to deal with incompletely observed, temporally varying covariates using a hierarchical model. Hierarchical modeling offers a way to separate process and observational components of demographic models to obtain estimates of the parameters of primary interest, and to evaluate structural effects of ecological and management interest. We built a hierarchical model for daily nest survival to analyze nest data from reintroduced whooping cranes (Grus americana) in the Eastern Migratory Population. This reintroduction effort has been beset by poor reproduction, apparently due primarily to nest abandonment by breeding birds. We used the model to assess support for the hypothesis that nest abandonment is caused by harassment from biting insects. We obtained indices of blood-feeding insect populations based on the spatially interpolated counts of insects captured in carbon dioxide traps. However, insect trapping was not conducted daily, and so we had incomplete information on a temporally variable covariate of interest. We therefore supplemented our nest survival model with a parallel model for estimating the values of the missing insect covariates. We used Bayesian model selection to identify the best predictors of daily nest survival. Our results suggest that the black fly Simulium annulus may be negatively affecting nest survival of reintroduced whooping cranes, with decreasing nest survival as abundance of S.annulus increases. The modeling framework we have developed will be applied in the future to a larger data set to evaluate the biting-insect hypothesis and other hypotheses for nesting failure in this reintroduced population; resulting inferences will support ongoing efforts to manage this population via an adaptive management approach. Wider application of our approach offers promise for modeling the effects of other temporally varying, but imperfectly observed covariates on nest survival, including the possibility of modeling temporally varying covariates collected from incubating adults.									4	0	0	4	0	4			2045-7758			WOS:000326824300014	24340185

Survey of Food Safety Practices on Small to Medium-Sized Farms and in Farmers Markets								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				76	11			1989	1993		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-158			NOV 2013	2013	As produce consumption has increased, so have foodborne disease outbreaks associated with fresh produce. Little research has addressed food safety practices used on small to medium-sized farms selling locally or in farmers markets. This study evaluated current food safety practices used by farmers on small to medium-sized farms and managers of farmers markets in Georgia, Virginia, and South Carolina based on responses to surveys. Surveys were developed, pretested, and revised before implementation with target audiences and were implemented via mail and the Web to maximize participation, with reminders sent to nonrespondents. Data were collected from 226 farmers and 45 market managers. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for all response variables. Responses from farmers indicated that more than 56% of them use manures. Of those who use manures, 34% use raw or mixtures of raw and composted manure, and over 26% wait fewer than 90 days between application of raw manure and harvest. Over 27% use water sources that have not been tested for safety for irrigation, and 16% use such water sources for washing produce. Over 43% do not sanitize surfaces that touch produce at the farm. Only 33% of farmers always clean transport containers between uses. Responses from market managers indicated that over 42% have no food safety standards in place for the market. Only 2 to 11% ask farmers specific questions about conditions on the farm that could affect product safety. Less than 25% of managers sanitize market surfaces. Only 11% always clean market containers between uses. Over 75% of markets offer no sanitation training to workers or vendors. While farmers and market managers are using many good practices, the results indicate that some practices being used may put consumers at risk of foodborne illness. Consequently, there is a need for training for both farmers and market managers.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000327096000026	24215708

Singlecrystal X-ray diffraction experiment revealed that the compound crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric orthorhombic.space group Ama2 with cell parameters: a = 6.3386(6) angstrom, b = 11.2613(11) angstrom, c = 4.6840(5) angstrom, Z = 4. In the structure, the basic building units are the distorted ZnO6 octahedron, LiO4 tetrahedron and the 103 group. These groups are linked together to form a three-dimensional structure by sharing the oxygen atoms. The DSC measurement demonstrates that the compound is stable up to 490 degrees C.

Seven such "liquid-lignin" fractions were produced, with each fraction being phase-separated within a narrow pH band of 0.5 units. The fractions were found to be highly hydrated phases, containing 32.3-48.2 wt.% water; as a result, their measured melting points were quite low, 90.7-110.5 degrees C. In contrast, no melting point was detected up to 375 degrees C for any of the lignin fractions after drying. Significant reductions in metals content were observed for the lignin fractions compared to the original black-liquor feed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This co-culture system enhanced hydrogen production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates by improving substrate utilization and diminishing acetate accumulation, despite the presence of fermentation inhibitors in the hydrolysates. The improvements were greater for xylose-rich hydrolysates. The increase in maximum cumulative hydrogen production for hydrolysates with glucose:xylose mass ratios of 1:0.2, 1:1 and 1:10 g/g was 0%, 22% and 11%, respectively. Alternative extracellular electron shuttles (EES), including indigo dye, juglone, lawsone, fulvic acids and humic acids, were able to substitute for AH(2)QDS, improving hydrogen production in the co-culture system using xylose as model substrate. Increased utilization of xylose-rich hydrolysates and substitution of alternative EES make the co-culture with EES system a more attractive strategy for industrial biohydrogen production.

A senior undergraduate capstone design course at Clemson University, consisting of approximately fifty students and nine graduate design coaches, was chosen as the unit of analysis. Results from a survey of the class suggest that, though these novice engineers were convinced that design methods they were eager to learn were of use in helping them make better products, they tended not to use them. The stated reasons for not using them were the effort required to implement the methods, to understand how and when to use the methods, and the pressure to deliver results in a short duration.

Fungicides Used Alone, in Combinations, and in Rotations for Managing Gladiolus Rust in Mexico								PLANT DISEASE				97	11			1491	1496		10.1094/PDIS-03-13-0272-RE			NOV 2013	2013	Gladiolus rust, caused by Uromyces transversalis, is a quarantine-significant pathogen in the United States. However, the fungus is endemic to commercial gladiolus-producing areas in Mexico and has been intercepted frequently on gladiolus plants entering the United States for the cut-flower market. The present study assessed 15 fungicide active ingredients (five quinone outside inhibitors: azoxystrobin, fluoxastrobin, kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin; six triazoles: cyproconazole, difenoconazole, epoxiconazole, myclobutanil, propiconazole, and tebuconazole; three succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors: boscalid, flutolanil, and oxycarboxin; and one broad-spectrum protectant: chlorothalonil) and one plant activator, acibenzolar-S-methyl, applied alone, in combinations, and in various rotations for efficacy against U. transversalis on field-grown gladiolus plants in Mexico. Experiments were conducted in 2010, 2011, and 2012 in commercial fields in Atlixco and Santa Isabel Cholula in Puebla and Cuautla and Tlayacapan in Morelos. Fungicides were applied at 2-week intervals starting when plants had three full leaves. Disease severity was recorded each week for at least 7 weeks after the first application. Under high disease pressure in 2010, fungicides were less effective than in 2011 and 2012, when disease pressure was not as high. In all 3 years, most fungicide treatments significantly reduced disease severity. Triazoles were more effective than quinone outside inhibitors when applied as individual products in 2010, and combinations of two fungicides in different mode-of-action groups were more effective than fungicides applied individually in 2011. In 2012, rotations of fungicides, either with individual products or with combinations of two products, provided excellent rust management. Reducing disease development by U. transversalis on commercial gladiolus plants in Mexico will reduce the potential for introducing this pathogen on cut flowers into the United States.									1	0	0	0	1	2			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000326412800013

Visiting a Climate-Influenced National Park: The Stability of Climate Change Perceptions								ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				52	5			1132	1148		10.1007/s00267-013-0153-2			NOV 2013	2013	Understanding perceptions of global environmental issues, such as climate change, can help inform resource management, policy development, and communication with constituents. Although a considerable amount of research documents citizens' perceptions of climate change, few have investigated how interactions with climate-impacted parks and protected areas influence these perceptions, and consequently elements of environmental management. Using a mixed methods Instrument Development Approach, the researchers examined the stability of park visitors' (N = 429) climate change perceptions during a daylong interaction with climate-sensitive and influenced resources at Kenai Fjords National Park in Alaska. Results indicate that global-level beliefs about climate change remained relatively stable during a park experience, but perceptions about climate change at the park-level (e.g., impacts) appeared more malleable. Findings also revealed the type of park experience (terrestrial vs. marine) can influence the degree of change in visitors' perceptions. Implications for communication, outreach, and park management are discussed.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0364-152X	1432-1009		WOS:000326245300008	23995385

The substitutions of only one residue in a protein sequence, so-called missense mutations, can be related to many pathological conditions and may influence susceptibility to disease and drug treatment. The plausible effects of nnissense mutations range from affecting the macromolecular stability to perturbing macronnolecular interactions and cellular localization. Here we review the individual cases and genome-wide studies that illustrate the association between missense mutations and diseases. In addition, we emphasize that the molecular mechanisms of effects of mutations should be revealed in order to understand the disease origin. Finally, we report the current state-of-the-art methodologies that predict the effects of mutations on protein stability, the hydrogen bond network, pH dependence, conformational dynamics and protein function.

The electrical conductivity, as well as small ion diffusivity, of male and female TMJ discs was determined under three compressive strains. In the male group, the average disc electrical conductivity (mean +/- A SD) at 0% strain was 5.14 +/- A 0.97 mS/cm, decreased to 4.50 +/- A 0.91 mS/cm (-12.3%) at 10% strain, and 3.93 +/- A 0.81 mS/cm (-23.5%) at 20% compressive strain. Correspondingly, the average disc relative ion diffusivity at 0% strain was 0.44 +/- A 0.08, decreased to 0.40 +/- A 0.08 (-8.9%) at 10% strain, and 0.36 +/- A 0.08 (-16.7%) at 20% compressive strain. In the female group, the average disc electrical conductivity at 0% strain was 5.84 +/- A 0.59 mS/cm, decreased to 5.01 +/- A 0.50 mS/cm (-14.2%) at 10% strain, and 4.33 +/- A 0.46 mS/cm (-25.8%) at 20% compressive strain. Correspondingly, the average disc relative ion diffusivity at 0% strain was 0.49 +/- A 0.05, decreased to 0.43 +/- A 0.04 (-11.3%) at 10% strain, and 0.39 +/- A 0.04 (-19.9%) at 20% compressive strain. The results indicated that mechanical strain significantly impeded solute diffusion through the disc. This mechanical strain effect was larger in the female than in the male human TMJ disc. This study may provide new insights into TMJ pathophysiology.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0090-6964	1573-9686		WOS:000325772900008	23771300

Orbit codes are constant dimension codeswhich are defined as orbits of a subgroup of the general linear group, acting on the set of all subspaces of F-q(n). If the acting group is cyclic, the corresponding orbit codes are called cyclic orbit codes. In this paper, we show how orbit codes can be seen as an analog of linear codes in the block coding case. We investigate how the structure of cyclic orbit codes can be utilized to compute the minimum distance and cardinality of a given code and propose different decoding procedures for a particular subclass of cyclic orbit codes.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0018-9448	1557-9654		WOS:000325981100028		
J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Ze; Li, Jin								A DHT-Aided Chunk-Driven Overlay for Scalable and Efficient Peer-to-Peer Live Streaming								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				24	11			2125	2137		10.1109/TPDS.2012.302			NOV 2013	2013	Internet-based video streaming applications are becoming more and more popular, attracting millions of online viewers every day. The incredible growth of viewers, dynamics of participants, and high video quality of service (QoS) requirement pose scalability, availability, and low-latency challenges to peer-to-peer (P2P) live video streaming systems. Tree-based systems have low-delay but are vulnerable to churn, while mesh-based systems are churn-resilient but suffer from high delay and overhead. Also, both structures cannot make full utilization of the bandwidth in the system. To tackle the challenges, we propose a DHT-aided chunk-driven overlay (DCO). It introduces a scalable DHT ring structure into a mesh-based overlay to efficiently manage video stream sharing. DCO includes a two-layer hierarchical DHT-based infrastructure, a chunk sharing algorithm, and a video provider selection algorithm. It selects stable nodes to form a scalable DHT-based infrastructure. The nodes in the DHT serve as distributed matchmakers between video providers and requesters. To motivate stable nodes to serve as the DHT nodes, we introduce an incentive mechanism based on the game theory. Aided by DHT, DCO guarantees stream chunk availability and assigns to a chunk requester a provider among all available providers in the system so that stream chunks are transmitted along a dynamic tree with top-down decreasing node bandwidth. In this way, DCO takes full advantage of available bandwidth in the system and, at the same time, provides high scalability and low latency. Experimental results show the superior performance of DCO compared with mesh-based and tree-based systems, and the effectiveness of the incentive mechanism and provider selection algorithm.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000325170700002		
J	Shen, Haiying; Liu, Guoxin								A Geographically Aware Poll-Based Distributed File Consistency Maintenance Method for P2P Systems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				24	11			2148	2159		10.1109/TPDS.2012.317			NOV 2013	2013	File consistency maintenance in P2P systems is a technique for maintaining consistency between files and their replicas. Most previous consistency maintenance methods depend on either message spreading or structure-based pushing. Message spreading generates high overhead due to a large amount of messages; structure-based pushing methods reduce this overhead. However, both approaches cannot guarantee that every replica node receives an update in churn, because replica nodes passively wait for updates. As opposed to push-based methods that are not effective in high-churn and low-resource P2P systems, polling is churn resilient and generates low overhead. However, it is faced with a number of challenges: 1) ensuring a limited inconsistency; 2) realizing polling in a distributed manner; 3) considering physical proximity in polling; and 4) leveraging polling to further reduce polling overhead. To handle these challenges, this paper introduces a poll-based distributed file consistency maintenance method called geographically aware wave (GeWave). GeWave further reduces update overhead, enhances the fidelity of file consistency, and takes proximity into account. Using adaptive polling in a dynamic structure, GeWave avoids redundant file updates and ensures that every node receives an update in a limited time period even in churn. Furthermore, it propagates updates between geographically close nodes in a distributed manner. Extensive experimental results from the PlanetLab real-world testbed demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of GeWave in comparison with other representative consistency maintenance schemes. It dramatically reduces the overhead and yields significant improvements on effectiveness, scalability, and churn resilience of previous file consistency maintenance methods.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000325170700004

Previous studies suggested that foraging organisms may experience decreased vigilance to attacks by predators; however, little is known about the effect of foraging on escape performance with respect to the kinematics and the timing of the response. This study tested the hypothesis that engaging in foraging activities affected escape performance by comparing fast-start escape responses of silver-spotted sculpins Blepsias cirrhosus under three conditions: (1) control (no foraging involved), (2) while targeting prey, and (3) immediately after capture of prey. Escape response variables (non-locomotor and locomotor) were analyzed from high-speed videos. Responsiveness was lower immediately after capturing a prey item compared with the other two treatments, and latency of performance was higher in the control treatment than in the other two. Locomotor variables such as maximum speed, maximum acceleration, and turning rates did not show statistical differences among the three groups. Our results demonstrate that foraging can negatively affect two fundamental components of the escape response: (1) responsiveness and (2) latency of escape, suggesting that engaging in foraging may decrease an individual's ability to successfully evade predators.									4	0	0	4	0	4			1540-7063	1557-7023		WOS:000326041500002	23624863	
J	Miller, Steven V.					Miller, Steven/0000-0003-4072-6263			Territorial disputes and the politics of individual well-being								JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH				50	6			677	690		10.1177/0022343313484954			NOV 2013	2013	Multiple studies argue that the division of territory between states is a root cause of war in the international system. This is often understood as a function of the unique importance of territory at the level of the individual citizen, because the territory itself directly affects an individual's well-being on multiple dimensions. As such, disputes over territory should also have consequences for an individual's overall subjective appraisal of their well-being. This article argues that disputes over the allocation of territory between states do affect an individual's subjective well-being, but not uniformly. Citizens in states routinely targeted by a territorial threat from a revisionist neighbor are generally unhappy. However, citizens in states that initiate territorial disputes are happier as a result of the aggressive foreign policy of the state leader to secure the coveted territorial good. This is first demonstrated using mixed effects modeling on data drawn from the World Values Survey and Correlates of War Militarized Interstate Dispute dataset. In addition, this article provides an illustration of variations in territorial threat and subjective well-being using the case of Nigeria, finding that Nigerians were happier when their state was initiating territorial threat against its neighbors and less happy during a period when Nigeria itself was the target of territorial threat. The analyses provided advance the territorial conflict research program by measuring the individual-level effects of territorial disputes. In addition, the findings add to a growing scholarship on the political determinants of an individual quality of life, sometimes considered the ultimate dependent variable' in social science.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3433	1460-3578		WOS:000326012100002		
J	Payero, Jose O.; Irmak, Suat								Daily energy fluxes, evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of soybean								AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT				129				31	43		10.1016/j.agwat.2013.06.018			NOV 2013	2013	Evapotranspiration represents the main consumptive use of water in agricultural production and its magnitude is important for irrigation water management. Since water shortages are increasing in many areas, there is a pressing need to improve irrigation water management, for which farmers need reliable information and tools to make better irrigation decisions. There is a lack of knowledge about the water use and irrigation requirements of crops grown in different environments, especially of new crop hybrids. The overall objective of this study was to improve our understanding of the water requirements of soybean. Specific objectives were to: (1) measure and document the daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and other energy fluxes, (2) document the daily and seasonal behavior of crop coefficients (Kc), and (3) evaluate the impact of weather variables on alfalfa-reference (ETr) and grass-reference (ETo) evapotranspiration. Here we report results of direct ETc measurements using an eddy covariance system obtained from soybean fields at North Platte, Nebraska, during 2002, 2003, and 2005. We found considerable differences in weather conditions among seasons that affected the accumulation of growing degree days, crop development pattern, crop ETc and Kc. We found that ETr values were on average 32.3% greater than ETo, which is important when choosing Kc values for calculating crop ETc. We also found that vapor pressure deficit (VPD) explained 90 and 92% of the variability in ETo and ETr, respectively. We presented daily measurements of energy fluxes and Kc values and found that measured Kc values were quite variable and often deviated considerably from the average Kc curves given in FAO-56 due to wetting events (rain and irrigation) and crop stress. Therefore, we recommend using the dual Kc method, rather than the single Kc method, for irrigation scheduling. In addition, we found considerable differences in crop maturity among years and suggested that acceleration in maturity could be due to crop stress, especially during the reproductive period. We raised the need for accurate methods to quantify the effect of stress on crop maturity and its impact on Kc.

We hypothesize that chelating agents, such as disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and sodium thiosulfate (STS) might reverse elastin calcification by directly removing calcium from calcified tissues into soluble calcium complexes. We assessed the chelating ability of EDTA, DTPA, and STS on removal of calcium from hydroxyapatite (HA) powder, calcified porcine aortic elastin, and calcified human aorta in vitro. We show that both EDTA and DTPA could effectively remove calcium from HA and calcified tissues, while STS was not effective. The tissue architecture was not altered during chelation. In the animal model of aortic elastin-specific calcification, we further show that local periadventitial delivery of EDTA loaded in to poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles regressed elastin-specific calcification in the aorta. Collectively, the data indicate that elastin-specific medial vascular calcification could be reversed by chelating agents.									7	0	0	5	0	7			0171-967X	1432-0827		WOS:000325825400005	23963635

The cases when the two hyperplanes are parallel and when they are nonparallel are discussed. We show that these families can be described with only one parameter and describe how the quadrics are transformed as the parameter changes. This research was motivated by an application in mixed integer conic optimization. In that application, we aimed to characterize the convex hull of the union of the intersections of an ellipsoid with two half-spaces arising from the imposition of a linear disjunction.

Tire chips sizes of 5.08, 10.16, and 15.24cm are used. The permeability tests are conducted using sample layers of 15.24-, 30.48-, and 45.72-cm thickness. The vertical and lateral permeability data of uniformly sized chips under no overburden are in the range of coarse gravel. The mixed-size tire chips have permeability in the range of coarse to very coarse gravel under no overburden. Under overburden, the compressibility of the uniformly sized tire chips increases with tire-chip size and decreases with layer thickness. There is a general trend of decrease in permeability with increase in overburden pressure. In the case of uniformly sized chips under overburden, the 5.08-cm chips have the highest permeability and the 15.24-cm chips have the lowest permeability. The mixed-size tire chips have higher permeability than the uniformly sized tire chips. In general, the permeability of uniform and mixed-size tire chips is in the range of coarse gravel.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0733-9437	1943-4774		WOS:000325643600006

In this study, the nanosilica was added to the control asphalt at contents of 4% and 6% based on the weight of asphalt binders. Superpave binder and mixture tests were utilized in this study to estimate the characteristics of the nano-modifed asphalt binder and mixture. The rotational viscosity (RV), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), bending beam rhometer (BBR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), asphalt pavement analyzer (APA), dynamic modulus (DM) and flow number (FN) tests were used to analyze rheological properties and chemical bonding changes of the nano-modified asphalt binder and the performance of the nano-modified asphalt mixture. In addition, the performance of nano-modified asphalt after rolling thin-film oven (RTFO) short-term and pressure-aging vessel (PAV) long-term aging was assessed as well. The dissipated work per load cycle for the asphalt binder was used to evaluate the rheological properties of the nano-modified asphalt binder. Based on the binder test results, it was found that the additional nanosilica in the control asphalt binder slightly decreased the viscosity of the control asphalt binder, maintained low dissipated work per load cycle, held a similar low-temperature performance to the control asphalt, and had a positive effect on antioxidation. From the mixture test results, the dynamic modulus and flow number of nano-modified asphalt mixtures improved, and the rutting susceptibility of nano-modified asphalt mixtures was reduced compared to the control asphalt mixture. In general, the findings from this study show that the antiaging property and rutting and fatigue cracking performance of nanosilica modified asphalt binders are enhanced, and the addition of nanosilica in the control asphalt mixture significantly improves the dynamic modulus, flow number, and rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0899-1561	1943-5533		WOS:000325644300006		
J	Shen, Haiying; Liu, Guoxin								A Lightweight and Cooperative Multifactor Considered File Replication Method in Structured P2P Systems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS				62	11			2115	2130		10.1109/TC.2012.104			NOV 2013	2013	File replication is widely used in structured P2P systems to avoid hot spots in servers and enhance file availability. The number of replicas and replication distance affect the file replication cost. These two elements and the replica update frequency determined in the file replication stage also affect the cost of subsequent consistency maintenance. However, most existing file replication protocols focus on improving file lookup efficiency without considering its cost and its subsequent influence on consistency maintenance. This paper studies the problem about how a server chooses files to replicate and where to replicate files to achieve low cost in both file replication and consistency maintenance stages without compromising the effectiveness of file replication. This paper presents a lightweight and Cooperative multifactOr considered file Replication Protocol (CORP) to achieve this goal. CORP simultaneously takes into account multiple factors including file popularity, update rate, node available capacity, file load, and node locality, aiming to minimize the number of replicas, update frequency, and replication distance. CORP also dynamically adjusts the number of replicas based on ever-changing file popularity and visit pattern. Extensive experimental results from simulation and PlanetLab real-world testbed demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of CORP in comparison with other file replication protocols. It dramatically reduces the overhead of both file replication and consistency maintenance. In addition, it exhibits high adaptiveness to skewed lookups and yields significant improvement in reducing overloaded nodes. Specifically, compared to the other replication protocols, CORP can reduce more than 71 percent of file replicas, 84 percent of overloaded nodes, 94 percent of consistency maintenance cost, and 72 percent of file replication and consistency maintenance latency.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0018-9340			WOS:000325171200001

The purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of national legislative efforts to address the education of children who are homeless, with a particular emphasis on students with disabilities. The McKinney-Vento Act is intended to provide some relief to the many challenges children who are homeless face. The act provides federal funding to the states and establishes requirements that expedite and in fact bypass bureaucratic documentation requirements for school enrollment and help create a stable school environment that provides the opportunity for these students to succeed in school.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1053-4512	1538-4810		WOS:000324994200004		
J	Lindburg, Carl Alexander; Willey, Jeffrey S.; Dean, Delphine								Effects of Low Dose X-Ray Irradiation on Porcine Articular Cartilage Explants								JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH				31	11			1780	1785		10.1002/jor.22406			NOV 2013	2013	Ionizing radiation therapy is a crucial treatment for cancer, but can damage surrounding normal tissues. Damage to articular cartilage leading to arthropathy can occur at irradiated sites. It is unclear whether this response is due to damaging surrounding skeletal structures or direct effects on cartilage. In this study, we showed that irradiation with 2Gy of X-rays causes a significant reduction in the stiffness of porcine explants 1 week post-irradiation. By using both microindentation and indentation-type atomic force microscopy, ionizing radiation reduces stiffness in both the superficial zone, and throughout the entire thickness of the tissue. Young's modulus values were 75% and 60% lower in 2Gy irradiated samples when compared with controls using microindentation and nanoindentation, respectively. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) released into the culture media of irradiated samples was nearly 100% greater at 24h after exposure. While collagen content in the tissue is similar between groups, GAG content is 55% lower in irradiated explants compared with controls 7 days after exposure. Therefore, the irradiated explants are unable to recover from the initial loss of GAGs by 1 week. This acute loss of GAGs is a likely contributor to the reduction in modulus seen after exposure to ionizing radiation. (c) 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

On the time-dependent moments of Markovian queues with reneging								QUEUEING SYSTEMS				75	2-4	SI		149	168		10.1007/s11134-012-9281-2			NOV 2013	2013	We give an explicit representation for the time-dependent moments of a Markovian queueing system with reneging. Our expressions are comparable in form to the moment expressions for the M/M/1 queue found in Abate and Whitt (Queueing Syst. 2:41-65, 1987; Adv. Appl. Probab. 20:145-178, 1988). We also illustrate how to use these expressions to derive analogous moment expressions for a reflected Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, with reflection at zero.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0257-0130	1572-9443		WOS:000325265600003

J	Zeng, Jian; Deng, Yanxiang; Vedantam, Pallavi; Tzeng, Tzuen-Rong; Xuan, Xiangchun				Xuan, Xiangchun/B-9174-2009				Magnetic separation of particles and cells in ferrofluid flow through a straight microchannel using two offset magnets								JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS				346				118	123		10.1016/j.jmmm.2013.07.021			NOV 2013	2013	The separation of particles and cells is critical in many chemical and biological applications. This work presents a simple idea for utilizing a pair of permanent magnets to continuously separate diamagnetic particles and cells in ferrofluid flow through a straight microchannel. The first magnet is placed close to the microchannel for focusing the particle mixture to a single stream without the use of a sheath flow. The second magnet, which is offset from the first magnet and placed farther from the channel, is to displace the aligned particles to dissimilar flow paths for a continuous sorting. This idea is first demonstrated through the separation of 3 mu m- and 10 mu m-diameter polystyrene particles, where the effects of flow speed and magnet distance are both examined. The experimental data are found to fit well with the predictions of an analytical model. Furthermore, a continuous separation of live yeast cells from 10 pm polystyrene particles is implemented in the same device. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Besides visible emission peaked at 480, 572 and 655 nm, near-infrared emission with sharp emission bands range from 800 nm to 1700 nm were detected from this complex. The Judd-Ofelt theory was introduced to calculate the radiative transition rate and the radiative decay time for the F-4(9/2)-> L-6(J), transitions of Dy3+ ion in this complex. The calculated radiative lifetime of the F-4(9/2) excited state was 410 mu s, compared with the measured luminescent lifetime 17.6 mu s, we obtained the radiative quantum efficiency of the F-4(9/2) excited state of 43% from this Dy (III) complex.

J	Liu, Shitao; Triggiani, Roberto								RECOVERING DAMPING AND POTENTIAL COEFFICIENTS FOR AN INVERSE NON-HOMOGENEOUS SECOND-ORDER HYPERBOLIC PROBLEM VIA A LOCALIZED NEUMANN BOUNDARY TRACE								DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS				33	11-12	SI		5217	5252		10.3934/dcds.2013.33.5217			NOV-DEC 2013	2013	We consider a second-order hyperbolic equation defined on an open bounded domain Q in R-n for n >= 2, with C-2-boundary F = partial derivative Omega = Gamma(0) boolean OR Gamma(1), Gamma(0) boolean OR Gamma(1) = empty set, subject to non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for the entire boundary Gamma. We then study the inverse problem of determining both the damping and the potential (source) coefficients simultaneously, in one shot, by means of an additional measurement of the Neumann boundary trace of the solution, in a suitable, explicit sub-portion Gamma(1) of the boundary Gamma, and over a computable time interval T > 0. Under sharp conditions on the complementary part Gamma(0) = Gamma\Gamma(1), T > 0, and under sharp regularity requirements on the data, we establish the two canonical results in inverse problems: (i) uniqueness and (ii) Lipschitz-stability. The latter (ii) is the main result of the paper. Our proof relies on a few main ingredients: (a) sharp Carleman estimates at the H-1(Omega) x L-2(Omega)-level for second-order hyperbolic equations [23] originally introduced for control theory issues; (b) a correspondingly implied continuous observability inequality at the same energy level [23[; (c) sharp interior and boundary regularity theory for second-order hyperbolic equations with Dirichlet boundary data [11, 15, 16]. The proof of the linear uniqueness result (Section 3) also takes advantage of a convenient tactical route "post-Carleman estimates" proposed by V. Isakov in [8, Thm. 8.2.2, p. 231]. Expressing the final results for the nonlinear inverse problem directly in terms of the data offers an additional challenge.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1078-0947	1553-5231		WOS:000318966900023

The field of the environmental health and safety of nanotechnology, or NanoEHS, is currently lacking significant molecular-resolution data, and we set out to characterize biocorona formation through electron microscopy imaging and circular dichroism spectroscopy that inspired a novel approach for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of protein-NP interactions. In our present study, we developed a novel GPU-biocorona formation, a first in the field. Specifically, we performed MD optimized coarse-grained MD simulation methodology for the study of of a spherical, negatively charged citrate-covered silver nanoparticle (AgNP) interacting with 15 apolipoproteins. At low ion concentrations, we observed the formation of an AgNP-apolipoprotein biocorona. Consistent with the circular dichroism (CD) spectra, we observed a decrease in alpha-helices coupled with an increase in beta-sheets in apolipoprotein upon biocorona formation.									11	0	0	3	0	11			1520-6106			WOS:000326608500006	24073791

Stanley								Classification Trees for Complex Synchrophasor Data								ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS				41	14			1381	1396		10.1080/15325008.2013.824048			OCT 26 2013	2013	Classification and regression trees (CART) has been used for various applications in power systems. In most of these applications, phasor data obtained from phasor measurement units are used for building the decision tree. However, the splits in CART are based on a single attribute or a combination of variables chosen by CART itself rather than the user. But as phasor measurement unit data are complex numbers, both the attributesreal and imaginaryshould be considered simultaneously for making critical decisions. For example, changing the reference bus in situations where the split is only on the real or imaginary part of a complex voltage (or current) measurement can cause the performance of the tree to degrade significantly. An algorithm is proposed in this article to allow splits on complex synchrophasor data. The methodology is implemented on two systems: a detailed model of the California Power System, where it is used for developing an adaptive protection scheme, and the IEEE 118-bus system, where it is used to classify dynamic events based on trajectories of voltage measurements obtained from phasor measurement units. MATLAB (R) (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) implementation of classification and regression trees (classregtree.m) has been used for performing both analyses.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1532-5008	1532-5016		WOS:000324612200004

It aims to facilitate development of community-driven biological websites by integrating the GMOD Chado database schema with Drupal, a popular website creation and content management software. Tripal provides a suite of tools for interaction with a Chado database and display of content therein. The tools are designed to be generic to support the various ways in which data may be stored in Chado. Previous releases of Tripal have supported organisms, genomic libraries, biological stocks, stock collections and genomic features, their alignments and annotations. Also, Tripal and its extension modules provided loaders for commonly used file formats such as FASTA, GFF, OBO, GAF, BLAST XML, KEGG heir files and InterProScan XML. Default generic templates were provided for common views of biological data, which could be customized using an open Application Programming Interface to change the way data are displayed. Here, we report additional tools and functionality that are part of release v1.1 of Tripal. These include (i) a new bulk loader that allows a site curator to import data stored in a custom tab delimited format; (ii) full support of every Chado table for Drupal Views (a powerful tool allowing site developers to construct novel displays and search pages); (iii) new modules including 'Feature Map', 'Genetic', 'Publication', 'Project', 'Contact' and the 'Natural Diversity' modules.

J	Rivera, Angela R. V.; Blob, Richard W.								Forelimb muscle function in pig-nosed turtles, Carettochelys insculpta: testing neuromotor conservation between rowing and flapping in swimming turtles								BIOLOGY LETTERS				9	5					20130471	10.1098/rsbl.2013.0471			OCT 23 2013	2013	Changes in muscle activation patterns can lead to new locomotor modes; however, neuromotor conservation-the evolution of new forms of locomotion through changes in structure without concurrent changes to underlying motor patterns-has been documented across diverse styles of locomotion. Animals that swim using appendages do so via rowing (anteroposterior oscilations) or flapping (dorsoventral oscilations). Yet few studies have compared motor patterns between these swimming modes. In swimming turtles, propulsion is generated exclusively by limbs. Kinematically, turtles swim using multiple styles of rowing (freshwater species), flapping (sea turtles) and a unique hybrid style with superficial similarity to flapping by sea turtles and characterized by increased dorsoventral motions of synchronously oscillated forelimbs that have been modified into flippers (Carettochelys insculpta). We compared forelimb motor patterns in four species of turtle (two rowers, Apalone ferox and Trachemys scripta; one flapper, Caretta caretta; and Carettochelys) and found that, despite kinematic differences, motor patterns were generally similar among species with a few notable exceptions: specifically, presence of variable bursts for pectoralis and triceps in Trachemys (though timing of the non-variable pectoralis burst was similar), and the timing of deltoideus activity in Carettochelys and Caretta compared with other taxa. The similarities in motor patterns we find for several muscles provide partial support for neuromotor conservation among turtles using diverse locomotor styles, but the differences implicate deltoideus as a prime contributor to flapping limb motions.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000330289600016	23966596

The activities of the naringinase and beta-D-glucosidase were determined through an indirect calculation of the naringenin concentration to avoid interference from its poor solubility. The measured enzymatic activities of the naringinase complex, alpha-L-rhamnosidase, and beta-D-glucosidase were the as same as their theoretical activities when the substrates' (i.e., naringin or prunin) concentrations were 200 mu g/mL, and the enzyme concentrations were within the range of 0.06-0.43, 0.067-0.53, and 0.15-1.13 U/mL, respectively. The beta-D-glucosidase had a much higher V-max than either naringinase or alpha-L-rhamnosidase, implying the hydrolysis of naringin to prunin was the limiting step of the enzyme reaction. The reliability of the method was finally validated through the repeatability test, indicating its feasibility for the determinations of the naringinase complex.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000326213000007	24070201

Factors that affect the physical science career interest of female students: Testing five common hypotheses								PHYSICAL REVIEW SPECIAL TOPICS-PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH				9	2					UNSP 020115	10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.9.020115			OCT 22 2013	2013	There are many hypotheses regarding factors that may encourage female students to pursue careers in the physical sciences. Using multivariate matching methods on national data drawn from the Persistence Research in Science and Engineering (PRiSE) project (n = 7505), we test the following five commonly held beliefs regarding what factors might impact females' physical science career interest: (i) having a single-sex physics class, (ii) having a female physics teacher, (iii) having female scientist guest speakers in physics class, (iv) discussing the work of female scientists in physics class, and (v) discussing the underrepresentation of women in physics class. The effect of these experiences on physical science career interest is compared for female students who are matched on several factors, including prior science interests, prior mathematics interests, grades in science, grades in mathematics, and years of enrollment in high school physics. No significant effects are found for single-sex classes, female teachers, female scientist guest speakers, and discussing the work of female scientists. However, discussions about women's underrepresentation have a significant positive effect.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1554-9178			WOS:000326054100001

To determine how copper binding results in antioxidant activity, biologically relevant selone and thione ligands and Cu+ complexes of the formula [Tpm*Cu(L)](+) [Tpm* = tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)methane; L = N,N'-dimethylimidazole selone or thione] were treated with H2O2 and the products analyzed by H-1, C-13{H-1}, and Se-77{H-1} NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. Upon H2O2 treatment, selone and thione binding to Cu+ prevents oxidation to Cu2+; instead, the chalcogenone ligand is oxidized. Thus, copper coordination by sulfur and selenium compounds can provide targeted sacrificial antioxidant activity.									6	0	0	2	0	6			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000326065600001	24490690

Field-Level Sublethal Effects of Approved Bee Hive Chemicals on Honey Bees (Apis mellifera L)								PLOS ONE				8	10					e76536	10.1371/journal.pone.0076536			OCT 18 2013	2013	In a study replicated across two states and two years, we tested the sublethal effects on honey bees of the miticides Apistan (tau fluvalinate) and Check Mite+ (coumaphos) and the wood preservative copper naphthenate applied at label rates in field conditions. A continuous covariate, a colony Varroa mite index, helped us disambiguate the effects of the chemicals on bees while adjusting for a presumed benefit of controlling mites. Mite levels in colonies treated with Apistan or Check Mite+ were not different from levels in non-treated controls. Experimental chemicals significantly decreased 3-day brood survivorship and increased construction of queen supercedure cells compared to non-treated controls. Bees exposed to Check Mite+ as immatures had higher legacy mortality as adults relative to non-treated controls, whereas bees exposed to Apistan had improved legacy mortality relative to non-treated controls. Relative to non-treated controls, Check Mite+ increased adult emergence weight. Although there was a treatment effect on a test of associative learning, it was not possible to statistically separate the treatment means, but bees treated with Apistan performed comparatively well. And finally, there were no detected effects of bee hive chemical on colony bee population, amount of brood, amount of honey, foraging rate, time required for marked released bees to return to their nest, percentage of released bees that return to the nest, and colony Nosema spore loads. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine sublethal effects of bee hive chemicals applied at label rates under field conditions while disambiguating the results from mite control benefits realized from the chemicals. Given the poor performance of the miticides at reducing mites and their inconsistent effects on the host, these results defend the use of bee health management practices that minimize use of exotic hive chemicals.									10	0	0	9	0	10			1932-6203			WOS:000326029300035	24204638

The objective was to determine which materials were capable of contaminant removal while causing minimal flux reduction. Methylene blue and atrazine were the model contaminants. When applied as membrane coatings, MWCNTs had minimal retention capabilities for the model contaminants, and S-PAC had the fastest removal. The membrane coating approach was also compared with a stirred vessel configuration, in which the adsorbent was added to a stirred flask preceding the membrane cell. Direct application of the adsorbent to the membrane constituted a greater initial reduction in permeate concentrations of the model contaminants than with the stirred flask setup. All adsorbents except S-PAC showed flux reductions less than 5% after application as thin-layer membrane coatings, and flux recovery after membrane backwashing was greater than 90% for all materials and masses tested.

The effects of protein solubility on the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) for recombinant Escherichia coli								BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				79				129	135		10.1016/j.bej.2013.07.011			OCT 15 2013	2013	High quality, intact messenger RNA (mRNA) is required for DNA microarray and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis and is generally obtained from total RNA isolations. The most widely recognized measure of RNA integrity is the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) obtained from the Agilent Bioanalyzer, as it provides sizing, quantification, and quality control measures. This work describes comparisons of the RIN values obtained for recombinant Escherichia coli. Uninduced recombinant E. coli cultures were examined, as well as induced cultures that produced either a soluble or insoluble recombinant protein. The uninduced cultures and the induced cultures producing soluble protein had higher RIN values than the induced cultures producing insoluble protein. These lower RIN values for E. coli producing the insoluble protein indicate that cellular degradation of the ribosomal RNA species is the likely cause of the lower RIN values. As the use of DNA microarrays and other gene expression tools increase in usage in the industrial recombinant protein production community, these results suggest the need for further studies to determine acceptable RIN ranges for gene expression analysis and effects of various culture conditions on RIN values for recombinant E. coli.

However, little information is available on how fine root heterogeneity of trees responds to environmental stresses. We examined concentrations of seven potentially toxic metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb) within fine root networks and their correlations with root morphological and macro-elemental traits in six Chinese subtropical trees. The contributions of different orders of roots to fine-root metal storage and return were also estimated. Results showed no consistent pattern for the correlation among different metal concentration against root traits. Unlike root metal concentration that generally decreased with root order, root metal storage was commonly lowest in middle root orders. Root senescence was at least comparable to leaf senescence contributing to metal removal. Although the first-order roots constituted 7.2-22.3% of total fine root biomass, they disproportionately contributed to most of metal return fluxes via root senescence. The two distinct root functional modules contributed differentially to metal uptake, allocation, and return, with defensive (lower-order) roots effectively stabilizing and removing toxic metals and bulk buffering (higher-order) roots possessing a persistent but diluted metal pool.

Recognition of HIV-TAR RNA using neomycin-benzimidazole conjugates								BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS				23	20			5689	5693		10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.08.014			OCT 15 2013	2013	Synthesis of a novel class of compounds and their biophysical studies with TAR-RNA are presented. The synthesis of these compounds was achieved by conjugating neomycin, an aminoglycoside, with benzimidazoles modeled from a B-DNA minor groove binder, Hoechst 33258. The neomycin-benzimidazole conjugates have varying linkers that connect the benzimidazole and neomycin units. The linkers of varying length (5-23 atoms) in these conjugates contain one to three triazole units. The UV thermal denaturation experiments showed that the conjugates resulted in greater stabilization of the TAR-RNA than either neomycin or benzimidazole used in the synthesis of conjugates. These results were corroborated by the FID displacement and tat-TAR inhibition assays. The binding of ligands to the TAR-RNA is affected by the length and composition of the linker. Our results show that increasing the number of triazole groups and the linker length in these compounds have diminishing effect on the binding to TAR-RNA. Compounds that have shorter linker length and fewer triazole units in the linker displayed increased affinity towards the TAR RNA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Each spectrum spans over a wide wavelength range covering from 310 to 2475 nm. We have monitored the continuum excess in the Balmer region of the spectra and the luminosity of 12 ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared spectral lines that are commonly used as accretion tracers for T Tauri stars. The observed strengths of the Balmer excesses have been reproduced from a magnetospheric accretion shock model, providing a mean mass accretion rate of 1.11 x 10(-7) and 4.50 x 10(-7) M-circle dot yr(-1) for HD 31648 and HD 163296, respectively. Accretion rate variations are observed, being more pronounced for HD 31648 (up to 0.5 dex). However, from the comparison with previous results it is found that the accretion rate of HD 163296 has increased by more than 1 dex, on a timescale of similar to 15 yr. Averaged accretion luminosities derived from the Balmer excess are consistent with the ones inferred from the empirical calibrations with the emission line luminosities, indicating that those can be extrapolated to HAe stars. In spite of that, the accretion rate variations do not generally coincide with those estimated from the line luminosities, suggesting that the empirical calibrations are not useful to accurately quantify accretion rate variability.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000324989000044		
J	Zhao, Yunsong; Zhu, Lin								Folded cavity angled-grating broad-area lasers								OPTICS EXPRESS				21	20			24087	24092		10.1364/OE.21.024087			OCT 7 2013	2013	The angled-grating broad-area laser is a promising candidate for high power, high brightness diode laser source. The key point in the design is the angled gratings which can simultaneously support the unique snake-like zigzag lasing mode and eliminate the direct Fabry-Perot(FP) feedback. Unlike a conventional laser waveguide mode, the phase front of the zigzag mode periodically changes along the propagation direction. By use of the mirror symmetry of the zigzag mode, we propose and demonstrate the folded cavity angled-grating broad-area lasers. One benefit of this design is to reduce the required wafer space compared to a regular angled-grating broad-area laser, especially in a long cavity laser for high power operation. Experimental results show that the folded cavity laser exhibits good beam quality in far field with a slightly larger threshold and smaller slope efficiency due to the additional interface loss.

J	Gu, Guancheng; Kong, Fanting; Hawkins, Thomas W.; Foy, Paul; Wei, Kanxian; Samson, Bryce; Dong, Liang								Impact of fiber outer boundaries on leaky mode losses in leakage channel fibers								OPTICS EXPRESS				21	20			24039	24048		10.1364/OE.21.024039			OCT 7 2013	2013	In a leakage channel fiber, the desired fundamental mode (FM) has negligible waveguide loss. Higher-order modes (HOM) are designed to have much higher waveguide losses so that they are practically eliminated during propagation. Coherent reflection at the fiber outer boundary can lead to additional confinement especially for highly leaky HOM, leading to lower HOM losses than what are predicted by conventional FEM mode solver considering infinite cladding. In this work, we conducted, for the first time, careful measurements of HOM losses in two leakage channel fibers (LCF) with circular and rounded hexagonal boundary shapes respectively. Impact on HOM losses from coiling, fiber boundary shapes and coating indexes were studied in comparison to simulations. This work, for the first time, demonstrates the limit of the simulation method commonly used in the large-mode-area fiber designs and the need for an improved approach. More importantly, this work also demonstrates that a deviation from circular fiber outer shape may be an effective method to mitigate HOM loss reduction from coherent reflection from fiber outer boundary, even in double-clad fibers, with HOM losses in excess of 20dB/m measured in the hexagonal LCF with similar to 50 mu m core diameter while keeping FM loss negligible.

Thermal processing and properties of bioplastic sheets derived from meat and bone meal								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				130	1			256	263		10.1002/app.39156			OCT 5 2013	2013	Chemical modification of plasticized meat and bone meal (MBM) and its thermal processing into bioplastic sheets is reported. Specifically, MBM plasticized with 30 wt% glycerol and modified with calcium hydroxide (CH) (0, 3, 7, and 10 wt%) was batch compounded at 100 degrees C, 15-30 min, and 60 rpm followed by thermal compaction at 140 degrees C to produce sheets. The effect of CH content on the chemical structure, processability, and tensile properties (static and dynamic) of modified MBM sheets were studied. Fine particle size of MBM and moderate environment humidity produced well-consolidated sheets. Increase in CH content to about 7 wt% was found to increase tensile strength and modulus, whereas the strain to failure decreased. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of modified MBM sheets showed that the changes in mechanical properties could be attributed to increased interactions between protein chains, which were further aided by the precipitation of the fat portion of MBM.

J	Li, Lin; Huang, Yanzhao; Xiao, Yi								How to Use Not-Always-Reliable Binding Site Information in Protein-Protein Docking Prediction								PLOS ONE				8	10					e75936	10.1371/journal.pone.0075936			OCT 4 2013	2013	In many protein-protein docking algorithms, binding site information is used to help predicting the protein complex structures. Using correct and accurate binding site information can increase protein-protein docking success rate significantly. On the other hand, using wrong binding sites information should lead to a failed prediction, or, at least decrease the success rate. Recently, various successful theoretical methods have been proposed to predict the binding sites of proteins. However, the predicted binding site information is not always reliable, sometimes wrong binding site information could be given. Hence there is a high risk to use the predicted binding site information in current docking algorithms. In this paper, a softly restricting method (SRM) is developed to solve this problem. By utilizing predicted binding site information in a proper way, the SRM algorithm is sensitive to the correct binding site information but insensitive to wrong information, which decreases the risk of using predicted binding site information. This SRM is tested on benchmark 3.0 using purely predicted binding site information. The result shows that when the predicted information is correct, SRM increases the success rate significantly; however, even if the predicted information is completely wrong, SRM only decreases success rate slightly, which indicates that the SRM is suitable for utilizing predicted binding site information.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000325489100079	24124522

In 2009, the range of M. coccopoma in the SE US extended from Ft. Pierce, FL north to Cape Hatteras, NC with seasonal populations found as far north as Kitty Hawk, NC. During the exceptionally cold winter of 2009/2010, the range of M. coccopoma shifted dramatically due to the dieback of all monitored populations north of Florida. We examined body size, distribution, and density of M. coccopoma during the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012 to describe the extent of the range retraction and the rate of range re-expansion. In 2010, recruits were found as far north as Tybee Island, Ga, but no established populations were found north of Florida. In 2011 recruits were found at Rodanthe, NC but established populations were still limited to Florida. By 2012 populations were established in Rodanthe, NC, slightly north of its previously known range limit. Estimated rates of range re-expansion were 255.8 km/yr in 2010 and 794.1 km/yr in 2011. Rates of re-expansion to the north in 2010 and 2011 were faster than have previously been reported for any marine species, and are one of the few rates published for any tropical marine invertebrate.									2	0	0	3	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000325483600091	24098598

Predominant syn addition of the chlorenium and the nudeophile across the olefin is observed. As shown by isotopic labeling, NMR spectroscopy, and derivative studies, the two new stereo-centers formed by addition across the double bond are set independently and influenced by different factors. These findings suggest a stepwise process via an intermediate capable of lactone closure with either stereochemistry, in contradistinction to the more familiar scenario in which anti addition is dictated by a bridging chloronium ion intermediate.									24	0	0	8	0	24			0002-7863			WOS:000326300500015	24025085

In conjunction with optimized enzymes and pretreatment strategies, genetic improvement of feedstock conversion potential is a common sense approach to increase end product yield. In this study, feedstock composition and crystallinity index traits were investigated across twenty Sorghum bicolor varieties for tissue specific relationships with enzymatic hydrolysis (Trichoderma viride and Aspergillus niger cellulases). It was found that hydrolysis yield potential was higher in stem than in leaf tissue. Lignin content was shown to be negatively correlated with hydrolysis rates in leaf but not stem tissue. Crystallinity index was negatively correlated with stem tissue hydrolysis rate in two grow-out years. In addition, pretreatment efficacy varied among tissue types of multiple genotypes. Dose-response curves for T. viride cellulase and ammonium hydroxide pretreatment revealed genotype and tissue specific hydrolysis rates, which suggests that these factors be optimized prior to large-scale implementation of a specific feedstock-conversion process combination. Butanol production correlates with hydrolysis rate in stem but not leaf tissue. This study suggests that selection of specific sorghum genotypes with high stem to leaf ratios could improve hydrolysis efficiency and end product yield. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Weisensee, Katherine E.								Exploring the Relative Importance of Spatial and Environmental Variation on the Craniometrics of the Modern Portuguese								HUMAN BIOLOGY				85	5			673	686					OCT 2013	2013	Previous research on the causes of craniometric variation within and among human populations has invoked both genetic and environmental explanations. Recent studies of modern populations in the United States and Portugal, among other populations, suggest that changes in environmental conditions have resulted in significant changes in cranial morphology. While similar changes in cranial morphology have been observed in genetically diverse populations, these populations do not appear to be converging on a common form. This study seeks to understand the role that population history and environmental variation play in explaining craniometric variation in the modern Portuguese. Using three-dimensional craniometric data collected from an identified skeletal collection from Lisbon, Portugal, this research examines the relationship between cranial morphology and place of birth. Two hypotheses are tested with regard to craniometric variation. The first asks whether phenotypic variation is related to geographic distance in the sample and therefore accurately represents genetic relationships. The second explores whether the significant secular changes observed in the sample obscure the population history reconstructed using craniometric data. The results demonstrate a significant relationship between geography and cranial morphology in the modern Portuguese sample. The clinal distribution to the craniometric variation is similar to what has been reported in some studies of molecular DNA from the Portuguese. The results show that cranial morphology reflects both the geography and genetic history of the sample and, furthermore, that secular changes in the population neither obscure nor erase this pattern. This study illustrates that even when secular changes have a significant impact on cranial morphology, they do not impede researchers' ability to reconstruct genetic relationships using craniometric data.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0018-7143	1534-6617		WOS:000337504300002	25078954	
J	Fisher, Murray; Chowdhury, Md Nasimul; Khan, Abdul A.; Atamturktur, Sez								An evaluation of scour measurement devices								FLOW MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION				33				55	67		10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2013.05.001			OCT 2013	2013	Scour, the leading cause of bridge failures, affects hundreds of thousand bridges and costs hundreds of millions of dollars in direct repair costs in the U.S. alone. Furthermore, scouring has also been linked to catastrophic failures that resulted in the loss of human lives. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration has proposed several countermeasures to reduce the impact of bed degradation. One of these countermeasures that is particularly relevant during peak flow periods is the real-time monitoring. Two common scour monitoring techniques are the sonar fathometers and time domain reflectometry. A novel vibration-based monitoring technique, which exploits the nature of turbulence in open channel flows for measuring scour hole depth has recently been proposed.Through an extensive experimental campaign, the authors evaluate the dependency of the performance of these three monitoring techniques on the channel conditions, such as the water temperature, and salinity or sediment concentration. The experimental results indicate that both the time domain reflectometry and sonar methods are sensitive to the channel temperature and salinity. For the sonar device, such effects can be accounted for by modifying the speed of sound for different temperature and salinity levels. For the time domain reflectometry method, the temperature effects can be accounted for using the above approach, while the presence of salinity degrades the waveform features limiting the device to non-saline environments. Salinity and temperature are shown to have little effect on the novel method. Furthermore, the time domain reflectometry and vibration-based methods are observed to be insensitive to suspended sediment concentrations and turbid flow. Sonar, however, is shown to be sensitive to moving turbid water. In varying topography, sonar is found to record the minimum depth within the beam diameter. Flow misalignments up to 90 have little impact on the vibration-based method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									5	1	0	0	0	6			0955-5986	1873-6998		WOS:000326361700006

Eu, Gd, Dy; x similar to 0.3 for Ln=Gd) were isolated upon using high-temperature, solid-state methods in molten-salt media. These compounds are isostructural with the previously reported Na(3)LnMn(3)O(3)(AsO4)(3) (Ln=La, Sm, Gd) series that contains the same [MnO4](infinity). spin chains. The synthesis of the Sr4Mn3O3(GeO4)(3) (x=0) phase was carried out by a double aliovalent substitution with respect to the Sr2+ and Ge4+ ions that replace Na+/Ln(3+) and As5+ in Na(3)LnMn(3)O(3)(AsO4)(3), respectively. The title series contains mixed-valent Mn(III)/Mn(IV) and shows a limited range of solid solution, both of which were not observed in the previously reported Na(3)LnMn(3)O(3)(AsO4)(3) series. To form the Sr(4-x)Ln(x)Mn(3)O(3)(GeO4)(3) solid solution, one of the Sr2+ sites, i.e., the original Ln-site in Na(3)LnMn(3)O(3)(AsO4)(3), is partially substituted by Ln(3+) in a statistical disorder of Sr1-x/Ln(x). Initial magnetic investigations of selected derivatives reveal higher ferromagnetic ordering temperatures than those reported for the Na(3)LnMn(3)O(3)(AsO4)(3) series, presumably attributed to a lesser degree of canting as a result of introducing non-Jahn-Teller Mn4+ ions. Also intriguing is the observation of multiple anomalies at low temperatures which appear to be of electronic origins. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

(Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Because adhesive toxicity and tag weight limit the use of this technology, initial efforts focused on selection of the optimal adhesive and design of harmonic radar tags to reduce impact on the movement of stink bugs. A design consisting of a 6-cm-long 0.10-mm-thick silver-plated copper monopole on the anode terminal of a three-contact Schottky barrier diode attached with Gorilla super glue provided a compromise between unimpaired movement and tracking range, adding an additional 8% to the weight of the stink bug while not significantly (P > 0.05) reducing walking or flying mobility in the laboratory. Recovery of tagged stink bugs in cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.), and fallow fields ranged from 10 to 75% after 24 h, whereas marked stink bugs were recovered at rates of 0-35% by using sweep net or drop cloth sampling. The distance dispersed in the field was not impacted (P > 0.05) by crop, tagged status, or gender of the insect. Future research should examine possible improvements to the harmonic radar transceiver and the wire antenna to decrease encumbrance.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000325544300022	24331611

All treatment groups, each containing 21 and 40 eggs in trials 1 and 2, respectively, were randomly represented on each of 10 replicate tray levels of a single-stage incubator. On 18 d of incubation (doi), eggs were subjected to 1 of 6 treatments using a commercial multi-egg injector. Treatments included noninjected and diluent-injected controls, along with those that received diluent containing 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, or 1.20 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 in trial 1 and 0.20, 0.60, 1.80, or 5.4 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 in trial 2. Hatchability of injected eggs (HI) was recorded on 20.5, 21.0, and 21.5 doi, and embryonic mortalities through 21.5 doi were determined. On 21.0 doi in each trial, the BW, body length, and weights and moisture concentrations of the livers and yolk sacs of male and female chicks in each replicate group were determined. In a preliminary trial, the in ovo injection of 0.60 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 on 18 doi significantly elevated its serum level concentrations in embryos on 19.25 doi. In both trials, the HI of noninjected controls through 21.0 doi was higher than that of diluent-injected controls. In trial 1, the HI of eggs on 21.0 doi after being injected with 0.30, 0.60, or 1.20 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 was higher compared with that of diluent-injected controls, and in trial 2, the HI of eggs on 21.0 and 21.5 doi after being injected with 0.60 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 was higher compared with that of diluent-injected controls.

Physiological Relationships of the Middle and Late Post-Hatch Performance of Broilers to their Embryo and Eggshell Characteristics								JOURNAL OF POULTRY SCIENCE				50	4			375	380		10.2141/jpsa.0130007			OCT 2013	2013	Relationships between physiological variables of middle and late post-hatch broilers with their corresponding egg and embryo variables were examined. Sixty Ross X Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs were randomly set on each of 8 replicate tray levels of an incubator. On 10.5 d of incubation, transponders were implanted in the air cells of 4 embryonated eggs per replicate for determination of internal egg temperature (T-emb) through d 18.5. On d 18.5, the implanted embryonated eggs were transferred to a hatcher unit where they were monitored for hatch every 12 h. Incubation length, eggshell water vapor conductance (G(H2O)), specific G(H2O) (g(H2O); G(H2O) adjusted to a 100 g set egg weight basis), and G(H2O) constants (K-H2O) of the embryonated eggs were determined. Chicks were placed in corresponding replicate floor pens and were grown out from 0 (21.5 d of incubation) to 48 d of age. On 28 and 48 d post-hatch, approximately 2 birds per pen were necropsied for determination of BW, and the relative weights and moisture concentrations of their liver, breast muscle, and left gastrocnemius muscle. Breast muscle moisture concentration on d 28 was negatively correlated with G(H2O), g(H2O), and K-H2O, and breast muscle moisture concentration on d 48 was negatively correlated with incubation length. However, relative body and breast muscle weights on d 48 were positively correlated with g(H2O) and K-H2O, and relative BW on d 48 was positively correlated with incubation length. More importantly, relative breast muscle weight on d 48 post-hatch was negatively correlated with T-emb. The variables T-emb, G(H2O), g(H2O), and K-H2O may differentially influence the physiological variables in birds during the middle and late post-hatch grow out periods, and bird metabolic and hydration statuses may be adjusted later during the post-hatch period, so that bird BW will eventually reach its genetically predetermined level.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1346-7395			WOS:000326205500013

The approach uses a basis-constrained inversion where basis vectors are tuned to the hydrologic problem of interest. Tuning is achieved using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to extract an optimal basis from synthetic training data generated by Monte Carlo simulations representative of hydrologic processes at a site. A synthetic case study illustrates that the approach performs well relative to other common inversion strategies for imaging a solute plume using an electrical resistivity survey, even when the initial conceptualization of hydrologic processes is incorrect. In two synthetic case studies, we found that the POD approach was able to significantly improve imaging of the plume by reducing the root mean square error of the concentration estimates by a factor of two. More importantly, the POD approach was able to better capture the bimodal nature of the plume in the second case study, even though the prior conceptual model for the POD basis was for a single plume. The ability of the POD inversion to improve concentration estimates exemplifies the importance of integrating process information within geophysical imaging problems. In contrast, the ability to capture the bimodality of the plume in the second example indicates the flexibility of the technique to move away from this prior process constraint when it is inconsistent with the observed ERI data.									8	0	0	1	0	8			0043-1397	1944-7973		WOS:000327432500008

To this end, several synthesis techniques, including unzipping of carbon nanotubes, chemical vapor deposition, and other bottom-up fabrication techniques have been pursued for the bulk production of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs). However, only limited progress has been made towards a fundamental understanding of the origin of strong photoluminescence (PL) in GQDs. Here, it is experimentally shown that the PL is independent of the functionalization scheme of the GQDs. Following a series of annealing experiments designed to passivate the free edges, the PL in GQDs originates from edge-states, and an edge-passivation subsequent to synthesis quenches the PL. The results of PL studies of GNRs and carbon nano-onions are shown to be consistent with PL being generated at the edge sites of GQDs.									45	3	0	3	0	46			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000327479600008

More recently, 3D printing has shown great promise in tissue fabrication with a structural control from the micro- to the macroscale by using a layer-by-layer approach. Whether through scaffold-based or scaffold-free approaches, the standard for 3D-printed tissue engineering constructs is to provide a biomimetic structural environment that facilitates tissue formation and promotes host tissue integration (e.g., cellular infiltration, vascularization, and active remodeling). This review will cover several approaches that have advanced the field of 3D printing through novel fabrication methods of tissue engineering constructs. It will also discuss the applications of synthetic and natural materials for 3D printingfacilitated tissue fabrication.									10	0	0	2	0	10			0021-2148	1869-5868		WOS:000327740500022	26869728

J	Fleck, Robert K.								Why did the electorate swing between parties during the Great Depression?								EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY				50	4	SI		599	619		10.1016/j.eeh.2013.06.003			OCT 2013	2013	The Democratic Party's electoral success during the 1930s has long intrigued politicians and scholars. To gain new insight into that success, this paper examines the striking heterogeneity in county-level support for Roosevelt. Even though the Depression's effects and the New Deal's benefits were famously widespread, only some parts of the country responded with large and durable partisan shifts. One reason is that several factors, including pre-New Deal economic hardship, Dust Bowl conditions, and New Deal spending, appear to have had effects that were largely transitory (i.e., faded by 1940). A complementary reason is that swing electorates can, and did, swing both ways. By contrast, several other variables - notably economic and demographic factors discussed in the previous literature - are related to relatively durable shifts. Finally, heterogeneity in marginal responses may have mattered greatly to national-level Democratic success. By demonstrating which factors were transitory and which were more durable, this paper illuminates the New Deal Realignment and, more generally, the influence of economic conditions and distributive policy on voter behavior.

The scattering number of a graph G is the maximum of c(G - S) - vertical bar S vertical bar taken over all cut-sets S of G. In this note we explore the minimum and maximum scattering number for several families. For example, we show that the minimum scattering number of a triangle-free graph on n vertices is approximately -n/3. We also consider the scattering number of some graph products.									0	1	0	0	0	1			1027-5487	2224-6851		WOS:000327366700010

GROWTH, MORPHOLOGY AND BIOMASS ALLOCATION IN RESPONSE TO LIGHT GRADIENT IN FIVE SUBTROPICAL EVERGREEN BROADLEAVED TREE SEEDLINGS								JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE				25	4			537	546					OCT 2013	2013	We compared seedling growth, leaf morphology and biomass allocation of five widely distributed, evergreen species (Elaeocarpus sylvestris, Illicium henryi, Quercus phillyraeoides, Gardenia jasminoides and Ardisia crenata) under varying controlled light conditions using artificial shade houses. Regardless of species, higher height growth rate was observed at intermediate light levels (33-52% sunlight). Diameter growth rate, however, increased with increasing light level. Morphological variables (mean leaf area, total leaf area per plant, specific leaf area and leaf area ratio) were significantly affected by light, with greater variation occurring in deep shade treatment (6% sunlight). Total biomass increased with light levels for E. sylvestris, Q. phillyraeoides and G. jasminoides but larger biomass was found at intermediate light levels for I. henryi and A. crenata. Biomass allocation patterns displayed small variations in the five species. Although the five species differ in their growth strategy across a light gradient, their large plasticity allows them to grow well under a wide range of light environments. As a whole, E. sylvestris, Q phillyraeoides and G. jasminoides showed their best growth above 52% sunlight. Optimal light condition for I. henryi and A. crenata were from 33 to 52% sunlight. Our findings support the underplanting of these five evergreen species in order to enrich the biodiversity of subtropical plantation ecosystems.									1	1	0	1	0	2			0128-1283			WOS:000326855000012

The effects of B doping on the absorption coefficient (alpha), optical band gap (E-g), Urbach energy (E-U), refractive index (n), refractive index at infinite wavelength (n(infinity)), extinction coefficient (k), single-oscillator energy (E-o), dispersion energy (E-d), average oscillator strength (S-o), average oscillator wavelength (lambda(o)), moments M-1 and M-3, dielectric constant (epsilon), optical conductivity (sigma), and electrical resistivity (rho) of the BZO thin films were investigated. The transmittance spectra of the ZnO and BZO thin films show that the transmittance of the BZO thin films was significantly higher than that of the ZnO thin films in the visible region of the spectrum and that the absorption edge of the BZO thin films was blue-shifted. The BZO thin films exhibited higher E-g, E-U, and E-o and lower E-d, lambda(o), M-1 and M-3 moments, S-o, n(infinity), and rho than the ZnO thin films. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These materials were obtained by ligand-free solution precipitation and calcination at 500 degrees C in air, and Ce, Eu and Tb were incorporated at the 1 mol% level. RL results of doped and undoped materials seem to indicate that the incorporation of rare earths creates effective luminescence centers, which is accompanied by an increase in the TL signal intensity in comparison with the undoped material. In particular, RL emission of MgF2:Ce is reported to be centered at 325 nm. The traps associated with the TL signal were found to be unstable under exposure to room light, suggesting potential for applications involving optically stimulated luminescence.

In the piedmont of South Carolina, during extreme drought conditions in August 2008, I. rufipes was found on redroot flatsedge, C. erythrorhizos, which had colonized mudflats on exposed shorelines of Hartwell Lake in Clemson. Surveys to determine the host-plant range of I. rufipes were conducted from 2008 to 2012 in the Blue Ridge ecoregion of Georgia and North Carolina and coastal plain and piedmont of Georgia and South Carolina. The blissid exploits the short (floriferous) growth form of C. erythrorhizos, an annual sedge of unpredictable availability in ephemeral mudflats, while maintaining populations mainly on a perennial sedge, Scirpus cyperinus, in more persistent habitats. The blissid also develops on the generally taller C. erythrorhizos plants in more permanent wetlands. Only one generation of I. rufipes might be possible on annual sedges of inconstant occurrence, but the blissid is bivoltine on woolly sedge (woolgrass), S. cyperinus. Adults overwintered not only on host sedges (mainly S. cyperinus), but also on nonhost sedges and other graminoids, beginning as early as September. A mating pair was observed on S. cyperinus in mid-May, early instars in late May, and first-generation adults by mid-July. Early instars of a second generation (and a mating pair) were observed in mid-August. The late instars found sparingly on woolly sedge in late fall and early winter probably attain adulthood or die during winter; only adults were observed after January. New state records for I. rufipes are Arkansas, Oklahoma, and South Carolina.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000326904300001

The first is based on CMOS pulse-forming-lines (PFLs). It includes a four-stage charge pump, a four-stacked-MOSFET switch and a 5 mm long PFL. The circuit is implemented in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process. Pulses of similar to 1.8 V amplitude with similar to 135 ps duration on a 50 Omega load are obtained. The obtained voltage is higher than 1.6 V, the rated operating voltage of the process. The second is a high-voltage Marx generator which also uses stacked MOSFETs as high voltage switches. The output voltage is 11.68 V, which is higher than the highest breakdown voltage (similar to 10 V) of the CMOS process. These results significantly extend high-voltage pulse generation capabilities of CMOS technologies.

SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL				80	2			454	465		10.4284/0038-4038-2012.087			OCT 2013	2013	This article considers whether presale auction estimates are unbiased predictors of price when "no-sales" are considered utilizing a newly constructed sample of over 500 works by eight early twentieth-century American artists. Unbiased presale auction estimates in predicting price, while expected, are generally not supported in previous work, but these studies (excepting one) do not include no-sales in the calculations. In order to study the question, we employ a standard approach that uses an inverse Mills ratio arising from a sample selection probit to correct for selection bias. We find that controlling for selection bias, presale auction estimates appear to be biased downward, and we offer possible reasons for this result.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0038-4038			WOS:000326905300010

It is our hypothesis that EPS produced in these systems serve to trap ions and maintain hydration. EPS isolated from in vitro and in vivo biofilms bind 200-600 nmol of ferrous iron per 10 g of biofilm sample. Initial characterizations of the EPS used preparations from two distinct microbial cultures grown in semi-submerged conditions with EPS harvested from approximately one-half of each culture immediately, the remaining biofilm was allowed to dry before the EPS was harvested. Analysis of ferrous iron binding of the four preparations showed that the culture dominated with non-filamentous cells only produced a chelating moiety after desiccation. Conversely, the second culture dominated by filamentous cells produced a ferrous iron binding activity when semi-submerged. Biochemical characterization showed that the extracted EPS was acidic, containing 37% uronic acid. Neither the EPS nor the biofilms had the ability to retain water though an increase in the rate of water loss was noted. We conclude that EPS produced by these communities are involved in nutrient capture as well as stabilization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bhattacharyya, Gautam								From Source to Sink: Mechanistic Reasoning Using the Electron-Pushing Formalism								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION				90	10			1282	1289		10.1021/ed300765k			OCT 2013	2013	Since the introduction of Morrison and Boyd's textbook in organic chemistry over 50 years. ago, reaction mechanisms and mechanistic reasoning using the electron-pushing formalism (EPF) have become a mainstay of organic chemistry courses. In recent years there have even been several papers in this Journal and others detailing research on how students attend to various aspects of this formalism. However, there are no explicit articulations of a definition or framework in the chemical or science education research literature on mechanistic reasoning using EPF. Although practicing chemists intuitively know what constitutes mechanistic reasoning, this paper presents results of a nationwide study of organic chemistry faculty regarding their understanding and use of this technique. Although a consensus definition did not emerge from this research, there were several common features to them. These features suggest an activity that has a back-of-the-envelope quality meant to generate possible pathways based on established patterns of reactivity: Consistent with this view, the experts' focus for skills required to develop dexterity in this type of mechanistic reasoning was on applied ones rather than those that are more theoretical in nature. Finally, the principal uses of mechanistic reasoning using EPF, according to the respondents, are to explain and predict outcomes of chemical processes.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0021-9584	1938-1328		WOS:000326141900005

Cutting Plane Methods for Analytical Target Cascading With Augmented Lagrangian Coordination								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				135	10					104502	10.1115/1.4024847			OCT 2013	2013	Analytical target cascading (ATC), a hierarchical, multilevel, multidisciplinary coordination method, has proven to be an effective decomposition approach for large-scale engineering optimization problems. In recent years, augmented Lagrangian relaxation methods have received renewed interest as dual update methods for solving ATC decomposed problems. These problems can be solved using the subgradient optimization algorithm, the application of which includes three schemes for updating dual variables. To address the convergence efficiency disadvantages of the existing dual update schemes, this paper investigates two new schemes, the linear and the proximal cutting plane methods, which are implemented in conjunction with augmented Lagrangian coordination for ATC-decomposed problems. Three nonconvex nonlinear example problems are used to show that these two cutting plane methods can significantly reduce the number of iterations and the number of function evaluations when compared to the traditional subgradient update methods. In addition, these methods are also compared to the method of multipliers and its variants, showing similar performance.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1050-0472			WOS:000326172500013

A convention for modelling physical architecture is presented, followed by a sample of 10 analysed systems used for training and three systems used for validation. These systems are evaluated on complexity metrics developed from graph theoretic measures. An example model is developed based on a series of regressions of trends observed within the sample data. This is validated against the systems that are not used to develop the model. The model developed uses average path length, part count and path length density to approximate assembly time within the standard deviation of the subjective variation possible in Boothroyd and Dewhurst design for assembly (DFA) analysis. While the specific example model developed is generalisable only to systems similar to those in the sample set, the capability to develop mappings between physical architecture and assembly time in early-stage design is demonstrated.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0951-192X	1362-3052		WOS:000326352600006

Effect of Deformation-Induced Suction in the Behavior of Unsaturated Fine-Grained Soils Using Simplified Finite-Element Model								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS				13	5			483	495		10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0000256			OCT 1 2013	2013	Matric suction is one of the important variables used to characterize the deformation behavior of unsaturated soil. The stress-strain relationship and the governing differential equations are the two elements in which suction is incorporated in the development of mathematical models for the dynamics of unsaturated soils. In this paper, a simplified finite-element model was used to understand the effect of initial suction and deformation-induced suction variation in the static and dynamic behavior of silty and clayey soils. The simplified finite-element model was developed by neglecting the relative acceleration and velocity terms associated with water and air phases in the fully coupled governing differential equations. The stress-strain behavior of the solid skeleton was represented by linear elastic model, a simple model to explain the computed responses using basic theory. The suction-degree of saturation relationship was modeled by the Brooks and Corey model. Simulation results showed that the initial degree of saturation has significant influence on the behavior of clayey soil compared with silty soil. It is also observed that the effect of matric suction in the Bishop's effective stress equation is significant if the clay and silt are relatively soft.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1532-3641	1943-5622		WOS:000324463800001		
J	Liu, Zhifeng; Atamturktur, Sez; Juang, C. Hsein								Performance based robust design optimization of steel moment resisting frames								JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH				89				165	174		10.1016/j.jcsr.2013.07.011			OCT 2013	2013	The seismic design of steel-moment resisting frames is subjected to uncertainties originating from various sources including imprecisely known seismic load, inaccurate modeling assumptions, as well as uncertain material properties and connection behavior. These uncertainties must be considered in the structural design process to ensure that a safe design is achieved. Design codes based on reliability of performance are useful in providing safety margins for the performance objectives with quantifiable confidence levels considering various sources of uncertainties. In these design codes, although seismic demand is usually calculated with a suite of ground motions, only the median seismic demand is used in the subsequent calculation of acceptance criterion (i.e., confidence level), and variation in seismic demand is not used. In the present manuscript, the authors utilize a performance based design approach for seismic design optimization of steel moment resisting frames, where material weight, mean value of seismic demand and variation of seismic demand are treated as three design objectives representing the cost, safety and robustness measures, respectively. Through a case study application, the proposed methodology is demonstrated to be capable of providing a set of Pareto-optimal designs with competing cost, safety and robustness. The obtained Pareto front designs are utilized in the development of uniformity drift ratio as design efficiency indicator. Required uniformity drift ratio to ensure efficient designs for each range of maximum inter-story drift is suggested based on the obtained results.

However, these nanostructuring processing were conducted on compositions optimized for bulk materials (x similar to 1.52-1.55). This leads to the question of whether the optimal composition for bulk materials is the same for their nanoscale counterparts. In this work we hydrothermally grew (Bi2-xSbx)Te-3 nanopowders (nominally, x 1.46; 1.48; 1.52 and 1.55) and measured their thermoelectric properties on cold-pressed vacuum-sintered pellets (74 - 78% of the theoretical density) below 300 K. The measurements were conducted 18 months apart to probe the aging phenomena, with the samples stored in ambient conditions. We have found that (i) the peak of thermopower shifts to lower temperatures upon nanostructuring but it shifts back to higher temperatures upon aging; (ii) the electrical conductivity degrades by a factor of 1.5 - 2.3 upon aging while the temperature dependence is largely retained; and (iii) the ZT of freshly made samples is sensitive to the x value, a maximum ZT similar to 1.25(similar to 0.62) at similar to 270K (similar to 255 K) was attained in the freshly made sample x 1.55(x 1.46), respectively; while the ZT of aged samples is significantly lowered by a factor of 2 - 4 but lesser x-dependent. These observations have been discussed in the context of charge buildup and compensation at grain boundaries.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1793-6047	1793-7213		WOS:000325992600009

A MODIFIED VAN DER PAUW SETUP FOR MEASURING THE RESISTIVITY AND THERMOPOWER OF THERMOELECTRIC MATERIALS OF VARYING THICKNESSES								FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS LETTERS				6	5						10.1142/S1793604713400092			OCT 2013	2013	In the investigation of thermoelectric (TE) materials as a practical, and efficient, means of power generation/refrigeration nearly ninety percent of the possible high-efficient binary compounds have been evaluated. But only a few proved to be useful such as Bi2Te3 alloys, PbTe and SiGe to name the most important materials. Therefore, in order to expand the research of high-efficiency TE materials new compounds and methods of efficiency optimization must be explored. There currently exist a vast number of uninvestigated ternary and quaternary materials that could be potential high-efficiency thermoelectric materials. The device and methodology discussed herein deal with rapidly measuring both the electrical resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient of thermoelectric materials, at a set temperature of T approximate to 300 K. Using nontraditional resistivity measurements and rapid, room-temperature thermopower measurements, a reliable and time-efficient means of gauging the power factor (defined below) values of newly synthesized thermoelectric materials is achievable. Furthermore, the efficacy of the van der Pauw technique for measuring the resistivity of thermoelectric materials has been verified.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-6047	1793-7213		WOS:000325992600010

Similarly, colorism within African American families and the ways in which skin tone influences family processes is an understudied area of research. Using data from a longitudinal sample of African American families (n = 767), we assessed whether skin tone impacted experiences with discrimination or was related to differences in quality of parenting and racial socialization within families. Findings indicated no link between skin tone and racial discrimination, which suggests that lightness or darkness of skin does not either protect African Americans from or exacerbate the experiences of discrimination. On the other hand, families displayed preferential treatment toward offspring based on skin tone, and these differences varied by gender of child. Specifically, darker skin sons received higher quality parenting and more racial socialization promoting mistrust compared to their counterparts with lighter skin. Lighter skin daughters received higher quality parenting compared with those with darker skin. In addition, gender of child moderated the association between primary caregiver skin tone and racial socialization promoting mistrust. These results suggest that colorism remains a salient issue within African American families. Implications for future research, prevention, and intervention are discussed.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0893-3200	1939-1293		WOS:000325486600013	24040901

QUALITY AND SHELF LIFE OF FRESH CHICKEN BREASTS SUBJECTED TO CRUST FREEZING WITH AND WITHOUT SKIN								JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY				36	5			361	368		10.1111/jfq.12046			OCT 2013	2013	The effect of crust freezing (20min, -85C) on raw chicken breast quality, with or without skin, during aerobic, refrigerated storage for up to 18 days was assessed using the International Commission on Illumination color parameters L*, a* and b*; tenderness; total aerobic (aerobic plate counts [APC]) and yeasts/molds counts. Skin on had significantly higher L* values compared with skinless breasts (average 75 versus 55), whereas a* and b* remained relatively constant regardless of the presence or absence of skin, freezing or time. For a* and b*, values oscillated between -2.10-0.78 and 1.38-3.77, respectively. Shear energy varied for skinless samples but tended to remain constant throughout time for skin-on breasts. APC increased over time, exceeding 8.0log(10)cfu/mL of rinse, between 6 and 12 days of storage. Crust freezing did not affect color or tenderness of raw chicken breasts, with or without skin, but also did not extend microbiological shelf life.Practical ApplicationsRaw poultry products are susceptible to spoilage and deterioration. Several freezing applications at the commercial level claim to improve quality attributes or extend shelf life of these products. Crust freezing, where the product is semi-frozen only at superficial layers of tissue, is one such application. The current study found that crust freezing did not affect quality attributes of raw chicken breasts, with or without skin, but neither did it extend their shelf life under aerobic, refrigerated storage, based on aerobic plate count values. Although further investigation is needed, this research serves as the foundation for other studies to benefit the industry. Because crust freezing is widely accepted as a shelf life-extending treatment, the results of this study imply that the freezing method, length of the crust freeze time, and the product type and form may influence the effectiveness of crust freezing for shelf life extension.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0146-9428	1745-4557		WOS:000325268400009

Human and animal studies indicate that maternal obesity adversely programs the development of offspring, predisposing them to chronic diseases later in life. Several mechanisms act together to produce these adverse health effects. There is a consequent need for effective interventions that can be used in the management of human pregnancy to prevent these outcomes. The present review analyzes the dietary and exercise intervention studies performed to date in both altricial and precocial animals, rats and sheep, with the aim of preventing adverse offspring outcomes. The results of these interventions present exciting opportunities to prevent, at least in part, adverse metabolic and other outcomes in obese mothers and their offspring.

The upper components hide details of the lower components, and each layer presents unified and simple interfaces to the layers above and below. This design helps Linux to be flexible as well as to provide support for multiple types of storage devices. In this paper, this component architecture is used to develop a realistic simulation without having to model lower level details of the hardware layer or particular storage devices. A detailed simulation-based performance model of the Linux ext3 file system has been developed using Colored Petri Nets. The extensive validation study using the model obtains results that are close to the expected behavior of the real file system. The model demonstrates that file system parameters have a significant impact on the I/O performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1619-1366	1619-1374		WOS:000326095600007

It has been found that the PR EoS implying the WS mixing rule can be used as a reliable thermodynamic model to perform a thermodynamic consistency test on the experimental data of phase behaviors of the supercritical CO2+ionic liquid systems (19 commonly-used ionic liquids have been studied). The results show that 40% of the experimental data seem to be thermodynamically consistent, 55.5% seem to be thermodynamically inconsistent, and 4.5% seem to be not fully consistent.

Liquefaction-induced ground movements such as settlement and lateral spread are of major concern to engineers who have to evaluate seismic risk. This paper deals with evaluation of liquefaction-induced settlement using a cone penetration test (CPT). Existing CPT-based models often overestimate liquefaction-induced settlement. In this paper, a database of case histories of settlement in recent earthquakes is compiled and used to calibrate the model bias of a CPT-based model, from which a simplified procedure is developed that allows for estimation of the probability of exceeding a specified settlement at a given site. Reasonable results are obtained using the developed simplified CPT-based model, as demonstrated in the examples presented.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0008-3674	1208-6010		WOS:000325754700005

The Pb(II) complex exhibits unique features within this group of complexes in terms of its structural and spectroscopic features involving the coordinated flavonolate ligand. Similar to the Group 12 compounds, irradiation of 1 at 300 nm in an O-2-containing environment results in the quantitative release of CO and the formation of a Pb(II) O-benzoylsalicylate (O-bs, depside) complex via a photoinduced dioxygenase-type reaction. Comparison of the quantum yield for the reaction of the Pb(II) flavonolate complex (Phi = 0.21(6)) versus the reactions of the structurally-related Group 12 metal complexes (6-Ph(2)TPA)M(3-Hfl)]ClO4 (M = Hg(II) (2, Phi = 0.31(2)), Cd(II) (3, Phi = 0.28(2)), Zn(II) (4), Phi = 0. 09(1)) revealed that flavonolate complexes of a heavy metal ion (Cd(II), Hg(II), Pb(II)) exhibit a higher reaction quantum yield than the Zn(II) derivative. Both Pb(II) and Zn(II) flavonolate complexes were found to be catalysts for the oxidative photoinduced degradation of 3-hydroxyflavone. The combined results of these investigations suggest that metal contaminants typically present in soil, including toxic heavy metal ions, might facilitate the oxidative decomposition of plant-derived flavonols via photoinduced reactions.

J	Miller, Melissa K.; Peake, Jeffrey S.								Press Effects, Public Opinion, and Gender: Coverage of Sarah Palin's Vice-Presidential Campaign								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS				18	4			482	507		10.1177/1940161213495456			OCT 2013	2013	The press had great potential to influence perceptions of Sarah Palin during the 2008 campaign, given her relative obscurity when picked to be the Republican vice-presidential nominee. Prior literature on press treatment of women running for national office suggests that Palin was likely to receive coverage that disadvantaged her due to her gender. We scrutinize press coverage of Palin's campaign for evidence that she was treated differently and that these differences affected public opinion. Our sample of over 2,500 individual newspaper articles published during the campaign is paired with the 2008 National Annenberg Election Survey. We demonstrate that Palin's coverage differed in significant ways from that of her male counterpart. Her gender, appearance, and family status were disproportionately mentioned in her coverage, and such mentions tended to dampen public opinion about her. In addition, the tone of Palin's coverage was markedly negative, increasingly so over time, and was significantly related to reader opinion about her. While Palin was a unique candidate for national-level office, these findings should give pause to those concerned with equitable press treatment of women on the campaign trail.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1940-1612	1940-1620		WOS:000325646600006

Its maximum-likelihood estimators (MLEs) are very sensitive to outliers and also have no closed-form expressions. This motivates us to develop some alternative estimators. In this paper, we develop two robust estimators, which are also explicit functions of sample observations and are thus easy to compute. We derive their breakdown points and carry out extensive Monte Carlo simulation experiments to compare the performance of all the estimators under consideration. It has been observed from the simulation results that the proposed estimators outperform in a manner that is approximately comparable with the MLEs, whereas they are far superior in the presence of data contamination that often occurs in practical situations. A simple bias-reduction technique is presented to reduce the bias of the recommended estimators. Finally, the practical application of the developed procedures is illustrated with a real-data example.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0266-4763	1360-0532		WOS:000324367400011

Using the Concept-Mapping Method for Empirical Studies in Construction Research								JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT				139	10					UNSP 04013002	10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000720			OCT 1 2013	2013	The concept-mapping method has enabled research advances in medicine and psychology. This method also seems well suited for many of the questions facing construction researchers, but its use remains limited in construction research. Concept mapping helps solicit and organize ideas from experts and stakeholders. This method can be used to categorize results into various clusters that may have competing explanations or backgrounds. It also allows for comparing results among group of participants. This method integrates qualitative group tasks of idea generation, sorting, and rating with two quantitative analyses, multidimensional scaling, and cluster analysis. One of the relevant findings of using these analyses is the creation of visual maps, which can help develop action plans and frameworks. This paper is meant as a guide for applying the concept-mapping method to construction research. Although examples for using this method in construction engineering and management are presented in this paper on the basis of the development of a sustainability framework, the emphasis is on general principles to show how various construction research topics could be explored by using this method.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0733-9364	1943-7862		WOS:000325768400012

We adopt Zellner's g-prior with the beta-prime distribution for g, which results in an explicit closed-form expression of the Bayes factor without integral representation. Furthermore, we investigate the model selection consistency of the Bayes factor under three different asymptotic scenarios: either the number of units goes to infinity, the number of observations per unit goes to infinity, or both go to infinity. The results presented extend some existing ones of the Bayes factor for the balanced ANOVA models in the literature.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0233-1888	1029-4910		WOS:000324576600015

The Influence of Bleaching Agent and Temperature on Bleaching Efficacy and Volatile Components of Fluid Whey and Whey Retentate								JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				78	10			C1535	C1542		10.1111/1750-3841.12251			OCT 2013	2013	Fluid whey or retentate are often bleached to remove residual annatto Cheddar cheese colorant, and this process causes off-flavors in dried whey proteins. This study determined the impact of temperature and bleaching agent on bleaching efficacy and volatile components in fluid whey and fluid whey retentate. Freshly manufactured liquid whey (6.7% solids) or concentrated whey protein (retentate) (12% solids, 80% protein) were bleached using benzoyl peroxide (BP) at 100 mg/kg (w/w) or hydrogen peroxide (HP) at 250 mg/kg (w/w) at 5 degrees C for 16 h or 50 degrees CC for 1 h. Unbleached controls were subjected to a similar temperature profile. The experiment was replicated three times. Annatto destruction (bleaching efficacy) among treatments was compared, and volatile compounds were extracted and separated using solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS). Bleaching efficacy of BP was higher than HP (P < 0.05) for fluid whey at both 5 and 50 degrees C. HP bleaching efficacy was increased in retentate compared to liquid whey (P < 0.05). In whey retentate, there was no difference between bleaching with HP or BP at 50 or 5 degrees C (P > 0.05). Retentate bleached with HP at either temperature had higher relative abundances of pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, and octanal than BP bleached retentate (P < 0.05). Liquid wheys generally had lower concentrations of selected volatiles compared to retentates. These results suggest that the highest bleaching efficacy (within the parameters evaluated) in liquid whey is achieved using BP at 5 or 50 degrees C and at 50 degrees C with HP or BP in whey protein retentate.Practical Application Benzoyl peroxide and hydrogen peroxide are the two chemical bleaching agents approved for bleaching whey in the United States. Previous studies have shown less norbixin destruction and increased off-flavor production using HP compared to BP in liquid whey. No published studies have compared bleaching parameters of liquid whey and whey retentate. BP is an effective bleaching agent in fluid whey or retentate at 5 or 50 degrees C. In contrast, optimal bleaching with HP occurs in whey protein retentate (12% solids, 80% protein). Decreased production of lipid oxidation volatiles occurred at 5 degrees C compared to 50 degrees C with HP bleaching and suggests that HP bleaching in whey protein retentate should occur at colder temperatures (5 degrees C).									6	0	0	6	0	6			0022-1147			WOS:000325482200008	24102418

SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS				115	4			1107	1137		10.1111/sjoe.12027			OCT 2013	2013	We show that previous results from the body of literature on the resource curse have primarily been driven by the collapse in oil prices during the mid-1980s. By exploiting cross-country variations in the size of initial oil endowments and the timing of oil discoveries, we find that there is a stable positive relationship between oil abundance and long-run economic growth. Using dynamic panel data methods, we also find that there is no evidence that higher oil rents hinder growth. However, to focus on material gain means that the welfare gain from oil is understated, because oil-rich countries benefit more by the reduction in infant mortality and the gain in longevity. Interestingly, such oil-led health improvements are more pronounced in non-democratic countries, where initial heath conditions were poor and oil wealth is concentrated among the ruling elites.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0347-0520			WOS:000325009000006

J	Guha, Sujay; Cao, Min; Kane, Ryan M.; Savino, Anthony M.; Zou, Sige; Dong, Yuqing								The longevity effect of cranberry extract in Caenorhabditis elegans is modulated by daf-16 and osr-1								AGE				35	5			1559	1574		10.1007/s11357-012-9459-x			OCT 2013	2013	Nutraceuticals are known to have numerous health and disease preventing properties. Recent studies suggest that extracts containing cranberry may have anti-aging benefits. However, little is known about whether and how cranberry by itself promotes longevity and healthspan in any organism. Here we examined the effect of a cranberry only extract on lifespan and healthspan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Supplementation of the diet with cranberry extract (CBE) increased the lifespan in C. elegans in a concentration-dependent manner. Cranberry also increased tolerance of C. elegans to heat shock, but not to oxidative stress or ultraviolet irradiation. In addition, we tested the effect of cranberry on brood size and motility and found that cranberry did not influence these behaviors. Our mechanistic studies indicated that lifespan extension induced by CBE requires the insulin/IGF signaling pathway and DAF-16. We also found that cranberry promotes longevity through osmotic stress resistant-1 (OSR-1) and one of its downstream effectors, UNC-43, but not through SEK-1, a component of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. However, SIR-2.1 and JNK signaling pathways are not required for cranberry to promote longevity. Our findings suggest that cranberry supplementation confers increased longevity and stress resistance in C. elegans through pathways modulated by daf-16 and osr-1. This study reveals the anti-aging property of widely consumed cranberry and elucidates the underpinning mechanisms.									19	2	0	15	0	25			0161-9152			WOS:000324545200004	22864793

We have shown multigenerational endocrine and metabolic effects of fetal sGC exposure. We hypothesized that sGC exposure would alter the second filial generation (F2) offspring neonatal leptin peak that controls development of appetitive behavior with metabolic consequences.STUDY DESIGN: F0 nulliparous ewes were bred to a single ram. Beginning at day 103 of gestation (term 150 days), dexamethasone (DEX) ewes received 4 injections of 2 mg DEX intramuscularly, 12 hours apart. Control ewes received saline. Ewes lambed naturally. At 22 months of age, F1 offspring were mated to produce F2 offspring. At 10 months of age, F2 female offspring were placed on an ad libitum feeding challenge for 12 weeks.RESULTS: DEX F2 female offspring did not show a postnatal leptin peak and their plasma cortisol concentration was elevated in the first days of life. During the feeding challenge, DEX F2 offspring consumed 10% more feed and gained 20% more weight compared with control F2 offspring. At the end of the feeding challenge, DEX F2 offspring had greater adiposity compared with control F2 offspring. F2 sGC offspring showed impaired insulin secretion in response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test.CONCLUSION: sGC administration to F0 mothers eliminates the neonatal leptin peak in F2 female offspring potentially by inhibition caused by elevated cortisol in the DEX F2 offspring. F2 offspring showed increased appetite, weight gain, and adiposity during an ad libitum feeding challenge accompanied by decreased insulin response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0002-9378	1097-6868		WOS:000324698200020	23727517

This study evaluated the effects of reducing dietary intake of obese/overfed ewes beginning in early gestation on fetal development. Sixty days prior to conception, ewes were assigned to a control diet [CON: 100% of National Research Council (NRC) recommendations], a diet inducing maternal obesity (MO: 150% of NRC recommendations), or a maternal obesity intervention diet (MOI: 150% of NRC recommendations to day 28 of gestation, then 100% NRC) until necropsy at midgestation (day 75) or late (day 135) gestation. Fetal size and weight, as well as fetal organ weights, were greater (P < 0.05) at midgestation in MO ewes than those of CON and MOI ewes. By late gestation, whereas fetal size and weight did not differ among dietary groups, cardiac ventricular weights and wall thicknesses as well as liver and perirenal fat weights remained elevated in fetuses from MO ewes compared with those from CON and MOI ewes. MO ewes and fetuses exhibited elevated (P < 0.05) plasma concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, glucose, and cortisol at midgestation compared with CON and MOI ewes and fetuses. In late gestation, whereas plasma triglycerides and cholesterol, insulin, and cortisol remained elevated in MO vs. CON and MOI ewes and fetuses, glucose concentrations were elevated in both MO and MOI fetuses compared with CON fetuses, which was associated with elevated placental GLUT3 expression in both groups. These data are consistent with the concept that reducing maternal diet of obese/overfed ewes to requirements from early gestation can prevent subsequent alterations in fetal growth, adiposity, and glucose/insulin dynamics.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0193-1849			WOS:000325344800011	23921140

Ambient desorption/ionization mass spectrometry using a liquid sampling-atmospheric glow discharge (LS-APGD) ionization source								ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				405	25			8171	8184		10.1007/s00216-013-7216-3			OCT 2013	2013	A novel approach to ambient desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (ADI-MS) is described, based on a recently developed liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) ionization source. The device is essentially unmodified relative to its implementation in elemental mass spectrometry, where the operational space is characterized by low operation power (< 10 W) and low solution delivery rates (< 50 mu L min(-1)). In this implementation, the plasma is produced between a Ni anode and an electrolytic liquid (1 M HNO3) cathode flowing through a glass capillary that is angled towards the sample surface, at a distance of similar to 2 mm away. Analyte species can be desorbed/ionized from neat solution residues and complex solid samples. The ADI-LS-APGD source is mounted onto the source interface of a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage Max quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer without modifications to the instrument faceplate or ion optics. Described here is the initial evaluation of the roles of source geometry and working parameters, including electrolytic solution composition and plasma current, on the response of caffeine residues, with preliminary limits of detection based on the relative standard deviation of the spectral background suggested to be on the 10-pg level. Demonstrative spectra are presented for green tea extracts and raw leaves, coffee beans, a dried (raw) tobacco leaf, an analgesic tablet, and paper currency. Versatility is further revealed through the determination of components in common cigarette smoke. In each case, the spectra are characterized by (M + H)(+) species of the expected constituents. The capacity for a single source to perform both in solution and particulate elemental analysis (as shown previously) and ADI of molecular species is unique in the realm of mass spectrometry.									11	0	0	8	0	11			1618-2642	1618-2650		WOS:000324587400023	23877182

Conditioned serum-free medium from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells has anti-photoaging properties								BIOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS				35	10			1707	1714		10.1007/s10529-013-1242-2			OCT 2013	2013	Chronic exposure to solar radiation is the primary cause of photoaging and benign and malignant skin tumors. A conditioned serum-free medium (SFM) was prepared from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) and its anti-photoaging effect, following chronic UV irradiation in vitro and in vivo, was evaluated. UC-MSC SFM had a stimulatory effect on human dermal fibroblast proliferation and reduced UVA-induced cell death. In addition, UC-MSC SFM blocked UVA inhibition of superoxide dismutase activity. Topical application of UC-MSC SFM to mouse skin prior to UV irradiation blocked the inhibition of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and prevented the upregulation of malonaldehyde. UC-MSC SFM thus protects against photoaging induced by UVA and UVB radiation and is a promising candidate for skin anti-photoaging treatments.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0141-5492			WOS:000325011900022	23690049

Test results indicated that the combined oxides content of fly ash showed a better correlation with the ASR expansions than its individual oxides. Mixtures containing finer fly ash fractions registered lower expansions than those containing the corresponding virgin fly ashes or its coarser fractions.Within the usual range of average particle size of 10 to 30 microns, of fly ash, the chemical composition had a more dominant influence on ASR mitigation than the particle size. However, when the average particle size of fly ash decreases below 10 microns, the fineness of fly ash becomes significant in mitigating ASR. In addition, the fineness of fly ash had a more significant influence in mitigating ASR in mixtures containing high-lime fly ashes than those containing low-lime fly ashes. Hence, reducing the particle size of fly ash to finer fractions is an effective strategy to mitigate ASR. The decoupling of the chemical composition of fly ash from its particle size indicated that ASR mitigation can be achieved with any fly ash having a D-50 below 5 mu m. However, low-lime fly ashes were effective in mitigating ASR even without reducing their particle size. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The fine structure is wavelike with predominant horizontal wavelengths as large as about 2-3 km. We attribute the structure to a drift wave instability operating in the collisional regime. A linear, local dispersion relation for the waves is described which predicts growth driven by polarization electric fields in the cloud. A numerical simulation produces wave growth and other features consistent with the dispersion relation, including finite parallel wavenumbers. The kilometric irregularities are thought to be the primary waves from which secondary, meter-scale waves in the layers can form. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Near-continual ground-based nighttime observations of thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures over equatorial Brazil from 2009 to 2012								JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS				103		SI		94	102		10.1016/j.jastp.2012.11.019			OCT 2013	2013	We present measurements of thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures measured by two Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs) operating in northeastern Brazil, in the equatorial region, over the period of September 2009 through June 2012. The FPIs observe the Doppler shift and broadening of the nighttime 630.0-nm emission originating at altitudes of approximately 240 km. The temperatures indicate a strong dependence on solar flux conditions, as captured by the F-10.7 index, which ranged from similar to 72 to 175 solar flux units over the duration of the study. The signature of the midnight temperature maximum is seen in the data, recurring each year during the local summer months (October through February). Throughout the year, the thermospheric zonal winds show an initial increase in eastward flow after sunset followed by a reduction in the midnight and early morning hours. This reduction in the zonal flow is most rapid in the local summer months. The thermospheric meridional winds show the expected signature of trans-equatorial flow from the summer to winter hemisphere. Superposed on this during the local summer months is a time of equatorward flow during the mid-evening period, 22-23 LT, which is likely a manifestation of the semi-diurnal thermal tidal wave moving upward into the lower thermosphere region from below. The thermospheric neutral winds do not show as much of a dependence on the solar flux as the thermospheric neutral temperatures do, at least for the range of fluxes covered during the study period.

Comparisons of thermospheric wind and temperature measurements in equatorial Brazil to Whole Atmosphere Model Predictions								JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS				103		SI		103	112		10.1016/j.jastp.2013.04.002			OCT 2013	2013	The results from the Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) at 240 km are compared with measurements of equatorial thermospheric winds and temperatures acquired by nearly continual nighttime Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) measurements made in northeastern Brazil from September 2009 to August 2012. These comparisons show generally good agreement for the zonal winds with only slight differences seen in regard to the early morning period. For the evening period of 21-23 LT the observed meridional winds differed from the WAM predictions in two respects. First, while the flow direction was generally correct, the speeds of observed cross-hemispheric flow from the summer to the winter hemisphere were generally somewhat greater by 25 to 35 ms(-1) than the predicted speeds from WAM. In contrast, the observed meridional winds are found to be weaker than the WAM results for winter months for all three years. Second, although the observations and predictions both show similar timing and amplitude for a 3-h period of northward flow in September and October, the observations indicate a shift in the timing of this flow of about 1 h, from similar to 22 LT in September and October to similar to 21 LT in December. The WAM predictions show a systematic shift in phase from 21-00 LT in September to 18-21 LT in December. Regarding temperature, the WAM predictions show a midnight temperature maximum (MTM) with a peak amplitude of 50-65 K, in agreement with the observations. However, the WAM results also show a systematic shift in timing of the MTM occurrence, with the MTM peak seen at similar to 22 LT in summer and at 00 LT in winter. In contrast, the FPI monthly climatology data show the timing of the MTM peak to be 00 +/- 0.5 LT for all months except winter, when the MTM peak is not clearly evident. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The three dimensional (3-D) layered scaffold of compound I and the "zigzag" motifs of compounds II and III were found to have been created via unique hydrogen bonding patterns.

Yablo (Analysis 53(4):251-252, 1993), however, has shown that there are infinitary versions of the paradoxes that do not involve this form of circularity. It remains an open question what relations of reference between collections of sentences afford the structure necessary for paradoxicality. In this essay, we lay the groundwork for a general investigation into the nature of reference structures that support the semantic paradoxes and the semantic hypodoxes. We develop a functionally complete infinitary propositional language endowed with a denotation assignment and extract the reference structural information in terms of graph-theoretic properties. We introduce the new concepts of dangerous and precarious reference graphs, which allows us to rigorously define the task: classify the dangerous and precarious directed graphs purely in terms of their graph-theoretic properties. Ungroundedness will be shown to fully characterize the precarious reference graphs and fully characterize the dangerous finite graphs. We prove that an undirected graph has a dangerous orientation if and only if it contains a cycle, providing some support for the traditional idea that cyclic structure is required for paradoxicality. This leaves the task of classifying danger for infinite acyclic reference graphs. We provide some compactness results, which give further necessary conditions on danger in infinite graphs, which in conjunction with a notion of self-containment allows us to prove that dangerous acyclic graphs must have infinitely many vertices with infinite out-degree. But a full characterization of danger remains an open question. In the appendices we relate our results to the results given in Cook (J Symb Log 69(3):767-774, 2004) and Yablo (2006) with respect to more restricted sentences systems, which we call F-systems.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0022-3611			WOS:000324497300003

The detection limit for the method is approximately 25 mu g/L uranium, which is below the maximum contaminant level for uranium in drinking water, 30 mu g/L. The method is rapid and requires little technical training to conduct, allowing it to be used by consumers, in the laboratory, or in the field. The two-step technique involves preconcentrating uranium using a U/TEVA-2 extraction chromatographic resin followed by complexation with a pyridylazo indicator dye, 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol. If color change is visible to the eye, the concentration of uranium in groundwater is above the detection limit. Preconcentration using U/TEVA-2 also serves to eliminate metals that may interfere with the quantification of uranium.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0236-5731			WOS:000324546100053

Inhibition of SCD1 activity by sterculic acid (SA) or conjugated linoleic acid, trans-10 cis-12 isomer, (t10, c12-CLA) did not alter adipocyte cellular proliferation, viability or differentiation. In 1,2-[C-13]-acetate supplemented cells, the mass isotopomer distribution analysis showed that the fractional synthesis rate of [C-13]-16:0 was reduced (P < 0.01) in SA and t10, c12-CLA treatments compared to control. Of the lipogenic genes, t10, c12-CLA treatment decreased (P < 0.05) the expression of SCD1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase; whereas SA supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) the expression of ACC. Both SA and t10, c12-CLA increased (P < 0.05) the expression of hormone-sensitive lipase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase involved in lipolysis and oxidation. Inhibition of SCD1 in bovine adipocytes decreases de novo fatty acid synthesis by down-regulating genes involved in lipogenesis and up-regulating genes involved in lipolysis and oxidation.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0024-4201			WOS:000324638000002	23929455

Thermal tolerance ranges of larvae of three different populations of P. elegans sampled in 2011 and 2012 (Mexico [MX], El Salvador [ES], and Peru [PE]) were investigated by measuring three indicators of physiological performance: swimming activity, oxygen consumption, and lethality or LT50. The thermal tolerance profiles, which include measurable optimum (maximum aerobic performance), pejus ("getting worse") and pessimum (worst aerobic performance) ranges, of larvae from the three populations were consistent with their characteristic environmental temperatures. In MX, larvae live close to the upper border of their optimum during warm months and so have a limited capacity to tolerate higher-than-normal temperatures. Larvae from the ES population likewise appear to live within their optimum temperature range, but these larvae lack a detectable pessimum range, suggesting they would be unable to cope with temperatures above their pejus range. Larvae from PE have a broad optimum but no pejus range. Different thermal tolerance ranges provide strong evidence for population-dependent physiological adaptations in P. elegans. For the southern (PE) and northern (MX) P. elegans populations, high tropical temperatures are likely to be a strong direct physiological barrier to larval survival and dispersal, which is in contrast to the more thermally tolerant ES population.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0025-3162			WOS:000324871300017

Silver nanoparticle toxicity to Daphnia magna is a function of dissolved silver concentration								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				32	10			2356	2364		10.1002/etc.2300			OCT 2013	2013	The most persistent question regarding the toxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is whether this toxicity is due to the nanoparticles themselves or the silver ions (Ag+) they release. The present study investigates the role of surface coating and the presence of dissolved organic carbon on the toxicity of AgNPs to Daphnia magna and tests the hypothesis that the acute toxicity of AgNPs is a function of dissolved Ag produced by nanoparticle dissolution. Toxicity of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and AgNPs with surface coatingsgum arabic (AgGA), polyethylene glycol (AgPEG), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (AgPVP)at 48h was assessed in US Environmental Protection Agency moderately hard reconstituted water alone and augmented with Suwannee River dissolved organic carbon (DOC). As expected, AgNO3 was the most toxic to D. magna and AgPVPs were the least toxic. In general, Suwannee River DOC presence reduced the toxicity of AgNO3, AgGAs, and AgPEG, while the toxicity of AgPVPs was unaffected. The measured dissolved Ag concentrations for all AgNPs and AgNO3 at the 48-h median lethal concentration in moderately hard reconstituted water were similar. The presence of Suwannee River DOC decreased the ratio of measured dissolved Ag to measured total Ag concentration. These results support the hypothesis that toxicity of AgNPs to D. magna is a function of dissolved Ag concentration from these particles. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;32:2356-2364.

Seven CAD homologs (LtuCAD1 to LtuCAD7) have been previously identified from a basal angiosperm species Liriodendron tulipifera L., which is an important timber tree species with significant ecological and economic values. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that LtuCAD1 is the only Liriodendron CAD grouped with the bona fide CADs, the primary CAD genes involved in lignification. In this study, the predicted protein sequence of LtuCAD1 was found to have conserved domains and the same key determinant site with the bona fide CADs in other plant species. Additionally, LtuCAD1 had the highest expression level in xylem as revealed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by the LtuCAD1 promoter was largely localized in vascular tissues in Arabidopsis. In stem cross sections, GUS staining was found exclusively in xylem and phloem. When expressed in the Arabidopsis cad4 cad5 double mutant, LtuCAD1 was able to restore the total lignin content and decrease the S/G lignin ratio. Our data indicate that LtuCAD1 is a CAD ortholog involved in lignin biosynthesis in Liriodendron.									2	2	0	1	0	4			0735-9640			WOS:000323669900004

Multiphysics Modeling and Simulations of Mil A46100 Armor-Grade Martensitic Steel Gas Metal Arc Welding Process								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				22	10			2950	2969		10.1007/s11665-013-0583-2			OCT 2013	2013	A multiphysics computational model has been developed for the conventional Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) joining process and used to analyze butt-welding of MIL A46100, a prototypical high-hardness armor martensitic steel. The model consists of five distinct modules, each covering a specific aspect of the GMAW process, i.e., (a) dynamics of welding-gun behavior; (b) heat transfer from the electric arc and mass transfer from the electrode to the weld; (c) development of thermal and mechanical fields during the GMAW process; (d) the associated evolution and spatial distribution of the material microstructure throughout the weld region; and (e) the final spatial distribution of the as-welded material properties. To make the newly developed GMAW process model applicable to MIL A46100, the basic physical-metallurgy concepts and principles for this material have to be investigated and properly accounted for/modeled. The newly developed GMAW process model enables establishment of the relationship between the GMAW process parameters (e.g., open circuit voltage, welding current, electrode diameter, electrode-tip/weld distance, filler-metal feed speed, and gun travel speed), workpiece material chemistry, and the spatial distribution of as-welded material microstructure and properties. The predictions of the present GMAW model pertaining to the spatial distribution of the material microstructure and properties within the MIL A46100 weld region are found to be consistent with general expectations and prior observations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000326455600017

Specifically, a modification to the process recently developed to produce longitudinally-graded optical fibers, LGFs [Opt. Express 20 (2012) 17394-17402], was employed. Herein reported are MCVD-derived germanosilicate fibers with rectangular cores where the aspect ratio changes by nearly 200% and the average refractive index changed by about 5%. Fiber losses were measured to be about 50 dB/km. Such rectangular core fibers are useful for a variety of telecommunication and biomedical applications and the dimensional and optical chirp provides a deterministic way to control further the modal properties of the fiber.

Although these two factors and their interaction have been studied across species in continent-scale experiments, few researchers have studied how labile and recalcitrant compounds interact to influence decomposition, or the climate sensitivity of decomposition, within a litter type.Over a period of 3 yr, we studied the effects of warming and altered precipitation on mass loss and compound-specific decomposition using two litter types that possessed similar heteropolymer chemistry, but different proportions of labile and recalcitrant compounds.Climate treatments immediately affected the mass loss of the more recalcitrant litter, but affected the more labile litter only after 2 yr. After 3 yr, although both litter types had lost similar amounts of mass, warming (c. 4 degrees C) and supplemental precipitation (150% of ambient) together accelerated the degradation of alkyl-carbon and lignin only in the more recalcitrant litter, highlighting the role of initial litter quality in determining whether the chemistry of litter residues converges or diverges under different climates. Our finding that labile compounds in litter reduce the climate sensitivity of mass loss and the decomposition of recalcitrant matrix is novel.Our results highlight the potential for litter quality to regulate the effect of climatic changes on the sequestration of litter-derived carbon.									15	0	0	13	0	15			1469-8137			WOS:000323475000015	23822593

The objectives of this study were to develop a method to study these combined effects under widely varying protein-protein interaction conditions using hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) adsorbed on silica glass, poly(methyl methacrylate), and polyethylene as our model systems. In order to vary protein-protein interaction effects over a wide range, HEWL was first adsorbed to each surface type under widely varying protein solution concentrations for 2 h to saturate the surface, followed by immersion in pure buffer solution for 15 h to equilibrate the adsorbed protein layers in the absence of additionally adsorbing protein. Periodic measurements were made at selected time points of the areal density of the adsorbed protein layer as an indicator of the level of protein-protein interaction effects within the layer, and these values were then correlated with measurements of the adsorbed protein's secondary structure and bioactivity. The results from these studies indicate that protein-protein interaction effects help stabilize the structure of HEWL adsorbed on silica glass, have little influence on the structural behavior of HEWL on HDPE, and actually serve to destabilize HEWL's structure on PMMA. The bioactivity of HEWL on silica glass and HDPE was found to decrease in direct proportion to the degree of adsorption-induce protein unfolding. A direct correlation between bioactivity and the conformational state of adsorbed HEWL was less apparent on PMMA, thus suggesting that other factors influenced HEWL's bioactivity on this surface, such as the accessibility of HEWL's bioactive site being blocked by neighboring proteins or the surface itself. The developed methods provide an effective means to characterize the influence of protein-protein interaction effects and provide new molecular-level insights into how protein-protein interaction effects combine with protein-surface interaction and internal protein stability effects to influence the structure and bioactivity of adsorbed protein.

In the present work, incoherent light source based photo-assisted metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) has been used to prepare CCTO thin films on Si/SiO2 substrates. Key to this unique processing technique is the use of UV radiation as an additional source of energy in conjunction to the thermal energy. The given Photo-assisted MOCVD processing resulted in polycrystalline CCTO growth on a SiO2 surface. Powder X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were performed to analyze structural and compositional properties of the CCTO thin film. Ellipsometric measurements indicated a refractive index of 3.03 for the CCTO thin film. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									5	1	0	0	0	5			1369-8001			WOS:000322054200016

Multi-physics modeling of the fabrication and dynamic performance of all-metal auxetic-hexagonal sandwich-structures								MATERIALS & DESIGN				51				113	130		10.1016/j.matdes.2013.04.004			OCT 2013	2013	In the present paper, various computational methods and tools are used to investigate the effect of the prior processing and the resulting microstructure on the performance of all-metal sandwich-structures with an auxetic-hexagonal core. Specific fabrication processes analyzed in the present work include: (a) sheet-metal fabrication using cold flat rolling; (b) a simple stamping process used to impart the desired corrugation to the as-cold rolled sheet-metal blanks; and (c) laser welding used to join the corrugated and stacked adjacent blanks over their areas of contact. The computational analyses employed yielded the results which clearly revealed how each of the three fabrication processes affects the grain microstructure of the sheet-metal blanks, the presence of residual stresses within the sandwich-structure as well as the presence of distortions. In the last portion of the present work, a series of transient nonlinear dynamics finite-element computational analyses is carried out in order to demonstrate how the prior fabrication processes and the material microstructure, residual stresses and distortions yielded by them affects the dynamic performance of the all-metal auxetic sandwich-structures subjected to blast loading. The results obtained clearly showed that the effect of prior processing must be taken into account in order to obtain accurate insight into the dynamic response of sandwich structures when subjected to blast loading.

Apart from van der Waals force, dipole-dipole, induced dipole-dipole, and hydrogen-bonding donor-acceptor interactions exist between aromatic compounds (AOCs) and activated carbons. Correlations between the solubility normalized Freundlich affinity coefficients (K-Fs) of six AOCs on four activated carbons and the linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) variables of the AOCs were established. The modeling results demonstrate that the LSER model could be applied to predict the adsorption of AOCs on the activated carbons with K-Fs as a measure of the relative interaction strengths between the adsorbents and the adsorbates. Although derived from the properties of the adsorbates, the LSER modeling parameters were correlated with the surface chemistry of the studied activated carbons, suggesting that the LSER models could also reflect the natures of the adsorbents.

Energy harvesting under combined aerodynamic and base excitations								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				332	20			5086	5102		10.1016/j.jsv.2013.04.009			SEP 30 2013	2013	This paper investigates the transduction of a piezoaeroelastic energy harvester under the combination of vibratory base excitations and aerodynamic loadings. The harvester which consists of a rigid airfoil supported by nonlinear flexural and torsional springs is placed in an incompressible air flow and subjected to a harmonic base excitation in the plunge direction. Under this combined loading, the airfoil undergoes complex motions which strain a piezoelectric element producing a voltage across an electric load. To capture the qualitative behavior of the harvester, a five-dimensional lumped-parameter model which adopts nonlinear quasi-steady aerodynamics is used. A center manifold reduction is implemented to reduce the full model into one nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equation. The normal form of the reduced system is then derived to study slow modulation of the response amplitude and phase near the flutter instability. Below the flutter speed, the response of the harvester is observed to be always periodic with the air flow serving to amplify the influence of the base excitation on the response by reducing the effective stiffness of the system, and hence, increasing the RMS output power. Beyond the flutter speed, two distinct regions are observed. The first occurs when the base excitation is small and/or when the excitation frequency is not close to the frequency of the self-sustained oscillations induced by the flutter instability. In this case, the response of the harvester is two-period quasiperiodic with amplitude modulation due to the presence of two incommensurate frequencies in the response. This amplitude modulation reduces the RMS output power. In the second region, the amplitude of excitation is large enough to eliminate the quasiperiodic response by causing the two frequencies to lock into each other. In this region, the response becomes periodic and the output power increases exhibiting little dependence on the base excitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

(Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), a promising parasitoid of the invasive Madeira mealybug, Phenacoccus madeirensis Green (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), is described based on material collected from India. This parasitoid was identified as Anagyrus sp. nov. nr. sinope Noyes & Menezes in recent literature, and was initially collected in Georgia, USA. It was found to be a specific parasitoid of the Madeira mealybug and its biological attributes and potential as a biological control agent of this pest were studied. In what appears to be a case of fortuitous introduction, we detected this parasitoid in large numbers on Madeira mealybugs from the southern Indian state of Karnataka, where the mealybug is a recently introduced invasive pest. In view of its economic importance as a potential biological control agent of the Madeira mealybug, it is formally described and illustrated here. Comparative accounts of the new species vis-a-vis its close relatives in India and the Americas are provided.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1175-5326			WOS:000324801900006	26176096

Tigers (Panthera tigris) are globally endangered and their populations are highly fragmented and exist in a few isolated metapopulations across their range. We used multi-locus genotypic data from 273 individual tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) from four tiger populations of the Satpura-Maikal landscape of central India to determine whether the corridors in this landscape are functional. This 45 000 km(2) landscape contains 17% of India's tiger population and 12% of its tiger habitat. We applied Bayesian and coalescent-based analyses to estimate contemporary and historical gene flow among these populations and to infer their evolutionary history. We found that the tiger metapopulation in central India has high rates of historical and contemporary gene flow. The tests for population history reveal that tigers populated central India about 10 000 years ago. Their population sub-division began about 1000 years ago and accelerated about 200 years ago owing to habitat fragmentation, leading to four spatially separated populations. These four populations have been in migration-drift equilibrium maintained by high gene flow. We found the highest rates of contemporary gene flow in populations that are connected by forest corridors. This information is highly relevant to conservation practitioners and policy makers, because deforestation, road widening and mining are imminent threats to these corridors.									24	2	0	18	0	25			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000330319800015	23902910

The results show that in nanopores wetted by RTILs a gradual dewetting transition occurs upon increasing the applied voltage, which is accompanied by a sharp increase in ionic current. These phenomena originate from the solvent-free nature of RTILs and are in stark contrast with the transport of conventional electrolytes through nanopores. Amplification is possible by controlling the properties of the nanopore and RTILs, and we show that it is especially pronounced in charged nanopores. The results highlight the unique physics of nonequilibrium transport of RTILs in confined geometries and point to potential experimental approaches for manipulating ionic transport in nanopores, which can benefit diverse techniques including nanofluidic circuitry and nanopore analytics.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1948-7185			WOS:000330018700016

Abiotic and Biotic Factors That Influence the Bioavailability of Gold Nanoparticles to Aquatic Macrophytes								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				47	18			10223	10230		10.1021/es4020508			SEP 17 2013	2013	This research identified and characterized factors that influenced nanomaterial bioavailability to three aquatic plants: Azolla caroliniana Willd, Egeria densa Planch., and Myriophyllum simulans Orch. Plants were exposed to 4-, 18-, and 30-nm gold nanoparticles. Uptake was influenced by nanoparticle size, the presence of roots on the plant, and dissolved organic carbon in the media. Statistical analysis of the data also revealed that particle uptake was influenced by a 4-way (plant species, plant roots, particle size, and dissolved organic carbon) interaction suggesting nanoparticle bioavailability was a complex result of multiple parameters. Size and species dependent absorption was observed that was dependent on the presence of roots and nanoparticle size. The presence of dissolved organic carbon was found to associate with 4- and 18-nm gold nanoparticles in suspension and form a nanoparticle/organic matter complex that resulted in (1) minimized particle aggregation and (2) a decrease of nanoparticle absorption by the aquatic plants. The same effect was not observed with the 30-nm nanoparticle treatment. These results indicate that multiple factors, both biotic and abiotic, must be taken into account when predicting bioavailability of nanomaterials to aquatic plants.									8	0	0	6	0	8			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000330096000021	23947987

On the stick-slip dynamics in ultrasonic additive manufacturing								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				332	19			4680	4695		10.1016/j.jsv.2013.04.007			SEP 16 2013	2013	Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) is a promising additive manufacturing process used to build complex structures by joining thin metal films. Layers of metal foil are joined by being compressed under moderate pressure using a rolling ultrasonic horn which vibrates at a high frequency in a direction transverse to the rolling motion. Foil-foil interfacial motion combined with moderate heating and pressure results in pure metal contact which causes atomic bonding. Unfortunately, large scale implementation of the UAM process is impeded by the presence of a range of build heights within which bonding between a new foil and the build feature cannot be initiated. This paper simplifies the UAM process into a lumped-parameter dry-friction oscillator and shows that complex stick-slip motions of the build feature near or above its resonance frequency are responsible for bond degradation. Specifically, as the height of the feature increases and its first modal frequency approaches the excitation frequency of the sonotrode, the relative motions between the tape and the feature become either pure stick or aperiodic. Pure stick responses, where the tape and the feature stick together, prevent interfacial motions necessary for bonding. Aperiodic motions, on the other hand, consist of slip trajectories interrupted by long stick intervals resulting in velocity bursts and nonuniform energy distribution at the interface. The adopted model and associated analysis also indicate that periodic uniform responses essential for bonding are always recovered once the critical build height is surpassed. These findings corroborate previous experimental results that demonstrate bonding is hard to initiate near or slightly below the problematic height but can be reinitiated above it.

It is caused by a significant decrease or loss of spermine synthase (SMS) activity. Here, we report a new missense mutation, p.Y328C (c.1084AG), in SMS in a family with XLID. The affected males available for evaluation had mild ID, speech and global delay, an asthenic build, short stature with long fingers and mild kyphosis. The spermine/spermidine ratio in lymphoblasts was 0.53, significantly reduced compared with normal (1.87 average). Activity analysis of SMS in the index patient failed to detect any activity above background. In silico modeling demonstrated that the Y328C mutation has a significant effect on SMS stability, resulting in decreased folding free energy and larger structural fluctuations compared with those of wild-type SMS. The loss of activity was attributed to the increase in conformational dynamics in the mutant which affects the active site geometry, rather than preventing dimer formation. Taken together, the biochemical and in silico studies confirm the p.Y328C mutation in SMS is responsible for the patients having a mild form of SRS and reveal yet another molecular mechanism resulting in a non-functional SMS causing SRS.									13	0	0	10	0	13			0964-6906			WOS:000323582000014	23696453

Jin, Jianyong/0000-0002-5521-6277			Formation and characterization of perfluorocyclobutyl polymer thin films								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				129	6			3226	3236		10.1002/app.39048			SEP 15 2013	2013	Perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) polymers are a new class of materials that show promise as selective layer materials in the development of composite membranes for gas separations, such as carbon dioxide/methane (pure gas = 38.6) and oxygen/nitrogen (pure gas = 4.8) separations. In many of the flat sheet applications, a thin film of the selective layer that is free of major defects must be coated onto a support membrane. A focus of this study was to elucidate the impacts of solvents, polymer concentration, and dip-coating withdrawal speed on PFCB thin film thickness and uniformity. An extension was proposed to the Landau-Levich model to estimate the polymer film thickness. The results show that the extended model fits the thickness-withdrawal speed data well above about 55 mm/min, but, at lower withdrawal speeds, the data deviated from the model. This deviation could be explained by the phenomenon of polymer surface excess. Static surface excesses of polymer solutions were estimated by applying the Gibbs adsorption equation using measured surface tension data. Prepared films were characterized by ellipsometry. Refractive index was found to increase with decreasing film thickness below about 50 nm, indicating densification of ultrathin films prepared from PFCB solutions below the overlap concentration. Atomic force microscopy was used to characterize surface morphologies. Films prepared from tetrahydrofuran and chloroform yielded uniform nanolayers. However, films prepared using acetone as solvent yielded a partial dewetting pattern, which could be explained by a surface depletion layer of pure solvent between the bulk PFCB/acetone solution and the substrate.

Upon introduction into physiological environments and driven by energetics, nanomaterials readily associate proteins forming a protein corona (PC) on their surface. This PC influences the nanomaterial's surface characteristics and may impact their interaction with cells. To determine the biological impact of nanomaterial exposure as well as nanotherapeutic applications, it is necessary to understand PC formation. Utilizing a label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we examined the composition of the PC for a set of four silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) including citrate-stabilized and polyvinlypyrrolidone-stabilized (PVP) colloidal silver (20 or 110 nm diameter). To simulate cell culture conditions, AgNPs were incubated for 1 h in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, washed, coronal proteins solubilized, and proteins identified and quantified by label-free LC-MS/MS. To determine which attributes influence PC formation, the AgNPs were characterized in both water and cell culture media with 10% FBS. All AgNPs associated a common subset of 11 proteins including albumin, apolipoproteins, keratins, and other serum proteins. 110 nm citrate-and PVP-stabilized AgNPs were found to bind the greatest number of proteins (79 and 85 respectively) compared to 20 nm citrate-and PVP-stabilized AgNPs (45 and 48 respectively), suggesting a difference in PC formation based on surface curvature. While no relationships were found for other protein parameters (isoelectric point or aliphatic index), the PC on 20 nm AgNPs (PVP and citrate) consisted of more hydrophobic proteins compared to 110 nm AgNPs implying that this class of proteins are more receptive to curvature-induced folding and crowding in exchange for an increased hydration in the aqueous environment. These observations demonstrate the significance of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in the formation of the PC which may have broad biological and toxicological implications.									39	1	0	22	0	40			1932-6203			WOS:000326405300148	24040142

The photophysical properties of the molecules were investigated, including UV/vis absorption, photoluminescence emission, and fluorescence quantum yields. Photophysical properties of chromophores 2 were found to exhibit significant solvatochromic effects, especially in the Stokes shift and photoluminescence maxima. The electrochemical properties of series 2 were also assessed by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. Results of photophysical and electrochemical analyses were further supported by DFT calculations (B3LYP/6-31G*) and single crystal X-ray diffraction on select molecules. The contributions of intermolecular pi-stacking and hydrogen bonding to crystal packing are discussed. A series of nine 1,4-distyrylphenylene derivatives (3) were also synthesised and similarly characterized for comparison to photophysical and solvatochromic effects observed in series 2. Properties of similarly-substituted molecules in series 2 and 3 were compared to one another in order to assess the influence of the 1,4-fluorenylene unit.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1477-0520	1477-0539		WOS:000323141800006	23863862

Copper catalysis is not required, and mechanistic considerations suggest that the reaction is proceeding by a conjugate addition pathway rather than by a pathway involving 1,2-addition to an intermediate pyridinium ion. TMSCl-mediated conjugate addition of Grignard reagents to 2-substituted-2,3-dihydropyridones gives the trans-2,6-disubstitued piperidinones stereoselectively, while cuprate reagents give either the trans or cis diastereomers or mixtures.									8	0	0	4	0	8			0022-3263			WOS:000330159300024	23937057

Currently, convection-limited electropolishing (CLE) is extensively used. Nanosharp probes are produced by electrochemically etching a wire until it breaks into two pieces. This process is difficult to control because of the complexity of the associated hydrodynamic flows. We introduce transport-limited electropolishing (TLE), where the electrochemical reaction results in the formation of metal oxides and hydroxides which form a porous surface layer hindering the flow of electrolyte. The developed TLE method enables one to make long tapered needles. The taper can spread over more than 6 mm while the radius of tip curvature can be decreased down to 30 nm. These needles are strong and were successfully applied for piercing single smooth vascular muscle cells.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000323136000015	23924892

Diabetes risk was applied to a simulated population. Age, natality and BMI were assigned to women according to race-and age-specific US Census, Natality and National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) data, respectively.Results: From 1980-2008, estimated GDM prevalence increased from 4.11% to 6.80% [2.68% (95% CI 2.58%-2.78%)] and from 3.96% to 6.43% [2.47% (95% CI 2.39%-2.55%)] in NHW and NHB women, respectively. In NHW women prepregnancy diabetes prevalence increased 0.90% (95% CI 0.85%-0.95%) from 0.95% in 1980 to 1.85% in 2008. In NHB women from 1980 through 2008 estimated prepregnancy diabetes prevalence increased 1.51% (95% CI 1.44%-1.57%), from 1.66% to 3.16%.Conclusions: Racial disparities in diabetes prevalence during pregnancy appear to stem from a higher prevalence of prepregnancy diabetes, but not GDM, in NHB than NHW.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000324481600077	24039941

We show that the desolvation barriers present in the potential of mean force between the solutes in bulk water are significantly reduced near an extended hydrophobic surface. Correspondingly, the kinetics of hydrophobic contact formation and breakage are faster near a hydrophobic surface than near a hydrophilic surface or in the bulk. We propose that the reduction in the disolvation barrier is a consequence of the fact that water near extended hydrophobic surfaces is akin to that at a liquid-vapor interface and is easily displaced. We support this proposal with three independent observations. First, when small hydrophobic solutes are brought near a hydrophobic surface; they induce local dewetting, thereby facilitating the reduction of disolvation barriers. Second, our results and those of Patel et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011, 108, 17678-17683) show that, whereas the association of small solutes in bulk water is driven by entropy, that near hydrophobic surfaces is driven by enthalpy, suggesting that the physics of interface deformation is important. Third, moving water away from its vapor-liquid coexistence, by applying hydrostatic pressure, leads to recovery of bulklike signatures (e.g., the presence of a desolvation barrier and an entropic driving force) in the association of solutes. These observations for simple solutes also translate to end-to-end contact formation in a model peptide with hydrophobic end groups, for which lowering of the desolvation barrier and acceleration of contact formation are observed near a hydrophobic surface. Our results suggest that extended hydrophobic surfaces, such as air-water or hydrocarbon-water surface, could serve as excellent platforms for catalyzing hydrophobically driven assembly.									14	0	0	2	0	14			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000326126900021	23906438

Experimental studies were conducted for P-25 and K-1100 mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers whose conductivity values bracket almost two orders of magnitude (approximate to 10 and 1000W/mK). Experimentally determined fiber thermal conductivity values were generally consistent with those cited in the literature after appropriate corrections were applied to account for the extremely high conductivity (low thermal resistance) of highly graphitic fibers, relative to the graphite coating. Finite element analysis was used to simulate heat flow patterns that may occur in a uniaxial fiber-polymer composite due to the large differences in the thermal conductivities of carbon fibers and polymer matrices. Simulations reveal that fiber thermal conductivity is accurately determined from composite response for high volume fraction of fibers (0.6) regardless of fiber conductivity, or for lower conductivity fibers (10-100W/mK) regardless of volume fractions. However, for composites containing high thermal conductivity fibers (100-1000W/mK) at low volume fractions (0.2), fiber thermal conductivity may not be accurately determined due to transverse heat flow within the graphite layers that channel heat through the highly conductive fiber. Thus, under certain conditions, heat flow paths deviate from the one-dimensional heat flow assumption inherent to laser flash analysis and rule-of-mixtures.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0021-9983			WOS:000322882400009

Expansion of Mesenchymal Stem Cells under Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide								BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS				29	5			1298	1306		10.1002/btpr.1782			SEP 2013	2013	Stem cells are needed for an increasing number of scientific applications, including both fundamental research and clinical disease treatment. To meet this rising demand, improved expansion methods to generate high quantities of high quality stem cells must be developed. Unfortunately, the bicarbonate buffering system - which relies upon an elevated CO2 environment - typically used to maintain pH in stem cell cultures introduces several unnecessary limitations in bioreactor systems. In addition to artificially high dissolved CO2 levels negatively affecting cell growth, but more importantly, the need to sparge CO2 into the system complicates the ability to control culture parameters. This control is especially important for stem cells, whose behavior and phenotype is highly sensitive to changes in culture conditions such as dissolved oxygen and pH. As a first step, this study developed a buffer to support expansion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) under an atmospheric CO2 environment in static cultures. MSC expanded under atmospheric CO2 with this buffer achieved equivalent growth rates without adaptation compared to those grown in standard conditions and also maintained a stem cell phenotype, self-renewal properties, and the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages after expansion.

Dimensions of critical care nursing : DCCN				32	5			266	70		10.1097/DCC.0b013e3182a077cd			2013 Sep-Oct	2013	INTRODUCTION: Delirium continues to be a major issue in intensive care units (ICUs). Sedation and lack of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep could be important factors in the development of delirium. Improper sedation may interfere with a patient's sleep pattern, specifically time spent in REM sleep, and could be a contributor to the development of delirium. The research team has discovered through this pilot study that there is a possible correlation between sedation, disruptions, and sleep. The goal of our research was to determine the relationship between these variables using a sleep monitor to capture actual sleep activity compared with patient characteristics and real-time activity in the ICU environment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a pilot study of 7 new patients, aged 65 years or older, who were intubated and sedated. Data on patient sleep cycles were collected using a wireless sleep monitor. A time sheet was placed outside each room to record time and type of interruption during nighttime hours (9 PM-6 AM). The patients were observed for 1 to 7 nights dependent on their length of stay in the ICU.RESULTS: Preliminary results demonstrated that, on average, between 9 PM and 6 AM, 48% remained awake (range, 8%-88%), 30% were in light sleep (range, 2%-50%), 18.5% were in REM (range, 2%-60%), and 3.4% were in a deep sleep (range, 0%-9%). Subject 1 remained awake 52% to 88% of the time during the entire admission of 7 days, had an Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score of 5, and had a self-extubation; sedation ordered was Versed as needed. Subject 5 had no interventions done between 12 midnight and 4:50 AM, with the exception of turning once, and had an REM recorded of 60% on 1 night, which equals to 4 hours 49 minutes of rest. All patients with the exception of 1 were on fentanyl and Versed drips with varying dose adjustments throughout their admission.IMPLICATIONS: Preliminary results show that there is a relationship between lack of REM sleep and delirium.

International journal of medical informatics				82	9			854	63		10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2013.04.008			2013-Sep	2013	PURPOSE: Ethical and legal requirements for healthcare providers in the United States, stipulate that patients sign a consent form prior to undergoing medical treatment or participating in a research study. Currently, the majority of the hospitals obtain these consents using paper-based forms, which makes patient preference data cumbersome to store, search and retrieve. To address these issues, Health Sciences of South Carolina (HSSC), a collaborative of academic medical institutions and research universities in South Carolina, is developing an electronic consenting system, the Research Permissions Management System (RPMS). This article reports the findings of a study conducted to investigate the efficacy of the two proposed interfaces for this system - an iPad-based and touchscreen-based by comparing them to the paper-based and Topaz-based systems currently in use.METHODS: This study involved 50 participants: 10 hospital admission staff and 40 patients. The four systems were compared with respect to the time taken to complete the consenting process, the number of errors made by the patients, the workload experienced by the hospital staff and the subjective ratings of both patients and staff on post-test questionnaires.RESULTS: The results from the empirical study indicated no significant differences in the time taken to complete the tasks. More importantly, the participants found the new systems more usable than the conventional methods with the registration staff experiencing the least workload in the iPad and touchscreen-based conditions and the patients experiencing more privacy and control during the consenting process with the proposed electronic systems. In addition, they indicated better comprehension and awareness of what they were signing using the new interfaces.DISCUSSION: The results indicate the two methods proposed for capturing patient consents are at least as effective as the conventional methods, and superior in several important respects. While more research is needed, these findings suggest the viability of cautious adoption of electronic consenting systems, especially because these new systems appear to address the challenge of identifying the participants required for the complex research being conducted as the result of advances in the biomedical sciences.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1872-8243		MEDLINE:23757370	23757370	
J	Liu, Xiaoling; Tan, Tianwu; Falta, Ronald W.; Murdoch, Lawrence C.								Experimental method for characterizing CVOC removal from fractured clays during boiling								JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY				152				44	59		10.1016/j.jconhyd.2013.06.006			SEP 2013	2013	Conventional remediation methods that rely on contact with contaminants can be ineffective in fractured media, but thermal methods of remediation involving CVOC stripping at boiling temperature show promise. However, limited experimental data are available to characterize thermal remediation because of challenges associated with high temperature. This research reports an experimental method using uniformly contaminated clay packed into two types of experimental cells, a rigid-wall stainless steel tube and a flexible-wall Teflon tube in a pressurized chamber. Both tubes are 5 cm in diameter and approximately 25 cm long. This laboratory apparatus was developed as a 1D physical model for contaminant transport in a cylindrical matrix towards a fracture, which is represented by one end of the cylinder and serves as the outlet of vapor and contaminant. The clay was contaminated with dissolved 12-dichloroethane (DCA) and bromide, and the columns were heated to more than 100 degrees C and then the top end was depressurized to atmospheric pressure to induce boiling. The outflow was condensed and analyzed for contaminant mass. The flexible-wall cell was confined to 100 kPa (gage), allowing equilibrium boiling temperatures of approximately 120 degrees C to be maintained. The clay was sampled before and after heating and extracted to determine the DCA distribution along the length of the column. During a typical test in the rigid-wall cell, internal temperatures and pressures along the column during heating reached the saturated vapor pressure curve. DCA concentrations in the recovered condensate were up to 12 times of the initial pore concentration in the clay. Less than 5% of non-volatile bromide was recovered. Significant removal of DCA and water occurred along the entire length of the clay column. This suggests that boiling was occurring in the clay matrix. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Epigonal Conditioned Media from Bonnethead Shark, Sphyrna tiburo, Induces Apoptosis in a T-Cell Leukemia Cell Line, Jurkat E6-1								MARINE DRUGS				11	9			3224	3257		10.3390/md11093224			SEP 2013	2013	Representatives of Subclass Elasmobranchii are cartilaginous fish whose members include sharks, skates, and rays. Because of their unique phylogenetic position of being the most primitive group of vertebrates to possess all the components necessary for an adaptive immune system, the immune regulatory compounds they possess may represent the earliest evolutionary forms of novel compounds with the potential for innovative therapeutic applications. Conditioned medium, generated from short term culture of cells from the epigonal organ of bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo), has been shown to have potent reproducible cytotoxic activity against a variety of human tumor cell lines in vitro. Existing data suggest that epigonal conditioned medium (ECM) exerts this cytotoxic activity through induction of apoptosis in target cells. This manuscript describes apoptosis induction in a representative tumor cell line, Jurkat E6-1, in response to treatment with ECM at concentrations of 1 and 2 mg/mL. Data indicate that ECM exposure initiates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis through activation of caspase enzymes. Future purification of ECM components may result in the isolation of an immune-regulatory compound with potential therapeutic benefit for treatment of human cancer.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1660-3397			WOS:000328621900008	24065163

Toward this goal, multiple studies have considered candidate genes and discovered quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with total biomass accumulation and/or grain production in bioenergy grass species including maize and sorghum. However, very little research has been focused on genes associated with increased biomass conversion efficiency. In this study, Trichoderma viride fungal cellulase hydrolysis activity was measured for lignocellulosic biomass (leaf and stem tissue) obtained from individuals in a F-5 recombinant inbred Sorghum bicolor x Sorghum propinquum mapping population. A total of 49 QTLs (20 leaf, 29 stem) were associated with enzymatic conversion efficiency. Interestingly, six high-density QTL regions were identified in which four or more QTLs overlapped. In addition to enzymatic conversion efficiency QTLs, two QTLs were identified for biomass crystallinity index, a trait which has been shown to be inversely correlated with conversion efficiency in bioenergy grasses. The identification of these QTLs provides an important step toward identifying specific genes relevant to increasing conversion efficiency of bioenergy feedstocks. DNA markers linked to these QTLs could be useful in marker-assisted breeding programs aimed at increasing overall bioenergy yields concomitant with selection of high total biomass genotypes.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0040-5752			WOS:000323671100014	23836384

A total of $ 67.3 million has been invested in this effort to date. The goal of the SFI is to improve the health status of medically underserved patient populations. It remains the sole capital improvement effort of its kind and has been in continuous implementation since 1991. The SFI consists of predesign needs assessment, analysis of alternate site planning options, historic preservation options in the adaptation of noteworthy community civic resources to healthcare uses, and the postoccupancy assessment of completed capital improvements with the aim of learning positive lessons that can be carried into future efforts. It is based on advocacy and guided by a statewide public health agency. The discussion is centered on a status report on a 21-year period and is examined critically from the perspective of key stakeholders.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1078-4659	1550-5022		WOS:000330445400002	23892383

J	Aiello, Brett R.; Blob, Richard W.; Butcher, Michael T.								Correlation of Muscle Function and Bone Strain in the Hindlimb of the River Cooter Turtle (Pseudemys concinna)								JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY				274	9			1060	1069		10.1002/jmor.20162			SEP 2013	2013	During terrestrial locomotion, limb muscles must generate mechanical work and stabilize joints against the ground reaction force. These demands can require high force production that imposes substantial loads on limb bones. To better understand how muscle contractile function influences patterns of bone loading in terrestrial locomotion, and refine force platform equilibrium models used to estimate limb bone safety factors, we correlated in vivo recordings of femoral strain with muscle activation and strain in a major propulsive hindlimb muscle, flexor tibialis internus (FTI), of a species with a published model of hindlimb force production (river cooter turtles, Pseudemys concinna). Electromyography (EMG) recordings indicate FTI activity prior to footfall that continues through approximately 50% of the stance phase. Large EMG bursts occur just after footfall when the muscle has reached its maximum length and is beginning to actively shorten, concurrent with increasing compressive strain on the anterior femur. The FTI muscle shortens through 35% of stance, with mean fascicle shortening strains reaching 14.0 +/- 5.4% resting length (L-0). At the time of peak compressive strains on the femur, the muscle fascicles remain active, but fascicles typically lengthen until mid-stance as the knee extends. Influenced by the activity of the dorsal knee extensor femorotibialis, the FTI muscle continues to passively lengthen simultaneously with knee extension and a shift to tensile axial strain on the anterior femur at approximately 40% of stance. The near coincidence in timing of peak compressive bone strain and peak muscle shortening (5.4 +/- 4.1% stance) indicates a close correlation between the action of the hip extensor/knee flexor, FTI, and femoral loading in the cooter hindlimb. In the context of equilibrium models of limb bone loading, these results may help explain differences in safety factor estimates observed between previous force platform and in vivo strain analyses in cooters.

Remote Technical Support Requires Diagnosing the End User (Customer) as well as the Computer								HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION				28	5			442	477		10.1080/07370024.2013.770360			SEP 1 2013	2013	A cognitive task analysis (CTA) and a laboratory study examined the cognitive and communicative processes technical support workers use when providing remote, Internet-based technical support, with a particular focus on the role of the end user who is receiving technical support. In the CTA, 6 experienced technical support employees communicated with end users to solve 4 technical support problems while providing the task analyst with a verbal protocol of their thoughts and actions. The results of the CTA include procedural diagrams illustrating the technical support process and the concept of user diagnosis. The subsequent laboratory study examined how two characteristics of technical support end users, their emotional state and the level of detail in their problem descriptions, affected stress levels and performance of technical support personnel. Angry end users caused more subjective stress to technical support workers than happy users, and technical support employees perceived problems to be more difficult when they were interacting with vague users or angry users. When end users were vague or angry, technical support workers' problem-solving time and performance ratings were significantly worse. Taken together, the results from these studies can be applied to improve the technical support process by providing interfaces that scaffold the communicative aspects of the technical support process and adding training and evaluation for support workers in communication and interpersonal skills.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0737-0024			WOS:000318155500003

J	Randunu, K. Manoj; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Initial Evaluation of Protein Throughput and Yield Characteristics on Nylon 6 Capillary-Channeled Polymer (C-CP) Fiber Stationary Phases by Frontal Analysis								BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS				29	5			1222	1229		10.1002/btpr.1773			SEP 2013	2013	Nylon 6 capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are investigated as an alternative support/stationary phase for downstream processing of macromolecules. Ionizable amine and carboxylic acid end groups on the native fiber surface allow for ion exchange chromatography (IEC). The low cost and ability to operate at high linear velocities and low back pressures are practical advantages of C-CP fibers for preparative-scale macromolecule separations. The lack of fiber porosity ensures facile adsorption/desorption that is conducive to high throughput and recoveries/yields. Described here is a preliminary investigation of the processing characteristics of lysozyme on nylon 6 fibers with an eye toward downstream processing applications. Fibers were packed into microbore (0.8 mm i.d.) and analytical-size (2.1 mm i.d.) columns for the evaluation of the role of linear velocity on pressure drop, frontal throughput, and yield. Protein isolation by frontal development involved three steps: loading of the column to breakthrough, an aqueous wash, and a salt wash to recover the protein. Frontal throughput was evaluated with different salt concentrations (0-1000 mM NaCl) and different linear velocities (6-24 mm s(-1)). The observed throughput values are in the range of 0.12-0.20 mg min(-1) when 0.25 mg mL(-1) lysozyme (in 20 mM Tris-HCl) is loaded onto 78 mg of C-CP fiber in 0.52 mL volume analytical columns. Increased throughput and yield were found when protein was loaded and eluted at high linear velocity. Results of this study lend credence to the further development of C-CP fibers for biomacromolecule processing on larger scales. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Wetland Technologies for Nursery and Greenhouse Compliance with Nutrient Regulations								HORTSCIENCE				48	9			1103	1108					SEP 2013	2013	The need to protect our water resources and increasing public awareness of the importance of cleaner water for ecological and human health reasons are driving regulations limiting nutrient release from traditionally exempt, non-point source agricultural contributors. Modification of production practices alone may not be adequate to meet regulated nutrient criterion limits for irrigation and stormwater runoff entering surface waters. Three constructed wetland technologies are well suited to help agricultural producers meet current and future regulations. The first two technologies, surface- and subsurface-flow constructed wetlands, have been in use for over 40 years to cleanse various types of wastewater, whereas floating treatment wetlands are an emerging remediation technology with potential for both stormwater and agricultural runoff treatment applications. The mechanisms driving removal of both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in constructed wetland systems are discussed. Surface-flow constructed wetlands remediate N contaminants from both container nursery and greenhouse production wastewater, whereas P remediation is variable and tied most closely to active plant growth as the constructed wetland ages. Subsurface-flow constructed wetlands effectively remediate N from production wastewater and can be tailored to increase consistency of P remediation through selection of P-sorbing root-bed substrates. Floating treatment wetlands effectively remediate both N and P with a designed surface area of a pond covered depending on the target effluent concentration or regulated total maximum daily load. The choice of treatment technology applied by growers to meet regulated water quality targets should be based on both economic and site-specific considerations.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000326305700007

Presented here is the isoflavone content in proposed National Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference materials (SRMs) determined by LC-particle beam/electron ionization MS. Botanical materials (soy, red clover, and kudzu) are characterized for the content of a suite of five isoflavones (puerarin, daidzein, genistein, formononetin, and biochanin A). These compounds are of interest due to correlations with certain health benefits. An RP chromatographic separation was first optimized using UV-Vis spectrophotometric detection. The LC output was then introduced to an electron ionization source using a particle beam interface on an Extrel Benchmark MS system. The separation was carried out using a commercial C-18 column and a linear gradient using water and methanol (both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phases A and B, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min over 40 min. LOD values for the isoflavones were determined to be at the ng level. Quantitation was performed using an internal standard (IS) approach with 7-hydroxy-4-chromone as the IS compound. The levels of isoflavones in the botanical products were determined for the proposed SRMs.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1060-3271	1944-7922		WOS:000326198600001	24282927	
J	Arnaiz-Cot, Juan Jose; Damon, Brooke James; Zhang, Xiao-Hua; Cleemann, Lars; Yamaguchi, Naohiro; Meissner, Gerhard; Morad, Martin								Cardiac calcium signalling pathologies associated with defective calmodulin regulation of type 2 ryanodine receptor								JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON				591	17	SI		4287	4299		10.1113/jphysiol.2013.256123			SEP 1 2013	2013	Cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a homotetramer of 560 kDa polypeptides regulated by calmodulin (CaM), which decreases its open probability at diastolic and systolic Ca2+ concentrations. Point mutations in the CaM-binding domain of RyR2 (W3587A/L3591D/F3603A, RyR2(ADA)) in mice result in severe cardiac hypertrophy, poor left ventricle contraction and death by postnatal day 16, suggesting that CaM inhibition of RyR2 is required for normal cardiac function. Here, we report on Ca2+ signalling properties of enzymatically isolated, Fluo-4 dialysed whole cell clamped cardiac myocytes from 10-15-day-old wild-type (WT) and homozygous Ryr2(ADA/ADA) mice. Spontaneously occurring Ca2+ spark frequency, measured at -80 mV, was 14-fold lower in mutant compared to WT myocytes. I-Ca, though significantly smaller in mutant myocytes, triggered Ca2+ transients that were of comparable size to those of WT myocytes, but with slower activation and decay kinetics. Caffeine-triggered Ca2+ transients were about three times larger in mutant myocytes, generating three- to four-fold bigger Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX currents (I-NCX). Mutant myocytes often exhibited Ca2+ transients of variable size and duration that were accompanied by similarly alternating and slowly activating I-NCX. The data suggest that RyR2(ADA) mutation produces significant reduction in I-Ca density and I-Ca-triggered Ca2+ release gain, longer but infrequently occurring Ca2+ sparks, larger sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ loads, and spontaneous Ca2+ releases accompanied by activation of large and potentially arrhythmogenic inward I-NCX.									14	1	0	12	0	15			0022-3751	1469-7793		WOS:000326178500017	23836685

Conservation Caring: Measuring the Influence of Zoo Visitors' Connection to Wildlife on Pro-Conservation Behaviors								ZOO BIOLOGY				32	5			528	540		10.1002/zoo.21086			SEP 2013	2013	Zoos in the 21st century are striving to make effective contributions to conservation. Although zoos are extremely popular and host over 600 million visitors worldwide, one challenge zoos face is how to effectively engage visitors and raise awareness and action for conservation. To this end, zoos commonly rely on charismatic megafauna, which have been shown to elicit a connection with zoo visitors. However, little is known about how to measure a connection to a species or how this connection may influence conservation behaviors. This study had two sequential objectives. The first was to develop a scale to measure visitors' connection to a species (Conservation Caring). The second was to investigate the relationship of Conservation Caring to pro-conservation behaviors, following a zoo experience. Pre- (n=411) and post-visit (n=452) responses were collected from three sites in order to assess the reliability and validity of a scale to measure Conservation Caring. Structural equation modeling was used to explore the relationship between Conservation Caring and pro-conservation behaviors. Conservation Caring was deemed a valid and reliable scale and was a strong predictor of species oriented behaviors (=0.62), for example, adopting an animal, but a weak predictor for biodiversity oriented behaviors (=0.07), for example, supporting sustainability policies. Results support the role zoos can play in fostering a connection to wildlife and stimulating pro-conservation behaviors. Additionally, visitors connected to a wide array of animals. On the basis of these results, zoos may recruit a wider assemblage of species as potential flagships. Zoo Biol. 32:528-540, 2013.

Detection of Internal Defects in Concrete Members Using Global Vibration Characteristics								ACI MATERIALS JOURNAL				110	5			529	538					SEP-OCT 2013	2013	Rock-pocket and honeycomb defects impair overall stiffness, accelerate aging, reduce service life, and cause structural problems in hardened concrete members. Traditional methods for detecting such deficient volumes involve visual observations or localized nondestructive methods, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, highly sensitive to test conditions, and require knowledge of and accessibility to defect locations. The authors propose a vibration response-based nondestructive technique that combines experimental and numerical methodologies for use in identifying the location and severity of internal defects of concrete members. The experimental component entails collecting mode shape curvatures from laboratory beam specimens with size-controlled rock pocket and honeycomb defects, and the numerical component entails simulating beam vibration response through a finite element (FE) model parameterized with three defect-identifying variables indicating location (x, coordinate along the beam length) and severity of damage (alpha, stiffness reduction and beta, mass reduction). Defects are detected by comparing the FE model predictions to experimental measurements and inferring the low number of defect-identifying variables. This method is particularly well-suited for rapid and cost-effective quality assurance for precast concrete members and for inspecting concrete members with simple geometric forms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0889-325X	1944-737X		WOS:000325736000006

Circumstellar disc evolution is paramount for the understanding of planet formation. The gas in protoplanetary discs large program (GASPS) aims at determining the circumstellar gas and solid mass around similar to 250 pre-main-sequence Herbig Ae and T Tauri stars.Aims. We aim to understand the origin and nature of the circumstellar matter orbiting 51 Oph, a young (<1 Myr) luminous B9.5 star.Methods. We obtained continuum and line observations with the PACS instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory and continuum data at 1.2 mm with the IRAM 30 m telescope. The spectral energy distribution and line fluxes were modelled using the physico-chemo radiative transfer code ProDiMo to constrain the gas and solid mass of the disc around 51 Oph. The disc vertical hydrostatic structure was computed self-consistently together with the gas thermal balance.Results. We detected a strong emission by atomic oxygen [O I] at 63 microns using the Herschel Space Observatory. The [O I] emission at 145 microns, the [C II] emission at 158 microns, the high-J CO emissions, and the warm water emissions were not detected. Continuum emission was detected at 1.2 mm. The continuum from the near-to the far-infrared and the [O I] emission are well explained by the emission from a compact (R-out = 10-15 AU) hydrostatic disc model with a gas mass of 5 x 10(-6) M-circle dot, 100 times that of the solid mass. However, this model fails to match the continuum millimeter flux, which hints at a cold outer disc with a mass in solids of similar to 10(-6) M-circle dot or free-free emission from a photoevaporative disc wind. This outer disc can either be devoid of gas and/or is too cold to emit in the [O I] line. A very flat extended disc model (R-out = 400 AU) with a fixed vertical structure and dust settling matches all photometric points and most of the [O I] flux.Conclusions. The observations can be explained by an extended flat disc where dust grains have settled. However, a flat gas disc cannot be reproduced by hydrostatic disc models.

The advent of the laser, 50yr ago, coupled with an insatiable demand for information enabled by light-based communications, ushered in a golden age of glass science and engineering. It is somewhat ironic that the staggering ubiquity of information today, which is carried globally and almost instantaneously via optical fibers, is enabled largely by one materialsilicainto which only a few components are added. The richness of the Periodic Table has largely been forgotten. The purpose of this study was to rethink the materials that can be used to make commercially relevant optical fibers and describe the extraordinary properties, with stimulated Brillouin scattering being the primary exemplar, of fibers made from otherwise ordinary materials. In particular, this study focuses on the use of the molten core approach to optical fiber fabrication and the novel yet practical fibers that can be produced. This study is purposely provocative and aims to reassert the centrality (and simplicity and beauty) of glass science as the best approach to meet future challenges for high-performance optical fibers.									33	0	0	1	0	33			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000325932000001		
J	Dalton, Derek; Radtke, Robin R.								The Joint Effects of Machiavellianism and Ethical Environment on Whistle-Blowing								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS				117	1			153	172		10.1007/s10551-012-1517-x			SEP 2013	2013	Given the importance of the Machiavellianism construct on informing a wide range of ethics research, we focus on gaining a better understanding of Machiavellianism within the whistle-blower context. In this regard, we examine the effect of Machiavellianism on whistle-blowing, focusing on the underlying mechanisms through which Machiavellianism affects whistle-blowing. Further, because individuals who are higher in Machiavellianism (high Machs) are expected to be less likely to report wrongdoing, we examine the ability of an organization's ethical environment to increase whistle-blowing intentions of high Machs. Results from a sample of 116 MBA students support our premise that Machiavellianism is negatively related to whistle-blowing. Further, we find that Machiavellianism has an indirect effect on whistle-blowing through perceived benefits and perceived responsibility. Finally, we find that a strong ethical environment, relative to a weak ethical environment, increases whistle-blowing intentions incrementally more for individuals who are higher in Machiavellianism. Taken together, these findings extend our understanding of how Machiavellianism and an organization's ethical environment impact whistle-blowing.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0167-4544			WOS:000325183800011

Mapping risk for nest predation on a barrier island								JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION				17	3			615	621		10.1007/s11852-013-0260-5			SEP 2013	2013	Barrier islands and coastal beach systems provide nesting habitat for marine and estuarine turtles. Densely settled coastal areas may subsidize nest predators. Our purpose was to inform conservation by providing a greater understanding of habitat-based risk factors for nest predation, for an estuarine turtle. We expected that habitat conditions at predated nests would differ from random locations at two spatial extents. We developed and validated an island-wide model for the distribution of predated Diamondback terrapin nests using locations of 198 predated nests collected during exhaustive searches at Fisherman Island National Wildlife Refuge, USA. We used aerial photographs to identify all areas of possible nesting habitat and searched each and surrounding environments for nests, collecting location and random-point microhabitat data. We built models for the probability of finding a predated nest using an equal number of random points and validated them with a reserve set (N = 67). Five variables in 9 a priori models were used and the best selected model (AIC weight 0.98) reflected positive associations with sand patches near marshes and roadways. Model validation had an average capture rate of predated nests of 84.14 % (26.17-97.38 %, Q1 77.53 %, median 88.07 %, Q3 95.08 %). Microhabitat selection results suggest that nests placed at the edges of sand patches adjacent to upland shrub/forest and marsh systems are vulnerable to predation. Forests and marshes provide cover and alternative resources for predators and roadways provide access; a suggestion is to focus nest protection efforts on the edges of dunes, near dense vegetation and roads.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1400-0350			WOS:000324110200026

Analysis of qualitative data revealed that IRT enabled students to explain and demonstrate appropriate strategies for locating and evaluating information on the Internet when they were asked to do so. However, students did not use these strategies or they quickly abandoned them when working independently or in small groups during inquiry projects. Data revealed three obstacles that inhibited efforts to promote consistent, independent use of strategies: the teacher's role in student inquiry, the structure of inquiry projects, and students' previous strategies. Results suggest notable challenges to implementing instruction that inculcates dispositions among middle school students leading to consistent, independent use of appropriate strategies for locating and evaluating information on the Internet. Implications for practitioners, policy makers, and researchers are discussed.									6	0	0	0	1	7			1086-296X	1554-8430		WOS:000324482900004

Search terms used included children, school, nutrition, diet, nutrition education, and evaluation.Results: Fourteen studies used a theoretical framework to guide the instrument's development. Knowledge and self-efficacy were the most commonly used psychosocial measures. Twelve instruments focused on specific nutrition-related behaviors. Eight instruments included over 40 items and used age-appropriate response formats. Acceptable reliability properties were most commonly reported for attitude and self-efficacy measures. Although most of the instruments were reviewed by experts (n = 8) and/or pilot-tested (n = 9), only 7 were tested using both rigorous types of validity and with low-income youth.Conclusions and Implications: Results from this review suggest that additional research is needed to develop more robust psychosocial measures for dietary behaviors, for low-income youth audiences.									5	1	0	0	0	6			1499-4046			WOS:000324751400004	23663986

The experimental data available for calibration and validation, however, is limited by the availability of resources. This limitation poses difficulties especially if the model is to be executed to predict at different settings and/or regimes within a domain. To assure that the model exhibits predictive maturity throughout the domain of applicability, a sufficient number of experiments must be conducted to explore this domain. Given the limited resources, it is therefore crucial to design validation experiments to maximize the improvement in the predictive capability of the physics-based numerical models. This article contributes to the recent developments in the optimal design of validation experiments by evaluating the performance of several experiment selection criteria that specify the specific benefits desired from future experiments. Our focus is on the Batch Sequential Design methods, which for a given set of initial experiments and a selection criteria, iteratively select a batch of future experiments. The performance of various selection criteria in improving model predictiveness are compared considering not only the empirically identified model discrepancy, but also the coverage of the domain of applicability. The manuscript provides an extensive simulation-based study on a polycrystal plasticity material model, utilizing an established index that quantifies predictive maturity of numerical models.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1615-147X	1615-1488		WOS:000325079300007		
J	Sinha, Aditi; Vyavahare, Naren R.								High-glucose levels and elastin degradation products accelerate osteogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells								DIABETES & VASCULAR DISEASE RESEARCH				10	5			410	419		10.1177/1479164113485101			SEP 2013	2013	Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease in which the body either does not use or produce the glucose metabolising hormone insulin efficiently. Calcification of elastin in the arteries of diabetics is a major predictor of cardiovascular diseases. It has been previously shown that elastin degradation products work synergistically with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-1) to induce osteogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that high concentration of glucose coupled with elastin degradation products and TGF-1 (a cytokine commonly associated with diabetes) will cause a greater degree of osteogenesis compared to normal vascular cells. Thus, the goal of this study was to analyse the effects of high concentration of glucose, elastin peptides and TGF-1 on bone-specific markers like alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). We demonstrated using relative gene expression and specific protein assays that elastin degradation products in the presence of high glucose cause the increase in expression of the specific elastin-laminin receptor-1 (ELR-1) and activin receptor-like kinase-5 (ALK-5) present on the surface of the vascular cells, in turn leading to overexpression of typical osteogenic markers like ALP, OCN and RUNX2. Conversely, blocking of ELR-1 and ALK-5 strongly suppressed the expression of the osteogenic proteins. In conclusion, our results indicate that glucose plays an important role in amplifying the osteogenesis induced by elastin peptides and TGF-1, possibly by activating the ELR-1 and ALK-5 signalling pathways.									12	2	0	9	0	14			1479-1641			WOS:000323113600003	23754846

J	Dawson, Douglas N.; Birchfield, Stanley T.								An Energy Minimization Approach to Automatic Traffic Camera Calibration								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				14	3			1095	1108		10.1109/TITS.2013.2253553			SEP 2013	2013	We present a method for automatic calibration of traffic cameras. The problem is formulated as one of energy minimization in reduced road-parameter space, from which internal and external camera parameters are determined. Our approach combines bottom-up processing of a video to find a vanishing point, lines in the background, and a directed activity map, along with top-down processing to fit a road model to these detected features using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Enhanced autocorrelation along the dashed lines is used in conjunction with a best-fit road model to find road-to-image parameters. To maximize both robustness to noise and flexibility (e. g., to handle cases in which the camera is looking straight down the road), a single-vanishing-point length-based approach (VWL, according to the taxonomy in the work of Kanhere and Birchfield) is used. On a large number of data sets exhibiting a wide variety of conditions (including distractions such as bridges and on/off-ramps), our approach performs well, achieving less than 10% error in measuring test lengths in all cases.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1524-9050			WOS:000324336100007

FACTORIZATION IDENTITIES FOR REFLECTED PROCESSES, WITH APPLICATIONS								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY				50	3			632	653					SEP 2013	2013	We derive factorization identities for a class of preemptive-resume queueing systems, with batch arrivals and catastrophes that, whenever they occur, eliminate multiple customers present in the system. These processes are quite general, as they can be used to approximate Levy processes, diffusion processes, and certain types of growth-collapse processes; thus, all of the processes mentioned above also satisfy similar factorization identities. In the Levy case, our identities simplify to both the well-known Wiener-Hopf factorization, and another interesting factorization of reflected Levy processes starting at an arbitrary initial state. We also show how the ideas can be used to derive transforms for some well-known state-dependent/inhomogeneous birth-death processes and diffusion processes.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0021-9002	1475-6072		WOS:000325057600004

Part I: Viscoelasticity, friction, and PPV								JOURNAL OF RHEOLOGY				57	5			1367	1389		10.1122/1.4817434			SEP 2013	2013	Computational mechanics simulations of glass forming processes such as precision lens molding require accurate thermo-mechanical glass property data as inputs. In the transition temperature range where glass behavior is viscoelastic, the important properties are the viscosity, the shear relaxation function, the bulk relaxation function, and the temperature dependence of these properties. The availability of such data is unfortunately limited, which in turn is the most limiting factor in applying computational mechanics to these processes. In this two-part study, computational and experimental mechanics are used to evaluate the use of the cylinder compression test for the precise determination of these properties. This test is convenient due to the simple sample geometry and availability of high temperature testing machines that can achieve accurate and uniform temperatures, such as a parallel plate viscometer (PPV) or a lens molding machine. The computational results show that deformation of the glass cylinder is strongly dependent on both frictional slip at the interface and the viscosity of the glass, which is the key material property that enables shape change in forming processes. The accuracy of viscosity predictions made using standard PPV formulas is quantified in terms of frictional slip, viscoelastic material behavior, and cylinder geometry within the transition temperature range where PPV measurements are thought not to apply and processes such as lens molding occur. The results extend PPV to log of viscosity values above 8 using units of Pa.s. Given accurate viscosity, it is possible to obtain additional properties.

Part II: No-slip experiments, viscoelastic constants, and sensitivity								JOURNAL OF RHEOLOGY				57	5			1391	1410		10.1122/1.4817435			SEP 2013	2013	The limited availability of viscoelastic material constants for moldable glasses in the transition temperature range makes it difficult to apply computational mechanics to processes such as precision lens molding. In Part I of this two-part study, the cylinder compression test and standard parallel plate viscometer procedures were analyzed, since this test is convenient and relatively easy to conduct. The computational results showed that deformation of the glass cylinder is strongly dependent on both frictional slip at the interface and the viscosity of the glass, which is the key material property for shape change in forming processes. Motivated by these results, in the current study, a specimen was designed that did not allow slip, which results in a very accurate determination of viscosity from the cylinder compression test data and in turn enables a sufficient characterization of the viscoelastic component of the creep curve. The resulting combined experimental and computational procedure was validated with N-BK7 glass using accurate values of viscosity provided by the supplier and then this method was applied to L-BAL35 glass. Given accurate creep data and an accurate viscosity, the shear relaxation functions for the two glasses were determined. In order understand the requirements for a valid test and to best take advantage of the procedure, sensitivity analysis is performed on the height to diameter ratio of the cylinder, the degree of compressibility, imperfections in specimen geometry, and the effects of nonuniform temperature.

Rheological and chemical characteristics of warm mix asphalt binders at intermediate and low performance temperatures								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING				40	9			861	868		10.1139/cjce-2012-0363			SEP 2013	2013	Warm asphalt has been gaining increasing popularity in recent years around the world due to many reasons including the energy reductions and environmental benefits. In the present study, the objective was to conduct a laboratory investigation of rheological properties of eight binders with four non-foaming warm mix asphalt (WMA) additives at intermediate and low performance temperatures in terms of Superpave low temperature test criteria. The conventional testing procedures such as dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), bending beam rheometer (BBR) test as well as specific Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were performed to determine the influences of non-foaming additives on asphalt binders after a long-term aging procedure. The test results indicated that the binder type and source play key roles in determining the G*sin delta values of WMA binders with the non-foaming WMA additive. All eight binders containing Sasobit generally have higher creep stiffness values compared to the binders with other WMA additives. The FTIR tests illustrated that the absorbance of the C-O stretch and C-H bend regions of the WMA binders after a short and long-term aging procedure can be considered similar. Moreover, the WMA binders generally exhibit better performance properties than control binders at intermediate and low temperatures after a long-term aging procedure. Furthermore, FTIR analysis results indicate that the binder type and source play important roles in determining the rheological properties of WMA binders.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0315-1468			WOS:000324176400003

However, DOM, as the main DBP precursor, collected using these techniques may not represent the DOM reacting with disinfectants due to biogeochemical alterations during water conveyance to drinking water treatment facilities. In this study, we exposed leachates from fresh litter and associated decomposed duff to natural sunlight or Escherichia coli K-12 for 14 d and evaluated the changes, if any, on the propensity to form trihalomethane (THM), haloacetonitrile (HAN), and chloral hydrate (CHD) during chlorination. Sunlight treatment did not significantly change dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration but caused a 24 to 43% decrease in the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) at 254 nm, indicating that UV-active chromophores were transformed or degraded. There were significant increases (P < 0.05) in specific HAN formation potential (HAN-FP) and specific CHD formation potential (CHD-FP) (i.e., HAN and CHD formation potentials per unit carbon), but no change in specific THM formation potential (THM-FP) after sunlight exposure. In contrast, bacterial treatment did not show any significant effect on SUVA, specific chlorine demand, or any specific DBP-FPs, although bacterial colony counts suggested DOM in leachates was utilized for bacterial growth. Results of this study confirmed that the reactivity of DOM in forming DBPs could be different after biogeochemical processes compared with its source materials. For this study, photochemical reactions had a greater effect on DBP-FPs than did microbial degradation.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0047-2425			WOS:000324095200030	24216437

Although histological analysis of intact alginate scaffold and cells is a critical aspect of investigations, the existing methods of histological processing often lead to distortions in the scaffold shape, resulting in poor image quality and misrepresentation of the cellular environment. For this reason, the use of glycol methacrylate (GMA) has been explored as an embedding material of alginate scaffolds for histological analysis of embedded cells. The results of the present study demonstrated that soaking alginate scaffolds in a barium chloride solution prior to fixation in neutral buffered formalin (NBF) was a critical step for maintenance of the structure. By slowly infiltrating the hydrogel matrix with GMA using a commercially available embedding kit, the techniques developed in the present study allowed preservation of alginate bead structural integrity and successful staining of the embedded cells.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0147-8885			WOS:000324531700005

Numerous incidents of bridge collapse call for an urgent need to develop a systematic method of assessing the failure risks and identifying the initiating events that can lead to a bridge collapse. This paper presents a process of bridge failure risk analysis through fault-tree modeling for a common type of bridge known as segmental concrete box girder bridge. The process was applied to a segmental box girder bridge in South Carolina and was found to effectively identify causal factors of bridge failure and estimate overall failure risk. However, to comprehensively assess the probability of bridge failure, fault-tree analysis can best be used in combination with current risk assessment methods, such as visual inspections and structural health monitoring sensors.

J	Rosopa, Patrick J.; Schaffer, Meline M.; Schroeder, Amber N.								Managing Heteroscedasticity in General Linear Models								PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS				18	3			335	351		10.1037/a0032553			SEP 2013	2013	Heteroscedasticity refers to a phenomenon where data violate a statistical assumption. This assumption is known as homoscedasticity. When the homoscedasticity assumption is violated, this can lead to increased Type I error rates or decreased statistical power. Because this can adversely affect substantive conclusions, the failure to detect and manage heteroscedasticity could have serious, implications for theory, research, and practice. In addition, heteroscedasticity is not uncommon in the behavioral and social sciences. Thus, in the current article, we synthesize extant literature in applied psychology, econometrics, quantitative psychology, and statistics, and we offer recommendations for researchers and practitioners regarding available procedures for detecting heteroscedasticity and mitigating its effects. In addition to discussing the strengths and weaknesses of various procedures and comparing them in terms of existing simulation results, we describe a 3-step data-analytic process for detecting and managing heteroscedasticity: (a) fitting a model based on theory and saving residuals, (b) the analysis of residuals, and (c) statistical inferences (e.g., hypothesis tests and confidence intervals) involving parameter estimates. We also demonstrate this data-analytic process using an illustrative example. Overall, detecting violations of the homoscedasticity assumption and mitigating its biasing effects can strengthen the validity of inferences from behavioral and social science data.									10	1	0	2	0	11			1082-989X	1939-1463		WOS:000324079900005	24015776

Surface wave velocity structure of the western Himalayan syntaxis								GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL				194	3			1866	1877		10.1093/gji/ggt203			SEP 2013	2013	The Nanga Parbat Haramosh massif (NPHM) is located in the western syntaxis of the India-Eurasia collision zone and is subject to erosion rates that are so extreme as to impact the isostatic equilibrium of the massif. In order to investigate the interaction between large scale tectonic forces and local isostatic processes, we employ a Rayleigh wave tomography method to measure phase velocities within the massif and surrounding region at crust and mantle depths. Our inversion solves for phase velocity anomalies by representing perturbations in the wavefield as the interference of two plane waves. Our data set was obtained from a temporary seismic array deployed in 1996 and includes 53 teleseismic events with M-w >= 5.0, at periods from 20 to 79 s. Phase velocities at short periods are low, ranging from 3.2 km s(-1) at 20 s, and increasing gradually to 3.5 km s(-1) at 40 s. These velocities are 11 per cent lower than velocities observed in the Indian continental Plate at periods below 45 s. Above 50 s, phase velocities in the Nanga Parbat region are significantly higher, ranging from 3.7 km s(-1) at 45 s to 4.0 km s(-1) at 79 s. These high phase velocities above 60 s are consistent with average velocities measured within the Indian Plate. Comparison of these results with surface wave studies in other regions of the Tibetan plateau including the eastern syntaxis and central Tibet show a similar low velocity anomaly below 45 s. Phase velocities above 55 s, however, are significantly higher in the Nanga Parbat region compared to velocities reported for all other regions of the plateau. Shear wave inversions produce significantly low velocities in the upper crust of the NPHM but exceed average lithospheric velocities below the Moho. We suggest the combination of anomalously low velocities in the upper crust and high velocities at lithospheric depths is due to rapid exhumation of deep crustal material causing elevated geothermal gradients. Azimuthal anisotropy shows a NNW-SSE fast direction at 1.5 per cent peak to peak for periods from 22 to 80 s.

The Varieties of German Rule in Poland during the Two World Wars								GERMAN HISTORY				31	3			318	344		10.1093/gerhis/ght032			SEP 2013	2013	The article challenges recent arguments about German relations with eastern Europe that stress pathological continuities, implying a new Sonderweg centred on German violence and expansionism in the region. It examines German policies towards Polish-speaking populations in the Imperial Government-General of Warsaw during the First World War and Nazi debates about whether to include the Polish city of Lodz in the Reich at the beginning of the Second World War. The article suggests that a key similarity existed in German imaginations of the region as an imperial space to be dominated, but that these imaginations competed with ideology, agency and contingency in both world wars. In uncovering key continuities and discontinuities between the two occupation regimes in Poland, it complicates arguments about the singularity and causality of a particular German mission in eastern Europe.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0266-3554	1477-089X		WOS:000323806300002

Effect of summer forage species grazed during finishing on animal performance, carcass quality, and meat quality								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				91	9			4451	4461		10.2527/jas2012-5405			SEP 2013	2013	Angus-cross steers (n = 60) were used to assess the effect of forage species [alfalfa (AL; Medicago sativa L.), bermudagrass (BG; Cynodon dactylon), chicory (CH; Cichorium intybus L.), cowpea (CO; Vigna unguiculata L.), and pearl millet (PM; Pennisetum glaucum (L. R Br.)] in replicated 2-ha paddocks for finishing on cattle performance, carcass quality, and meat quality in a 2-yr study. Steers were blocked by BW and assigned randomly to finishing-forage treatments before the start of the experiment. Steers grazing AL and CH had greater (P < 0.05) ADG than those grazing for BG, CO, and PM, whereas AL produced more (P < 0.05) gain/ha than CH, CO, and PM. Days steers spent grazing were longest (P < 0.05) for PM and shortest (P < 0.05) for CO. Steers grazing BG and CO produced heavier (P < 0.05) HCW than steers grazing BG and PM. Dressing percentage was greatest (P < 0.05) in steers grazing CO, and grazing AL resulted in greater (P < 0.05) dressing percentages than grazing BG, CH, and PM. Grazing AL and CH produced carcasses with more (P < 0.05) fat at the 12th rib than steers grazing warm-season grasses (BG and PM). Marbling scores tended to be greater (P = 0.06) for CO, but carcasses from steers grazing CO received greater (P < 0.05) quality grades than AL and CH. Trans-11 vaccenic (C18: 1 trans-11; TVA) acid concentration in the LM was greater (P < 0.05) for BG than CH, CO, and AL. Conjugated linoleic acid, cis-9 trans-11 isomer, concentration was greatest (P < 0.05) for BG and PM than AL, CH, and CO. Grazing CH and PM increased (P < 0.05) the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in the LM compared with AL, BG, and CO. Grazing legumes (AL and CO) resulted in lower (P < 0.05) Warner-Bratzler shear force values than other forage species. Consumers rated steaks from steers finished on AL and CO pastures greatest (P < 0.05) and steaks from steers finished on BG and CH least (P < 0.05) for overall palatability. Consumer preference was greatest (P < 0.05) for steaks from steers finished on AL and least (P < 0.05) for steaks from steers finished on BG and CH. Finishing steers on AL and CH during summer increased steer performance (> 1 kg/d). Finishing on legumes (AL and CO) increased dressing percentage, reduced Warner-Bratzler shear force values, and increased consumers preference, whereas finishing on grasses (BG and PM) enhanced anticarcinogenic fatty acid concentrations.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0021-8812			WOS:000323602200042	23825343

ECOLOGY OF THE PRIMARY BURROWING CRAYFISH DISTOCAMBARUS CROCKERI								JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY				33	5			660	666		10.1163/1937240X-00002176			SEP 2013	2013	Distocambarus crockeri Hobbs and Carlson, 1983 (piedmont prairie burrowing crayfish) burrows were excavated monthly from April through July 2005 and September 2005 through June 2006 at a terrestrial site in South Carolina. Crayfish were counted, measured (carapace length in mm, CL), sexed, and life stage determined. Number, size and life stage of crayfish per burrow varied within and among months. Burrow excavation yielded ovigerous females in spring and a new cohort of young-of-the-year (YOY) crayfish in June 2005 and 2006. Burrows contained both sexes of adult (>= 27 mm CL) and juvenile (<27 mm CL) crayfish, male reproductive forms, and YOY. The sex ratio of 394 adult and juvenile (0.80:1) crayfish favored females. Rarely were burrows observed with more than two adult or juvenile individuals and YOY crayfish with juveniles were not observed in the same burrow. Young-of-the-year crayfish were observed in 28.7% of excavated burrows (n = 359) and these YOY accounted for 81% of the 2116 crayfish excavated. Mean burrow occupancy decreased from 14.9 crayfish/burrow in September 2005 to 1.2 in March 2006 before increasing to 6.3 crayfish/burrow in June 2006. The decrease in the 2005-year class YOY crayfish from parental burrows through mortality and emigration, instantaneous rate of loss (Z'), was estimated at 0.008. The von Bertalanffy growth model: CL = 36.62 * (1 - 0.82366((-0.2219*t))) derived from mark-recapture CL data provide an estimated first age of reproduction of 5.1 years for this D. crockeri population.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0278-0372			WOS:000323855600007

Using a pedestal undercladding geometry we obtain an optical loss for our Si waveguide which is 10 dB/cm lower compared to other waveguides using planar SiO2 cladding at lambda = 5 mu m, and a fundamental mode is seen over a broad mid-IR spectral range. To realize a fully integrated mid-IR on-chip system, in parallel, we develop PbTe thin film detectors that can be deposited on various mid-IR platforms through a thermal evaporation technique, offering high photoresponsivity of 25 V/W from lambda = 1 mu m to 4 mu m. The detector can be efficiently integrated, using a suitable spacer, to an underlying Chalcogenide glass (ChGs) waveguide. Our results of low loss waveguides and integrated thin film detectors enable Si-CMOS microphotonics for mid-IR applications.

J	Alley, Bethany L.; Willis, Ben; Rodgers, John, Jr.; Castle, James W.								Seasonal Performance of a Hybrid Pilot-Scale Constructed Wetland Treatment System for Simulated Fresh Oil Field-Produced Water								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				224	9					1639	10.1007/s11270-013-1639-5			SEP 2013	2013	Seasonal changes (e. g., temperature, photoperiod, microbial activity) can affect treatment performance of constituents (oil, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn) in a constructed wetland treatment system (CWTS). The purpose of this research was to measure seasonal differences in performance of a hybrid free water surface CWTS for renovating simulated fresh oil field-produced water (FOPW) for surface water discharge and irrigation. The hybrid CWTS was constructed outdoors and consisted of an oil/water separator and two pilot-scale wetland series with four cells each. Oil removal activity (oil-specific agar plates) as well as acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extractable metal concentrations were measured in the laboratory. For this experiment, water temperatures ranged from 0 to 30.2 degrees C in the wetland cells. There were no measurable seasonal differences in performance during this study. From inflow to outflow, the hybrid CWTS decreased oil marker compound concentrations by >= 99% and Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn concentrations by >= 98 %. There were no significant (p >= 0.5634) differences in biodegradation activity of oil nor in production of AVS during the year-long study, which supported our findings of consistent removal of the targeted constituents. With a hydraulic retention time of 4 days, oil marker compound and Cd concentrations in the treated simulated FOPW were greater than surface water discharge criteria, but did not cause toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas (e. g., decreased survival or reproduction). Data from this pilot-scale hybrid CWTS indicated that performance goals for the removal of targeted constituents from simulated FOPW could be achieved throughout a seasonal study.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000323644600004

Its performance is based on making the right decisions on strategic, tactical and operational processes. Discrete-event simulation is the tool of choice to verify such strategic decisions. As the use of the tool is complex, the task of verifying suitable solutions is accomplished by simulation experts and limited to high-priority projects. For the optimisation of operational processes, companies have established lean initiatives with real-time monitoring systems to measure production processes and to reveal bottlenecks. The improvement process is often based on trial and error and could be strongly supported by discrete-event simulation. Based on a use case of an assembly line in the automotive industry, we propose an approach in which running production environments benefit from simulation experiments without any intensive support by simulation experts. Besides introducing a new work procedure, the goal is to extend the current tool set and to simplify the use of discrete-event simulation tools for daily application by production engineers, by providing new visualisation and interaction interfaces to support decisions on tactical measures and, thus, prevent system instabilities and blocked line conditions. Finally, initial results are described in the conclusion to this article.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1571-0882			WOS:000323475900003

Livestock grazing increased species richness of wet and nutrient-rich sites, while no significant change was observed in dry and nutrient-poor sites. The species richness increase in the wet and nutrient-poor sites was explained by local colonization of grazing-tolerant species. Species that adapted in the wet and nutrient-rich sites were driven to local extinction as a consequence of competitive exclusion. At a large spatial scale, livestock grazing can have a potential negative effect on a regional species pool, as it excludes species adapted in wet and nutrient-rich sites. Although grazing did not affect species richness in the dry and nutrient-poor south-facing steppe, plant communities under grazing shifted to dominance by short and prostrate forb species. A spatial difference of the total plant biomass across the landscape was higher in non-grazed landscape but this difference lessened in grazed landscape. The greatest percentage reductions of the total plant biomass due to grazing were in wet and nutrient-rich sites. In conclusion, at a community level, plant communities responded differently to livestock grazing, but at an ecosystem level, the total plant biomass decreased under grazing across the landscape of the semiarid boreal steppe. The livestock grazing in the wet and nutrient-rich sites resulted in the disappearance of moss cover, which is the main insulator of permafrost. The loss of moss cover could potentially accelerate a thawing of permafrost and warming of this region. Also, we found different results on dominance of Artemisia frigida Willd. from those reported in the steppe of Inner Mongolia. At a regional scale, this species might not be considered as an indicator species of livestock grazing.									4	1	0	4	0	6			1744-6961			WOS:000323848200002

Currently, the majority of the hospitals obtain these consents using paper-based forms, which makes patient preference data cumbersome to store, search and retrieve. To address these issues, Health Sciences of South Carolina (HSSC), a collaborative of academic medical institutions and research universities in South Carolina, is developing an electronic consenting system, the Research Permissions Management System (RPMS). This article reports the findings of a study conducted to investigate the efficacy of the two proposed interfaces for this system an iPad-based and touchscreen-based by comparing them to the paper-based and Topaz-based systems currently in use.Methods: This study involved 50 participants: 10 hospital admission staff and 40 patients. The four systems were compared with respect to the time taken to complete the consenting process, the number of errors made by the patients, the workload experienced by the hospital staff and the subjective ratings of both patients and staff on post-test questionnaires.Results: The results from the empirical study indicated no significant differences in the time taken to complete the tasks. More importantly, the participants found the new systems more usable than the conventional methods with the registration staff experiencing the least workload in the iPad and touchscreen-based conditions and the patients experiencing more privacy and control during the consenting process with the proposed electronic systems. In addition, they indicated better comprehension and awareness of what they were signing using the new interfaces.Discussion: The results indicate the two methods proposed for capturing patient consents are at least as effective as the conventional methods, and superior in several important respects. While more research is needed, these findings suggest the viability of cautious adoption of electronic consenting systems, especially because these new systems appear to address the challenge of identifying the participants required for the complex research being conducted as the result of advances in the biomedical sciences.

Through source water characterization, it was found that biochemical processes in the river affected manganese concentrations more than any processes in the lake feeding the river. Because measures taken in the lake would not control manganese at the plant intake, in-plant treatment was required. Bench-top experiments evaluated three treatment trains: potassium permanganate (KMnO4) direct oxidation followed by microfiltration (MF), manganese-coated media bed before MF, and manganese-coated media bed after MF. All processes removed manganese, with the media bed processes consistently achieving < 0.004 mg/L and KMnO4 oxidation reaching as low as 0.008 mg/L Mn. Organic carbon and trihalomethane formation potential removals were comparable, but the media bed after MF exhibited the highest rate of membrane fouling. This study provides a holistic understanding of manganese source and treatability, which should prove useful to other utilities with similar manganese issues.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2164-4535			WOS:000323795900013

The mini-grants project implemented evidence-based health interventions tailored to the specific needs of each community. This study aims to support the SC-CPCRN's goals of moving toward greater dissemination and implementation of evidence-based programs in the community to improve public health, prevent disease, and reduce the cancer burden. Three community-based organizations were awarded $10,000 each to implement one of the National Cancer Institute's evidence-based interventions. Each group had 12 months to complete their project. SC-CPCRN investigators and staff provided guidance, oversight, and technical assistance for each project. Grantees provided regular updates and reports to their SC-CPCRN liaisons to capture vital evaluation information. The intended CHIP mini-grant target population reach was projected to be up to 880 participants combined. Actual combined reach of the three projects reported upon completion totaled 1,072 individuals. The majority of CHIP participants were African-American females. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 81 years. Evaluation results showed an increase in physical activity, dietary improvements, and screening participation. The success of the initiative was the result of a strong community-university partnership built on trust. Active two-way communication and an honest open dialogue created an atmosphere for collaboration. Communities were highly motivated. All team members shared a common goal of reducing cancer-related health disparities and building greater public health capacity across the state.									13	0	0	1	0	13			0885-8195			WOS:000323516400005	23645547

The intensities of both the near-band-edge emission (NBE) and deep-level emission (DLE) as well as the overall spectral line shape were strongly affected by the excitation power. At low excitation power, the blue emission was found to show the highest intensity among the different emission lights. A low-temperature photoluminescence analysis revealed the bound-exciton-related luminescence peak at 3.362 eV. The dependence of peak energy with the excitation power indicates that these DLE processes are generated by DAP transitions. The overall intensity of DLE was found to decrease as the temperature increases. With regard to the blue emission (around 2.52 eV), it showed a well-pronounced shoulder at 200 K. The activation energy for this blue emission was 51.93 meV, which corresponds to the thermal dissociation energy required for the donor-acceptor pair transitions.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1533-4880			WOS:000323628900053	24205634

Any strategies to solve this problem must include increasing crop yields and quality. MicroRNA-based genetic modification technology (miRNA-based GM tech) can be one of the most promising solutions that contribute to agricultural productivity directly by developing superior crop cultivars with enhanced biotic and abiotic stress tolerance and increased biomass yields. Indirectly, the technology may increase usage of marginal soils and decrease pesticide use, among other benefits. This review highlights the most recent progress of transgenic studies utilizing various miRNAs and their targets for plant trait modifications, and analyzes the potential of miRNA-mediated gene regulation for use in crop improvement. Strategies for manipulating miRNAs and their targets in transgenic plants including constitutive, stress-induced, or tissue-specific expression of miRNAs or their targets, RNA interference, expressing miRNA-resistant target genes, artificial target mimic and artificial miRNAs were discussed. We also discussed potential risks of utilizing miRNA-based GM tech. In general, miRNAs and their targets not only provide an invaluable source of novel transgenes, but also inspire the development of several new GM strategies, allowing advances in breeding novel crop cultivars with agronomically useful characteristics.									32	6	0	31	0	39			0167-4412			WOS:000323669000007	23771582

Decades of biochemical and genetic investigations have accumulated rich information on its role as a DNA repair enzyme for the removal of deaminated bases. Structural and biochemical analyses have offered invaluable insights on its recognition capacity, catalytic mechanism, and multitude of enzymatic activities. The roles of endo V in genome maintenance have been validated in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The ubiquitous nature of endo V in the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes, indicates its existence in the early evolutionary stage of cellular life. The application of endo V in mutation detection and DNA manipulation underscores its value beyond cellular DNA repair. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive account of the historic aspects, biochemical, structural biological, genetic and biotechnological studies of this unusual DNA repair enzyme.									16	0	0	13	0	16			1420-682X			WOS:000323247600008	23263163

Weekend bias in Citizen Science data reporting: implications for phenology studies								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY				57	5			715	720		10.1007/s00484-012-0598-7			SEP 2013	2013	Studies of bird phenology can help elucidate the effects of climate change on wildlife species but observations over broad spatial scales are difficult without a network of observers. Recently, networks of citizen volunteers have begun to report first arrival dates for many migratory species. Potential benefits are substantial (e.g., understanding ecological processes at broad spatial and temporal scales) if known biases of citizen data reporting are identified and addressed. One potential source of bias in bird phenology studies is the tendency for more "first" migratory arrivals to be reported on weekends than on weekdays. We investigated weekend bias in data reporting for five common bird species in North America (Baltimore Oriole, Icterus galbula; Barn Swallow, Hirundo rustica; Chimney Swift, Chaetura pelagica; Purple Martin, Progne subis; and Ruby-throated Hummingbird, Archilochus colubris), and assessed whether this bias affected mean arrival dates reported using data from historical (1880-1969; N = 25,555) and recent (1997-2010; N = 63,149) Citizen Science databases. We found a greater percentage of first arrivals reported on weekends and small but significant differences in mean arrival dates (approximately 0.5 days) for four of five species. Comparing time periods, this weekend bias decreased from 33.7 % and five species in the historical time period to 32 % and three species in the recent, perhaps related to changes in human activity patterns. Our results indicate that weekend bias in citizen data reporting is decreasing over time in North America and including a 'day of week' term in models examining changes in phenology could help make conclusions more robust.									7	0	0	3	0	7			0020-7128			WOS:000323309300007	23104424

Specifically, we draw on psychological contracts theory and the group value model to argue that Machiavellianism will moderate the relationships between psychological contract breach and (1) organizational identification; and (2) organizational disidentification.We tested our hypotheses in a study of 262 employees from various organizations at two points in time.We found that psychological contract breach was negatively related to organizational identification and positively related to organizational disidentification. Furthermore, employees with higher levels of Machiavellianism tended to disidentify with their organizations to a greater extent (at Time 2) in response to psychological contract breach (at Time 1) than did employees with low levels of Machiavellianism. Machiavellianism did not moderate the relationship between psychological contract breach and organizational identification.Our study contributes to extant research exploring the importance of Machiavellianism in the workplace. Specifically, we show that employees with high levels of Machiavellianism are more likely to disidentify in response to psychological contract breach but do not tend to identify to a lesser degree.This study builds on the extant research exploring individual differences in the psychological contract dynamics by considering Machiavellianism as a moderator of the breach-outcome relationship.									5	1	0	0	0	6			0889-3268			WOS:000323202700003		
J	Emeneker, Wesley; Apon, Amy								On modeling contention for shared caches in multi-core processors with techniques from ecology								NATURAL COMPUTING				12	3	SI		411	428		10.1007/s11047-012-9348-3			SEP 2013	2013	Multi-core x86_64 processors introduced an important change in architecture, a shared last level cache. Historically, each processor has had access to a large private cache that seamlessly and transparently (to end users) interfaced with main memory. Previously, processes or threads only had to compete for memory bandwidth, but now they are competing for actual space. Competition for space and environmental resources is a problem studied in other scientific domains. This paper introduces methods from ecology to model multi-core cache usage with the competitive Lotka-Volterra equations. A model is presented and validated for characterizing the interaction of cores through shared caching, and for predicting the degree to which different workloads will interfere with each others' execution from cache contention.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1567-7818			WOS:000323331400009

Patient and Family Attitudes about an Eye Donation Registry for Research								CURRENT EYE RESEARCH				38	9			945	951		10.3109/02713683.2013.800890			SEP 2013	2013	Purpose: There is a shortage of human eye tissue available for scientists, and it is unknown how willing ophthalmic patients are to donate their eyes for research. Therefore, we assessed eye patient and family member attitudes regarding the establishment of an eye donation registry for research purposes.Materials and Methods: Surveys were distributed to consecutive patients attending the clinics of an academic ophthalmology practice over a period of 8 days. This survey consisted of questions about demographic information of the participant, attitudes regarding eye donation and attitudes regarding a registry for research-specific eye donation. An additional nested survey was administered to family members who accompanied survey participants.Results: A total of 207 patients and 76 accompanying family members returned their respective surveys. Of the patients, 55% indicated that they would consider joining a proposed eye donation registry for research, 30% were undecided and 15% would not consider joining (n = 193). Over 95% of family members indicated that they would support their relative's decision to enroll in the registry (n = 74). Of the potential donors, 41% indicated they would most prefer to learn about the registry from their eye doctor and 37% from a pamphlet (n = 180).Conclusions: A majority of patients with eye disease and their family members support the idea of establishing an advance-directive eye donation registry for research. This registry for research donors could be incorporated into the current eye donation registry. Such an addendum would bridge the current disconnect between ophthalmic patients who want to donate their eyes for research on their disease (and are ineligible to donate for corneal transplantation) and scientists who need more human eye tissue for experimentation.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0271-3683			WOS:000322319800006	23767667

However, to what extent can the use of specific behaviors be associated with particular types of selection on morphological traits? Laboratory selection analyses on waterfall-climbing gobiid fishes were performed to investigate how behavioral variations in locomotion can affect patterns of linear and nonlinear morphological selection. Species from sister genera (Sicyopterus stimpsoni and Sicydium punctatum) that use different climbing behaviors were exposed to similar artificial waterfalls to simulate a controlled selective regime involving the climbing of a nearly vertical slope against flowing water. Juvenile S. stimpsoni "inch up" waterfalls by alternate attachment of oral and pelvic suckers with little axial or fin movement, leading to straightforward expectations that climbing selection should favor morphologies that improve drag reduction and substrate adhesion. In contrast, juvenile S. punctatum climb using substantial axial and fin movements, complicating expectations for selection patterns and potentially promoting correlational selection. Comparisons of directional, quadratic and correlational selection coefficients for various morphological traits and trait interactions indicated that these species showed different selection patterns that generally fit these predictions. Both directional and correlational selection patterns were different between the species, and on average were stronger in S. punctatum compared to S. stimpsoni. Stronger selection in S. punctatum may be related to its climbing style that requires more integrated movement of the fins and body axis than S. stimpsoni, promoting dynamic interactions among body regions within a complicated hydrodynamic environment.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0269-7653	1573-8477		WOS:000322723500009

The system adopts quality function deployment principle and analytical hierarchy process methodology to be the main reasoning logic for design decisions, and to explore the effect of enhancing these traditional tools with an artificial intelligent scheme, namely the knowledge-based system. Moreover, all knowledge and expertise of production line design are stored in an interactive knowledge base. Thus, the system is knowledge-base-oriented and exhibits the ability to repetitively deal with design problems as changes occur to design needs or manufacturing process options. Furthermore, this technique offers two knowledge bases: the first holds the production requirements and their correlations to essential process attributes, while the second contains available manufacturing processes and their characteristics to fabricate body-in-white panels. Finally, the work contains a case study to verify the developed system's functionality and merits. The results demonstrate an increase in the design procedure efficiency and reduction in the inconsistency. Similarly, the system provides improved results interpretation using graphical representation, in addition to the possibility of tracking the justification of final selected manufacturing processes down to the customer requirements.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0951-192X			WOS:000323146300003

Effect of Compaction Temperature on Rutting and Moisture Resistance of Foamed Warm-Mix-Asphalt Mixtures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				25	9			1344	1352		10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000664			SEP 1 2013	2013	A laboratory investigation was carried out to study the effects of various compaction temperatures on moisture susceptibility and rutting resistance of warm-mix-asphalt (WMA) mixtures containing moist aggregates using a foaming technology. The experimental design included two aggregate moisture contents (0 and by weight of aggregate dry mass), one lime content (1% lime by weight of dry aggregate), two foaming water contents (2 and 3%) with control, and two aggregate sources. The major properties, such as the gyration number of various samples, indirect tensile strength (ITS), tensile strength ratio, rut depths of dry and conditioned specimens, and deformation (flow), were measured for all mixtures. The test results indicated that the aggregate source significantly affected the ITS and rutting resistance regardless of the foaming water content, compaction temperature, and aggregate moisture content. In addition, mixtures from moist aggregate had lower gyration numbers regardless of aggregate type, foaming technology, and compaction temperature. Moreover, the ITS values of foamed mixtures containing moist aggregate increased as the compaction temperature increased. Furthermore, the rut depths of all the dry and wet mixtures slightly increased as their compaction temperatures decreased regardless of the aggregate moisture content, foaming water contents, and aggregate type. A compaction temperature below 102 degrees C (215 degrees F) generally had no noticeable aging (2h) effects on the mixture and did not significantly increase the rutting resistance of these WMA mixtures.									3	2	0	0	1	5			0899-1561			WOS:000322959100022

Situational judgment tests: The influence and importance of applicant status and targeted constructs on estimates of Black-White subgroup differences								JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY				86	3			394	409		10.1111/joop.12013			SEP 2013	2013	Situational judgment tests (SJTs) have become popular in recent years. Yet, there is little research on how the constructs targeted within SJTs influence standardized ethnic group differences. Further, most research in this area is subject to differential range restriction concerns that hinder understanding of the role of constructs. We report on scale-level data from four jobs in which SJTs were part of the first major hurdle of selection, thus providing an analysis of how constructs might relate to standardized group differences when range restriction concerns are minimized. Results indicate that cognitively saturated scales were associated with d values of 0.56 and 0.76, while interpersonal items were associated with d values of 0.07, 0.20, and 0.50. Based on the obtained ds, we simulated hiring and obtained adverse impact ratios to help interpret these values of d for decision-makers. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of examining constructs and gathering data at the applicant level of analyses when attempting to understand SJT d values (and any associated adverse impact).									5	0	0	0	0	5			0963-1798	2044-8325		WOS:000322818900009

Arguably the birthplace of preservation in the United States, decisions about preservation and interpretation at Mount Vernon continue to be scrutinized in a very public manner. Even before the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association assumed ownership in the middle of the nineteenth century, such decisions could arouse strong feelings. The story of Washington's initial resting place and the removal of his body from the badly decayed original casket to a marble sarcophagus carved by the Philadelphia marble mason John Struthers in the 1830s is one such example of how good intentions and forgetfulness combined to result in hard feelings and a significant misinterpretation of Washington's burial site and its meaning.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2153-053X	2153-0548		WOS:000209275300005

The psyllid is newly recorded from Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia and the bruchine chrysomelid from Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia. Both immigrant insects can be considered either detrimental or beneficial additions to the U.S. fauna, depending on whether mimosa is regarded as a desirable ornamental or an invasive plant.

Review of human factors and ergonomics				8	1			4	54					2013-Sep-1	2013	The US Institute of Medicine and healthcare experts have called for new approaches to manage healthcare quality problems. In this chapter, we focus on macroergonomics, a branch of human factors and ergonomics that is based on the systems approach and considers the organizational and sociotechnical context of work activities and processes. Selected macroergonomic approaches to healthcare quality and patient safety are described such as the SEIPS model of work system and patient safety and the model of healthcare professional performance. Focused reviews on job stress and burnout, workload, interruptions, patient-centered care, health IT and medical devices, violations, and care coordination provide examples of macroergonomics contributions to healthcare quality and patient safety. Healthcare systems and processes clearly need to be systematically redesigned; examples of macroergonomic approaches, principles and methods for healthcare system redesign are described. Further research linking macroergonomics and care processes/patient outcomes is needed. Other needs for macroergonomics research are highlighted, including understanding the link between worker outcomes (e.g., safety and well-being) and patient outcomes (e.g., patient safety), and macroergonomics of patient-centered care and care coordination.									12	0	0	1	0	12			1557-234X			MEDLINE:24729777	24729777

Currently, STEM-related employment is only 28% non-White; however, greater efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented minorities should increase this figure. Amidst the attention given to supporting "leaky pipelines," less emphasis has been placed on mitigating challenges associated with bringing diverse cultures together. This article presents a framework for supporting underrepresented minorities in building STEM-relevant skills and enhancing their ability to collaborate with peers different from themselves.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0042-0859	1552-8340		WOS:000324314900004

Direct tensile, pullout, and fluid transport tests were performed. Cracking was observed using four test geometries: (i) tensile tests, (ii) pullout tests, (iii) restrained shrinkage tests, and (iv) wedge splitting tests. The results show that coating multifilament carbon yarns improves mechanical behavior and bonding of the composite when compared with non-coated carbon yarn composites. The non-coated carbon systems may be problematic due to poor bonding as well as their potential to permit fluid ingress along the bundle-matrix interface and through the empty spaces between filaments. In addition, it was also found that fabric with coated bundles reduces crack width and develops dense branched network cracks. However, these additional fine cracks were found to increase fluid ingress into the matrix as compared with the plain cement paste. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The families were exposed, through a series of workshops, to an abundance of children's literature written by and about African Americans. Data sources included pre and post interviews conducted with parents, parental reading logs, and a reflective journal kept by the researcher. Findings suggested that parents increased the amount of time reading aloud to their children, passed along the information that they learned about African American children's literature to family, friends, and co-workers, and began seeking out and developing an appreciation for quality African American children's literature. This study was unique in that it involved collaboration between a public university, a local church, an African American sorority, and an innovative teacher recruitment initiative designed to increase the number of Black, male elementary school teachers.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0045-6713			WOS:000322522100001		
J	Li, Ze; Shen, Haiying; Sapra, Karan								Leveraging Social Networks to Combat Collusion in Reputation Systems for Peer-to-Peer Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS				62	9			1745	1759		10.1109/TC.2012.158			SEP 2013	2013	In peer-to-peer networks (P2Ps), many autonomous peers without preexisting trust relationships share resources with each other. Due to their open environment, the P2Ps usually employ reputation systems to provide guidance in selecting trustworthy resource providers for high reliability and security; however, node collusion impairs the effectiveness of reputation systems in trustworthy node selection. Although some reputation systems have certain mechanisms to counter collusion, the effectiveness of the mechanisms is not sufficiently high. In this paper, we leverage social networks to enhance the capability of reputation systems in combating collusion. We first analyzed real trace of the reputation system in the Overstock online auction platform, which incorporates a social network. The analysis reveals the impact of the social network on user purchasing and reputation rating patterns. We, thus, identified suspicious collusion behavior patterns and propose a social network-based mechanism, SocialTrust, to counter collusion. SocialTrust adaptively adjusts the weight of ratings based on the social distance and interest relationship between peers. Experiment results show that SocialTrust can significantly strengthen the capability of current reputation systems in combating collusion.									8	0	0	1	0	8			0018-9340			WOS:000322453200006

MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY				14	7			663	677		10.1111/mpp.12037			SEP 2013	2013	Sharka disease, caused by Plum pox virus (PPV), is the most important viral disease affecting Prunus species. A major PPV resistance locus (PPVres) has been mapped to the upper part of apricot (Prunus armeniaca) linkage group 1. In this study, a physical map of the PPVres locus in the PPV-resistant cultivar 'Goldrich' was constructed. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones belonging to the resistant haplotype contig were sequenced using 454/ GS-FLX Titanium technology. Concurrently, the whole genome of seven apricot varieties (three PPV-resistant and four PPV-susceptible) and two PPV-susceptible apricot relatives (P. sibirica var. davidiana and P. mume) were obtained using the Illumina-HiSeq2000 platform. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the mapped interval, recorded from alignments against the peach genome, allowed us to narrow down the PPVres locus to a region of similar to 196 kb. Searches for polymorphisms linked in coupling with the resistance led to the identification of 68 variants within 23 predicted transcripts according to peach genome annotation. Candidate resistance genes were ranked combining data from variant calling and predicted functions inferred from sequence homology. Together, the results suggest that members of a cluster of meprin and TRAF-C homology domain (MATHd)-containing proteins are the most likely candidate genes for PPV resistance in apricot. Interestingly, MATHd proteins are hypothesized to control long-distance movement (LDM) of potyviruses in Arabidopsis, and restriction for LDM is also a major component of PPV resistance in apricot. Although the PPV resistance gene(s) remains to be unambiguously identified, these results pave the way to the determination of the underlying mechanism and to the development of more accurate breeding strategies.									12	0	0	12	0	12			1464-6722			WOS:000322591700002	23672686

The 1.5 mol% UV-crosslinked tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate (TEGDA) (step 1) poly(HEMA) and the electropolymerized (step 2) polypyrrole co-networks were covalently joined by the inclusion of a bifunctional monomer (1.5 mol%), 2-methacryloyloxyethyl-4(3-pyrrolyl)butanate (MPB) that served to covalently link the two networks. The optical absorbance, degree of hydration, the frequency dependent electrical impedance and the elastic modulus were examined as a function of electropolymerization charge density (step 2) (1-900 mC/cm(2)) used to prepare the linked, interpenetrating co-networks. The absorption at 430 nm showed a monotonic increase with electropolymerization charge density and correlated with the increase in elastic modulus [56 (+/- 32)-499 (+/- 293) kPa], the decrease in % hydration (68-0%) and the decrease in membrane electrical resistance. Polypyrrole (PPy) grows initially from the gel-electrode interface to fill voids within the hydrogel and ultimately onto the surface of the hydrogel. Growth of attachment dependent Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS13) and pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells reflects this evolution, showing an increase to a maximal value and then to decrease again at high electropolymerization charge density.

J	VandeVoort, Allison Rick; Livi, Ken J.; Arai, Yuji								Reaction conditions control soil colloid facilitated phosphorus release in agricultural Ultisols								GEODERMA				206				101	111		10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.04.024			SEP 2013	2013	Colloid (typically <1 mu m) facilitated phosphorus (P) transport in agricultural soils has received much research attention in recent decades due to the possibility of a mobile solid form of P, which may increase P runoff in some soils. The existing literature reports inconsistent results of colloidal P release as a percentage of total P in soil solution, separated at operationally defined size definitions by various centrifugation and/or filtration methods. The amount of total soil P attributed to colloidal particles remarkably ranges from 0 to 95%. The cause of colloidal P release has been difficult to assess since their experimental/environmental conditions (e.g., soil type, pH) vary from study to study. The case study presented here aims to focus on three controllable reaction conditions: ionic strength (I), pH and added P concentration, to elucidate their effect on P colloid release. Our case study showed that these reaction conditions do not largely alter the release of colloidal P in Ultisols of the southeastern United States (mildly acidic native pH, low organic C). However, the availability of colloidal P was slightly enhanced at near neutral pH in high [P] or high I (0.1 M) solutions. We further discussed these reaction conditions in selected literature studies to better assess the occurrence of colloid facilitated P transport in a wide variety of soil types and conditions.

The inhibition mechanism was examined by characterizing the physicochemical properties and biophysical interactions of the enzyme and the AgNPs. Consistently, binding of the enzyme induced an increase in zeta potential from -22 to 6 mV for the AgNPs, triggered a red-shift of 44 nm in the absorbance peak of the AgNPs, and rendered a 'protein corona' of 20 nm in thickness on the nanoparticle surfaces. However, the secondary structures of the enzyme were only marginally affected upon formation of the protein corona, as verified by circular dichroism spectroscopy measurement and multiscale discrete molecular dynamics simulations. Rather, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurement revealed a significant ion release from the AgNPs. The released silver ions could readily react with the cysteine residues and N-groups of the enzyme to alter the physicochemical environment of their neighboring catalytic site and subsequently impair the enzymatic activity.									11	0	0	8	0	11			0957-4484			WOS:000322642900002	23899823

MOLLER) OKUMURA (CACTACEAE)								Journal of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas				7	1			355	365					AUG 27 2013	2013	We review Momberger's (2007) designation of a neotype for Astrophytum capricorne var. crassispinum. The morphological evidence indicates that the neotype (ULM-18572) seriously conflicts with Heinrich Moller's (1925) original description of this taxon. Momberger's assertion that the Astrophytum population from Sierra Agua Chiquita, Coahuila, Mexico, is var. crassispinum is incorrect. Under the provisions of ICBN, Article 9.17b, we recommend that ULM-18572 be set aside and superseded by another element. We designate ZSS-019963 as the neotype for var. crassispinum for its morphology agrees with the original description.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1934-5259			BCI:BCI201300760980

Synthesis and electrochemical characterization of [Ru(NCCH3)(6)](2+), tris(acetonitrile) tris(pyrazolyl)borate, and tris(acetonitrile) tris(pyrazolyl)methane ruthenium(II) complexes								INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA				405				470	476		10.1016/j.ica.2013.02.027			AUG 24 2013	2013	Tris(acetonitrile) tris(pyrazolyl)borato- and tris(pyrazolyl)methano ruthenium(II) complexes would make good synthons in ruthenium chemistry for synthesis of catalysts and DNA binding drugs. However, these complexes are not widely used as starting materials due to the long reaction times and multiple synthetic steps required or the lack of their successful synthesis. We have developed a new synthesis for the ruthenium(II) acetonitrile complex [Ru(NCCH3)(6)](2+) with noncoordinating BF4- or OTf (OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate) counterions. Using this [Ru(NCCH3)(6)](2+) complex, the previously reported tris(acetonitrile) tris(pyrazolyl)borato ruthenium(II) complexes [Tp(R)Ru(NCCH3)(3)](+) (Tp(R) = tris(pyrazolyl)borate; R = H, Me) and the unreported tris(acetonitrile) tris(pyrazolyl)borato ruthenium(II) complex (R = Ph) have been synthesized using an improved synthetic pathway that reduces the number of required steps by up to six and the average synthesis times by up to 45 h. Novel tris(acetonitrile) tris(pyrazolyl)methano ruthenium(II) complexes of the formula [Tpm(R)Ru(NCCH3)(3)](2+) (Tpm(R) = tris(pyrazolyl)methane; R = Me, Ph) have also been synthesized in one step in 12 h using this method. Cyclic voltammetry studies of the synthesized complexes show that Ru2+/(3+) redox potentials generally increase with increasing steric bulk of the Tp(R) or Tpm(R) ligand. The ability to sterically tune Ru2+/3+ redox potentials may be used to promote catalysis development and in the development of ruthenium-based drugs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report a 40-fold amplification of rhodamine B (RhB) fluorophore when graphene is used as the spacer layer in a conventional Ag-based SPCE setup. In addition to protecting the Ag thin film from oxidation, the highly impermeable graphene facilitated pi-pi stacking interactions with the RhB molecules that resulted in an efficient radiated emission from the plasmaphore. In addition, we found that the plasmaphore emission was more sensitively dependent on the in-plane crystallinity (measured by coherence length L-a) of the graphene spacer layer than its thickness. This study describes the unique features of graphene as a spacer layer for SPCE-based analytical platforms and its potential applications in chem-bio sensing and detection.									20	0	0	1	0	20			1932-7447			WOS:000323593100052

Characterization of Permeability of Electrospun Yarns								LANGMUIR				29	33			10596	10602		10.1021/la401819t			AUG 20 2013	2013	We developed a novel technique enabling determination of the permeability of electrospun yarns composed of hundreds of fibers. Analyzing the wicking kinetics in a yarn-in-a-tube composite conduit, it was found that the kinetic is very specific. The liquid was pulled by the capillary pressure associated with the meniscus in the tube while the main resistance comes from the yarn. Therefore, one can separate the yarn permeability from the capillary pressure, which cannot be done in wicking experiments with single yarns. A surface tensiometer (Cahn) was employed to collect the data on wicking kinetics of hexadecane into the yarn-in-a-tube conduits. Yarns from different polymers and blends were electrospun and characterized using the proposed protocol. We showed that the permeability of electrospun yarns can be varied in a broad range from 10(-14) m(2) to 10(-12) m(2) by changing the fiber diameter and packing density. These results offer new applications of electrospun yarns as flexible micro- and nanofluidic systems.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0743-7463			WOS:000323472000036	23875644

A reduced complexity model for dynamic similarity in obstructed shear flows								GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS				40	15			3888	3892		10.1002/grl.50759			AUG 16 2013	2013	Coupled flows through and over permeable media, also known as obstructed shear flows, are ubiquitous to many environmental systems at different scales, including aquatic flows over sediment beds, and atmospheric flows over crops and cities. Despite their differences, such flows exhibit strong dynamic similarities among systems and scales, as evidenced by the recent finding of empirical universal scaling laws correlating relevant length and velocity scales. We propose a reduced complexity model for obstructed shear channel flows, which couples Brinkman with Reynolds equations to describe the flow within and above the obstruction. We derive scaling laws by intermediate asymptotic analysis of a Darcy-Brinkman type solution in the low permeability limit. The approach highlights the importance of the effective permeability of the obstruction as a critical parameter governing the system dynamical response. The model results are in good agreement with the scaling laws empirically calculated in other studies.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0094-8276			WOS:000323660000020

The cytotoxicity of the combination of ultraviolet radiation or x-rays with the nanodots was examined in cancer cells in vitro. The cell viability decreased following the exposure to the radiation. The carbon nanodots enhanced the radiation effects by significantly reducing the amount of surviving cells compared to that of the cells exposed only to the radiation. Carbon-core silver-shell nanodots can be proposed as a bimodal sensitization platform for biological and medicinal applications employing non-ionizing or ionizing radiation.									9	1	0	2	0	10			0957-4484			WOS:000322001100003	23868054

However, the electrostatics of large macromolecules and macromolecular complexes, including nano-objects, may not be obtainable via explicit methods and even the standard continuum electrostatics methods may not be applicable due to high computational time and memory requirements. Here, we report further development of the parallelization scheme reported in our previous work (Li, et al., J. Comput. Chem. 2012, 33, 1960) to include parallelization of the molecular surface and energy calculations components of the algorithm. The parallelization scheme utilizes different approaches such as space domain parallelization, algorithmic parallelization, multithreading, and task scheduling, depending on the quantity being calculated. This allows for efficient use of the computing resources of the corresponding computer cluster. The parallelization scheme is implemented in the popular software DelPhi and results in speedup of several folds. As a demonstration of the efficiency and capability of this methodology, the electrostatic potential, and electric field distributions are calculated for the bovine mitochondrial supercomplex illustrating their complex topology, which cannot be obtained by modeling the supercomplex components alone.

The Okinawan population is a chromosomally unique cytoform, designated 'D,' which is essentially monomorphic and differs by about 27 fixed rearrangements from the chromosomal standard sequence for the subgenus Simulium and by two fixed differences from its nearest known relative, representing the type of S. suzukii, on the main islands of Japan. Chromosomal band sequences revealed two additional, sympatric cytoforms of S. suzukii, designated 'A' and 'B,' each with species status, in Korea, and a third cytoform, designated 'C,' on Hokkaido, Japan. A new cytoform, 'K,' of S. tani from Malaysia, representing the type of S. tani, is more closely related to cytoforms in Thailand, as are populations from Taiwan previously treated as S. suzukii but more closely aligned with S. tani and newly recognized as cytoform 'L' of the latter nominal species. Rooting of chromosomal band sequences by outgroup comparisons allowed directionality of chromosomal rearrangements to be established, enabling phylogenetic inference of cytoforms. Of 41 macrogenomic rearrangements discovered in the five new cytoforms, four provide evidence for a stepwise origin of the Okinawan population from populations characteristic of the main islands of Japan. The macrogenomic approach applied to black flies on Okinawa Island illustrates its potential utility in defining source areas for other species of flies including those that might pose medical and veterinary risks.									7	0	0	7	0	8			1932-6203			WOS:000326473200017	23951001

Such states can potentially be useful for topological quantum computation using a nanotube network. The physics behind topological superconductivity in CNTs is novel and mediated by a recently reported curvature-induced spin-orbit coupling which itself has a topological origin. In addition to the spin-orbit coupling, an important new requirement for a robust topological state is broken chirality symmetry. We use topological arguments, calculations of the topological gap, and explicit numerical solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations to show that, for recently reported strengths of spin-orbit coupling and broken chirality symmetry, MFs and a robust topological gap similar to 500 mK are achievable in chiral carbon nanotubes.									8	2	0	0	0	8			1098-0121			WOS:000322897000005

We discovered that the external surface of the butterfly proboscis has a sharp boundary separating a hydrophilic drinking region and a hydrophobic non-drinking region. The structural arrangement of the proboscis provides the basis for the wetting dichotomy. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that fluid uptake is associated with enlargement of hydrophilic cuticular structures, the legulae, which link the two halves of the proboscis together. We also show that an elliptical proboscis produces a higher external meniscus than does a cylindrical proboscis of the same circumference. Fluid uptake is additionally facilitated in sap-feeding butterflies that have a proboscis with enlarged chemosensory structures forming a brush near the tip. This structural modification of the proboscis enables sap feeders to exploit films of liquid more efficiently. Structural changes along the proboscis, including increased legular width and presence of a brush-like tip, occur in a wide range of species, suggesting that a wetting dichotomy is widespread in the Lepidoptera.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1742-5662			ZOOREC:ZOOR14911056552

Batch reactors containing GAC to which RDX was preadsorbed were used in experiments to test the potential for adsorbed RDX reduction and daughter product formation using (i) chemically reduced anthrahydroquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AH(2)QDS), (ii) resting Geobacter metallireducens strain GS-15, and (iii) a combined system containing AQDS and GS-15. Approximately 97.0% of the adsorbed RDX was transformed in each of these experimental systems by 90 h. Chemically reduced AQDS (AH(2)QDS) transformed 99.2% of adsorbed RDX; formaldehyde was produced rapidly and was stoichiometric (3 mol HCHO per mol RDX). Geobacter metallireducens also reduced RDX with and without AQDS present. This the first study to demonstrate biological transformation of RDX adsorbed to GAC. Formaldehyde increased and then decreased in biological systems, suggesting a previously unreported capacity for G. metallireducens to oxidize formaldehyde, which was confirmed with resting cell suspensions. These data suggest the masses of GAC waste currently produced by activated carbon at RDX remediation sites can be minimized, decreasing the carbon footprint of the treatment technology. Alternatively, this strategy may be used to develop a Bio-GAC system for ex situ RDX treatment.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0013-936X			WOS:000323013400081	23837558

The optimal conditions for preparation of NE, chitosan coating and lignosulfonate coating were investigated. The results indicate that polymer coating and the number of coating layers significantly affected the release profile and photoprotection capacity of nano-carriers. In particular, after coating, the release rate became slower and photoprotection capacity became higher. Moreover, in the case of L-CH-NE after 24 h of UV exposure in direct photolysis and 2.5 h of UV exposure in indirect photolysis, the non-degraded amount of deltamethrin was approximately 4.5 times and 2.1 times, respectively, higher than that of the free-from deltamethrin. In the future, this novel nanocarrier system will show great potential and be widely applied to many fields related to protection of photo-labile compounds against photo-degradation.

The carbon nanodots with a poly(propionylethylenimine-co-ethylenimine) coating were investigated in human prostate adenocarcinoma (Du145 and PC3) cell cultures in vitro.

The inverse slope of the cell survival curves is about 20-30% lower for the carbon nanodots and radiation compared to that for the radiation alone. Such photoactivatable carbon nanodots can be suggested for use in photocatalytic and photodynamic applications. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.									10	0	0	3	0	10			0003-6951			WOS:000322908300085		
J	Bunget, Cristina J.; Salandro, Wesley A.; Mears, Laine								Thermomechanical modeling sensitivity analysis of electrically assisted forming								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE				227	8			1089	1098		10.1177/0954405413482304			AUG 2013	2013	Recent research by the authors has resulted in the conception of several methods of accounting for direct electrical effects during an electrically assisted manufacturing process, where electricity is applied to a conductive workpiece to enhance its formability characteristics. This modeling and analysis strategy accounts for both mechanical effects and heat transfer effects due to the applied electrical power. This study presents a sensitivity analysis and explanation of several key material and process inputs during an electrically assisted forming test on Stainless Steel 304 and Titanium Grades 2 and 5 specimens. First, the effect that the specific heat (C-p) value has on the model will be discussed and compared with another lightweight material. Second, the significance of all three heat transfer modes (conduction, convection, and radiation) will be noted, and any possible simplifications to the existing heat transfer model will be highlighted. Third, the general electroplastic effect coefficient profile shape for the Stainless Steel 304 material will be compared to that of titanium alloys. Fourth, a frequency analysis will be done on the data taken during the experiments, by way of a Fast Fourier Transform, and the variation of frequency response with the electric input is studied. Overall, this study provides insight into several factors affecting a material's electroplastic effect coefficient profile and also compares resulting electroplastic effect coefficient profiles of various materials.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0954-4054	2041-2975		WOS:000329659300001

Developing a Mobile Application as an Extension Education Tool: A Case Study Using IPMPro								HORTTECHNOLOGY				23	4			402	406					AUG 2013	2013	With increased mobile device usage, mobile applications (apps) are emerging as an extension medium, well suited to "place-less" knowledge transfer. Conceptualizing, designing, and developing an app can be a daunting process. This article summarizes the considerations and steps that must be taken to successfully develop an app and is based on the authors' experience developing two horticulture apps, IPMPro and IPMLite. These apps provide information for major pests and plant care tasks and prompt users to take action on time-sensitive tasks with push notifications scheduled specifically for their location. Topics such as selecting between a web app and a native app, choosing the platform(s) for native apps, and designing the user interface are covered. Whether to charge to download the app or have free access, and navigating the intra- and interinstitutional agreements and programming contract are also discussed. Lastly, the nonprogramming costs such as creating, editing, and uploading content, as well as ongoing app management and updates are discussed.

Testing, Promoting, and Launching a Mobile Application as an Extension Tool: A Case Study with IPMPro								HORTTECHNOLOGY				23	4			407	410					AUG 2013	2013	Mobile device applications (apps) have the potential to become a mainstream delivery method, providing services, information, and tools to extension clientele. Testing, promoting, and launching an app are key components supporting the successful development of this new technology. This article summarizes the considerations and steps that must be taken to successfully test, promote, and launch an app and is based on the authors' experience developing two horticulture apps, IPMPro and IPMLite. These apps provide information for major pests and plant care tasks and prompt users to take action on time-sensitive tasks with push notifications scheduled specifically for their location. App testing and evaluation is a continual process. Effective tactics for app testing and evaluation include garnering focus group input throughout app development and postlaunch, in-house testing with simulators, beta testing and the advantages of services that enhance information gained during beta testing, and postlaunch evaluations. Differences in promotional and bulk purchasing options available among the two main device platforms, Android and iOS, are explored as are general preparations for marketing the launch of a new app. Finally, navigating the app submission process is discussed. Creating an app is an involved process, but one that can be rewarding and lead to a unique portal for extension clientele to access information, assistance, and tools.

FORmative Evaluation Consultation And Systems Technique (FORECAST) is a formative evaluation approach that develops a set of models and processes that can be used across settings and times, while allowing for local adaptations and innovations. FORECAST integrates specific models and tools to improve limitations in program theory, implementation, and evaluation. In the period since its initial use in a federally funded community prevention project in the early 1990s, evaluators have incorporated important formative evaluation innovations into FORECAST, including the integration of feedback loops and proximal outcome evaluation. In addition, FORECAST has been applied in a randomized community research trial. In this article, we describe updates to FORECAST and the implications of FORECAST for ameliorating failures in program theory, implementation, and evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior to death the horse had developed mild diarrhoea and began showing evidence of colic. Necropsy examination revealed a markedly enlarged heart due predominantly to marked dilation of the right atrium, tortuous congested mesenteric blood vessels, marked ascites, pleural effusion and pulmonary oedema. Further examination of the heart showed the endocardium of the left side of the heart, including the mitral valve leaflets, to be diffusely thickened. Microscopically, the endocardial thickening was due to deposition of fibrous connective tissue and elastin fibres. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of endocardial fibroelastosis.

In the present study, the effect of glycosylation on the IgE-binding activity of tropomyosin (TM), a major allergen in Scylla paramamosain, was investigated. The results showed that TM was a glycoprotein with a 0.2% carbohydrate moiety and contained O-glycan. Moreover, enzymatic deglycosylation of TM by glycosidase had no effect on the IgE-binding activity of TM. In contrast, treatment with periodate resulted in a significant reduction in its IgE-binding activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-1147			WOS:000323202800004	23772949

The activity of T904 was not promoter-dependent, increasing the expression of reporter genes under both cytomegalovirus and SV40 promoters. Although T904 did not affect the internalization or nuclear uptake of plasmid, mRNA expression levels from both promoters showed dose-dependent increases that closely paralleled increases in gene expression.ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that T904 significantly increases polyplex transfection efficiency and suggests a mechanism of increased transcriptional activity. As a four-arm, hydroxyl-terminated polymer, T904 is amenable to a variety of end group functionalization and covalent cross-linking strategies that have been developed for preparing hydrogels from multi-arm polyethylene glycol, making it particularly attractive for scaffold-mediated gene delivery.

The optimization of solution parameters, which include concentration of the solution and number-average molecular weight of the polymer, was followed by optimization of the instrumental parameters, which include flow rate, inter-electrode voltage and inter-electrode distance. Varying these parameters resulted in different degrees of hydrophobicity on the generated surfaces. The degree of hydrophobicity was determined by measuring static water contact angles. The effects of these variations in electrospinning parameters on the thickness of the fibers constituting the surface were also observed. It was found that the hydrophobic nature of the electrospun fibrous surface of BP-PFCB depended on two factors: fluorine concentration and thickness of the fibers. During the optimization of the parameters, three different morphological regimes, namely beads, beaded fibers and fibers, were observed. The fine tuning of electrospinning parameters eventually produced a statically non-wetting, highly hydrophobic surface which predominantly consisted of an intricate network of nanoscale fibers.

Such research permissions and consents typically are collected on paper upon patient registration. We describe a novel method of capturing this information electronically.Purpose The objective is to enable the collection of research permissions and informed consent data electronically to permit tracking of potential research participants' interest in current and future research involvement and to provide a foundation for facilitating the research workflow.Methods The project involved systematic analysis focused on key areas, including existing business practices, registration processes, and permission collection workflows, and ascertaining best practices for presenting consent information to users via tablet technology and capturing permissions data. Analysis was followed by an iterative software development cycle with feedback from subject matter experts and users.Results An initial version of the software was piloted at one institution in South Carolina for a period of 1 year, during which consents and permission were collected during 2524 registrations of patients. The captured research permission data were transmitted to a clinical data warehouse. The software was later released as an open-source package that can be adopted for use by other institutions.Limitations There are significant ethical, legal, and informatics challenges that must be addressed at an institution to deploy such a system. We have not yet assessed the long-term impact of the system on recruitment of patients to clinical trials.Conclusions We propose that by improving the ability to track willing potential research participants, we can improve recruitment into clinical trials and, in the process, improve patient education by introducing multimedia to informed consent documents.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1740-7745	1740-7753		WOS:000329574000011	23785065

Models for Production Planning under Power Interruptions								NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS				60	5			413	431		10.1002/nav.21547			AUG 2013	2013	We present a robust optimization model for production planning under the assumption that electricity supply is subject to uncertain interruptions caused by participation in interruptible load contracts (ILCs). The objective is to minimize the cost of electricity used for production while providing a robust production plan which ensures demand satisfaction under all possible interruption scenarios. The combinatorial size of the set of interruption scenarios makes this a challenging problem. Furthermore, we assume that no probabilistic information is known about the supply uncertainty: we only use the information given in the ILC to identify an uncertainty set that captures the possible scenarios. We construct a general robust framework to handle this uncertainty and present a heuristic to compute a good feasible solution of the robust model. We provide computational experiments on a real-world example and compare the performance of an exact solver applied to the robust model with that of the heuristic procedure. Finally, we include the operational impact of interruptions such as recovery modes in the definition of the uncertainty set. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Method for Determining Instantaneous Temperature at the Surface of Combustion Chamber Deposits in an HCCI Engine								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				135	8					081501	10.1115/1.4024180			AUG 2013	2013	Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion is widely regarded as an attractive option for future high efficiency gasoline engines. HCCI combustion permits operation with a highly dilute, well mixed charge, resulting in high thermal efficiency and extremely low NOx and soot emissions, two qualities essential for future propulsion system solutions. Because HCCI is a thermokinetically dominated process, full understanding of how combustion chamber boundary thermal conditions affect the combustion process are crucial. This includes the dynamics of the effective chamber wall surface temperature, as dictated by the formation of combustion chamber deposits (CCD). It has been demonstrated that, due to the combination of CCD thermal properties and the sensitivity of HCCI to wall temperature, the phasing of autoignition can vary significantly as CCD coverage in the chamber increases. In order to better characterize and quantify the influence of CCDs, a numerical methodology has been developed which permits calculation of the crank-angle resolved local temperature profile at the surface of a layer of combustion chamber deposits. This unique predictor-corrector methodology relies on experimental measurement of instantaneous temperature underneath the layer, i.e., at the metal-CCD interface, and known deposit layer thickness. A numerical method for validation of these calculations has also been devised. The resultant crank-angle resolved CCD surface temperature and heat flux profiles both on top and under the CCD layer provide valuable insight into the near wall phenomena, and shed light on the interplay between the dynamics of the heat transfer process and HCCI burn rates.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0742-4795	1528-8919		WOS:000326157800001

Fuels available at the pump can differ considerably in composition and autoignition chemistry; hence strategies intended to bring HCCI to market must account for the fuel variability. To this end, a test matrix consisting of eight gasoline fuels composed of blends made solely from refinery streams was investigated in an experimental, single cylinder HCCI engine. The base compositions were largely representative of gasoline one would expect to find across the United States, although some of the fuels had slightly lower average octane values than the ASTM minimum specification of 87. All fuels had 10% ethanol by volume included in the blend. The properties of the fuels were varied according to research octane number (RON), sensitivity (S=RON-MON) and the volumetric fractions of aromatics and olefins. For each fuel, a sweep of the fuelling was carried out at each speed from the level of instability to excessive ringing to determine the limits of HCCI operation. This was repeated for a range of speeds to determine the overall operability zone. The fuels were kept at a constant intake air temperature during these tests. The variation of fuel properties brought about changes in the overall operating range of each fuel, as some fuels had more favorable low load limits, whereas others enabled more benefit at the high load limit. The extent to which the combustion event changed from the low load limit to the high load limit was examined as well, to provide a relative criterion indicating the sensitivity of HCCI range to particular fuel properties.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0742-4795	1528-8919		WOS:000326157800005

Sleep quality was assessed using 3 scales: difficulty in initiating sleep, difficulty in maintaining sleep, and non-restorative sleep, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-defined insomnia.RESULTSConsidering all 3 types of poor sleep quality, 20.9% of teenagers in Taiwan experienced some form of sleep problems. After adjusting for the other variables, 2 factors independently and statistically predicted sleep problems: current smoking and working night shifts by the head of the household. Teens experiencing difficulty in initiating sleep had higher BMIs ranging from 0.86 to 1.41 units.CONCLUSIONSEfforts to address childhood obesity need to take into consideration sleep problems that are highly prevalent among teenagers.									5	0	0	2	0	5			0022-4391	1746-1561		WOS:000326102800008	23834610	
J	Nguyen, Khuong X.; Horst, Thomas W.; Oncley, Steven P.; Tong, Chenning								Measurements of the budgets of the subgrid-scale stress and temperature flux in a convective atmospheric surface layer								JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS				729				388	422		10.1017/jfm.2013.302			AUG 2013	2013	The dynamics of the subgrid-scale (SGS) stress and scalar flux in the convective atmospheric surface layer are studied through the budgets of the SGS turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), the SGS stress and the SGS temperature flux using field measurements from the Advection Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (AHATS). The array technique, which employs sensor arrays to perform filter operations to obtain the SGS velocity and temperature, is extended to include pressure sensors to measure the fluctuating pressure, enabling separation of the resolvable-and subgrid-scale pressure, and therefore for the first time allowing for measurement of the pressure covariance terms and the full SGS budgets. The non-dimensional forms of the SGS budget terms are obtained as functions of the stability parameter z/L and the ratio of the wavelength of the spectral peak of the vertical velocity to the filter width, Lambda(w)/Delta(f). The results show that the SGS TKE budget is a balance among the production, transport and dissipation. The SGS shear stress budget and the SGS temperature flux budgets are dominated by the production and pressure destruction, with the latter causing return to isotropy. The budgets of the SGS normal stress components are more complex. Most notably the pressure-strain-rate correlation includes two competing processes, return to isotropy and generation of anisotropy, the latter due to ground blockage of the large convective eddies. For neutral surface layers, return to isotropy dominates. For unstable surface layers return to isotropy dominates for small filter widths, whereas for large filter widths the ground blockage effect dominates, resulting in strong anisotropy. The results in the present study, particularly for the pressure-strain-rate correlation, have strong implications for modelling the SGS stress and flux using their transport equations in the convective atmospheric boundary layer.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0022-1120	1469-7645		WOS:000322379400017

The flow regime and surface-groundwater connection must be properly identified and characterized to improve management in karst watersheds with impaired water bodies, such as the Chapel Branch Creek (CBC), South Carolina watershed, which has a long-temn sampling station presently listed on an EPA 303(d) list for phosphorous, pH, and nitrogen. Water from the carbonate limestone aquifer of the Santee Cave system and spring seeps in the CBC watershed were monitored to characterize dominant flow type and surface-groundwater connection by measuring dissolved calcium and magnesium, total suspended solids, volatile suspended solids, alkalinity, pH, specific conductance, and stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2). These measurements indicated that the conduit flow to Santee Cave spring was recharged predominantly from diffuse flow, with a slow response of surface water infiltration to the conduit. Qualitative dye traces and stage elevation at Santee Cave spring and the adjacent Lake Marion (equal to the elevation of the flooded portion of CBC) also indicated a relation between fluctuating base level of the CBC reservoir-like embayment and elevation of the Santee Limestone karst aquifer at the spring. Methods described herein to characterize the flow type and surface-groundwater connection in the Santee Cave system can be applied not only to watershed management in the Chapel Branch Creek watershed, but also to the greater region where this carbonate limestone aquifer exists.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1090-6924			WOS:000325305600005

Post-Release Survival and Behavior of Adult Shoal Bass in the Flint River, Georgia								NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT				33	4			717	722		10.1080/02755947.2013.806378			AUG 1 2013	2013	We conducted a telemetry study of Shoal Bass Micropterus cataractae in the lower Flint River, Georgia, during 2010. Our objectives were to (1) characterize Shoal Bass migration from communal spawning habitats and (2) evaluate the effects of translocation on survival of adult Shoal Bass and determine its value as a viable restoration and management tool. Twenty-seven adult Shoal Bass (TL 305mm) were fitted with hydroacoustic tags. Thirteen fish (control group) were released at the site of capture, and the remaining 14 individuals were transported 75 river kilometers (rkm) downstream prior to release (translocated group). Telemetry data suggested that spawning congregations are composed of fish from local (<3 rkm) and distant (>3 rkm) home ranges. Initially, within 14 d, translocated fish remained near their release site significantly longer than control fish remained at the original capture site. After 90 d at large, the distance that control Shoal Bass dispersed from the release site was similar to distances dispersed by the translocated group, 1.6-23.0 rkm and 2.6-28.6 rkm, respectively. After 90 d, translocated Shoal Bass had not returned to the same river reach that was occupied by control fish. No sex-specific differences were found between groups. Postrelease survival after 90 d was 92% for both translocated and control groups. Telemetry results indicated that Shoal Bass in the Flint River undergo substantial migrations to spawning habitats. Stockpiling of Shoal Bass from live-release tournaments may occur in the short term, and relocation away from home ranges may occur in the long term, thus affecting adult Shoal Bass distribution.

Moran, Amy/F-7072-2011				Eggs as Energy: Revisiting the Scaling of Egg Size and Energetic Content Among Echinoderms								BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN				224	3			184	191					AUG 2013	2013	Marine organisms exhibit substantial life-history diversity, of which egg size is one fundamental parameter. The size of an egg is generally assumed to reflect the amount of energy it contains and the amount of per-offspring maternal investment. Egg size and energy are thought to scale isometrically. We investigated this relationship by updating published datasets for echinoderms, increasing the number of species over those in previous studies by 62%. When we plotted egg energy versus egg size in the updated dataset we found that planktotrophs have a scaling factor significantly lower than 1, demonstrating an overall trend toward lower energy density in larger planktotrophic eggs. By looking within three genera, Echinometra, Strongylocentrotus, and Arbacia, we also found that the scaling exponent differed among taxa, and that in Echinometra, energy density was significantly lower in species with larger eggs. Theoretical models generally assume a strong tradeoff between egg size and fecundity that limits energetic investment and constrains life-history evolution. These data suggest that the evolution of egg size and egg energy content can be decoupled, possibly facilitating response to selective factors such as sperm limitation which could act on volume alone.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0006-3185			WOS:000324068200007	23995742	
J	Katsanevakis, Eleni; Whatley, Ben; Beachley, Vince; Wen, Xuejun; Zhang, Ning								Mineralized Nanofibril Arrays as Building Units for Tissue Engineering of Long Bones								JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS AND TISSUE ENGINEERING				3	4	SI		448	460		10.1166/jbt.2013.1100			AUG 2013	2013	Bone tissue engineering has emerged as a future alternative to bone grafting for the treatment of long bone defects. Numerous strategies involving biomolecules, stem cells, and engineered scaffolds have shown promise in inducing sufficient bone regeneration. However, a common limitation of these strategies lies in their inability to generate bone tissue that mimics the organized microstructure of cortical bone. Thus, the objective of this study is to develop highly-aligned nanofibril scaffolds, which closely mimic the microstructure of the cortical bone. The idea behind this goal is that if a more organized bone structure is formed during the healing process, the time for the remodeling process to occur would be reduced. Electrospun polymer nanofibril arrays are often used in tissue engineering applications due to their ability to support cell attachment, growth, and tissue formation. Using an electrospinning apparatus paired with a customized motorized collecting device developed in our lab, we are able to spin small diameter, highly-aligned, loose nanofibril arrays that closely mimic the structure and arrangement of collagen fibrils in bones' ECM. This is advantageous as it will allow cells to penetrate and migrate within the scaffold in order to regenerate the tissue. In this study, polycaprolactone (PCL) was used due to its extended biodegradability as well as excellent biocompatibility, though other polymers can be used with this device. To further mimic the structure, composition, and mechanical properties of the lowest hierarchical level of natural cortical bone, we have biomineralized the surface of the nanofibril arrays in order to direct osteoblast behavior and facilitate bone tissue formation, organization, and regeneration. Our present study determines the proper treatment methods and parameters for optimal mineralization of the nanofibril scaffolds, in order to achieve a composition and microstructure that mimics that of natural bone. Results indicate that a hydrolysis treatment for 30 minutes prior to incubating with 5X simulated body fluid (SBF) for 24 hours leads to a coating with ideal compositional and structural characteristics. This structure resulted in enhanced mechanical properties, as well as improved osteoconductivity and bioactivity, which allowed bone progenitor cells to attach, align, and proliferate on. Future preclinical studies will include the incorporation of angiogenic and osteogenic factors in order to further promote vascularization and enhance bone regeneration. As current strategies have yet to produce a suitable candidate for a clinical cortical bone substitute, this strategy has a great deal of clinical relevance, as it can potentially serve as an alternative to autologous bone grafts for human long bone regeneration.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2157-9083			WOS:000323866900009

Appropriate surface functionalization of nanofiber scaffolds can result in improved cell interactions such as attachment and proliferation. Here a simple method of introducing functional groups to electrospun scaffolds by blending amine terminated block polymer chains directly into an electrospinning solution is investigated. This method benefits from simplicity and does not require any harsh physical or chemical treatments that may damage nanofiber structures. The potential of this method in vascular graft applications was demonstrated by attaching heparin to the surface of electrospun polyurethane scaffolds. Heparin incorporation was confirmed by toluidine blue assay and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Bioactivity of the functionalized scaffolds was demonstrated by improved endothelial cell attachment in vitro.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2157-9083	2157-9091		WOS:000323866900011

A major challenge in ligand-receptor docking is the modeling of both receptor and ligand flexibilities in order to capture receptor conformational changes induced by ligand binding. In the molecular docking suite MedusaDock, both ligand and receptor side chain flexibilities are modeled simultaneously with sets of discrete rotamers, where the ligand rotamer library is generated "on the fly" in a stochastic manner. Here, we introduce backbone flexibility into MedusaDock by implementing ensemble docking in a sequential manner for a set of distinct receptor backbone conformations. We generate corresponding backbone ensembles to capture backbone changes upon binding to different ligands, as observed experimentally. We develop a simple clustering and ranking approach to select the top poses as blind predictions. We applied our method in the CSAR2011 benchmark exercise. In 28 out of 35 cases (80%) where the ligand-receptor complex structures were released, we were able to predict near-native poses (<2.5 angstrom RMSD), the highest success rate reported for CSAR2011. This result highlights the importance of modeling receptor backbone flexibility to the accurate docking of ligands to flexible targets. We expect a broad application of our fully flexible docking approach in biological studies as well as in rational drug design.									17	0	0	11	0	17			1549-9596			WOS:000323797700004	23237273

Grafted Watermelon Root Length Density and Distribution under Different Soil Moisture Treatments								HORTSCIENCE				48	8			1021	1026					AUG 2013	2013	Delineating the depth and extent of the watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thumb.) Matsum. & Nak.] root zone assists with proper irrigation management and minimizes nutrient leaching. The objective of this 3-year field study was to measure root distribution and root length density of watermelon (cv. Wrigley) grafted on two different rootstocks (Lagenaria siceraria cv. 'FR Strong' and Cucurbita moschata x Cucurbita maxima cv. Chilsung Shintoza) and grown under three soil moisture treatments. Irrigation treatments tested were: no irrigation (NI), briefly irrigated for fertigation and early-season plant establishment; minimally irrigated (MI), irrigated when soil moisture in top 0.30 m of soil fell below 50% available water capacity (AWC); well irrigated (WI), irrigated when soil moisture in top 0.30 m of soil fell below 15% (AWC). Root length density (RLD) was measured from 75-cm-deep soil cores at two locations three times per growing season and a third location at the end of the season. Cores 1 and 2 sample locations were 15 cm to the side of each plant: Core 1 on the same side as the drip tape and Core 2 on the opposite side. At the end of the season, Core 3 was taken 15 cm outside of the bed in bare ground. RLD was significantly greater in the 0- to 30-cm soil depth and dropped dramatically below 30 cm; it was not significantly affected by irrigation treatment or rootstock. Core 1, next to the drip tape, had greater RLD than Core 2, 30 cm from drip tape, but only at the later sampling dates. Roots were found in Core 3 at all depths, but the RLD was significantly less than that measured in Cores 1 and 2. These findings suggest that the effective root zone depth for watermelon is 0 to 30 cm and that the particular scion/rootstock combinations tested in this study do not differ in root system size or location.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0018-5345			WOS:000323690400013

In this paper, it is shown how to decide optimal linear codes (i.e., with the biggest information rate) realizing a given access structure over finite fields. It amounts to solving a system of quadratic equations constructed from the given access structure and the corresponding adversary structure. The system becomes a linear system for binary codes. An algorithm is also given for finding the adversary structure for any given access structure.									2	2	0	0	0	2			1009-6124			WOS:000323501400011

Democratical Gentlemen and the Lust for Mastery: Status, Ambition, and the Language of Liberty in Hobbes's Political Thought								POLITICAL THEORY				41	4			648	675		10.1177/0090591713485445			AUG 2013	2013	Neorepublican treatments of Hobbes argue that his conception of liberty was deliberately developed to counter a revived and Roman-rooted republican theory of liberty. In doing so, Hobbes rejects republican liberty, and, with it, Roman republicanism. We dispute this narrative and argue that rather than rejecting Roman liberty, per se, Hobbes identifies and attacks a language of liberty, Roman in character, often abused by ambitious persons. This is possible because Roman libertyand, by extension, Hobbes's relationship to itis more complex than neorepublican authors have allowed. Drawing on Roman sources, along with Hobbes's major works, we argue that Hobbes's theory of liberty owes much to his engagement with Roman sources, and that this theory speaks to the egalitarian elements in his political thought.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-5917	1552-7476		WOS:000323431100006

Albeit the chains are not in their equilibrium conformation and are not confined by cross-links, they remain stable over astounding long times. Using fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with an innovative method to controllably collapse an inherently rigid polymer, we determined for the first time the internal structure and stability of polydots made of dialkyl-para-phenylene ethynylene, immersed in water, a biological relevant medium. In contrast to natural aggregates, the aromatic rings within the polydots are uncorrelated, with little to no water in its interior. This lack of correlation explains the differences of luminescence characteristics between spontaneously aggregated conjugated polymers and polydots. Resolving the conformation and stability of these particles will enable transforming an idea to a new effective tool.									6	0	0	0	0	6			2161-1653			WOS:000323472100013

Effects of canopy structure and cultural treatments on the survival and growth of Pinus palustris Mill. seedlings underplanted in Pinus taeda L. stands								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				57				46	56		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.04.014			AUG 2013	2013	Longleaf pine restoration is a common management objective in the southeastern United States and requires artificial regeneration of longleaf pines on sites currently dominated by loblolly pine. In many cases, retention of canopy trees during stand conversion may be desirable to promote ecological function and meet conservation objectives. We tested the effects of seven harvesting treatments that varied residual canopy density and distribution, in conjunction with additional cultural treatments (herbicides and fertilizer), on the mortality and growth of longleaf pine seedlings underplanted in loblolly pine stands. We observed no change in the root collar diameter of longleaf pine seedlings planted in plots with no canopy removal (residual basal area of 16 m(2)/ha) over three growing seasons. Clearcutting resulted in the greatest seedling growth and the greatest percentage of seedlings that had emerged from the grass stage, although mean seedling size within canopy gaps did not differ from that within clearcut plots. Within canopy gaps, seedling root collar diameter did not significantly increase beyond 10 m from the forest edge. Canopy trees provided an apparent facilitation effect on longleaf pine seedling survival, with the highest mortality in clearcut plots and on the northern half of canopy gaps. Releasing planted longleaf pine seedlings with herbicides resulted in a moderate increase in the percentage of seedlings in height growth but had no effect on root collar diameter. Our results demonstrate trade-offs between longleaf pine seedling survival and growth associated with canopy retention but also suggest that managers have some degree of flexibility in prescribing harvesting treatments to meet restoration objectives on sites currently dominated by loblolly pines.

J	Lolap, Gati N.; Devol, Timothy A.								Correlating the Luminosity Parameters to Pulse Shape Discrimination								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE				60	4			2958	2965		10.1109/TNS.2013.2272464			AUG 2013	2013	Monte Carlo simulations were used to investigate the correlation between luminosity parameters and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) and subsequently compared with experimental results from CsI:Tl. Luminosity intensity parameters A(f), A(s) (fast and slow initial luminosities) and temporal luminosity parameters tau(f), tau(s) (fast and slow decay time constants) of a dual decay mode scintillator were applied to create a dynamic model with Crystal Ball simulation system. The simulated pulses were analyzed with charge comparison (CC) and constant time discrimination (CTD) PSD methods followed by quantification of the histogrammed pulse data with Figure of Merit (FoM) and spillover (pulse misclassification). Performance in terms of FoM and spillover is compared with that of fixed reference pulses set at (A(f)tau(f)/A(s)tau(s))(gamma) =1 and (A(f)tau(f)/A(s)tau(s))(gamma) = 0.1. For the CC method, independent of the reference pulse characteristics [(A(f)tau(f)/A(s)tau(s))(gamma) = 1 or = 0.1] tau(s) is the most influential parameter for PSD as compared with, A(f), A(s), and tau(f). For the CTD method, A(f) and A(s) are seen to have less influence over the PSD compared to tau(f) and tau(s) when (A(f)tau(f)/A(s)tau(s))(gamma) = 1and tau(f) is the most influential parameter for both reference pulses. Using both methods with either reference pulse applied, the scintillator having luminosity parameters such that 0.1 < (A(f)tau(f)/A(s)tau(s))(alpha/gamma) < 2 is classified as having poor PSD. Excellent correlation is observed between the simulation and the experimental results with CsI:Tl, which is known for very good alpha/beta(gamma) pulse shape discrimination. This study is useful for describing how the luminosity parameters affects PSD.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9499			WOS:000323451800018

Two-Level Dynamic Stochastic Optimal Power Flow Control for Power Systems With Intermittent Renewable Generation								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS				28	3			2670	2678		10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2237793			AUG 2013	2013	High penetration of intermittent renewable energy imposes new challenges to the operation and control of power systems. Power system security needs to be ensured dynamically as the system operating condition continuously changes. The dynamic stochastic optimal power flow (DSOPF) control algorithm using the Adaptive Critic Designs (ACDs) has shown promising dynamic power flow control capability and has been demonstrated in a small system. To further investigate the potential of the DSOPF control algorithm for large power systems, a 70-bus test power system with different generation resources, including large wind plants, is developed. A two-level DSOPF control scheme is proposed in this paper to scale up the DSOPF algorithm for this 70-bus system. The lower-level area DSOPF controllers control their own area power network. The top-level global DSOPF controller coordinates the area controllers by adjusting the inter-area tie-line flows. This two-level architecture distributes the control and computation burden to multiple area DSOPF controllers, and reduces the training difficulty for implementing the DSOPF control for a large power network. Simulation studies on the 70-bus power system with large wind variation are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-level DSOPF control scheme.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0885-8950			WOS:000322989900063

Reduction of Soybean Yield Components by Megacopta cribraria (Hemiptera: Plataspidae)								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				106	4			1676	1683		10.1603/EC13121			AUG 2013	2013	Since its discovery in the United States, the invasive plataspid Megacopta cribraria (F.) (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) has infested soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] fields in often alarming numbers in parts of the southeastern United States. Although a known feeder on soybean, reports of its pest status in its native Asian range are conflicting, and little information exists documenting its impact on soybean yields. Our objective was to examine the relationship between M. cribraria density and soybean yield loss. M. cribraria adults and nymphs were confined to small soybean plots by using walk-in field cages from late vegetative stage to harvest in 2011 and 2012. Adults (0, 5, or 25 per plant) were added at late vegetative stages, and their progeny were allowed to complete a full generation within the caged plots. Densities reached as high as 182.5 +/- 23.1 (SEM) nymphs and adults per plant, and soybean yield was reduced by as much as 59.6% at the highest density treatment. The yield components seeds per pod and individual seed weight were reduced as M. cribraria densities increased, but pods per plant and protein and oil content were not affected. Preliminary economic injury level curves for a range of grain prices and management costs were calculated based on 2012 yield loss data combined with population monitoring. M. cribraria is capable of causing severe reductions in soybean yields at densities that are relevant within its invasive U.S. range.									18	0	0	17	0	19			0022-0493			WOS:000323043000021	24020281

TT contributed to the variance in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.001), total cholesterol (P = 0.003), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.003), and apolipoprotein B (P = 0.004). FAI contributed to the variance in the greatest number of metabolic variables beyond VAT. There was also a significant race-FAI interaction for fasting glucose (P = 0.013). A Pearson's correlation coefficient showed a significant relationship between FAI and glucose in white women (r = 0.48, P = 0.003) while showing no relationship in black women (r = -0.01, P = 0.941).Conclusions: Our study showed that androgenic sex steroids contributed significantly to the variance in metabolic variables associated with health risk. However, they do not provide sufficient information relevant to glucose status in black women.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1930-7381			WOS:000323521500018	23670917

Calcium currents (I-Ca) averaged similar to 8 pA/pF in control and mutant iPS-CMs. I-Ca-induced Ca2+-transients in control and mutant cells had bell-shaped voltage-dependence similar to that of I-Ca, consistent with Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release (CICR) mechanism. The ratio of I-Ca -actiyated to caffeine-triggered Ca2+-transients was similar to 0.3 in both cell types. Caffeine-induced Ca2+-transients generated significantly smaller Na+-Ca2+ exchanger current (I-NCX) in mutant cells, reflecting their smaller Ca2+-stores. The gain of CICR was voltage-dependent as in adult cardiomyocytes. Adrenergic agonists enhanced I-Ca, but differentially altered the CICR gain, diastolic Ca2+, and Ca2+-sparks in mutant cells. The mutant cells, when Ca2+-overloaded, showed longer and wandering Ca2+-sparks that activated adjoining release sites, had larger CICR gain at -30 mV yet smaller Ca2+-stores. We conclude that control and mutant iPS-CMs express the adult cardiomyocyte Ca2+-signaling phenotype. RyR2 F2483I mutant myocytes have aberrant unitary Ca2+-signaling, smaller Ca2+-stores, higher CICR gains, and sensitized adrenergic regulation, consistent with functionally altered Ca2+-release profile of CPVT syndrome.

J	Ginjupalli, Gautam K.; Baldwin, William S.								The time- and age-dependent effects of the juvenile hormone analog pesticide, pyriproxyfen on Daphnia magna reproduction								CHEMOSPHERE				92	9			1260	1266		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.04.061			AUG 2013	2013	Pyriproxyfen is an insecticidal juvenile hormone analog that perturbs insect and tick development. Pyriproxyfen also alters parthenogenic reproduction in non-target cladoceran species as it induces male production that can lead to a decrease in fecundity, a reduction in population density, and subsequent ecological effects. In this study, we investigate the impacts of pyriproxyfen on Daphnia magna reproduction using a series of male production screening assays. These assays demonstrate that pyriproxyfen increases male production in a concentration-dependent fashion with an EC50 of 156 pM (50.24 ng L-1) a concentration considered environmentally relevant. Furthermore, pyriproxyfen decreases overall fecundity at all ages tested (7, 14, 21-d old female parthenogenic daphnids). juvenile (3-d old) and reproductively mature (10-d old) female daphnids were also exposed to 155 pM pyriproxyfen for 2-12 d and reproduction measured for 16 d to compare the effects of short-term and prolonged exposures, and determine the potential for recovery. Results indicate that longer pyriproxyfen exposures (8-12 d) extend male production and decrease reproduction; however, daphnids exposed for only 2-4 d recover and produce a relatively normal abundance of neonates. In addition, juvenile daphnids are also very sensitive to pyriproxyfen, but the primary effect on juvenile daphnids is reduced reproduction and protracted development not male production. Taken together, continued use of pyriproxyfen around water bodies needs due caution because of its potential adverse effects with significant developmental delays and male production compounded by prolonged exposure.

However, walls and other normal indoor infrastructure cause a systemic spatial warp in the measurements. In this paper, we describe methods to manually build a map of the measurement noise and use it in a particle filter framework to improve measurement accuracy. We tested our methods in two facilities, collecting over 5.6 million measurements. Evidence shows that the measurement noise is multimodal, location dependent, stable over time, and locally similar. Using the map in a particle filter framework, we demonstrate an average improvement in measurement accuracy of 30%.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0018-9456			WOS:000321932100012

Robust parameter design (RPD) is often considered among the most important methods for achieving these ends. Focused on statistical modelling and numerical optimisation strategies, most researchers typically assume processes possess moderate to low variability, which facilitates the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Realistically, however, industrial processes often exhibit high variability. In such cases, many of the modelling assumptions underpinning OLS methods do not hold. Consequently, the results and recommendations provided to decision-makers using these could generate suboptimal modifications to processes and products. This paper proposes an alternative method for dealing with high process variability. Specifically, using the coefficient of variation to identify influential sources of variability between design points, the proposed method advocates removing these sources and then applying optimal design theory to rebalance the experimental framework. Thereafter, RPD optimisation schemes may be applied to obtain more precise optimal operating conditions with less variability and bias.

Most of the engineering statistics literature focuses on finding point estimates of the optimum operating conditions for robust design. Various procedures have been considered for calculating point estimates of the optimum operating conditions. Although the point estimation procedure is important for continuous quality improvement, the immediate question is how accurate are these optimum operating conditions? The answer is to consider interval estimation for a single variable or joint confidence regions for multiple variables. In this paper, using the bootstrap technique, we develop procedures for obtaining joint confidence regions for the optimum operating conditions. Two different procedures, using Bonferroni and multivariate normal approximation, are introduced. The proposed methods are illustrated and substantiated using a numerical example.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0020-7543	1366-588X		WOS:000322808100018

Moreover, in addition to locating so-called factual errors in our work, he recommends the Kahneman-Tversky attempt to inject psychology (and neuroscience) into market behavior as a kind of new economics that challenges the rational-agent model and thus supposedly has value in religious history and the social sciences as well.

One key component of tree architecture is the branch angle, yet little is known about the molecular basis for the spatial patterning of branches in trees. Here, we report the identification of a candidate gene for the br mutation in Prunus persica (peach) associated with vertically oriented growth of branches, referred to as pillar' or broomy'. Ppa010082, annotated as hypothetical protein in the peach genome sequence, was identified as a candidate gene for br using a next generation sequence-based mapping approach. Sequence similarity searches identified rice TAC1 (tiller angle control 1) as a putative ortholog, and we thus named it PpeTAC1. In monocots, TAC1 is known to lead to less compact growth by increasing the tiller angle. In Arabidopsis, an attac1 mutant showed more vertical branch growth angles, suggesting that the gene functions universally to promote the horizontal growth of branches. TAC1 genes belong to a gene family (here named IGT for a shared conserved motif) found in all plant genomes, consisting of two clades: one containing TAC1-like genes; the other containing LAZY1, which contains an EAR motif, and promotes vertical shoot growth in Oryza sativa (rice) and Arabidopsis through influencing polar auxin transport. The data suggest that IGT genes are ancient, and play conserved roles in determining shoot growth angles in plants. Understanding how IGT genes modulate branch angles will provide insights into how different architectural growth habits evolved in terrestrial plants.									22	0	0	22	0	22			0960-7412			WOS:000322898800008	23663106

We arithmetically define 3-Selmer groups through isogeny and 3-descent maps, then associate the image of the 3-descent maps to solutions of homogeneous cubic polynomials affiliated with the elliptic curve E and an isogenous curve E'. Thanks to the work of Cohen and Pazuki, we have solubility conditions for the homogeneous polynomials. Using these conditions, we give a graphical approach to computing the size of 3-Selmer groups. Finally, we translate the conditions on graphs into a question concerning ranks of matrices and give an upper bound for the rank of the elliptic curve E by calculating the size of the Selmer groups.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1382-4090			WOS:000322744200010

However, with the worldwide concern about the carcinogenicity of AA, how to reduce the toxicity of AA has become a hot research topic. In this study, we further discussed the effects of oral administration of allicin on AA-induced toxicity by determining the hematological, biochemical and immunological parameters in the serum, kidney, liver, and brain of male mice. Our data showed that the orally administered allicin of 5, 10, and 20 mg kg(-1) bw d(-1) could significantly decrease thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, and simultaneously remarkably increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione (GSH) levels in the kidney, liver, and brain of the AA-treated mice. Furthermore, oral administration of allicin not only significantly decreased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, interleukin (IL)-6, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and 8-hydroxy-desoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), but also increased interleukin (IL)-10 in the serum of AA-treated mice. Therefore, it was concluded that oral administration of allicin had a significant in vivo protective effect against the AA induced toxicity.									15	1	0	12	0	16			2042-6496	2042-650X		WOS:000322188000009	23760623	
J	Ashley-Ross, Miriam A.; Hsieh, S. Tonia; Gibb, Alice C.; Blob, Richard W.								Vertebrate Land Invasions-Past, Present, and Future: An Introduction to the Symposium								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				53	2			192	196		10.1093/icb/ict048			AUG 2013	2013	The transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats was a seminal event in vertebrate evolution because it precipitated a sudden radiation of species as new land animals diversified in response to novel physical and biological conditions. However, the first stages of this environmental transition presented numerous challenges to ancestrally aquatic organisms, and necessitated changes in the morphological and physiological mechanisms that underlie most life processes, among them movement, feeding, respiration, and reproduction. How did solutions to these functional challenges evolve? One approach to this question is to examine modern vertebrate species that face analogous demands; just as the first tetrapods lived at the margins of bodies of water and likely moved between water and land regularly, many extant fishes and amphibians use their body systems in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats on a daily basis. Thus, studies of amphibious vertebrates elucidate the functional demands of two very different habitats and clarify our understanding of the initial evolutionary challenges of moving onto land. A complementary approach is to use studies of the fossil record and comparative development to gain new perspectives on form and function of modern amphibious and non-amphibious vertebrate taxa. Based on the synthetic approaches presented in the symposium, it is clear that our understanding of aquatic-to-terrestrial transitions is greatly improved by the reciprocal integration of paleontological and neontological perspectives. In addition, common themes and new insights that emerged from this symposium point to the value of innovative approaches, new model species, and cutting-edge research techniques to elucidate the functional challenges and evolutionary changes associated with vertebrates' invasion of the land.									13	0	0	11	0	13			1540-7063			WOS:000322342600002	23660589

Kawano, Sandy/0000-0002-1856-5566			Propulsive Forces of Mudskipper Fins and Salamander Limbs during Terrestrial Locomotion: Implications for the Invasion of Land								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				53	2			283	294		10.1093/icb/ict051			AUG 2013	2013	The invasion of land was a pivotal event in vertebrate evolution that was associated with major appendicular modifications. Although fossils indicate that the evolution of fundamentally limb-like appendages likely occurred in aquatic environments, the functional consequences of using early digited limbs, rather than fins, for terrestrial propulsion have had little empirical investigation. Paleontological and experimental analyses both have led to the proposal of an early origin of "hind limb-driven" locomotion among tetrapods or their ancestors. However, the retention of a pectoral appendage that had already developed terrestrial adaptations has been proposed for some taxa, and few data are available from extant functional models that can provide a foundation for evaluating the relative contributions of pectoral and pelvic appendages to terrestrial support among early stem tetrapods. To examine these aspects of vertebrate locomotor evolution during the invasion of land, we measured three-dimensional ground reaction forces (GRFs) produced by isolated pectoral fins of mudskipper fishes (Periophthalmus barbarus) during terrestrial crutching, and compared these to isolated walking footfalls by the forelimbs and hind limbs of tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), a species with subequally-sized limbs that facilitate comparisons to early tetrapods. Pectoral appendages of salamanders and mudskippers exhibited numerous differences in GRFs. Compared with salamander forelimbs, isolated fins of mudskippers bear lower vertical magnitudes of GRFs (as a proportion of body weight), and had GRFs that were oriented more medially. Comparing the salamanders' forelimbs and hind limbs, although the peak net GRF occurs later in stance for the forelimb, both limbs experience nearly identical mediolateral and vertical components of GRF, suggesting comparable contributions to support. Thus, forelimbs could also have played a significant locomotor role among basal tetrapods that had limbs of sub-equal size. However, the salamander hind limb and mudskipper pectoral fin had a greater acceleratory role than did the salamander forelimb. Together, data from these extant taxa help to clarify how structural change may have influenced locomotor function through the evolutionary invasion of land by vertebrates.									20	0	0	17	0	20			1540-7063			WOS:000322342600010	23667046

Effects of fescue toxicosis on bull growth, semen characteristics, and breeding soundness evaluation								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				91	8			3686	3692		10.2527/jas.2012-6078			AUG 2013	2013	Tall fescue possesses heat, drought, and pest resistance conferred to the plant by its mutualistic relationship with the ergot alkaloid producing fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium coenophialum. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of ergot alkaloid consumption on growth, scrotal circumference (SC), and semen quality. The SC measurement and percentage of motile and normal sperm were used to determine if a bull passed the breeding soundness exam (BSE) requirements. Bulls (n = 14) between 13 and 16 mo of age exhibiting >= 32 cm SC and having passed a BSE were assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments accounting for BCS and BW. Bulls were fed the treatment diet containing toxic tall fescue seed (E+; 0.8 mu g of ergovaline and ergovalanine/g DM) or the control diet containing endophyte-free nontoxic tall fescue seed (E-) for 126 d. Blood samples were collected and BSE and BCS accessed at the start of the test (d 0) and every 21 d to the end of test (d 126). Weights were obtained on d 0 and d 126. Serum prolactin (PRL) concentrations were affected by treatment x day interactions (P = 0.04) verifying the effectiveness of the E+ diet. Bulls consuming the E+ diet exhibited declining PRL concentrations from 250 +/- 52.1 ng/mL on d 0 to 30.6 +/- 46.9 ng/mL by d 126 whereas bulls receiving the E- ration maintained serum PRL concentrations greater than or equal to 226.7 +/- 50.4 ng/mL across the 126-d study. Body condition score (P = 0.4) and BW (P = 0.4) were not different between treatments. No difference due to treatment was observed for the percentage of bulls passing a standard BSE exam (P = 0.6) and no treatment effect was observed for any semen characteristic measured by computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA; P >= 0.2). The SC was negatively affected by treatment x day interaction (P = 0.04) with E- bulls exhibiting a larger SC at d 126 compared with E+ bulls of 36.7 +/- 0.8 versus 34.3 +/- 0.8 cm, respectively. Within treatment, E+ bulls exhibited a decrease in SC (P = 0.0001) with a d 0 SC of 37.3 +/- 0.8 cm and dropping to 34.3 +/- 0.8 by d 126. Theoretically, reduced SC would negatively impact semen quality, but this was not observed. However, CASA and BSE evaluation data are consistent with recent reports indicating that bulls grazing E+ tall fescue exhibited only subtle, if any, differences on semen characteristics.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000322588100020	23739791

Scour monitoring via turbulent open channel flow								MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				24	8					085602	10.1088/0957-0233/24/8/085602			AUG 2013	2013	Scour is the leading cause of bridge failure in the United States. It can result in the loss of lives and costs millions to repair the damage. A novel method is proposed for monitoring scour that exploits the turbulence in natural channels. The method utilizes the dynamic pressure associated with the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the flow to excite a flexible plate. A semi-empirical model is developed to describe the interaction of turbulent open channel flow with the plate. The model describes the variation of turbulent velocity fluctuations across the flow depth in an open channel resulting in a method for determining the average dynamic pressure on the flexible plate. The dynamic response of the plate is then modeled by superimposing the response of multiple modes of the disk to the random, turbulent dynamic pressure spectrum. The model is verified considering the pressure integration across the plate surface to ensure converged solutions. Due to the uncertainties in the material properties of the plate, the experimentally determined natural frequencies and vibration measurements are used to calibrate the model. The calibrated model predictions are then compared against an independent dataset for validation. In addition to describing the physical operation of the device, the semi-empirical model is also employed to optimize the field device. Measurements made using the field device also confirmed the model results, even in a non-design, misaligned flow condition.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-0233	1361-6501		WOS:000321943100032

Despite that travel patterns are a fundamental aspect of the tourism phenomenon, little attention has been given to spatial and temporal tourist behaviors. Furthermore, although tourist typologies have identified some differences in visitor behaviors, little is known of how these typologies are related to actual travel patterns. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine if people with different travel styles differ in their actual movement patterns by combining spatial movement data with non-spatial visitor characteristics. This study used GPS to track tourists' use of an area and surveys to measure different activity styles based on a typology of wanderers' and planners.' The wanderer-planner' typology was validated through confirmatory factor analysis. Factor composite scores were used to separate participants into four groups: Traditional Wanderers, Traditional Planners, Ambivalent Travelers, and Planned Wanderers. GPS data were used to identify spatial and temporal travel patterns and distribution of visitors. Time spent on primary roads, secondary roads, and stopping locations were treated as dependent variables used to identify actual travel pattern differences between wanderers' and planners.' Results showed that there were no significant differences between any of the groups on these three variables. Findings revealed that travel style had no significant effect on actual travel patterns. Practical, theoretical, and methodical implications are discussed.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1461-6688			WOS:000322212000010

Sterol 14 alpha-demethylase inhibitors (DMIs) continue to be important in the management of brown rot of Monilinia spp. worldwide. Tebuconazole and triadimefon are two kinds of DMI fungicides that may be used for brown rot control in China. To establish the baseline sensitivity of M. yunnanensis to these two DMI fungicides, 203 M. yunnanensis single spore isolates were collected. Measurements of sensitivity to the two fungicides were based on inhibition of mycelial growth. For both fungicides, the sensitivity distribution was a unimodal curve, with an EC50 range (the effective concentration to inhibit mycelial growth by 50 %) of 0.0001-0.0644 mu g/ml for tebuconazole and 0.2311-1.7477 mu g/ml for triadimefon. The M. yunnanensis isolates were obtained from orchards where DMI fungicides have not been used for peach brown rot control, thus the fungicide sensitivity distribution established in this study can be considered as the baseline for monitoring the resistance development in M. yunnanensis once the DMI fungicides are used to control peach brown rot.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0929-1873			WOS:000321246300001

Only limited focus has been placed on potential use for qualitative and quantitative reasoning and analysis of the design concept. This potential for early stage analysis has not been fully explored partly because computational reasoning tools have not been developed for this express purpose. This paper presents a set of requirements and their justification to realize this design enabling tool. The requirements include coverage, consistency, validity against physics laws, domain neutrality, physics-based definitions, normative and descriptive modeling, and qualitative and quantitative modeling and reasoning. Each requirement is defined in concrete terms and illustrated with examples and logic. With the requirements for function-based reasoning and representation clearly identified, future research toward formalizing of function-based design will be more focused and objective validation of proposed representations against these requirements would be possible.									4	1	0	0	0	5			0890-0604			WOS:000322175800011

However, there is a dearth of knowledge on how BCMA alters nursing work. This study investigated how BCMA technology affected nursing work, particularly nurses' operational problem-solving behavior. Cognitive systems engineering observations and interviews were conducted after the implementation of BCMA in three nursing units of a freestanding pediatric hospital. Problem-solving behavior, associated problems, and goals were specifically defined and extracted from observed episodes of care. Three broad themes regarding BCMA's impact on problem solving were identified. First, BCMA allowed nurses to invent new problem-solving behavior to deal with pre-existing problems. Second, BCMA made it difficult or impossible to apply some problem-solving behaviors that were commonly used pre-BCMA, often requiring nurses to use potentially risky workarounds to achieve their goals. Third, BCMA created new problems that nurses were either able to solve using familiar or novel problem-solving behaviors, or unable to solve effectively. Results from this study shed light on hidden hazards and suggest three critical design needs: (1) ecologically valid design; (2) anticipatory control; and (3) basic usability. Principled studies of the actual nature of clinicians' work, including problem solving, are necessary to uncover hidden hazards and to inform health information technology design and redesign.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1435-5558			WOS:000322162100004	24443642

Environmentally Regulated Glycosome Protein Composition in the African Trypanosome								EUKARYOTIC CELL				12	8			1072	1079		10.1128/EC.00086-13			AUG 2013	2013	Trypanosomes compartmentalize many metabolic enzymes in glycosomes, peroxisome-related microbodies that are essential to parasite survival. While it is understood that these dynamic organelles undergo profound changes in protein composition throughout life cycle differentiation, the adaptations that occur in response to changes in environmental conditions are less appreciated. We have adopted a fluorescent-organelle reporter system in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei by expressing a fluorescent protein (FP) fused to a glycosomal targeting sequence (peroxisome-targeting sequence 2 [PTS2]). In these cell lines, PTS2-FP is localized within import-competent glycosomes, and organelle composition can be analyzed by microscopy and flow cytometry. Using this reporter system, we have characterized parasite populations that differ in their glycosome composition. In glucose-rich medium, two parasite populations are observed; one population harbors glycosomes bearing the full repertoire of glycosome proteins, while the other parasite population contains glycosomes that lack the usual glycosome-resident proteins but do contain the glycosome membrane protein TbPEX11. Interestingly, these cells lack TbPEX13, a protein essential for the import of proteins into the glycosome. This bimodal distribution is lost in low-glucose medium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that changes in environmental conditions trigger changes in glycosome protein composition. These findings demonstrate a level of procyclic glycosome diversity heretofore unappreciated and offer a system by which glycosome dynamics can be studied in live cells. This work adds to our growing understanding of how the regulation of glycosome composition relates to environmental sensing.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1535-9778			WOS:000322315700003	23709182	
J	Keinath, Anthony P.								Susceptibility of Cucurbit Rootstocks to Didymella bryoniae and Control of Gummy Stem Blight on Grafted Watermelon Seedlings with Fungicides								PLANT DISEASE				97	8			1018	1024					AUG 2013	2013	Seedlings of watermelon are susceptible to Didymella bryoniae, the cucurbit pathogen that causes gummy stem blight, particularly when they are grown in the greenhouse for use as transplants. Seedlings of bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and interspecific hybrid squash (Cucurbita moschata x C. maxima) that are used as rootstocks for grafting watermelon are susceptible to gummy stem blight when wounded. Nonwounded rootstock seedlings of both genera were as susceptible to gummy stem blight as seedless watermelon. Because grafted plants must be misted or held at high relative humidity for 1 week so the graft union will heal, fungicides may be necessary to manage gummy stem blight under these disease-conducive environmental conditions. Nine fungicides were applied as foliar treatments at labeled rates per 467 liters/ha water to nongrafted seedlings of watermelon and five rootstock cultivars. Fluopyram + tebuconazole injured all five bottle gourd and hybrid squash cultivars and stunted watermelon and hybrid squash seedlings. Cyprodinil + difenoconazole injured all five rootstock cultivars and watermelon. Tebuconazole stunted bottle gourd and watermelon seedlings. Four of the five fungicides that were not phytotoxic reduced incidence and severity of gummy stem blight on seedless watermelon grafted onto bottle gourd Emphasis and hybrid squash Strong Tosa. Difenoconazole and cyprodinil were more effective than mancozeb or cyprodinil + fludioxonil, which were more effective than thiophanate-methyl, which was not significantly different from the water control (P = 0.01). Nongrafted watermelon seedlings and watermelon seedlings grafted onto watermelon as the rootstock were as susceptible to gummy stem blight as watermelon seedlings grafted onto cucurbits. Although difenoconazole and cyprodinil are not registered currently on cucurbits, transplant growers can apply mancozeb or cyprodinil + fludioxonil to manage gummy stem blight on watermelon and rootstock seedlings during greenhouse production.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0191-2917			WOS:000321991500002

Preliminary analysis under greenhouse conditions indicated that the currently available commercial watermelon rootstocks were either highly susceptible or somewhat tolerant to one or more viruses. However, in greenhouse screening, several breeding lines of bottle gourd displayed broad-spectrum resistance to four viruses tested, including Zucchini yellow mosaic virus, Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV), Papaya ringspot virus watermelon strain (PRSV-W), and Squash vein yellowing virus. Resistance to PRSV-W and WMV was confirmed through field trials in two consecutive years at two different locations in South Carolina. Two breeding lines (USVL#1-8 and USVL#5-5) with broad-spectrum virus resistance could be useful materials for watermelon rootstock development.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0191-2917			WOS:000321991500007		
J	Chen, F.; Liu, X.; Schnabel, G.								Field Strains of Monilinia fructicola Resistant to Both MBC and DMI Fungicides Isolated from Stone Fruit Orchards in the Eastern United States								PLANT DISEASE				97	8			1063	1068		10.1094/PDIS-12-12-1177-RE			AUG 2013	2013	In 2012, significant brown rot disease was observed on stone fruit in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and South Carolina despite preharvest application of methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC) and demethylase inhibitor (DMI) fungicides. In total, 140 Mondinia fructicola isolates were collected from diseased orchards and examined for fungicide sensitivity. In addition to isolates resistant to either the DMI propiconazole or the MBC thiophanate-methyl, 22 isolates were discovered that were resistant to both fungicides, including 4 isolates from peach in South Carolina, 12 isolates from peach and sweet cherry in Maryland, and 6 isolates from sweet cherry in Pennsylvania. Analysis of MBC resistance revealed that dual-resistant isolates from South Carolina carried the beta-tubulin E198A mutation, whereas isolates from Maryland and Pennsylvania carried E198 mutations not previously described in the Monilinia genus, E198Q or F200Y. The genetic element Mona, associated with DMI fungicide resistance in M. fructicola, was detected in the dual-resistant isolates from South Carolina but not in the isolates from the two more northern states. An investigation into the molecular mechanism of DMI resistance in the latter isolates revealed that resistance was not based on increased expression or mutation of MfCYP51, which encodes the target of DMI fungicides. Label rates of formulated propiconazole or thiophanate-methyl were unable to control dual-resistant isolates on detached peach fruit, confirming field relevance of dual resistance. The same isolates were not affected by fitness penalties based on mycelial growth rate, ability to sporulate, and virulence on detached peach fruit. The emergence of M. fructicola strains resistant to both DMI and MBC fungicides in multiple states and multiple stone fruit crops is a significant development and needs to be considered when designing resistance management strategies in stone fruit orchards.									15	1	0	12	0	16			0191-2917			WOS:000321991500008		
J	Monaenkova, Daria; Andrukh, Taras; Kornev, Konstantin G.								Bernoulli catenary and elasto-capillary effect in partially wet fibrous materials								TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL				83	13			1386	1397		10.1177/0040517512464294			AUG 2013	2013	When a wetting liquid wicks into a fibrous material, it causes the material to deform. In this paper we discuss the elasto-capillary effect that leads to spontaneous internal stresses in the materials. The elasto-capillary effect produced by menisci in pores can be identified through a specific stress distribution in the fibrous matrix. We show that the classical Bernoulli problem of a freely hanging fabric can be used for the analysis of gravity-induced stresses in textile materials. These stresses change due to elasto-capillary effect. Wicking of a wetting liquid into a freely suspended fibrous material is shown to be an instructive nontrivial experiment illustrating interesting distinguishable stress distributions in the fibrous matrix.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0040-5175			WOS:000322156000006

P. falciparum, one of the deadliest species of the parasite, relies on glycolysis for the generation of ATP while it inhabits the mammalian red blood cell. The first step in glycolysis is catalyzed by hexokinase (HK). While the 55.3-kDa P. falciparum HK (PfHK) shares several biochemical characteristics with mammalian HKs, including being inhibited by its products, it has limited amino acid identity (similar to 26%) to the human HKs, suggesting that enzyme-specific therapeutics could be generated. To that end, interrogation of a selected small-molecule library of HK inhibitors has identified a class of PfHK inhibitors, isobenzothiazolinones, some of which have 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of <1 mu M. Inhibition was reversible by dilution but not by treatment with a reducing agent, suggesting that the basis for enzyme inactivation was not covalent association with the inhibitor. Lastly, six of these compounds and the related molecule ebselen inhibited P. falciparum growth in vitro (50% effective concentration [EC50] of >= 0.6 and <6.8 mu M). These findings suggest that the chemotypes identified here could represent leads for future development of therapeutics against P. falciparum.									13	0	0	13	0	13			0066-4804			WOS:000321761800034	23716053

Degradation of materials								JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY				113	2			507	510		10.1007/s10973-013-3195-z			AUG 2013	2013	In part A, thermal analysis techniques were discussed to characterize masonry building materials from significant historic properties in the Charleston, South Carolina, area. In part B, thermal analysis confirms various modes of long-term degradation of the materials through environmental exposure. This research provides evidence of diagenesis within materials usually considered as chemically inert. Masonry mortars used in the nineteenth century include those composed of lime and sand in the early part of the period, with the use of natural (manufactured) cement in conjunction with the mid-century fortification of the harbor. Mortars with both types of binders have been found subject to chemical alteration by long-term reactions with intruding soluble salts to form phases rich in sulfur (primarily from ground salt intrusion) or rich in chloride (primarily from sea water intrusion). The general direction of reactions may be toward formation of smectite minerals found in salt water estuaries. Further, evidence of alkali-silica reaction was found in a mortar exposed to sea water. Differences were found in reactions between lime mortars and those containing natural cements in regard to reaction phenomena. Mineral phases as a result of chemical alteration were also found in "underfired" clay bricks. Thermal analysis techniques confirm the identities of new phases within the historic masonry materials. The results suggest new phases formed within the masonry elements have the potential to cause deterioration through salt crystallization phenomena.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-6150			WOS:000321784900012

The eingenmode frequencies of In and Yb were obtained from low-temperature specific heat capacity analysis. It is found that filling these two types of guest atoms with different eingenmode frequencies into the voids in skutterudites could introduce strong point defect and resonant scattering to lattice phonons, thus lead to significant decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1000-2413	1993-0437		WOS:000321869900009

Medline, Web of Science and PubMed were searched to identify prospective cohort studies that evaluated the association between several variables (e.g. physical activity, sedentary behaviour, dietary intake and genetic, physiological, social cognitive, family and peer, school and community factors) and the development of excessive fatness in children and adolescents (5-18 years). Sixty-one studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. There is evidence to support the association between genetic factors and low physical activity with excessive fatness in children and adolescents. Current studies yielded mixed evidence for the contribution of sedentary behaviour, dietary intake, physiological biomarkers, family factors and the community physical activity environment. No conclusions could be drawn about social cognitive factors, peer factors, school nutrition and physical activity environments, and the community nutrition environment. There is a dearth of longitudinal evidence that examines specific factors contributing to the development of excessive fatness in childhood and adolescence. Given that childhood obesity is a worldwide public health concern, the field can benefit from large-scale, long-term prospective studies that use state-of-the-art measures in a diverse sample of children and adolescents.									37	0	0	14	2	38			1467-7881			WOS:000321982800005	23601571

Suitability of California bay laurel and other species as hosts for the non-native redbay ambrosia beetle and granulate ambrosia beetle								AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY				15	3			227	235		10.1111/afe.12009			AUG 2013	2013	1 The redbay ambrosia beetle Xyleborus glabratus Eichhoff is a non-native vector of the pathogen that causes laurel wilt, a deadly disease of trees in the family Lauraceae in the southeastern U.S.A.2 Concern exists that X. glabratus and its fungal symbiont could be transported to the western U.S.A. and cause damage to California bay laurel Umbellularia californica (Hook. & Arn.) Nutt. in California and Washington.3 The present study evaluated in-flight attraction, attack density and emergence of X. glabratus and another invasive ambrosia beetle Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky) on cut bolts of California bay laurel and eight related tree species in an infested forest in South Carolina. Xylosandrus crassiusculus is not a vector of the laurel wilt pathogen but is a pest of nursery and ornamental trees.4 Mean catch of X. glabratus on California bay laurel bolts was not significantly different from catches on bolts of known X. glabratus hosts sassafras Sassafras albidum (Nutt.) Nees and swampbay Persea palustris (Raf.) Sarg. Mean attack density and adult emergence of both beetle species from California bay laurel was equal to or greater than all other tree species tested. Both beetle species readily produced brood in California bay laurel bolts.5 The results obtained in the present study suggest that California bay laurel may be negatively impacted by both of these invasive ambrosia beetles if they become established in the tree's native range.									14	0	0	13	0	14			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000321578700001

The cytotoxicity of PVP coated-AgNPs to pollen, the aploid male gametophyte of higher plants, has been assessed here for the first time. The negative effects of AgNPs include substantial decreases in pollen viability and performance, specific ultrastructural alterations, early changes in calcium content, and unbalance of redox status. Ag+ released from AgNPs damaged pollen membranes and inhibited germination to a greater extent than the AgNPs themselves. By contrast, the AgNPs were more potent at disrupting the tube elongation process. ROS deficiency and overproduction were registered in the Ag+- and AgNP-treatment, respectively. The peculiar features of AgNP toxicity reflected their specific modes of interaction with pollen surface and membranes, and the dynamic exchange between coating (PVP) and culture medium. In contrast, the effects of Ag+ were most likely induced through chemical/physicochemical interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of reaction temperature, pH value and ratio of enzyme/soybean protein powder ([E/S]) on the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) of the peptides was well fitted to a quadric equation with high determination coefficients. The hydrolysate with optimal DPPH was predicted to be obtained at: temperature of 50 degrees C, pH value of 10.32, and [EIS] ratio of 12%. The hydrolysates were separated by the ultrafiltration membranes in the cut-off MW at 1 kDa, 3 kDa, 10 kDa and 30 kDa and molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO) I-V were determined antioxidant activity.

J	Fleck, Robert K.; Hanssen, F. Andrew								When voice fails: Potential exit as a constraint on government quality								INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS				35				26	41		10.1016/j.irle.2012.11.003			AUG 2013	2013	Poorly governed (e.g., repressive) countries tend to be located near other poorly governed countries, and well governed countries near other well governed countries. Researchers, by identifying country characteristics (e.g., ethnic fractionalization) that may influence government quality, have provided one potential explanation: Neighboring countries tend to be similar with respect to those characteristics. In this paper, we draw on Hirschman's notion of "exit" as a disciplining device in order to provide a different, though complementary, explanation: The ability of a ruler to implement policy that displeases the country's populace is constrained by opportunities for residents to relocate to other countries nearby. To generate testable predictions about the effects of potential exit on government quality, we develop a simple theoretical model. We test the model's predictions using cross-sectional and panel data, controlling for other determinants of government quality. The evidence we present - which includes discussion of historical examples such as ancient Greece and the Soviet Bloc - supports the model's predictions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, tax management strategies employed by these politically active firms were valued by shareholders. Firms lobbying on tax issues have lower book effective taxes and greater discretionary permanent differences in GAAP and IRS taxable income. Investors place a premium on lobbying activities for tax purposes unless the firm already has a low effective tax rate or very high book-tax differences. We conclude that lobbying political officials is one method by which firms manage risks attendant an aggressive tax strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Although the functional implications of certain aspects of shape have been widely examined, the functional implications of a related parameter, symmetry, remain mostly unknown. We used finite-element models to examine the effects of turtle shell asymmetry on shell strength across three morphologically distinct emydid species. The goals of this study were to: 1) test the hypothesis that increased asymmetry (independent of differences in shape) is associated with increased stress levels for a given load, and thus with weaker shells, 2) ascertain how asymmetry and the position of load application interact to influence shell strength, and 3) determine how interspecific differences in shape influence the effect of asymmetry. We found that increased asymmetry does produce higher stresses for both midline and non-midline loads. Non-midline loads produce slightly larger and more variable stresses. Species-specific shell shape can mitigate the effects of asymmetry; stronger shapes are potentially more resistant to the negative effects of asymmetry. Our findings indicate that changes in asymmetry associated with relatively small changes in shape can have as much of an effect on stress incurred by the shell as the changes in shape themselves. J.

Two notable projects occurred in succession, the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE) and California Institute of Technology (Caltech) CUREE-Caltech Woodframe Project, and the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) NEESWood Project, which provided greater understanding, improved analytical modeling, and advances in force- and performance-based seismic design (PBSD) of woodframe buildings, respectively. The NEESWood project focused on the development of a PBSD philosophy (and procedures) for midrise woodframe buildings and included full-scale system-level validation. To date, the complete design procedure has not been systematically explained, which serves as the impetus for this paper. While the method was shown to be quite viable, some challenges remain, including identifying a format that would facilitate widespread adoption and use by engineers. Thus, this paper examines the progress, current state, and challenges for PBSD of midrise woodframe buildings.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0733-9445			WOS:000321550800004

A large portion of the older multistory buildings in the California region were constructed with a deficiency that makes them vulnerable to collapse in the first story during earthquakes. This deficiency is referred to as soft-story. The new model presented in this paper was developed using a corotational formulation, which makes it suitable for modeling the side-sway collapse of wood shear walls under large displacement as well as estimating the in-plane stiffness of floor diaphragms. To achieve high computational efficiency, a nodal condensation technique is used to eliminate the degrees of freedom (DOFs) associated with the nail connections from the global DOFs of the model. To verify the validity of the new model, the model was coded into a computer program and was used to analyze selected shear walls and diaphragms tested by various institutions and research programs. Good agreement was observed between the test and model-predicted backbone and cyclic curves for shear walls with various gravity loads and different anchorage conditions. The model is highly flexible and has been shown to be able to model older shear wall construction with horizontal sheathing boards and diagonal bracings.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0733-9445			WOS:000321550800005

To develop robust evacuation policies, it is important to understand how people respond to evacuation alerts, including choices of time to leave and routes to take. The purpose of this study was to investigate the preferred communication sources and modalities for evacuees to use and learn about changes in hurricane scenarios. A hurricane evacuation behavior survey was administrated to residents in the greater Charleston, South Carolina, area. In this study, two hurricane scenarios are examined to understand prehurricane evacuation decisions and communication preferences of residents. Results from the survey indicate that while driving, respondents prefer using radios to gather traffic and weather information. When at home, television is the most preferred modality among respondents to determine weather status and to find out about hurricane evacuation notices. Concerning evacuation behavior, respondents prefer leaving in the daytime rather than at night. To account for this preference, evacuation announcements and notifications should be broadcast early enough to allow for more daytime evacuations. This may result in a longer lead time if the announcement would have otherwise occurred at night. The evacuation timing decisions from the survey are then compared with historical behavior data from a retrospective Hurricane Hugo survey. The respondents indicate a tendency to evacuate earlier than what was shown in the Hurricane Hugo survey. This may imply that it takes longer to actually prepare to leave than respondents to the current survey realize. Alternatively, respondents to the Hurricane Hugo survey may pay more attention to weather patterns as well as wait for orders to be provided by the state rather than make a proactive decision to leave.

A spacer layer is used to modify effective index of the structure, enabling a waveguide-detector mode to propagate in the chalcogenide waveguide and be absorbed in the PbTe detector. The relation between quantum efficiency and detector dimensions is analyzed showing that the design geometry can be optimized to maximize signal to noise ratio. In addition, the location of metal contacts is optimized to minimize loss while maintaining good device performance. The design is compatible with standard planar lithographic processing and its flexibility suggests multiple applications in the fields of biological and chemical sensing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Supplements provide enhanced nutritional levels for daily competitive performance. However, there is a need to explore the quality of dietary supplements as there are few studies related to this area. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the microbiological quality of dietary supplements in the local markets of Saudi Arabia. The total bacterial count, coliform, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus were included in this analysis. The 80 most popular supplements were tested in this study. Our results showed that microbial contamination was present in only nine products. The microbial level ranged from 1.69-8.43 Log CFU/mL. The higher level of total count (8.43 Log CFU/mL) and S. aureus (8.39 Log CFU/mL) were found in supplement glutamine. Amino acids, dynamisan, glucosamine sulfate, glucosaiene, creatine monohydrate, whey protein, and folate acid also showed the presence of bacterial contamination. Our fmdings suggested that improvements are needed in these supplements which were tested for microbiological contamination. These findings highlight the fact that a review of product safety and quality is becoming increasingly important for consumer health. This will help to ensure safe products available for today's savvy, health-conscious consumer.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2079-052X	2079-0538		WOS:000344447500004

A detailed methodology is described to obtain a consistent model of severe SCI. Use of a stereotactic frame and computer controlled impactor allows for creation of reproducible injury. Hypothermia and urinary tract infection pose significant challenges in the post-operative period. Careful monitoring of animals with daily weight recording and bladder expression allows for early detection of post-operative complications. The functional results of this contusion model are equivalent to transection models. The contusion model can be utilized to evaluate the efficacy of both neuroprotective and neuroregenerative approaches.									3	1	0	2	0	3			1940-087X			WOS:000209228000006

The thermal conductivity of rock is greater than that of water, so heat is conducted from a partially-submerged rock faster than from water. Consequently, a collar of thicker ice forms at the water surface, a layer of ice forms on more deeply-submerged parts of the rock, and playa sediment beneath the rock may even become frozen to it. While this occurs, only a surface layer of ice forms on water away from the rock. Once the ice becomes thick enough, perhaps only 5-10 mm, either the buoyancy of the ice or additions of water to the playa by rain, snow-melt, or groundwater seepage then reduce the normal force between the rock and the playa to the point where wind shear can move the ice sheet with its entrained rocks, making trails (Stanley, 1955; Reid et al., 1995). After the ice melts, rocks are left at the ends of the trails, sometimes atop a pedestal of silt. A renewed increase in water level on the playa before the ice melts may lift a rock completely free of the playa surface and whisk it away, leaving a rockless trail. During a movement event, changes in rock orientation or water depth may result in changes in width along the track. Rock speeds are likely tens to hundreds of millimeters per second.

The molecular structures comprising catalytically polymerized pyrene pitch								CARBON				59				33	39		10.1016/j.carbon.2013.02.021			AUG 2013	2013	Key molecular species present in a model pyrene pitch catalytically polymerized (using AlCl3) from pure pyrene have been unambiguously identified. Packed-column, dense-gas extraction, using supercritical toluene as the solvent, was used to fractionate the pitch into monomer- and dimer-rich cuts. The resultant fractions were then analyzed for molecular-structure information via matrix-assisted, laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-vis detection. Results indicate that only one of the possible isomers of pyrene dimer, that is, 1.14,7.8-dibenzoperopyrene, is present. In addition, mono-, di-, and tri-methylated pyrenes, which are completely absent in the starting pyrene, are present in the pyrene pitch in small but nontrivial (i.e., several per cent) quantities. Furthermore, the purity of the starting pyrene has no discernable impact on the relative amounts of alkylated pyrene species that are produced. A portion of the pyrene dimers, trimers, and tetramers are similarly alkylated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0008-6223			WOS:000320489300003

Carbon black modification of mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers								CARBON				59				40	48		10.1016/j.carbon.2013.02.048			AUG 2013	2013	The effects of carbon black (CB) on the microstructural development within mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers are reported. Unlike carbon nanotubes, which were previously studied for modifying fiber microstructure, CB represents a significantly lower cost alternative making it more favorable for industrial application. Additionally, the aspect ratio of CB is much closer to unity than carbon nanotubes, which have an aspect ratio similar to 100 to 1000. Fibers were produced by first dispersing CB into a synthetic mesophase pitch at a dilute concentration of 0.3 wt%. These precursor materials were spun and then processed into carbon fibers. Unmodified (0 wt%) carbon fibers exhibited a severe radial texture with increasing orientation of graphitic pleats away from the fiber core. Carbon fibers modified with CB showed a strong flat layer structure, with only a slight increase in pleat folding away from the core. This difference in structure was also accompanied by a decrease in the number of fibers that exhibited "pac-man" splitting. No discernable reduction was observed in the graphitic crystallinity (interplanar spacing and crystallite size) or axial orientation of crystallites within the fiber, as a result of nanomodification.

LOSS of Mrp1 alters detoxification enzyme expression in a tissue- and hormonal-status-specific manner								JOURNAL OF APPLIED TOXICOLOGY				33	8			766	773		10.1002/jat.2727			AUG 2013	2013	The multidrug resistance-associated protein1 (MRP1/ABCC1) is a member of the ABCC transporter subfamily that mediates the efflux of pharmaceuticals, xenobiotics and steroid hormones, typically as glutathione, glucuronide or sulfate conjugates. Since loss of one transporter can be compensated by increasing the expression of other transporters and conjugation enzymes, we sought to examine compensatory changes in phase I, II and III enzyme expression in extrahepatic tissues, including the kidney, lungs and small intestine of intact or castrated Mrp1-/- male mice. In the kidney, the expression of several P450s, sulfotransferase 1a1 (Sult), glucuronosyltransferases (Ugt) and Mrps2-4, were significantly changed owing to castration alone. The only time genotype mattered was between the castrated FVB and Mrp1 knockout mice. In contrast, expression of the Ugts, Sult 1a1 and Mrp3 in the lungs was significantly downregulated in the Mrp1 knockout mice, so based exclusively on genotype. In the small intestine, there were interactions between steroid hormone levels and genotype, as the expression differences were only found in mice lacking Mrp1, and were changed between intact and castrated animals. The mechanism behind this pattern of expression may be to due to Nrf2 regulation, as its expression mirrors that of the phase II and phase III enzymes. These results indicate that compensatory responses owing to the loss of Mrp1 vary dramatically, depending on the particular tissue. This information will aid in the understanding of how drug uptake, disposition and elimination can be influenced by both hormone status and the presence and magnitude of transporter expression.

Batch sorption experiments were used to monitor the amount of plutonium sorbed to high-purity quartz as a function of time, pH, and total alpha radioactivity. Three systems were prepared using both Pu-238 and Pu-242 in order to increase the total alpha radioactivity of the mineral suspensions while maintaining a constant plutonium concentration. The fraction of sorbed plutonium increased with increasing time and pH regardless of the total alpha radioactivity of the system. Increasing the total alpha radioactivity of the solution had a negligible effect on the sorption rate. This indicated that surface-mediated reduction of Pu(V) in these systems was not due to radiolysis. Additionally, literature values for the Pu(V) disproportionation rate constant did not describe the experimental results. Therefore, Pu(V) disproportionation was also not a main driver for surface-mediated reduction of plutonium. Batch desorption experiments and X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy were used to show that Pu(IV) was the dominant oxidation state of sorbed plutonium. Thus, it appears that the observed surface-mediated reduction of Pu(V) in the presence of high-purity quartz was based on the thermodynamic favorability of a Pu(IV) surface complex.

The effects of these differences on their microbial communities are not clear. Here, we investigated both alpha and beta diversity of diffuse flow-associated microbial communities emanating from vents at a basalt-based hydrothermal system along the East Pacific Rise (EPR) and a sediment-based hydrothermal system, Guaymas Basin. Both Bacteria and Archaea were targeted using high throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analyses. A unique aspect of this study was the use of a universal set of 16S rRNA gene primers to characterize total and diffuse flow-specific microbial communities from varied deep-sea hydrothermal environments. Both surrounding seawater and diffuse flow water samples contained large numbers of Marine Group I (MGI) Thaumarchaea and Gammaproteobacteria taxa previously observed in deep-sea systems. However, these taxa were geographically distinct and segregated according to type of spreading center. Diffuse flow microbial community profiles were highly differentiated. In particular, EPR dominant diffuse flow taxa were most closely associated with chemolithoautotrophs, and off axis water was dominated by heterotrophic-related taxa, whereas the opposite was true for Guaymas Basin. The diversity and richness of diffuse flow-specific microbial communities were strongly correlated to the relative abundance of Epsilonproteobacteria, proximity to macrofauna, and hydrothermal system type. Archaeal diversity was higher than or equivalent to bacterial diversity in about one third of the samples. Most diffuse flow-specific communities were dominated by OTUs associated with Epsilonproteobacteria, but many of the Guaymas Basin diffuse flow samples were dominated by either OTUs within the Planctomycetes or hyperthermophilic Archaea. This study emphasizes the unique microbial communities associated with geochemically and geographically distinct hydrothermal diffuse flow environments.									10	1	0	11	0	11			1664-302X			WOS:000331366100001	23898323

The size and shape of the NPs can be controlled by adjusting the temperature, reaction time, and nature of the surfactants and solvents. Aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene, xylenes) and ethers (phenyl- and benzyl-ether) favor the formation of stoichiometric Bi2Te3 NPs of platelike morphology, whereas the presence of oleylamine and 1-dodecanethiol yields Bi-rich Bi2Te3 spherical NPs. XRD, IR, SEM, TEM, and SAED techniques have been used to characterize the obtained products. We show that the surfactants can be efficiently removed from the surface of the NPs using a two-step process employing nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate and hydrazine hydrate. The surfactant-free NPs were further consolidated into high density pellets using cold-pressing and field-assisted sintering techniques. The sintered surfactant-free Bi2Te3 showed electrical and thermal properties comparable to Bi2Te3 materials processed through conventional solid state techniques, and greatly improved over other nanostructured Bi2Te3 materials synthesized by wet-chemical approaches.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1944-8244			WOS:000322432500035	23806251

The results are in good agreement with previous work, extending the measurements to both lower and higher energies. The measurements are compared to theoretical predictions using the NON-SMOKER and TALYS nuclear reaction codes.

Using rapid discrete-molecular-dynamics simulations, we examined the binding of graphene and graphene oxide with peptides, fatty acids, and cellulose, and complemented our simulations by experimental studies of Raman spectroscopy, FTIR, and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Specifically, we established a connection between the differential binding and the conformational flexibility, molecular geometry, and hydrocarbon content of the amphiphiles. Importantly, our dynamics simulations revealed a Vroman-like competitive binding of the amphiphiles for the graphene oxide substrate. This study provides a mechanistic basis for addressing the transformation, evolution, transport, biocompatibility, and toxicity of graphene derivatives in living systems and the natural environment.									21	1	0	4	0	22			2045-2322			WOS:000322153800001	23881402

In Oryza sativa (rice), thousands of quantitative genetic signals have been mapped to the rice genome. In parallel, thousands of gene expression profiles have been generated across many experimental conditions. Through the discovery of networks with real gene co-expression relationships, it is possible to identify co-localized genetic and gene expression signals that implicate complex genotype-phenotype relationships. In this work, we used a knowledge-independent, systems genetics approach, to discover a high-quality set of co-expression networks, termed Gene Interaction Layers (GILs). Twenty-two GILs were constructed from 1,306 Affymetrix microarray rice expression profiles that were pre-clustered to allow for improved capture of gene co-expression relationships. Functional genomic and genetic data, including over 8,000 QTLs and 766 phenotype-tagged SNPs (p-value < = 0.001) from genome-wide association studies, both covering over 230 different rice traits were integrated with the GILs. An online systems genetics data-mining resource, the GeneNet Engine, was constructed to enable dynamic discovery of gene sets (i.e. network modules) that overlap with genetic traits. GeneNet Engine does not provide the exact set of genes underlying a given complex trait, but through the evidence of gene-marker correspondence, co-expression, and functional enrichment, site visitors can identify genes with potential shared causality for a trait which could then be used for experimental validation. A set of 2 million SNPs was incorporated into the database and serve as a potential set of testable biomarkers for genes in modules that overlap with genetic traits. Herein, we describe two modules found using GeneNet Engine, one with significant overlap with the trait amylose content and another with significant overlap with blast disease resistance.									4	0	0	4	0	4			1932-6203			WOS:000322064300047	23874666

On a reduced sparsity stabilization of grad-div type for incompressible flow problems								COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING				261				142	153		10.1016/j.cma.2013.04.005			JUL 15 2013	2013	We introduce a new operator for stabilizing error that arises from the weak enforcement of mass conservation in finite element simulations of incompressible flow problems. We show this new operator has a similar positive effect on velocity error as the well-known and very successful grad-div stabilization operator, but the new operator is more attractive from an implementation standpoint because it yields a sparser block structure matrix. That is, while grad-div produces fully coupled block matrices (i.e. block-full), the matrices arising from the new operator are block-upper triangular in two dimensions, and in three dimensions the 2,1 and 3,1 blocks are empty. Moreover, the diagonal blocks of the new operator's matrices are identical to those of grad-div. We provide error estimates and numerical examples for finite element simulations with the new operator, which reveals the significant improvement in accuracy it can provide. Solutions found using the new operator are also compared to those using usual grad-div stabilization, and in all cases, solutions are found to be very similar. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Substitutions of Pr at the Sr site and Nb at the Ti site generate n-type doping and thus improve the thermoelectric performance as compared to pristine SrTiO3.

Thus, the X-ray crystallographic study allows detailed examination of its structural properties. The planar Sc3N group lies perpendicular to the threefold axis of the fullerene cage with the scandium ions bound to the three 6:6 ring junctions that lie in the horizontal mirror plane of the molecule. The Sc-N distances are 2.0111(10), 2.0106(10), and 1.9998(10) angstrom and the shortest Sc-C distances fall in the range 2.2371(13)-2.2591(13) angstrom. Those six carbon atoms nearest the scandium ions are the most pyramidalized carbon atoms in the molecule with an average theta(p),= 13.9 degrees compared to theta(p) = 11.6 degrees for C-60 and to average theta(p) = 11.3 degrees for the 12 carbon atoms along the C-3 axis at the poles of the molecule. The C C bond distances at the 6:6 and 5:6 ring junctions do not show the distinct variations that are found in C50. The shortest average C-C bond length, 1.391(2) angstrom, and the longest average bond length, 1.466(1) A, occur at 6:6 ring junctions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The zero-bias peak (ZBP) (a) appears above a threshold parallel bulk Zeeman field, (b) is stable for a range of bulk field before splitting, (c) disappears with rotation of the bulk Zeeman field, and (d) is robust to weak disorder fluctuations. The topologically trivial ZBPs are also expected to produce splitting oscillations with the applied field similar to those from Majorana fermions. Because of such strong similarity with the phenomenology expected from Majorana fermions, we find that the only unambiguous way to distinguish these trivial ZBPs (of height 4e(2)/h) from those arising from Majorana fermions (of height 2e(2)/h) is by comparing the (zero-temperature) peak height and/or through an interference experiment.									19	0	0	0	0	19			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000321669300002
